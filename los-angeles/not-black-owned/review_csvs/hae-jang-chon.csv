5/14/2022,5 star rating,A full experience that makes me want to come back again! Amazing hosts. Very welcoming and friendly. Recommending to everyone.
6/8/2022,5 star rating,"I would consider myself a KBBQ connoisseur and I have to say this is the best Korean BBQ I have ever had. The meat is the absolute best quality (personal recommendation is the Prime Steak) the sides are delicious and the service is quick and friendly. It's pretty rare to find a restaurant that checks all the boxes but this place really does. 10/10 would recommend you to try it. $40 a person and worth every penny! My new favorite spot! PS: The cheese corn is epic, think elote X cream corn!"
5/31/2022,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is hands down my favorite AYCE KBBQ in LA. I have yet to find a place that matches the quality of food and service for an AYCE place. The price is definitely higher compared to other ayce kbbq places (around $40 per person), and the lines here can get incredibly long since I feel the place has gotten crazy hyped in the last 4-5 years. Still, I absolutely love this place and whenever I have time to come down to ktown, this is my first choice. I like to call ahead to ask what the wait times are because you definitely don't want to make the drive down there and find out the wait times are 2-3 hours. On top of that, plan ahead for parking. They do have a little lot they share with various other restaurants that does valet parking for ~ $3 (cash) but if that's full, you'll have to brave it out and find street parking (which can be infuriatingly impossible in ktown). Now, there is a reason this place has become so popular. The meats here are the highest quality ayce place, anywhere from beef brisket, beef belly, pork belly, short rib, bulgogi- I can assure you everything here is delicious. The meat is so delicious that you don't need to dunk it into their brisket sauce like other cheap kbbq places. A little bit of salt and sesame oil elevates the flavor enough, since the meat is just that good!!! Even their banchan is my favorite among all the AYCE KBBQs I've ever had. I always order salad and steamed egg, both I feel are essential when you're downing so much oily meat. When you're almost full on meat, I definitely recommend getting the kimchi fried rice. Another tier of excellent service is the servers who often will cook for you. You have tongs so you can cook if you wanted the full kbbq experience, but if you just wanted to relax and eat some good food, you can just have the server cook for you (which is what I do- just watch and eat haha). Coming down here is definitely a commitment, so be prepared! I absolutely love this place and recommend it to anyone coming to LA :)"
5/21/2022,5 star rating,My favorite ayce Korean bbq in la! I've been coming here for many years and it never disappoints. I once again came for a work event last night and had a blast. The waitresses were even nice enough to hell cook and then were extremely attentive to our large party. I called a week in advance and was able to reserve an area for a large party of 14. My favorite meat will always be the beef tongue. And the Bachan here is fresh and delicious. I do wish they had more soju options. They only had three last night but it wasn't too bad! Be sure to order the kimchi fried rice at the end to end the delicious meal!
6/12/2022,5 star rating,"One of the best KBBQ spots in LA. Depending what time you go it's jammed packed but if your willing to wait it's for sure worth it. Top choices of meat and always good service. Ive been coming here for what's and they are always consistent. From the meant selections to the side dishes, always a great place to eat. They are kid friendly and great for big groups and have adding things to the menu like marinated chicken and beef hotdogs incase you have folks in your party that won't eat some of the other dishes. Recommend for sure for a great KBBQ experience."
5/24/2022,5 star rating,My favorite Korean BBQ place. The line is always long but worth it. Service is always great and the meat quality A+. The only thing I wouldn't order again would be the cheese corn cause there was a weird sour taste.
5/5/2022,3 star rating,"I came to Hae Jang Chon once before this time, maybe like 8-10 years ago and remember liking it a lot. That's not to say I had a bad experience this time around, but at $40 AYCE I think it'd be hard to get 4 stars. I would say I actually want to give 3.5 stars and leaned towards the 3 instead of 4 for a few reasons:1. Out of the beef brisket, pork belly, beef tongue, beef steak and beef short rib that we tried, I only really liked the beef short rib. Brisket is normally a fav but this one was a little too oily. The beef tongue and steak were a little tough. 2. I also felt a little rushed because they kindly cooked for us (very nice and attentive), but literally piled the meats on the grill one right after another. We were stuffing ourselves real fast. 3. Our server misheard me and thought I wanted a kimchi pancake when we didn't and looked annoyed when we said we hadn't asked for it. She also kept asking us if we were done lol. I know they have to get people in and out of there, but cooking the meat more slowly would be a better strategy haha Parking: $4 valet was great since street parking is awful in KtownCleanliness: 4/5 the bathroom, floors were fine and they also had lots of windows open which is great Sides: corn and cheese was not good, very liquidy, steamed egg was okay, kimchi fried rice was not bad and it was fun that they browned the cheese on top Drinks: rice wine wasn't good and cost $12. Probably it's just the type of rice wine but if you're expecting sweet and fruity, don't get it. It was still a fine experience but would recommend some improvements!"
4/28/2022,5 star rating,"My favorite Korean BBQ restaurant period! Every time I go to Los Angeles, I have to stop by Hae Jang Chon. This is a all you can eat establishment, but the meat is amazing. Makes me wonder how it is even possible. The wait times have been different, but during my latest visit, we had to wait for an hour and thirty minutes. I was actually telling people that it may be part of the experience, you get extra hungry and keep getting a whiff of that meat being grilled, makes you ready to eat! The menu is pretty straight forward, you choose three types of meat at a time and they bring generous portions. I do not know if I am going to ever try a different Korean bbq place again since my other experiences have not been as great as this place. Definitely try the kimchi fried rice!"
4/29/2022,4 star rating,"Was looking for AYCE kbbq in Ktown and this place was #1, after seeing the amount of positive reviews, I knew I def had to try it. Def be prepared for a long wait (even on a Tuesday night at 8PM it was still about 1 hr)I'd say it's definitely the highest quality AYCE kbbq I've ever had. 40$/person for dinner. Menu was simple and straightforward and the meats were sooo good, you could definitely taste the higher quality. My faves were beef tongue, brisket, and pork belly. Banchan was on point, heaping portions and so delicious.At the end of the meal you can order cheesy kimchi fried rice that they cook in front of you. Was too full this time but def trying next time! My only con is that the servers are a little too attentive. They are always coming by to get your meat cooked, if the meats are done they will literally come and remove it off the grill and place on a plate so they can cook your next meat. I get this place is busy and they probably want to turn over tables, but we felt a little bit rushed and it took away from the eating experience. Nonetheless I'd definitely still come back!"
12/4/2021,2 star rating,"Not worth the hype. Waited 1.5 hours and the food was just mediocre. Disappointed in the service and food. Selection was tiny compared to other places I've been to. Also WHY do they charge you for lettuce of allllll things like WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!! And why the heck do they make you wait until you're done with all your meat to eat kim chi fried rice! That's insane and honestly was terrible. Also why are there apples in the potato salad :( I will say our server was veryyyy nice! Nothing personal on him. Couldn't believe it. Not sure how this place has high stars. Save your time, money, and appetite and go someplace else."
6/13/2022,5 star rating,"Bessssst all you can eat Korean bbq EVER! My boyfriend & I love this place, it's our go to spot & the only one we go to! It is a little pricey, but it's worth the hype I promise. It is always a long wait after 5pm Â & on weekends. The longest we've ever waited was 2 hours, rookie mistake. We now know what times to go! The waiters are quick & very attentive. love it here!"
3/2/2022,5 star rating,"Went here with my cousin and his girlfriend. I've been at this place before (before 2020) and it's pretty good every time. The menu is pretty extensive and it also had some delicious sides like: steamed eggs, kimchi pancakes, and corn cheese. There are options for indoor and outdoor dining. We ordered a lot of brisket, spicy pork belly, beef belly, pork jowl, and bulgogi. You can never go wrong with brisket! I also enjoyed the banchan a lot too. Our server was James and he was polite and attentive. There were also some other people too that stopped by once or twice. Some of our orders were heard wrong (nothing major like an extra steamed egg or beef tongue we didn't order) but that's understandable because none of the servers write anything down and it can get a bit loud if people are in large parties or get drunk.I remembered valet as being $2 but it's $4 now which is still not too bad. We found street parking which was available but always rare in LA area."
6/11/2022,3 star rating,"I went here with my brother and my friend for dinner. It was packed, I know when a business is busy they are doing something right but for my first time experience wasnt all that great. The food is good but the service was mediocre they didn't take there time and was just serving food and going to the next customer, I felt like I was being rushed to eat and get out. FYI"
11/12/2021,5 star rating,"This place is amazing and completely worth a special trip and any wait. Highly recommend, and can't wait to be back!They have vallet parking ($4 cash only, no cards or venmo), and plenty of free street parking all around the block.Even on the busiest night you'll be seated fairly quickly.All the meat is beautifully fresh, and delicious. The place is an AYCE (all you can eat), but you must order up to three meat/seafood options at a time. This helps you pace yourself. There is no takeout/takeaway, and you cannot take the meat home. If you leave a substantial amount behind, you'll be charged extra, so really - pace yourself :-)All the fixings are delicious, the sauces options would satisfy even the pickiest individuals. You can order veggies and other sides (after you're done with your meat), but if you or someone in your party doesn't eat meat this may not be a place for them.Now, the most important thing: the service here is EXCEPTIONAL, as in BEYOND AMAZING. The servers keep an eye on the hot plates, manage temperature and make sure you don't burn or undercook any of your food. Whether you're new to Korean barbecue or already a pro - you will feel very well taken care of and will surely enjoy your time here."
10/6/2021,5 star rating,"First AYCE KBBQ in LA during the pandemic! Gone goes the AYCE prices less than $30. AYCE at Hae Jang Chon was $40/person in Sep'21. So it goes to about $50/head with tax and tip, without any add ons. Nonetheless, we had to get the fixing. I had been to Hae Jang Chon a few times before pre-pandemic. Usually, you would need to wait 1-2 hours to get seated. We were seated immediately eating a late lunch. Meats I enjoyed were the brisket, beef belly, beef short rib, and pork belly. We got steamed egg (a bit salty) and the soybean paste soup (I was told the soybean paste soup wasn't very good). The sides were good. The grill was pretty good. We didn't get it changed at all, and nothing got really overburnt.Staff was very attentive. Food came out in 30 seconds to a min after we ordered, which I never had that happen before. We definitely did feel rushed for no reason. They were checking every few min if we wanted more meat and kept asking. We were in and out in 75 min, normally we take at least 1.5-2 hours for AYCE KBBQ. Weird thing too was that no one else was waiting. So pros and cons. Quick meal, but definitely feel rushed. Then they took super long to swipe my card. It honestly took them 10 min for them to bring my card back which is a little sus, but whatever lol.Nonetheless, big fan of HJC! Hopefully they can go back to pre-pandemic prices :)Valet parking is probably easiest. $4"
5/31/2022,5 star rating,Best Korean BBQ All you Can Eat. Hands down. Bring all my friends here. Much love to Hae Jang Chon.
9/21/2021,4 star rating,It's been awhile since I've been here and we recently went again with some friends.This use to be my favorite Korean BBQ places and it's still pretty up there but quality has definitely gone down since the pandemic. Â We came on a Saturday for lunch and there was a 20 minute wait (which is normally pretty good for them). Â They had outdoor seating now but we still preferred inside.They were pretty quick with taking our orders but forgot some items. Â I think we had to ask for mushrooms like 4 times before actually getting it towards the end of our meal. Â They also gave us the wrong meat once. Â Some of the meats were lacking but some were really good. Â Other than that everything else went pretty smoothly and most of the meats were good for the pricing. Â Experience is still pretty good compared to other AYCE korean bbq spots but still room for improvement. Â Oh and parking is still $4 for valet.
10/27/2019,5 star rating,I think I found my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ spot.One of my friends recommended we go for a double date. Â Our wait was an hour and half on a Saturday and it was well worth it. Â And I am saying this being although I am anal about waits longer than an hour. Â I have heard the wait can go up to 3 hours and it is still worth it. Â But if you have a group larger than 6 people then you can make reservations.For $27 per person and up to two hours you can enjoy their amazing foods. Â This place probably has the most options of meats of any AYCE Korean BBQ places and of the highest quality. Â They also have better sides than any other places I have been to as well. Â We went with all non-marinated meats to make sure they were all good and was not disappointed. Â Usually I am not such a huge fan of brisket but it was so good here. Â Everything was good. Â They also have korean pancakes and fried rice as well. Â Yum! Â The service was excellent although our waiter kept forgetting some items. Â He did kept asking to make sure and also cooked for us. Â The restaurant is very casual and like any other Korean BBQ places. Â Their cooking grill is a hot stone instead of a grill which I thought was cool. Â I also like that their tables are round which makes it easy to make conversation with everyone. Â Parking is valet only and is $3. Â I highly recommend.
5/28/2022,5 star rating,Beast Korean BBQ ever love the taste I will be eating here often highly recommendBBQ Beef Plate
2/22/2022,5 star rating,Overall such an amazing experience!! Small parking lot but there's valet parking immediately that costs as much a bottle of coca cola Â :) The staff in the front accommodated for us right away with a newborn and a stroller. The environment was friendlyand the smells... oh boy this place smells so good. Reasonable prices for the amount of food they provide you with. Definitely will be coming back after discovering this gem.
12/6/2021,4 star rating,"Came here on a Thursday evening for dinner for a group of 4. The wait was about 10 minutes, this place is popular. The pricing is per person, all-you-can-eat style. It was approximately $45/person which is pretty good for unlimited size and meat, not for limited stomach sizes. Be strategic when ordering meats, stick to thin slices of meat (bulgolgi, thin pork belly slices, briskets). Â Pace yourself when consuming sides. Their sides are all delectable for a place that does all-you-can-eat because it can be filling. We ordered 6 different types of meat and it was too much, 5 would have been good for 4.We had to stop ourselves from ordering the kimchi pancake as we didn't have room for it in our bellies. So as not to be wasteful, they charge $15/table if you have leftover meat.Highly recommend! Docked off a star as it can be pricey."
5/29/2022,5 star rating,"One of the best ayce kbbqs in Ktown LA. The meat quality is generally good and the atmosphere is nice and boisterous. The hostesses were helpful and the Â service is attentive. One thing is the banchan (side dish) refills are sometimes late (maybe less of a priority than the meat which is understandable). Overall, this is my go to kbbq spot whenever I'm in town."
2/1/2022,4 star rating,"Clearly no one goes hungry here.There are thirty items to choose from all you can eat ,beef,pork ,seafood chicken and loadd of side dishesGreat place if quantity is important"
4/25/2022,5 star rating,"Do you see the long line? There is a reason. It is worth the wait. This place has outstanding food. Their meats taste grade A+ and the servers also are quick and are there to cook and cut for you. I went at a busy Saturday dinner time with a party of 6, parked valet $4, and it took about an hour from the time of signing to getting seated. Well ventilated, stone stove to cook meats, clean restaurant, including the restroom, awesome staff. I know there are many higher end KBBQs in K-town however for an AYCE, this has to be one of the best experiences I've had. The rave continues even after paying bills, having a great time and leaving with a big smile and big stomach. When I got home, I noticed my wallet was gone. The restaurant had already closed so I couldnt call. I checked everything and had everyone check their pockets, bags, jackets, and cars. The restaurant most likely is owned by a Christian and closed Sundays, so I couldn't call. Come Monday, I set my alarm to make sure to call when they opened. The one who picked up was extremely patient and understanding of my situation but said they do not have any returned items in the lost and found. I thanked them, told them to take down my number in case they do see anything. As I started the inconvenient process of canceling all cards and applying for a lost driver's license, Hae Jang Chon calls back and said the manager saw it Saturday and put it in a safe bc it was a small valuable. The workers informed the manager when I had called and so, the great news was relayed to me!I'm freaking biased, but also couldn't be happier to see how professional everything was."
9/24/2021,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is my favorite KBBQ place in LA! A lot of times, AYCE KBBQ restaurants get poor reputations, especially when places like Quarters and Kang Ho Dong are so hyped up. However, I think HJC is the best for a few reasons:1. The prices are very reasonable! For around $45 per person, you can get unlimited meat, side dishes (kimchi fried rice, soybean soup, etc.), and of course banchan. They do charge $15 if you order too much and waste, but I don't know if this is always enforced since they are always so busy and want to get people in and out.2. The meat is delicious! All of the meat is tasty, cut well, and high quality. I enjoyed everything I ordered and would recommend the pork belly.3. HJC has the best banchan in Ktown. I absolutely LOVE the banchan here -- the rice noodle squares are so yummy with KBBQ, but not every place gives them. The soybean sprouts are also some of the best I've had.4. The service is excellent. The waiters at HJC were all so attentive, kind, and patient. They refilled my water and banchan probably like four times throughout my meal there, and were always asking us if we needed anything else.Long story short, I highly recommend HJC as the best KBBQ in Ktown! (Just be prepared to wait a bit and find parking)"
9/24/2021,5 star rating,"K-Town is overflowing with All You Can Eat KBBQ places -- you look up 'korean bbq' on Google and there will be one right next to one. Hae Jang Chon stands above as the pack as one place that is dedicated to serving high-quality meats that are typically found at traditional entree-based KBBQ restaurants. Because of this, Hae Jang Chon is extremely popular -- their small parking lot has a 2$ valet service, and a wait for two on a Friday night was almost 2 hrs. But it is indeed worth the wait: with over 27 meats to choose from, you will not be dissatisfied. With their all you can eat BBQ, we opted for everything from Spicy Pork Belly to tender Beef Tongue (I'm adventurous !) Pro-Tip #1: Get the traditional raspberry wine but be ready to stumble to the uber Â Pro-Tip #2: Ask for a bigger side of the black garlic dipping sauce. Trust me, you'll need it!"
2/23/2022,4 star rating,"Good but pretty expensive. The staff is very friendly. Lettuce on the side with an extra $5. The lunch special was still $40. The quality is really good, but definitely comes at a price. Also kind of confusing wait staff. They start cooking your food for you, but then walk away? Not sure if they're supposed to serve it to you or if you're supposed to grab it from the grill. We ended up grabbing it from the grill. Been there a few times and not really sure to this day."
9/1/2021,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is definitely one of my favorite KBBQ spots in LA County. Their AYCE dinner menu starts at $40 and includes several amazing protein options. All of their proteins are delicious/high-quality and their sides are fire! Their side sauces are bomb as well - there is one with a garlic clove in it that is AMAZING (not sure what it is, but I always dump this on my rice). We ordered the brisket and beef belly - LA FLAME. You know a spot is good when their brisket is amazing, since this is basically every KBBQ's protein baseline. Your server will serve the meat and cook it for you, which isn't that common for AYCE, but hey - less work for me. At the end of the meal you have the option of ordering their kimchi fried rice - DO IT, and opt in for the mozzarella cheese because it is a beautiful, beautiful thing. I'm usually stuffed at this point and a little heartbroken that you can't take the leftover kimchi fried rice home, but it's fine (that's the greedy fat girl in me speaking)."
2/14/2022,3 star rating,"Definitely disappointed with the service here. I will preface this by saying that the food was pretty good and the meat was of higher quality than other AYCE places.Made a reservation for 8 people for February 11th & I was super excited because it was my birthday dinner. We all arrived and when we got seated at our table, it was definitely WAY too small. At best, it could have sat only 6 people, but we had 8. We were so incredibly cramped and it got to the point where the server had to bring a dish cart out to put our extra dishes and meat on because we didn't have enough room on our table."
1/23/2022,4 star rating,"Our second time going here, first was pre-covid.Parking is valet only, $4 or you can look for street parking.Prepare your vaccine card and ID, as they will check prior to getting on the list.We mainly got beef: brisket, bulgogi, steak and short rib. Surprisingly, the service was good and quick. Â Our server was good cooking and getting what we want.Recommend to definitely try this if you're in the area. Wait time can be long depending the time of day you come in.Don't forget the kimchi fried rice after your meat!"
5/10/2022,5 star rating,"SO SO good. Came here with three other people for AYCE KBBQ for lunch. There weren't too many people on a Tuesday afternoon which was great since we didn't have to wait too long. We ordered beef brisket, beef tongue, bulgolgi, intestines, and short rib - all of them were great cuts of meat. The only exception was that the bulgolgi lacked a bit in flavor. But overall amazing service, great food, and amazing value."
6/10/2022,5 star rating,What a great experience with a large group - this place has a lunch special for all you can eat meat. You'll definitely be leaving full and satisfied. The meats are of pretty good quality and the waiting staff comes around to help you cook. One of the best Korean BBQ options in the area and I'm excited to come back.
3/12/2022,4 star rating,"This place is really nice fresh food ! And Good prices, owner did his part , but unfortunately people who works here !are angry,and force everyone to eat fast and leave specially at 10:30 pm... ."
6/21/2019,4 star rating,"I like this place,it has very good foods great quality with normal prices just sometimes I fill that the servers hate customers maybe because of the pressure of their job ââ! also it can be great if they take a reservation even for 1 person not just for 6"
2/12/2022,3 star rating,"Our party of 5 visited on November 30th 2022. It is one of the famous AYCE kbbq in LA. I had too much expectations because of the hype, so I was disappointed a bit. There was a 1 hour wait to get in. The beef brisket and Bulgogi were pretty good, I didn't like the other meat options. With Soju, it came to around 60$ per person. The most expensive of all the kbbq places I've been to."

6/15/2021,5 star rating,"My new favorite kbbq place is definitely this one..sorry SJ kbbqs but this one is just so much better.We stopped by here on our first night around 8 close to 9 and the wait time was already 1-2 hours long, as well as the other kbbqs around us when we phoned in. We were already starving so we decided to grab bibimbap elsewhere and came back the next morning, which got us a table inside so yay!!After ordering, everything came out super quick and our server also cooked for us which is SOOO nice and relaxing. Our waiters, I believe Kevin and Jun(I believe?) were super friendly and helpful. Kevin came around many times to check in on us, refill our brisket sauce (this sauce was so yummy) and to grill our meat. Aside from the service, the quality of the meat is also MUCH better than ones that I've tried at other restaurants. I loved getting the brisket, pork belly, bulgogi and short rib (I usually don't order marinated meats at Gen's because it's too sweet but it's perfectly seasoned here!)The pork neck steak and the intestine (this was cut differently which allowed for more thorough cooking which was good!) were also surprisingly delicious.Overall, I'm super satisfied with my experience here and it's definitely worth the visit. Parking can be tedious but there are other lots and street parking you could try as well :3"
2/12/2022,5 star rating,This place has great meat and spectacular service. I can never eat at Gen again. Wished I lived closer. My top favoritesBrisket Pork Belly (thin sliced)Gal BiSteak I understand why it's so popular
12/29/2021,5 star rating,"Lunch is $33.99Dinner is $39.99Hae Jang Chon has always been on the pricier side when it came to KBBQ but I have always found the price to be justifiable. Before my last visit, it's been a few years since I've been to Hae Jang Chon due to covid and distance. I came here for lunch for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. Especially since there wasn't a long wait. I think I waited 10 minutes max. Could be due to covid and could be that it was lunch time but it made my return to Hae Jang Chon so much better than I expected. If I waited 1.4 hours like others have stated, I probably wouldn't have been as happy. If you vallet it will be $4. Parking on the street is fine in the day time but a friend of mine got his car broken into around the corner a different night. Just FYI. Park at your own risk."
12/22/2021,4 star rating,"Came here around 5:30 on Tuesday for early AYCE dinner. Got seated pretty quick and was able to eat some banchan while we waited to order the meat and wait for the grille to warm up. Beef brisket and beef belly were super delicious. The beef short rib was good but not as soft as I was hoping. Kimchi was super spicy.All in all pretty awesome bbq, and ended up super stuffed. Caveats about this place include: $4 valet parking, lettuce costs $5, limit 3 meats at a time, you can do half orders, and kimchi fried rice is only served after the meal is done."
6/6/2022,4 star rating,I just want to give a shout out to the host because we came here right after a dodger game and you can tell they were just about ready to stop taking people in. We had a party of 4 and everywhere else was closed/would not seat us but thankfully they got us and they said we had 45 minutes which I wasn't even tripping about because we got there super late. Even though we were on s time crunch we did not feel rushed at all! The food was amazing and I will definitely come back with out getting there 30 mins before closing
5/20/2022,5 star rating,"This is my favorite Korean bbq restaurant. Been going to this establishment for over ten years. This place can get crowded so come prepared to wait, but trust me it's worth it. Also make sure all of your party is there or else they will not seat you. Â They require you to order three meets at a time and the service is fast. Â Come prepared to eat as the food here is delicious."
6/4/2022,4 star rating,"Expect a long wait because this place is very popular, but man is the food so worth it!"
5/29/2021,3 star rating,"So... the most reviewed KBBQ restaurant in the area on Yelp... so I had to try it. I mean over 5000+ Yelp reviews so I had to see what's up!So I arrived here at 6:20 PM and didn't get to eat until 9:10 PM. That's right a ridiculous wait time of almost 3 hours. I have never waited for a restaurant for 3 hours. There was even a line to put your name on the waiting list. That's how busy this place is.So let's talk food, the menu doesn't seem that big and is only a few items. Pricing of this place is on the higher end of a KBBQ AYCE but the menu was pretty limited. For example, there are some missed opportunities for increasing their menu like having marinated rib finger instead of just having rib finger. The food itself was good, solid, no doubt about it. The only thing that I really liked was the brisket and the marinated short rib. One thing I didn't like about the short rib was that there was no bone. I mean, that's one of the main things of the short rib was to get the actual bone right? One thing I am not sure about is if the first order is a higher quality one and any additional orders is a subpar quality. The additional orders of brisket and short ribs I had weren't as good as my original order. It was tougher and wasn't marinated as well.The steamed egg was extremely watery and just tasted like egg and salt. Nothing special, but I wouldn't get it again. The side dishes here were meh, the fish cake was really oily and soggy. The kimchi was super sour, like if it came out of a jar from the grocery market. Service here is excellent, the food came out very fast, didn't have an opportunity to not have meat and also the server cooked for us. This was pretty A+ service here. For example, short ribs they grilled and cut it up for us, the brisket and other meat, they grilled it and then slid it to the top of the grill for us to eat. The only other place that has cooked for me was Quarters or the Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong. The grill itself is very nice. It's tilted so the fat and grease roll away from the meat. It's not like other KBBQ restaurant where it just sits on the grill or it rolls off into the fire. The fire here is also very strong and cooked very quickly.The parking situation here is valet only. There are street parking near by if you get lucky, and if you are paying by the hour, make sure you buy enough hours because the wait time here is pretty bad. I parked in a structure about 3 blocks away near the CVS, it's not the actual CVS lot but there's a structure near there. It's 14 dollars all day. The restroom here is kinda dirty and there is only 1 for men and 1 for women. There's always a line to go to the restroom. So my only issues about this place is the atrocious wait time, the short rib not having bone, and valet parking only. The food is good, service is great, but I'm not sure waiting 3 hours is justifiable for this place. Overall, 3/5 - would recommend trying it at least once."

6/4/2022,3 star rating,"The food was great- very well seasoned meat and a good selection of sauces and side dishes. The reason I'm giving it a subpar review is due to the lackluster service and the obnoxiously long wait time. We got there shortly before 8pm and put our name on the list. We asked the host how long the wait was and he informed us it would be about 30-40 minutes. AN HOUR AND A HALF HOUR LATER, we were FINALLY seated. Had he given us an accurate wait time, we definitely would have bounced and gone somewhere else- there are a lot of choices for KBBQ AYCE that don't have crazy wait times and taste just as good. If you don't mind waiting and being told ""just 30-40 more minutes"", go for it. â Advice to management: give accurate wait times instead."
5/23/2022,5 star rating,Had my bf surprise bday party and it went great because of the staff working there. Â I made an reservation because it was a party and I didn't want to make our guest wait. When I get there host told me that all guest (10-12) has to be there to be seated. Â I complained because that's why I made a reservation and restaurant should reserve seats for that reservation but they told me their system isn't that way. Â I was disappointed but manager on the site quickly resolved issue I had and we had table in less than 10 min. I am sorry that I complained but THANK YOU SO MUCH for accommodating our needs Â food also so good and at the end they brought out cake with some music Â (also they accept to bring cake in advance) again thank you so much for every and my bf and his stomach was happy Â also all our friends
5/28/2022,5 star rating,The best service Korean All You Can Eat Restaurant. Kay was an amazing server/Manager. She was so attentive like any other Korean joints that you have to chase for the server to get your next order. She comes to you and cook for you which was unusual to other Korean AYCE we've eaten. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Definitely will come back here.
12/5/2021,5 star rating,"10/10. Great service. Quick, efficient, they help you when you are too busy eating to cook. Meats were great. The wait was 2.5hrs though. We played monopoly deal to pass the time. Good."
11/19/2021,5 star rating,Dinner for 5 AYCE. Â Ate way too much and the food kept coming. We were only here for about 40 minutes and I think I ate about 2lb of meat. Â Our server was great considering our table kept order more and more and more. It was non stop... Â the meat was great because they slice it thin and it was delicious. Â Definitely a place to go since the servers are great and food was even better.We ordered just about everything on the menu.A must when in the area!!!
12/25/2021,5 star rating,"One of my favorite ayce kbbq places in town. For 33.99 (weekday lunch), they have a large variety of meats and side dishes. Some of my personal favorites include the steamed egg and corn cheese. they also included the radishes and rice paper as sides on the table whereas most other places require you to ask for it. you could cook for yourself but the servers also come by every now and then to flip the meat or put new meat on the grill. overall, it was a pleasant experience.btw, they do ask for ID and vaccination card(physical or digital) before seating so don't forget it!"
6/9/2021,5 star rating,Went for the first time recently and I completely understand the following Hae Jang Chon has. I came about 10 minutes before they opened and was able to be seated as soon as they opened.Food: Their meat is definitely high quality. My group was a fan of most of the meats except for the marinated short rib. It was a bit too tough for our liking. Definitely get the beef tongue though! Service: The staff is super attentive and would often come by to ask what else we wanted to order. Meat comes out fast and cooks even faster so be ready to eat! We had an order of kimchi fried rice to round out the meal and I really appreciated that the staff moved some of the burnt bits off the grill before they cooked on it. Parking: There's valet parking available. Sometimes you'll be able to find parking in the residential area but it's pretty limited. Pro tip: Ask for sliced raw garlic. It's a game changer.

2/20/2022,5 star rating,"Very happy with the AYCE KBBQ experience here! Came here on a Saturday for dinner. Our friends put our name on the waitlist around 5pm, and the wait was around 40 minutes. Ambience inside was pretty nice. I was mainly impressed by how the staff helps you to cook the meats! So convenient! The grills here are also great - makes the meat extra crispy. Portion sizes were good, so you can try a bunch of different meats. We got the brisket, beef tongue, short rib, bulgogi, octopus, and pork belly. Everything was quite good! On the pricier side compared to other places, but it's as expected because it's LA, and because the staff here helps you to cook/cut the meats. We will definitely be back!"

7/5/2021,4 star rating,"Came here around 1:45pm and there were a lot of people waiting! We were like 19th on the list. Waited for about an hour to get seated. The banchan is already there, placed it even before we got to our table. Their service is really great! Ordered a lot of beef and it's good. (Nothing super special but all good) Also ordered some seafood.- Beef brisket- beef tongue- Short Rib- Beef belly- Bulgogi- Octopus- Squid- Salad- Steamed Egg- Kimchi fried riceI think if you ask my sister what's the best one for her, it's the squid and the salad. For the meat, it'd be the beef tongue. Price is a bit on the expensive side but it's okay if you're craving for AYCE kbbq."
1/19/2022,4 star rating,"One of the best quality ayce Korean BBQ spots. Their meat quality is always fresh and tender. The meat is never tough like some of the other ayce spots.I order the beef brisket, beef belly, pork belly, and beef tongue.I also get the steamed egg and soy bean soup."
5/29/2021,5 star rating,"This place was absolute amazing. We were a group of 16 people looking to get food on a Friday night. At first, I was worried because past reviews made the place sound very strict about people not showing up and the wait time. However, we got in after waiting for an hour despite adding a person last minute. Meat options were plenty, service was amazing (shouout to the ahjumma who was our waiter!). 3 meat options per round and they have a bunch of side-dishes like kimchi pancake that you can order. Overall, there are reasons why this place is so popular. Although there are a lot of bad reviews mentioning reservations not being respected, but I had a different experience. It may be an exception or not."
10/26/2021,5 star rating,"This place is absolutely amazing. From the moment we entered they had great service. They sat us at a round table with plenty of space. We had multiple people coming over to ask us what we wanted and needed. They do have the policy that if you leave a good amount of left over meat that you have to pay $15 so we were mindful of that before ordering all kinds of meat. I like that idea that way you don't waste and you eat just what you like. They also have indoor and outdoor dining and their restaurant has wide open doors with lots of ventilation. We ordered marinated short ribs, thin and thick slices of pork belly, we asked if we could order half the portion for the thick pork belly and bulgogi and it was perfect. We also ordered the corn cheese and sides of rice. Their radish wraps and rice wraps are delicious. They also cook all your meat for you and the waiters take turns coming around so your meat doesn't burn. The service is amazing. Their food is top notch quality. I can't wait to go back and I'm sad I hadn't been there before."
4/24/2021,4 star rating,"Heard wonderful things about this KBBQ in Koreatown and decided to give it a try for its lunch AYCE ($32 per person).The line was about 1 hour long in the afternoon. You can find metered parking either nearby on the streets or their valet parking for about $5.I thought the side dishes were excellent; they weren't overly salty like many other restaurants. The meats were decent, but not amazing. The beef fingers were dry and rough, and the short ribs were middle of the road. Otherwise, all the other meats tasted great and I was satisfied with the food.One thing that did bother me was the service. I understand that there's a line outside and they want to keep customers flowing in, but our waiters felt incredibly rushed in trying to get us out of there asap. We wanted to just sit down and enjoy a lunch after waiting an hour outside, but ended up only eating for 40 minutes. Our waiters kept asking us to place new orders and cooking the food for us before we could even get in 2 bites of the previous meat."
11/18/2021,5 star rating,"My favorite AYCE KBBQ of all time!! While it's tough to top the premium a la carte places, Hae Jang Chon embodies the best of both worlds with quantity and quality - the perfect splurge meal for meat lovers with large appetites. Lines can get crazy, especially for dinner, so I recommend arriving at opening if possible. Service was efficient with our lady refilling sauces and cooking our meat attentively! Lastly I love their grills since they don't need to be changed out often. We usually start with the brisket but quickly graduate to several orders of the more tender and crowd favorite beef belly. Thin pork belly and beef tongue (my favorite kbbq meats) are excellent here as well. Their galbi comes with bones removed already and is perfectly marinated. Kimchi pancake, corn cheese, and steamed egg are tasty compliments. Don't forget to request kimchi fried rice (optional mozzarella melted on top) if your party has enough room left at the end!"
2/25/2022,5 star rating,All around a fantastic Friday lunch time AYCE KBBQ experience that came out to around $36 per person. Easy five stars for the marinated squid. Any KBBQ spot can serve you a mountain of bulgogi. Only the exceptional KBBQ spot will bring out perfect seafood. I will probably go back again soon and just alternate between thick cut pork belly and marinated squid until I am kindly asked to leave.
12/6/2021,5 star rating,"THIS IS A MUST TRY! Boy was this place awesome. Words can't describe the experience and I can't wait to go back!First-This place is in a shopping center and I will say the parking isn't ideal. They have valet I believe it's like $4 but didn't seem worth it. Found street parking but the meter only goes to an hour max. You'll definitely need more than that for this awesome place. The inside is really nice, and they have outdoor seating. I'm tall so the seating wasn't the most comfortable but it was still good enough. The staff was great. They explained everything on the table and made great recommendations for food. They were polite. Cooked some food for us and cut stuff up and we're delightful.Second-The food was PHENOMENAL! They have a lot of choices and we probably went through half before we hit our fill. Everything was so fresh and just great. It was so good. I highly recommend the prime steak and the brisket! They seemed like very popular options as a lot of tables seemed to be getting that!I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this place! It is worth the $40 I promise."
12/5/2021,4 star rating,"Pretty decent quality food, but it's a bit pricey and the line is quite long.On a Saturday night around 5:30pm we waited approximately 2.5 hours for two people. There's one a paper list so you won't get a text message when you're up in line.The servers were pretty nice and attentive although they're all pretty busy going around the whole restaurant. The side dishes were all delicious and I enjoyed every order that I got. I do advise ordering half portions for everything for a party of two so you don't fully commit to any one dish and get to try more.They also have fried rice to end the meal which is nice.Overall, I would recommend this place over a non-AYCE place only if you (1) want to try many dishes or (2) you really eat a lot to make it worth the price.I would come back with a group of friends. For this price point, I think going to a non-AYCE for a party of two makes more sense :)"
11/23/2021,5 star rating,What an experience! The staff were so attentive and I'm so happy to have found this place on Yelp. The wait was about 10 minutes - not bad at all! The meats were such good quality and the ventilation was really good in the restaurant. 10/10!

11/1/2021,5 star rating,"Would anyone like to explain to me why I've been in LA for two years and I'm just now trying Korean BBQ? One of my work besties treated me after she clowned me for not having it yet lol. She insisted since it was my first time, it was only right to do all you can eat and Hae Jang is her favorite and it's my favorite now too lol. We had pork belly, bulgogi, and beef short rib and they were all hella good even before dipping it into the variety of sauces you get, which honestly just led me to have a foodgasm Â My friend even got me hip on creating a lil wrap situation with the radish wrap, some meat, some sauce and a little salad. A COMBINATION LET ME TELL YOU. Another hidden gem I can't wait to take my friends when they come visit,"
3/13/2021,4 star rating,"Shout out to Jun! Best server ever. Canopies were set up at the parking lot. It was a bit cold because the sidewalls did not go all the way to the ground (there was about 3 feet opening). NO RESERVATION. FOOD:We ordered Spicy Thin Sliced Canadian Pork Belly, Bulgogi, and Brisket. We also asked for Kimchi Pancake. THEY CHARGE $5 for lettuce of perilla leaves (sesame leaves). Not good. I love wrapping my grilled meat with a little bit of soy bean paste. Unfortunately, we did not get this. Out of all the meats, the spicy thinly sliced Canadian pork belly was the best. It was spicy but not overly spicy. We grilled it until some parts were charred, it was good!Beef Bulgogi was good, soft and juicy. But we expected it to come with that popular sweet, spicy, soy sauce, garlicky flavor. It was not marinated. Beef Brisket had too much fat. It was almost fat more than meat. But it was still good. Kimchi Pancake was not good. I was so disappointed because it's one of my fav Korean food. It had too much flour. It was not crispy at all. Sauces: sesame with pickled radish, garlic, and jalapeÃ±o, sesame oil, soybean paste, some spicy sauce that was so good it made me eat more meat than I should. Banchan: I'd say there is a variety. I love that they give you cabbage kimchi and bean sprout kimchi. They also have the popular fish cake. Greens. Radish, two kinds - good to cleanse the palate. PARKING: there is a valet in that compound which costs $3 (at the time of visit, 12 MAR 2021). You can leave the car there for the whole day. Sadly folks, my pictures did not turn out good because of the color of the canopy, orange. With the sun and orange canopy my pictures look like I was in hell Â but if you enjoy BW photography, I attached one."
4/13/2022,5 star rating,"Let's be real, I usually like going to Korean BBQ places where I see lots of older Korean folks. Makes me feel like I can trust that the food is not catered to Western palates. So I had some hesitation about this place based on the crowd. But man, they still serve some bomb meat! Grill burns real hot. Would def come here again, even with the packed house"
8/12/2021,5 star rating,"Holy Smokes!! This restaurant really is AMAZING in many ways. Let me list for you all the ways that it has won me over! Outdoor seatings and full ventilation of the restaurant since all its windows and doors are open. Truly... open concept restaurant. They have a body temperature scanner. Awesome in my book. Less dealing with people near me. They have a huge air filter machine or AC blowing fresh air circulating around the restaurant. Guys! They aren't joking around with this Covid thing. They are taking it very seriously!! Also, their vent for sucking up bbq smokes/odor is spot less!! Do you know how hard it is to keep those suckers clean?? I mean those things are actually sparkly shiny!! Finally...the food!! They serve quality meat !! The short ribs is my favorite since it's so tender. Can't wait to go again!!"
11/6/2021,3 star rating,"Came in for a friends birthday on a weekday as a group of 6. Â There is valet parking for about $4 but also some street parking. Def recommend the spicy pork belly as it was one of our favorites. The food itself was good, however, not sure if it's worth the $50 with tax and tip price tag. Def can find similar quality for $10-$15 cheaper. The service was very unwelcoming and they did not let our friend come in who was running a bit late due to traffic."
6/3/2022,5 star rating,Great food good quality of service they're open late and they never let any customers walk away even if it's last minute which is amazing food comes out fast accurate hot place is clean and nice the bathrooms are not bad and I would probably recommend this place to a lot of people

We waited for over an hour and still they were unable to seat our group. The manager was also very rude and extremely disrespectful to us. Maybe it was a bad night for making a reservation, but regardless restaurants need to honor a reservation. I might try again but, be aware that they may not honor your reservation if they are people before you!!!"

If I ever find myself in the area again, I would definitely want to come back."

3/23/2022,1 star rating,"Probably my worst overall dining experience of my life! 1. We were told we had to wait 45 mins, we were called at 1 hour to be told to wait another 30 mins which turned into a total of 2 hours. If we had known this we would have at least gotten a drink / apps somewhere else. (Note: they also called us for just a headcount and then called us again 20 mins later so we were feeling toyed with)2. $40 a pop all you can eat. We were told we would be charged for any extra meat we couldn't finish- yet we could not take any of said meat home. Weird... pick one.3. Our vegetarian in the group was told if she ordered An egg or some rice that she would be charged $40. Her other option was to be charged $7 to just eat the Ban Chan (picked sides that were given for free)4. When we tried to order kimchi fried rice, we were told by our server that the owner wouldn't ""let us"" because they prefer we get full on meat first. It was all so weirdly controlling and not fun. Service was weak. We were seriously primed for a good time, for a birthday, feeling great when we got there. It took quite a lot of bad service, weird patronizing policies, and mediocre food to kill our vibe.With all the amazing Korean food spots that let you order what you want and treat you with kindness and like you're a sentient adult, I would never ever come here again. Paying hella money to wait forever, cook your own food, get told you can't have what you want, and be stressed about finishing you food- just not a good experience."
1/9/2022,5 star rating,"My go to for AYCE korean bbq in Korea town! Higher quality of meats compared to the nearby AYCE joints including brisket, thin pork belly, and beef tongue, granted at a higher cost (~typically $50 pp with tip tax). Also there's a good variety of side dishes like kimchi pancake and corn cheese. Nice touch is that service is also much better than most AYCES, and the waiters cook the meat for you. Waits can be long on weekends so expect to wait at least an hr at peak times (6-8PM). We highly recommend stopping at 88 hot dog to eat a korean hot dog while waiting for a table so the hanger doesn't catch up to you."
5/2/2022,5 star rating,Best KBBQ I have ever had in my life .. Meat selection and quality is incredible for what you pay. Must try!
9/14/2021,5 star rating,"Came in for dinner last Friday on the suggestion of a friend, and had high expectations based on these reviews! Hae Jang Chon is found in the middle of a little strip plaza off of 6th St. For a Friday evening, parking in the plaza was for valet, with very limited street parking in the surrounding areas.Once our car had found a spot, the wait time was about 1 hour--and you definitely won't be the only party waiting! Currently, they are offering both indoor and outdoor seating. Once we were seated, our server was quick with our orders. She even jumped in to help barbecue some of our meats. Staff all around were highly attentive even in our water and banchan refills. The beef selection is really where this spot shines! Overall, the quality of all the meats we selected was pretty good, and I am such a fan of places that offer good thin beef belly and beef tongue. Our table favorites though were definitely the brisket and marinated beef short rib! Highly recommend!Unfortunately, we did order a couple steamed eggs at the beginning that never made their way to our table, but after a certain point it wasn't worth following up when the meat and side dishes were so good! This was definitely a good KBBQ spot and would recommend a stop in!"
5/7/2022,2 star rating,"I have been going to this place like forever! Love the food! However, the last time I was there, I was really disappointed. They stopped seating customers at 11PM. I was seated at 10:50PM, and I was informed that the last call was at 11:10PM, which I did not mind. I wanted to order as much meat as possible. I know my limit and I never order more than 9 orders of meat. The server told me that I could only order 3 meats at a time, which annoyed me but I was willing to work with them. After I ordered my first round of meat with them, it took 10 minutes for us to get the meat and it was 11:02PM by that point. I was annoyed, so I asked our waiter if can I order more than 3 meat please because your last call is at 11:10PM. I could tell that he was annoyed and a little upset, and he answered me with ""You can only do 3 meat if you don't finish your meat I'm going to charge you."" I was thinking to myself ""I know...I've been here many times and I've always finished my food."" I was able to order 5 more and when the order came out they were half a size of what I would usually get. Of course, my auntie and I finished our food with no problems. He's been our server plenty of times and I have to say that he is not my favorite. After we paid our check, he had the nerves to check on the tip that we left him. Of course with unpleasant service, you'd get tip that matched your service. He looked at us and didn't pick up a little folder with him, so my aunt threw another $10 in there. He came back to check the tip again and he took it after the folder this time.I did not ask for much. All I wanted was to order the meat that I wanted to order. I DIDN'T EVEN EXPECT ANY SERVICE FROM THEM! If I couldn't finish it then charge me! But do not disrespect me and my auntie, and treated us like we're stupid.They need to change the time when they stop seating people or their last call time. Because if you seat customers at 11PM and only allow them to order 3 meat at a time, and we can't order more meat unless we finish the 3 meat we order, then we are paying for something that we cannot fully enjoy. Last call should be 30 minutes after the time you stop seating customers."
1/30/2022,3 star rating,"This was a pretty good Kbbq spot. They check vaccine cards if you want to dine inside. The area is kinda sketchy but we had to street park. The meats here are pretty good, so tender and flavorful. The sides however threw me off a bit, the potatoes tasted so weird it had a weird flavor that's hard to describe but I didn't like it. The cheese corn also had a weird flavor. The grill itself splattered alot, the oil kept splattering on my face and arms so it was a painful experience. The service was pretty good they come cook the meat for you here and there. Overall I don't know if I would come back, I didn't really enjoy getting hot oil splattering on my face the whole meal."

Service is good. Price has definitely gone up but with the all you can eat meat I guess it's worth it, but that wait!I'll have to explore other all you can eat around town and report back in comparison."

1/12/2022,5 star rating,"Let me start off by this place Â got Korean bbq right. Â The service here is impeccable. Â I'm not sure if it's an LA thing (I'm from OC) Â as they cook for you here. Â This is by far the best one of the best Korean BBQ spot in have been to. Â Not only are they not stingy with the sauces, Â they hook it up with everything. My only regret is that I came here when I wasn't that hungry, even after biking 14 miles, still... I tried to eat. Â I would say the meat are about the same as all other Korean bbq places. Â  I was also surprised as I never had kalbi flank steak before. I was cracking up as they served us that instead of regular bone kalbi. Â For two people it was about ~$118 with gratuity. Â  They earned their tip with Â their cooking n service. Â I would love to go to this place again next time I'm in k town on an empty stomach.

My favorites were the BBQ Chicken, Beef Bulgogi, and the Bean Paste Soup which was a surprisingly refreshing break in between meat rounds. The service was also great--our waitress was very attentive and cooked our food for us which made it that much more relaxing. The Kimchi and bean sprouts that are already at your table when you're seated are INCREDIBLE. They also offer you a couple things to help you make wraps out of your bites. Our group of 5 was SO full and satisfied by the time we left, LOVED this place!"
11/23/2020,5 star rating,"What a delight. We decided to treat ourselves since we're about to go on lockdown and they're about to take away outdoor dining again. KBBQ is one of the things I've personally missed these last few months. We showed up 4 deep and waited about 10 minutes for a table. Not bad for a Sunday imo. They have a great system in place with partitions. Their parking lot has been turned to outdoor dining. We got a prime spot far away from foot traffic. My friends mentioned maybe it was the hookup for being Asian. Lol. Brendan did a great job waiting on us. He definitely got so many steps in. We were hungry and thirsty so the table constantly asked for beer/sake/soda/water. We got:Beef brisketBeef short ribBulgogiOctopusThe bulgogi was so good we got 2.5 orders of it. The last round was a half order because we don't like to waste food and knew we only had a little bit of room left. I loved all the sides that were on the table as soon as we sat down. My personal favorite was all the potato salad. I know some people are weirder out by the addition of apple in there, but I live for it."
6/21/2021,4 star rating,First time I actually been here. Â Now it explain the long lines. Â I've had brisket at other places that were tastier but theirs was okay. Â The service is impeccable. Â They have banchan but they could have more options. Â Their potato salad was subpar. Â They do have a wide selection of choices on their all you can eat menu though. Â We left pretty full and satisfied.Parking is Valet. Â $3
8/7/2021,4 star rating,"AYCE kbbq. Â A good selection of quality meats. Â The highlight here was the service. They brought out the food super fast and cooked it for us. Â We had an expected wait time of 1.5 hrs, but were seated in about 30 minutes. Â It is a bit pricey."
7/8/2021,5 star rating,"Always love this place! Loved it even more this week cause I didn't have to wait too long to sit. Best kBBQ In Ktown. If you haven't tried this spot, you're missing out. My only advice- end it with fried rice"
6/29/2021,5 star rating,"Service was great and we appreciated our servers recommendations and help with the cooking. The food was fresh and delicious. If you haven't had Korean BBQ lately, or ever, check it out. All you Can Eat!!!Get there early. Did I say to get there early? Get there early."
12/20/2021,3 star rating,"Came here on Saturday for dinner. Haven't been here for quite some time, so decided to have BBQ here. We were seated right away, which was cool. I'm glad they checked for vaccination proof, and they also added some dividers between the tables. Went ahead and started ordering the meats. Once the meats started to come, the servers began cooking the food for us; which is a nice gesture. We started eating the meats, but then, another server (the guy) started putting more raw meat to cook.. I told the guy, "" oh, we will cook later"" but the guy didn't even listen and kept putting more meat in to cook. Come on guy.... are you RUSHING us to finish our meal??? We prefer to enjoy our meats and side dishes at our own pace. Our second round of meat order, I started to order just 1 item at a time. Â Man, I felt super rushed and pressured to finish the food at a fast pace. I know that it's part of the service to cook the meat for us, but man... please listen to your patrons when they tell you to hold off in cooking. We don't eat that fast, and we were not in a rush to finish our dinner. Not every server were rude. A couple of the young girls were a lot more friendlier. Overall, I like their selection of meats, but please don't rush your customers."
1/26/2022,5 star rating,"Went during a weekday right when they opened for lunch at 11am so there wasn't a lot of people yet. Felt pretty safe as there were clear dividers for each of the tables (the ones at the wall at least). We got the lunch ayce. Overall great service, had 7 plates of meat for a party of 2 people . We loved the beef belly & marinated beef short ribs"
4/17/2022,5 star rating,First time here & will be back. Service was outstanding & quality of meats top notch. Only waited 25 minutes on a Saturday afternoon.
11/16/2020,4 star rating,"Went here on a Saturday night and it was really crowded! But crowded for a reason: the food was amazing!First time here ever and went during the pandemic. Parking is a little difficult to find but that's typical of Los Angeles. They followed CDC guidelines with wearing masks, gloves, and even having screen dividers by table.The meat was juicy and was consistent throughout the time we were eating! The sides were really yummy and it was great to drink with soju. Also, everything was disposable! Nothing reusable.The reason for 4 stars is because there were two concerns I had: (1) I think they should have a Yelp waitlist or phone number waitlist, so that overcrowding does not happen. There were a lot of moments where a lot of people were crowding because they wanted to make sure they can hear their names when the host would call them. (2) I really did not like that the waiter would keep cooking and pouring all the meat into our grill. It forced us to eat really fast, so that the food does not burn. Overall, great food! Just minor things they should consider changing for the safety of their staff and customers && the rushing."
8/28/2021,5 star rating,"Great value for excellent all-you-can-eat meat cuts, an assortment of sides and sauces, and fun atmosphere!We had been wanting to try authentic KBBQ, and had a good friend recommend this place and can confidently say it delivered in all aspects. They do not take reservations for parties less than 6, and knowing there were 2 of us we arrived at around 4:30pm on a Saturday. We waited only a moment for our table indoors to be cleaned and we were seated. There's abundant indoor and outdoor seating, and even when we left around 5:30 there were plenty of tables open (though bustling nonetheless!)We used the valet to park to avoid the headache of finding a street spot. It's only $4 and you can get it situated right when you pull into the strip mall with the restaurant. Have nothing but positive reviews of the food, beer, and atmosphere! The main windows and front section are open, so even if you're seated ""indoors,"" there's plenty of open air and ventilation. Our meat choices were beef brisket, BBQ beef bulgogi, and the spicy pork belly cuts. They were all incredibly juicy, tasty, and we're looking forward to more in our near future."
5/29/2022,5 star rating,So good!!! They give you so much meat and the sides are all amazing. Loved the daikon wraps and pickled daikon
4/22/2022,5 star rating,"Had such a great experience here! I'm from the bay area though, so not sure if my standards are just low haha. The meat was great, and the customer service was even better. Came at 5:30pm on a Friday and was seated within 5 minutes."
11/19/2020,3 star rating,"My friends wanted to grab KBBQ & my friend suggested we go to Hae Jang Chon since it was one of the best KBBQ he has ever had.I would strongly agree w/ this statement; however, we had an unfortunate experience during our dinner. As we were waiting for our food, the grill suddenly exploded on us which created a mess & honestly becomes a safety concern. Gladly no one was hurt when the grill shattered. I was tempted to sue the restaurant since it really brought down the mood of the entire dinner & again, it's a safety concern. I believe it exploded in the first place because they had the heat on too high.Despite everything that happened, there was an effort for a service recovery so I tried to look past it. They offered free drinks & a discount on the total bill. An unfortunate turn of events but the food was really amazing & for a KBBQ restaurant they had a lot of options. We liked the fact that they served rice cakes & fried rice topped w/ melted cheese. All of the different meats that we had was great quality & very flavorful from the beef, chicken, & squid.If it wasn't for this unfortunate experience I would give this restaurant a 5/5."
12/17/2021,5 star rating,"Even though the wait was long (about an hour and a half), it was definitely worth the wait and money. Recommend to go on a weekday instead or just browse around the plaza while you wait (just be conscious since they won't give you a timer). Sides were delicious. It was my first time having a Korean BBQ restaurant serve rice papers. Service was good despite how busy they were. Overall, I will definitely come back with my friends."
12/17/2021,3 star rating,"Because it wasn't worth 40 dollars a plate, maybe 20. The taste didn't have a wow factor. The meat only tasted good because it was marinated, anybody can do that. It's an all you can eat type of establishment. Anyone can do this at home."
10/7/2021,5 star rating,"I've wanted to try this AYCE BBQ place for many years but never have the patience to wait in line. I was finally able to go on a this Wednesday at 5 p.m. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and the excellent service. The menu was quite simple but had all the classics I enjoyed. I love how the beef quality is either USDA prime or choice. My mother has a very sensitive digestive, so we avoided spicy and sour foods (including kimchi fried rice -so sad). She is happy to report that she has no problems and had the best night's sleep for a long while. I also liked the plastic dividers between the closer tables, and all the staff members wore masks. It shows the commitment to protecting their customers during these times. Street parking is pretty much impossible to find. Their convenient valet is $4. I highly recommend this place as I would definitely return in the near future."
3/31/2021,4 star rating,"Solid spot for AYCE KBBQ! Hae Jang Chon is open for both indoor and outdoor seating - they've done a good job of separating out tables and enforcing COVID precautions. There is some street parking nearby if you're lucky, but otherwise, the complex the restaurant is located in offers valet parking for $4. AYCE is about $35/person for dinner and $32/person for lunch. There's a good variety of quality meat and seafood and tasty barchan as well. I thought that the kimchi pancake was ok and could've been crispier and wasn't a big fan of the kimchi fried rice either (think the seaweed flavor was a bit too overpowering for me personally). The service was great and we didn't have to wait too long before being seated."
3/25/2021,5 star rating,"The price has raised post-pandemic. But this place is totally still worth it. I stand by this being my favorite Kbbq(I've tried a variety of different places at different prices). I love the garlicky spinach they added to the banchan. Love that they have rice paper+ delicious banchan! Meats are good quality and so delicious. And the stone grill prevents burning and charring on the grill Â and having to constantly trade out the grill. We got really lucky and came around 5:30pm, and only waited 10 minutes on a Thursday night. Dinner price is $35/person now. Lunch is $32. We usually park down the street."
2/14/2020,5 star rating,"This is one of my new favorite kbbq spots I think. For lunch it's a great deal at 25.99 with quite a few options. The meat was all great quality and really tasty. The meat also cooks so delicious on the stone grill I love it. The service was okay, not terrible. I definitely will be back!"
1/13/2022,4 star rating,"One of the best kbbq! This place is expensive, but if you want quality meat come here!! Mainly ordered short ribs, pork belly, and brisket. Place is always crowded so come earlier to fill out the sign in sheet at the front or try to call ahead of time. Valet parking."
10/24/2021,5 star rating,"Came to this place for the first time last night and all I can really say is that the KBBQ here is definitely 5 star worthy! The food, experience and service was well worth the wait! When we arrived we came to a crowd of people who were waiting to get seated as well. Despite the wait being seemingly long, that was more than enough reason for us to stay. Thankfully we managed to get seated in 40-45 minutes.As we made our way to our seats, I could see that the bonchon was already set on our table. It was nice to have that there before we got seated. As a Bay Area resident, most KBBQ places we've gone to will serve the bonchon after we're seated so I appreciated seeing it there before we made it to our seats. To add on to the bonchon, I loved the selection they provided. The staff was super attentive as well and came to tend to our needs. The service altogether was impeccable! As our waiter was taking our order, we ended up ordering the beef brisket, spicy pork and bulgogi. All the meats they had available were premium so everything that we had from the beef brisket to the bulgogi was beyond delicious! Not so fatty either which was a HUGE plus for me. The beef brisket was my personal favorite. Both the bulgogi and spicy pork were marinated really well but I would say that the spicy pork was a tad bit too spicy for me, so we ended up just ordering more of the beef brisket and bulgogi. I have no regrets! The corn cheese was also delicious!Overall this is definitely one of my go to places when I come to LA again! I can honestly say that the KBBQ here for the prices they have is WORTH IT! Especially for the quality meat that they serve. A lot of the KBBQ places I've been to up North are priced the same but for everything that I've mentioned at this place, those places don't touch this one! Excited to come back again in the future!"
11/30/2021,3 star rating,"Kinda disappointed and hate to give 3 stars especially with such a high rated restaurant. I wanted to give it 2 stars, but the meat portions were really good. Also, the quality of the meat was very good. Which is why I'm giving 3 stars.The reason why I wanted to give it 2 stars was the customer service. There was a 2 hour wait, which we understood because it's the BTS concert and so many people are visiting. The people checking us in were super sweet and very welcoming. So, we thought it was smooth sailing. Until we sat down at our table. Our waitress got upset right as we put our meat on the grill. She proceeded to take over the whole time and grabbed the tongs out of my friend's hands. We were kind of flustered and confused based on our previous experiences. And we have been to a lot of AYCE KBQQ spots since our experience was they give us the meat and we cook it ourselves. She kinda was condescending to my husband and friend since she didn't want us to touch anything. We aren't sure if it's a safety hazard and that's why we couldn't cook it ourselves. We honestly thought she was singling us out because she didn't do it to anyone else. But the new group of people that sat next to us. She got really upset with them as well when they did the same thing.Again, I'm not sure if it's a safety or liable thing or that how things are at this particular kbqq spot."
4/1/2021,3 star rating,"So.....mixed feelings about this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good. The meat is plentiful and they are trying to make it work with COVID. However, I felt like there was not a lot of ventilation with the smoke coming from the grill when sitting inside, even with the doors open. The banchan was kind of salty and overseasoned. But overall, did the trick. Price is reasonable at around 38 with tax and tip for dinner. So I grew up going here with my family. I've recommended people to come here for the AYCE. The thing that really holds this place back from me continuing to come back was the abominable service I received with my friends the last night I was here. The waitress was extremely rude and when we asked for more side dishes she responded extremely rudely. And we had an incident where we wanted to add another friend to the party and we asked to speak the manager. However, we were going to comply with their rules of COVID and leave, but she grabbed the utensils out of my friend's hands. It was extremely unprofessional, and I will not be coming back nor recommending this AYCE to my friends and family anymore. Oh, and she kept bumping into us when we were trying to leave and after we paid. Just the cherry on top of the type of service you should expect to receive here. TLDR; okay meat and side dishes. Horrible, horrible service."
11/28/2020,5 star rating,"Yay! Loving the outdoor experience! This overall was a straight 5 stars. To the service, the experience of cooking your own food, the taste, the safety procedures they take to keep everyone safe. My family and I felt they took all the best care of us to make we were all safe. When you are eating and the skillet looks too charred, they come and replace it with a brand new one. The food was super flavor full as well. Loving it ! If you're ever in the area, this is a must try."
2/1/2022,1 star rating,Managment sucks here no one knows what their job is Â here drove 45min twice and they didn't let me eat cuz i was only one person horrible never coming back here
4/22/2022,1 star rating,We were in the neighborhood and craved kkq so we decided to give this place a chance. There was no wait and they seated us right away. But then came the problems. The first problem was they told us we couldn't get the only spicy thing on the menu because the grill would get too dirty too fast. Which I found absurd because in other places they just replace it. Then when the meat came out waitress (who we didn't get her name) put the meat on the grill. We said thanks and we all were flipping the meat then she came back and she flipped the meat for us and then she didn't stop coming to flip the meat for us. This made it very uncomfortable having someone cooking our meat when hello the point of Korean bbq is cooking your own meat. It made it uncomfortable even to continue our convo when she was always there flipping and moving our meat around. The other problem was the limited selection of meat. The price isn't worth the very limited meat they offer. The other problem was They only have one kind of chicken and it was bbq which had no flavor. Unless you don't have another kkq 50 miles from where you live don't come here ! You been warned
2/28/2021,5 star rating,"The waitress worked her *** off. We never even had to ask for something. Very safe. Hand sanitizer on the table outside under a tent. All the sauces, banchan came in individual containers. Loved the pork belly."

9/18/2021,1 star rating,"My boyfriend and I drove 2 hours to try this restaurant. We were really excited and were looking forward to eating here since the reviews and food looked great. When we got here, we paid the $4 for valet. (no parking anywhere) We put our name in and the hostess said it would be a 30 min wait, so we waited. When it was our time to be seated our table was nicely set up. Now our problem here is the customer service. We literally just sat down and the server comes up and asks us ""what do you want"" excuse me??That's not even the worst part, I start naming things off the menu: he ROLLS his eyes at me and moves his hands in a circular motion (basically him telling me to speed it up) Listen, I get that the restaurant is busy, but I just sat down!?? Can you give me a second to look at the menu? I immediately got up. I don't care how good the food is no food is worth getting eyes rolled at from a place you are going to spend your hard working money at. It's okay tho, I went to baekjeong kbbq instead. :)"
5/7/2021,4 star rating,This will always be our go to spot to take family and friends visiting from out of town.The meat is cooked on a stone grill versus the types of grills you usually see at KBBQ restaurants. I personally think it brings out the best flavor.Only negative of course is the price jump.
3/28/2021,5 star rating,"Came here a few days ago after indoor dining is allowed. Upon checking in, they have you come to a screen to check your body temperature (pretty sophisticated) then they will seat your party. We originally chose outdoor but the girl said that its pretty windy out there. Thank God I listened to her. They have limited indoor capacity and they seat people more than 6 feet away from each other. They also have plexiglass barriers in between tables. It definitely made me feel safe dining indoors with my girlfriends. Just a heads up, their menu prices did go up (but its worth it). Its now $33.99 per person. I would still pay that price considering its good. Service is great too. Parking is valet. Be ready to pay $4 upon getting there"
7/28/2018,4 star rating,"Celebrated my birthday dinner here with co workers. First of all, we were a party of 11 and I have been trying to get a reservation with them for a good 2 days. Apparently, they have certain time slots available only. Other than that, you just have to walk in and wait. So we got there at 530pm to have our name on the list. What we didnt know is that we ALL have to be here in order to be seated. They have this rule and strictly comply to that. The guy in charge even does a head count to make sure. Anyway, after an hour and 15mins...we were finally complete and only waited 15 more minutes to be seated. I felt bad for our server who was overwhelmed with our order and demands. The meat quality was good compared to other ayce kbbq out there. The brisket and short ribs that we ordered was very lean. The bulgogi was perfectly marinated. The ban chans (side dishes) were very good too. We couldnt stop eating them. Hahaha. I had a great experience here. It is my first time at hae jan and it wont be my last. In the end, they will make u a kimchi fried rice. But by this time, everyone in your table is already too full to even move or breathe. Service was great too. Cant wait to be back."
2/4/2021,5 star rating,"This is my second time at Hae Jang and it's another amazing visit . Went with a friend of mine, we wanted to have Korean bbq Â and I suggest it.The out door area is so great it's it has clear plastic Barrier and social distancing between each Â tent or seating , which it made it more privet and felt safer .For 27.99 $ dinner time !! all you can eat is the way to go Â .A lot of collection of meat. Beef , spicy , marinated Chicken ,marinated. Pork ,sea food. Â And ur max is three different meat at Â each round Condiment Â : radishes , rice paper ,mash potatoes,sprouts and kimchi with Â few different flavor sauces . I did ordered a bowl of the steam egg Â , never had it before thought to try , and it wasn't Â my thing. I won't suggest it for someone can't handle the eggy steamed egg smell Â , again it's a preference. It Â just didn't care for it. Are waitress was so kind and fun and she was on top of it. She kept coming checking on us, making sure we don't need anything or if we do , she ll be right on it .Very friendly and polite amazing service. The food and the meat quality is amazing. I will say it's a great vibe to have a beer and Cook ur own dinner with friends and get to enjoy the food and the time .Place is clean and staff is Â follow covid protocol it's impressive !!"
4/13/2021,1 star rating,"The waiter's service attitude is very bad, he even turned around and scolded bad words said ""fuk""and Very bad experience. and there food nuclean .so we changed to another restaurant ."
7/7/2021,4 star rating,We were told that there would be an hour's wait time but we were called in within about 30 mins wait. It was just the 2 of us and my first k-bbq experience .Our priority was also not to waste food; so we ordered 2 kinds of meat: beef brisket and the spicy pork belly. Loved both meats and the whole experience of them being cooked in front of you. Esp the spicy pork belly tasted yumm with rice. all sides and sauces were yumm. the rice wrap was a bit tricky to do but was fun. This is an all-you-can-eat buffet and you can make the most of it if you are a big appetite for meat or if you come in with a big gang. so not giving 5 stars just because it was not a value for money ($34 per head) for us.
2/24/2022,5 star rating,Memories. So many good memories. My siblings and I love this place! A must when in LA. People here are super nice and quick. The meat and ban Chans are really good. The best spicy Korean fish cakes. Love the thin pork belly here! This place is always crowded. Come early and maybe on a weekday. Always happy and full here.
3/25/2022,3 star rating,"I was definitely underwhelmed. I went for lunch and there was no wait. I really like how they use stone grills and have someone cook for you but the meat quality is very underwhelming. Quite frankly the meat quality was one of the lowest ones I've had in a while. The brisket was dry and the pork belly was also not that high quality. Also, sometimes there are periods where the server doesn't come frequent enough and the meat gets over cooked. For the price ($34) for lunch, it definitely wasn't worth it for what we got."
1/21/2022,4 star rating,Very reasonably priced for what you get and the banchan is quite good. I'm a fan of the yogurt soju myself and you get a big carafe of it. Love all the pork belly and beef. Didn't try much else as I only have one stomach.
7/11/2021,2 star rating,"I have been coming here since attending college at USC. Since graduating, I have come by maybe four or five times, but not for a couple years since the covid pandemic hit and slowed things down for a while. I can say without hesitation that my most recent visit to HJC has been one of the biggest disappointments for Korean BBQ since moving to and living in Koreatown.Let's start with the price - I recognize that everything is getting more expensive, and almost everywhere has raised their price since moving here. That's not a problem in and of itself, but when it buys you nearly nothing new, waits just as long, or in a shoddy outside area that seems more akin to a $15.99 AYCE place, charging $40 is insulting at best, playing off their fame, name, and high rating to rip you off for average food. Jjukku Jjukku has raised prices, but kept quality consistent - if you stop reading here, do yourself a favor and go there instead.Now let's move to the differentiators. This place used to be famous for using an actual granite stone grill, which they meticulously cleaned with radishes in between servings as to not let the charred meat/ashes stay on the grill, compromising the flavor and cooking quality of the next batch. No longer is that the case - like every $15.99 on 8th street and beyond, they are using a charred metal tray, though it still retains a drip tray to remove excess oil. It's bigger, and cooks more food, but all unevenly for a subpar experience. Their menu is as big or perhaps bigger than before, but no way to tell as they reorganized their menu, and no longer proudly and prominently display it on the wall, replacing it instead of giant LCD screens advertising themselves or showing pictures of the food.Service leaves much to be desired. I suppose it doesn't help that I am not Korean, but we had three Koreans in our group if that was supposed to make any difference. They were curt, came around only from time to time, and did not participate much in the cooking. As before, they did help come by and cut the meat at the appropriate times, but in more than half the instances, they left the meat to be overcooked, too chewy, and overall unenjoyable.When you order something less expensive (e.g. brisket or beef tongue), they will bring it in inordinate quantities to stuff you up. When our group of six ordered brisket and tongue, we'd receive over a pound of each - a giant platter filled with a pyramid the size of a large bowling ball of brisket and tongue. When we ordered the beef belly or spicy pork, they brought out enough meat for maybe a kid's meal. Given you can only order three at a time, even for a group of six (or larger), you're more likely to starve and wait for the pork or other large items to cook. Actually no, guess you won't be starving because that first order of brisket probably still is sitting around waiting to be eaten.Another thing that used to make this place special was their specialty items - spicy pork, which is somewhat rare amongst AYCE areas, beef bulgogi, and kimchi fried rice. They used to cook the spicy pork in aluminum foil so it can properly and evenly cook. Pork, as you probably know, cannot be served when undercooked, and needs time to properly get to the right temperature. It's difficult on a high heat grill to cook it without burning it, especially so now that they don't clean the grill as often as before, compounded by the fact that it is now using a lower quality grilling surface than before. If you order pork, prepare to risk being sick, or eating burnt food. Both the bulgogi and pork are not cooked using the foil any longer, and their juices will spill over and contaminate whatever else you have on the grill, which they will pile onto and stack for the sake of expediency.Their kimchi fried rice used to be a great way to end the meal, and was a highlight of this place. Now, toward the end of your meal, they'll toss the ingredients as your other food is still cooking, spread it out, then leave you to it without adjusting the heat or preparing it further. The end result is a sticky, charred mess on your grill that is hard to pull off and serve. There's not much in the dish now aside from the kimchi, rice, and some nori. They seem to have really cut back on this offering, and it's frankly just sad. Once they serve that, they pass you the check, and say there's no rush but come by every 10 minutes or so to ask if you can pay so they can close outThere's plenty of good options when you move the price needle to $40. If you're looking for a tons of meat, great experience and excellent food too, go to M Grill close by. It's not Korean BBQ, but easily one of the best steak/red meat experiences in Los Angeles. If you want AYCE KBBQ, go to Jjukku Jjukku. The wait is about the same, but it's less expensive with far better options and better quality meat. If you don't want AYCE, you have plenty of great options, ranging from Parks, Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, or Woo Hyang Woo."
9/27/2021,5 star rating,"One of my favorite spots for KBBQ. The quality of the meat is much better than the majority of other kbbq spots. There's usually always a long wait, old school style where you sign your name and have to hang near by or set a timer, go chief it and hurry back. I don't recommend ever ! getting chicken at any KBBQ I've tried it several times and it's just not meant to be. It's tough not seasoned correctly, and just plain wrong. I believe the shrimp came wrapped with the tail which is weird, only ordered those once so don't quote me on that ! Stick to the red meats especially bulgogi and brisket it's lit.Customer service is mostly spot on, they tend to help each other and work as a team. I've had a couple girls try to catch an attitude or be rude to my brother but I Â gave her a ""who are you talking to type of face "" and they usually come back down to earth. Lol  Overall a really great spot and there's Valet which is always a plus.  It's one of the pricier ones but worth it. (Went up to 40$) If you're on a budget Moon BBQ on Western gets the job done.If the wait here is too long the fried chicken at Kyochon in the same plaza is fiirreeeee"
4/1/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly probably one of the best KBBQ I've ever had (and I've had many). Although we waited a little over an hour for be seated, it was definitely worth it. The meat quality is great, and yeah it is $33 or $34ish for AYCE which is higher than other places I normally go to, but I think the price is worth the quality of meat and the quick service. We had Brendan as our server, and although he didn't really show much personality or talk to us, he was always on it about getting us what we needed and remembered literally everything. Great service in my opinion regardless of the lack of friendliness, lol. The brisket, bulgolgi, spicy Canadian pork belly, and marinated pork ribs were SO good. I'll definitely be back! Thank god for outdoor dining right now too considering it was such a beautiful Spring weeknight in LA."
7/25/2021,5 star rating,"The price may be high, but the quality of the food justifies it!I ordered brisket, thin pork belly (they also have thick pork belly), unmarinated short rib (boneless, they also have a marinated option), mushrooms (they were sliced king oyster mushrooms) all of which were really tasty & had good texture. This was the only kbbq place ive been that had mushrooms!Their sides include rice & radish paper, bean sprout & radish & cabbage kimchi, spicy fish cakes, and potato salad. Their cabbage kimchi was super sour & the potato salad was really creamy but the other sides were really good!Definitely will be coming back here in the future!"
11/26/2021,5 star rating,"Our ayce destination every time in LA K Town. Fresh meat that is served up quick by staff who also cook and cut it up for you. Oh yes, it's still cooked on your table and if you really want to cook it, of course you can. But I prefer to let the experts handle it. The kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal is a must. It takes all the flavors that was cooking on the stone plate and mixed it in with fresh kimchi."
1/3/2022,2 star rating,"I've been coming here for a few years for k-bbq. Its pretty good for its price. Unfortunately today I had a terrible experience. We ordered the brisket+short rib. We cooked it ourselves like per usual since the waiters are always busy. Upon putting down the short rib and noticed a pretty nasty sour smell. At this moment I didn't think nothing of it I figured maybe it was one of the sides or something in the air but after it cooked it still had a funky smell. I tried it and sure enough I was eating ROTTEN MEAT. I immediately spit it out. To make sure I wasn't crazy I had my bf smell it and try it and he was disgusted as well. I never ever had this issue out of all the times I've gone. I quickly mentioned this to one of the workers and he said it was no problem that we didn't have to eat it, but he never offered to bring out a new plate of it. Instead, he proceeded to put the kimchi fried rice down which is only done once you're done ordering meat, after this is cooked you can no longer cook/order meat. I was kind of bummed how they handed the situation but I figured id speak to the manager and maybe he'll correct the bill.When he brought the check I explained to him how the meat had a bad taste and smell and he basically said that can't be true because they order it fresh daily (LIES). So he was saying I was lying lol, me the customer. Most people know what bad meat smells like: sour, rotteneggs, ammonia kind of smell. This meat fit exactly that description. He didn't offer any sort of discount off the bill instead charged us in full.You may not have this experience I never did before this but just know if you ever do the manager does not care to accommodate anyone for mistakes on their behalf.Two stars because : -the service sucks you'll find yourself having to cook the meat yourself- meat quality is eh-kimchi stew isn't good they put glass noodles and chopped hotdogs in it-the meat IS NOT fresh daily, especially not the short rib they marinate short rib for 24 hours minimum so thats a lie, and the brisket and most other meats come out semi frozen-the wait are ridiculous and they prioritize certain groups.I definitely won't be coming back after this experience"
2/15/2022,4 star rating,"This place is always solid and consistent, I love their meat choices.. although I do think sometimes they try to rush you. I totally understand tho, they are busy and trying to keep it moving. I'll be back for sure! It's definitely for the Meat-tatarian in your life."
3/19/2022,5 star rating,I have eaten here and the Food and Service was excellent the waiters were very friendly and they cleaned your table right away with out you having to call them over I would recommend this Restaurant to all my friends and family as the Food and Service is excellent.

12/28/2021,1 star rating,long wait beware!!!!!this place has a list goingbut claims depending how big your party is ..is where/when they'll seat you. is this not first come first serve? what is the purpose of the list??why are you seating people that came after me ???? i hate coming here they always let people cut first come first servewhy make the dang list???????wendy makes no sense!!!!
7/16/2021,3 star rating,"Service and food was as good as you'd expect, but this place cost too much for the quality of the restaurant itself. I applaud their ability to thrive through covid, but I honestly don't see how or why any of the food or service I received was over 115 dollars for 2 people. Had they cooked the meat themselves I can possibly understand, but they don't. We seriously didn't order that much food. And during the tail end of covid (when I went), they were still serving food in disposable dishes and barely even had napkins. In any case. I honestly don't see a reason to return. I've gone to other buffet type asian cuisine places that have similar items that are far cheaper per person and even offer a service for all the food to be cooked for you. I don't understand the infatuation of self cooked food either, it's not better, it's not healthier, and apparently not any cheaper. The waitress and the menu's didn't even have suggestions or guidelines on how long we should cook the meat, leading to a possiblity of burning and wasting meat and other items. Not to mention some of the tables are terribly small and the grill plate takes up a substantial amount of table real estate. The burner is so close, it will absolutely destroy your clothes with popping hot oil and get oil all over whatever is around you.DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF LEAVING YOUR PERSONAL ITEMS SITTING OUT ON THE TABLE, THEY WILL BE COVERED IN HOT BURNING PIG FAT.Apart from these complaints, all the meat we didn't burn was actually really well seasoned and the veggies and side dishes were all really good. So there is a lot of positive takeaway from this experience.With that saidThis isn't a ""do not recommend"" review. Just a notice that this is more of a ""one and done"" place for me."
12/27/2020,5 star rating,"It's sad how much this pandemic affected restaurants. My boyfriend and I try to order locally and support small businesses.With that being said, Hae Jang Chon has been our favorite kbbq spot for the last 6 years. My boyfriend and I use to go here at least twice a month... Unfortunately with the pandemic they've been closed. They did open up a couple of times but they were too late, and things would close a week or two after them opening up.They have offered a to-go menu which I forgot to take a picture of! But they have about 6-8 option of bento box. Everything cost $16.00. What you get is a container of rice, a container of sides and container of meat. They offer the sauces & they are kind enough to switch out the sides of your choice.It's was a good amount of food for $16 and i'm pleasantly surprised! Of course it doesn't replace cooking it yourself but a great alternative. We ordered the brisket (left) & bulgogi (right). The wings are from another restaurant haha."
5/13/2022,5 star rating,If you're in Korea town this is a must! Â The chicken wings were so crispy and delicious. This is going to be the spot for wings whenever I'm back in Los Ãngeles.
7/31/2021,5 star rating,"This place is my favorite kbbq spot to go to when I visit LA, and I lived in La for about 3 years so I've tried a lot of places. It can get really crowded so I highly recommend having a reservation (call in we had a party of 13 so they're pretty accommodating), but if your party is late you'll get cancelled! The beef belly, brisket, beef tongue, and short ribs are the best! The bon chon is also amazing. The staff is actually pretty attentive for an ayce place and they honestly cooked half the time for us! This is a must go place for me!"
5/12/2022,4 star rating,Always been our favorite. We never miss going to this place whenever we visit LA. It's just kinda pricey.
5/12/2022,1 star rating,False advertisement on their part. They will not even seat you unless you are willing to pay for two people.
12/4/2021,5 star rating,"Great food, very consistent and good service. We enjoy coming here every time. There can be a 45-1 hr wait so go on the earlier side of dinner or later. Weekdays I would imagine to be good, as weekends will be packed. Plan an hour wait time!"
3/8/2022,4 star rating,The service is great. Food is great. And price is just right. Im glad they have valet
5/10/2022,5 star rating,"Good place to eat, the food was of good quality had no complaints. The service was great and very friendly."
12/31/2021,5 star rating,"One of the top kbbq places I've been to in my life! I loved the quality of the meat and the attentiveness of the servers. They are always on top of things, getting new meats, cooking and cutting the meats for us, and like another reviewer said they set out the rice paper for you ahead of time! The side dishes here are also great but you do need to be able to tolerate spice! They're way spicier than the other Korean bbq places I've been to. Also, there is valet parking for $4, be sure to get there early because it does run out! While I was leaving I saw people being turned away from the parking lot and felt sad because I'd have no idea where else to park in that busy neighborhood! I highly recommend the beef tongue and the bbq squid. Once you have beef tongue I feel like you won't ever need brisket ever again! Additionally, they have every dipping sauce already set up for you to enjoy! Overall, a great experience and worth the premium price and wait!"
5/8/2022,4 star rating,"Nice atmosphere. The food was great. The wait wasn't too long. Watch out for the grill, you might get sting from the excessive oil."
2/24/2021,4 star rating,One of the more popular AYCE KBBQ in LA. The signature round grill was unique. The cons are the typical long wait time and the lack of greens/veggies options
12/30/2021,5 star rating,My go to AYCE KBBQ! This place is always busy but they run like a well oiled machine. I love their side and meat selection. Heads up you MUST have your full party to be seated and I would recommend grabbing a craft beer at Nandarang next door if there's a long wait.
2/23/2022,5 star rating,Wow! The most amazing KBBQ. Jaw dropping great! We honestly can wait to go back for another round. Very reasonably priced for the quality and quantities of food you get. Staff was so incredibly friendly!
7/3/2021,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is my favorite ayce bbq restaurant for so many years. I haven't had a chance to visit until today and lots of things have changed! Price went UP! I was shocked. I arrived at 5pm and waited about 40 mins for a table. They have both dine-in and tents outside. There was a miscommunication tonight. You put your name down and from time to time, a host will call out names to make sure your party is here and ready. By the time they called my name, the host told my party that our table is ready and to wait next to a bench because a server will come get us. After waiting a while we went to speak with the host and they said no and that the host was just trying to check if we are ready as a party and our table isn't ready. We went back and forth and basically the host led me to believe that my table was ready but in fact they were just checking names. So just be careful and ask what they meant. Within 10 minutes we got seated inside. The service was great and they occasionally cook for you. I also ordered kimchi fried rice with mozzarella cheese after the meal. It was a bit bland to eat by itself. I'm glad I had some meat and soup on the side to eat along with kimchi fried rice. I had a good time but $39.99 per person for dinner is a bit much although I enjoy the food. Valet parking available for $4.00 in the plaza."
7/1/2021,2 star rating,"Finally ate here - after seeing the long lines for years, and I have no idea what the shouting is about. Bulgogi was above average, and that's about it; the beef belly was poor; the tongue nondescript; there was next to no banchan on offer; the prices were the same as any other AYCE; the kimchi pancake was tasteless; and the service was curt and rushed - even at an hour when it wasn't packed, they kept coming by to dump all of your meat on the superhot plate, and moving it to the middle, whether you liked it or not, to get you out of there with maximum efficiency."
11/9/2020,5 star rating,"27.99 for Lunch AYCE29.99 for Dinner AYCELEGIT because there aren't any levels like at some other places... for the full price you pay, you can get whatever protein/meat you want! I recently tried for the first time: beef rib fingers, and they were delicious. Tried and true must-haves: beef tongue, pork belly (the OG), brisket, short-rib!They're covid friendly right now with outdoor seating under tents. We went on a particularly windy afternoon... so I would advise against that... but the staff did everything they could like putting up plexiglass to try to stop the wind. Great Kbbq go to."
4/29/2022,5 star rating,So good for all you can eat the meat quality is phenomenal. The servers are top notch I definitely recommend you try this place if your in Koreatown and want to make sure you eat at one of the best AYCE.
6/3/2021,5 star rating,Best Korean bbq place in town. I would definitely come back over and over again! However the wait time is long because it's so popular!
2/11/2021,5 star rating,"The best AYCE kbbq in LA. Prices are great, food is always amazing and never changes, all of their ban chan are amazing. Came and dined in the outdoor dining area and I felt safe and I love that they have plexiglass between each table. I didn't mind that we were eating off paper plates and styrofoam cups...felt a little safer/cleaner than reusable serve ware at the current moment."
8/22/2021,3 star rating,"We used to love Hae Jang Chon. Their side dishes are delicious. However their price has gone up, their selection is limited and their quality of meat is average.We dined at this place on a hot day and there were only 3 portable commercial AC running. However, the thermostat still showed 86F inside the restaurant. We felt like a torture eating bbq in a hot sauna. We appreciate their effort to cope with the pandemic. However, we would not dine here during hot days. We'd support the business by ordering togo and not dine in as it's uncomfortable to enjoy the meal in that condition."
2/4/2022,1 star rating,Yeah no don't go here. My boyfriend and I paid $100 just to get food poisoning and extremely rushed service. I had a Lakers game to attend right after eating here and unfortunately got a really high fever and chills throughout the event because of the crappy food. My boyfriend threw up and felt nauseous the whole night.
6/1/2021,3 star rating,"We were informed the wait time would be 2.5 hours but we actually got in less than an hour. Ordered beef brisket, unmarrinated short ribs, prime steak, beef tongue, thick cut pork belly and small octopus. The meat portion they gave to two people's table is huge. I wish they could consider how many people the table have and adjust the portion accordingly. Regarding the meat quality, beef brisket and prime steak was great. But short ribs are so hard. Short ribs, beef tongue, pork belly(very fat) and small octopus have no flavor, doesn't taste very fresh. The waitress was cooking in a hurry with high heat. Kimchee was old and tasted sour. Kimchee fried rice was good. In my opinion, this place is not worth more than 30 mins wait. It is just an average all you can eat place, so don't expect the meat quality can be as good as any non all you can eat place. Especially the price has raised to $33 per person. It might be more suitable for a large group of guys just looking to fill their belly with not so good quality of meat. So if you see the wait is incredibly long, go somewhere else, and you are not missing out anything."
11/14/2020,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is my absolute favorite Korean BBQ restaurant!! They have such tasty sides, and amazing, high quality meat. I haven't been able to go all year because of the pandemic, but I heard they were taking good precautions after their recent reopening, so I decided to go during lunch yesterday.I was actually very impressed with their transition to outdoor dining and their safety precautions! (I typically prefer not to dine in these days because of pandemic, but Hae Jang Chon was great.) When we got there around 12pm, they were doing a lot of sanitizing, and they immediately performed a temperature check! All employees are wearing masks, as well as face guards and gloves. There was no one there and we immediately got seated -- seating is in the parking lot under red tents. All tables are a good distance apart (there are also 6 seats per table, even if your party doesn't need all seats) and there are plexiglass barriers between each table. They transitioned to using disposable plates/utensils/cups and portable grills. They are also using online menus that you can view from your phone!The food is still the best kbbq I have ever had -- brisket, thick pork belly, and angus steak are great go-to meats. They aren't using their usual grills but that didn't affect the meat or how it was cooked! Also, finishing your meal off with kimchi fried rice with melted mozzarella is the best way to go!! Our bellies were so happy after lunch. I recommend this restaurant to everyone! It's a little pricier for AYCE ($28-30 for lunch/dinner) but totally worth every penny. Food is amazing, service is excellent, and they are being pretty safe during these times!"
5/24/2021,1 star rating,"Awful awful customer service!! Absolutely disgusting Came here almost an hour an a half before they closed, only had a few people waiting and the young guy goes ""we probably won't be able to seat you"" Change the business hour then... his attitude was gross and super uninviting"
9/7/2021,4 star rating,This place deserves Â 4 1/2 stars. Everything was great except they had run out of rice wrap- which is my favorite. I probably would've left had I known.
9/7/2021,5 star rating,"Me and my friends went during labor day weekend around 6pm. I think we were blessed since we didn't have to wait around too long. The service was good -- whenever we had a request, everything was brought out to us swiftly and promptly. Our favorite meat was the thinly sliced pork belly! We loved eating it with sides. This place never disappoints. :)"
9/5/2021,2 star rating,"Terrible service, bad experience with the service. Our waitress is with attitude and so disrespectful. She always ignored us and never responded. They charged 18% gratuity, but provide bad service in return. The food is just mediocre. $40/ person is not worth it. I recommend Shik Do Rak Korean BBQ in Irvine. It is a lot cheaper with good food and excellent service. Please never use Covid pandemic as an excuse for a bad service."
9/4/2021,5 star rating,"So so good. I would definitely recommend the pho. The service was also really good. If I didn't live in LA, I would be back all the time."
9/4/2021,5 star rating,"Great food and even better service. Our server Jun was attentive, friendly, and always executed everything perfectly. Model employee. I would hire him in a minute. There are tons of kbbq places in LA and we would come back not only for the great quality food, but for the attentive and positive service!"
9/3/2021,3 star rating,"Second run here today. Service was amazing but everything else leaves alot to be desired. Having tried so many Kbbq joints in LA can't seem to understand how this spot gets so much foot traffic. Perhaps it's because it's all you can eat? Short rib marinated was very mediocore & unmarinated was a complete miss. Pretty solid pork belly & brisket. Much better options such as Genwa, Soowon Galbi, Road to Seoul, Bulgogi Hut.."
7/22/2021,4 star rating,"Everything was fairly tasty as far as Kbbq was concerned. Went early for lunch so avoided the long lines. After getting to try this place & being able to finally compare it with so many KBBQ spots I've visited out here in LA, it is safe to say I can't reason waiting 2 hours in the evenings to have it. Standout for me was surprisingly the beef belly."
9/2/2021,5 star rating,My co worker asked if I was hungry for KBBQ after work and he suggested this place. Â  We got sat pretty quickly and the meats started to come out fast! Â Marvin our server was awesome. Â What ever we needed he got it for us and checked on us when it was appropriate! Â Definitely coming back!!!
9/1/2021,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is definitely one of my favorite KBBQ spots in LA County. Their AYCE dinner menu starts at $40 and includes several amazing protein options. All of their proteins are delicious/high-quality and their sides are fire! Their side sauces are bomb as well - there is one with a garlic clove in it that is AMAZING (not sure what it is, but I always dump this on my rice). We ordered the brisket and beef belly - LA FLAME. You know a spot is good when their brisket is amazing, since this is basically every KBBQ's protein baseline. Your server will serve the meat and cook it for you, which isn't that common for AYCE, but hey - less work for me. At the end of the meal you have the option of ordering their kimchi fried rice - DO IT, and opt in for the mozzarella cheese because it is a beautiful, beautiful thing. I'm usually stuffed at this point and a little heartbroken that you can't take the leftover kimchi fried rice home, but it's fine (that's the greedy fat girl in me speaking)."
8/31/2021,3 star rating,"It's just okay and extremely expensive. Stay away from the all-you-can-eat KBBQ locations, it's just not worth it. You'll be paying for food you will never eat and the quality isn't there."
8/28/2021,5 star rating,"Great value for excellent all-you-can-eat meat cuts, an assortment of sides and sauces, and fun atmosphere!We had been wanting to try authentic KBBQ, and had a good friend recommend this place and can confidently say it delivered in all aspects. They do not take reservations for parties less than 6, and knowing there were 2 of us we arrived at around 4:30pm on a Saturday. We waited only a moment for our table indoors to be cleaned and we were seated. There's abundant indoor and outdoor seating, and even when we left around 5:30 there were plenty of tables open (though bustling nonetheless!)We used the valet to park to avoid the headache of finding a street spot. It's only $4 and you can get it situated right when you pull into the strip mall with the restaurant. Have nothing but positive reviews of the food, beer, and atmosphere! The main windows and front section are open, so even if you're seated ""indoors,"" there's plenty of open air and ventilation. Our meat choices were beef brisket, BBQ beef bulgogi, and the spicy pork belly cuts. They were all incredibly juicy, tasty, and we're looking forward to more in our near future."
1/9/2022,1 star rating,Normally when i goto this place i eat their all you can eat bbq which is a 4 star but went to this place twice for lunch and tried ordering their non ayce bbq menu items and what a mistake. Â So ordered some bibimbap day 1 and second time for lunch ordered a single portion bbq beef plate the kitchen cooks and not the ayce and both were total ripoffs. Â The bibimbap rice and vegetables looked and tasted like came from some grocery store packed deli item..dried rice and bland vegetables and barely any meat. Â The bbq beef plate the meat was brunt and dried up piece of leather and overly salty...looked like they just gave the leftover burnt scrap from when they were cleaning the fying pans from other customer's Â tables. Â And totai bill for both tines added up to $40. Â What a waste of money. Â Lesson...dont order amything here other then ayce. Â Haha
12/28/2021,5 star rating,The best Korean bbq in the valley ! We eat here at least once a month . Always good quality meat
4/14/2021,3 star rating,"I would give it 5 stars for the food alone; however, just like most of the bad reviews/stars are for that blame goes to the host who works in the late afternoon/evenings. I don't know if this guy has a napoleon complex, but the guy needs to relax. I noticed that he has an attitude or mood swings every single time we come here. I saw him personally yelling at people and ordering people where to stand and curse out LOUD. I know it's minimum wage, but can you at least be a little bit professional? Or if you're that miserable there or stressed taking people to their tables, work somewhere else! It's not healthy for you or your mental state for you to be that angry all the time. You're the host, the face of the restaurant so check yourself at the door. Your attitude and eye rolls doesn't suit you at all. If you ever do that to me I will curse you out both in English and Korean like a little kid you are. LOL. Â I'm surprised none of your nunas or hyungs smacked you to get some manners. Overall go for the food and the waiters/waitresses. They're all friendly and work fast."
3/30/2022,5 star rating,"It's time I write a review for this place. I've been coming here for 10 years now with my friends and family. Their food is Amazinnggggg! Always fresh, great quality meat, and a friendly staff. The only downside is the wait time. It's usually over an hour and a half wait but it's the same for all other KBBQ places nearby. I'd highly recommend to anyone wanting high quality KBBQ!"
8/28/2021,3 star rating,"The grills are terrible and fhe meat is bland and seemed frozen. Generous with extra sauces or side dishes. Fast service.Only 2 bathrooms. Don't believe yelp wait times. If it says no wait, expect to arrive to over an hour wait."
4/3/2022,4 star rating,"All you can eat kbbq, with good meat quality. Been going there for years before COVID and now that it's open we always come here when we are in the LA area. Like always there has always been a long wait to get seated but all members must be present at the time you are called or they will skip you and the wait becomes longer. Other than that this place has always been my favorite."
1/18/2022,2 star rating,"Good food but very pricey. Â The services, was strange, the wait staff seated us but didn't even bother to ask if we've ever been there. Â They proceeded to take your orders but forgot about our drinks, didn't asked if we needed rice or not, and didn't ask if we needed anything else. Â Overall too pricey and service was disappointing."
3/1/2022,4 star rating,"Food is delicious! It felt a little rushed for the price (6 people came to about $330 with only non-alcoholic drinks) and they could add more types of kimchi but overall, the meal was a hit. Â The kids liked the brisket the best."
3/6/2020,3 star rating,"Honestly I'm not even sure what the hype is about. I mean it's good but I've definitely had better. The selection of meats is rather limited as compared to other places and the staff isn't quite as attentive. Try picking up your tongs and they'll insist on cooking the meats for you which is nice until they forget about your table as they walk past it time and time again. I would have looked past this but the place wasn't even busy yet!Parking is $3 and valet only. If you do decide to come here, I recommend the marinated beef bulgogi and the marinated rib fingers-- enjoy!"
10/8/2021,5 star rating,The best kbbq hands down. There's a lot of choices which I appreciate and the servers met our needs. Would recommend this place 100%
4/8/2022,4 star rating,Staff omggg was on point..I love how they cook the food for you..I mean they were on point..qualitÃ  of meat is alot better than most AYCE korean bbq places..cost about 116.00-125.00 for 2 people..waited 1 1/2 so get there when they open or be prepared to wait..definitely will go back
11/17/2021,1 star rating,"Don't come here before closing. Came here at 9;30pm, they told us it might be 10:30 until we get seated. Even though they close at 11, they would still charge us dinner price when we would only get 30 minutes to eat. Fucking ridiculous"
7/23/2021,4 star rating,"Excellent staff, attentive and friendly. The meat choices are fresh and worth the price. The restaurant is very clean. I've been coming here for years and the quality is still the same. You may think that their pricing is little high compared to other places but rest assured it is all worth it. Thanks guys, see you soon"
10/15/2021,5 star rating,"Parking may be hard to find and wait time may be long , depending on when you go. Great service- different from usual kbbq places, as they also help us cook the meat, which is really helpful since my friends and I are not the best at it. We were served by Sarah and she was very quick and got us everything we needed! Honestly since the service was good, we were able to get all our food and leave in a timely manner In terms of the quality of meat, it is SUPER GOOD. The brisket is not fatty like Gen's and you can really just taste it. Their meats are not marinated with hella sugary sauces so you can enjoy it with the sauces. I highly recommend ordering their beef selection. I tried the thinly sliced pork belly but I like their beef better."
2/18/2020,5 star rating,"Long wait not going to sugar coat it but it is so worth the wait! $27.99 before tax for dinner all you can eat (2 hour window). Kimchi fried rice with cheese or without at the end when you're done with ordering meat. Valet parking or street parking and there's not a lot of space for waiting but it's worth it. Go during lunch or weekday instead of weekend if waiting long period is not your thing. I went on Tuesday night and waited 50+ minutes for two people but again, been back every single time we're in LA and I visit on a yearly basis. Been to many kbbq place in LA, Ktown and down south more but this place is legit the best because what more than stone grill charred meat can you ask for?Yes I have waited for 2+ hours for a group of 10 and some felt the meat quality can be better and some felt the wait made it worse. I personally thought all their meat quality stayed true each time they came out, not once was more thawed or more freshly frozen cut than others. The wait I expected because that many people eating with a 2 hour limit that your mouths aren't moving only to eat but to also talk, sure that'll take up a few tables more than 2 hours when there's multiple large groups waiting. Â Shouldn't go with an expectation that this is THE last place to dine for kbbq before you die, but if you want good service, top quality meat that is consistent in texture and cut and taste fresh and stone grill for cooking? Then yeh, this place is it. Top quality meat. Servers consistently check in on you to bring you banchan (side dishes) and for me in particular I ask for radish wrap, kimchi and salads. So yeah don't eat too much rice during the bbq wait until they ask if you're done with ordering meat. Then do the kimchi fried rice with cheese at the end. so bombbbbb just make sure if you're lactose Intolerant that you take some medication first."
2/18/2020,3 star rating,"My friends and I (party of 7) decided to hit up HJC for dinner on a Saturday night. We stopped by the restaurant to put our names down around 6pm, and it took over 2 hours to get in. Thankfully we weren't too hungry at the time, otherwise I doubt I would have been willing to brave the wait.To be honest the meat here isn't really anything spectacular. We ordered brisket, beef tongue, beef belly, galbi, pork belly, and bulgogi (and some other meats that I forgot lol) and I only really enjoyed the brisket and beef belly. The galbi and bulgogi both turned out p soggy which was disappointing :(For sides, I got to try the miso soup, steamed egg, and korean pancake. I wasn't too impressed by any of them either; they didn't taste any better than what you could get at any other Korean BBQ place with a fraction of the wait.The service here is great, and they cook the meat for you here as well. It's quite lively inside and they had EDM blaring from the speakers during our visit. Honestly, having tried a lot of AYCE KBBQ places, Hae Jang Chon didn't really impress me, ESPECIALLY with the crazy wait. I've had the same or better quality AYCE meat at different places in both NorCal and SoCal without the 2+ hour line.My advice is if you're intrigued by the hype and don't mind an unreasonable wait, then go ahead and check HJC out, but don't have your expectations super high. But if you're looking for actually good food (and not looking to waste half an evening waiting) then go somewhere else -- there are so many other great Korean options in ktown that are better worth your time."

2/27/2021,5 star rating,"...Christ on a stick!!! That was long wait but f*ck me silly and call me sally, THAT WAS WORTH THE THREE HOUR WAIT!!!! Kevin and Jun we're on it like cheese on the fried rice. The wait was honestly dreadful but the food and service really made up for waiting three hours...But put on your happy face cause you in for a damn TREAT with this food. I'm not gonna lie I almost went to a different KBBQ since they didn't have cheese corn on the menu but if I knew that Kev and Jun would serve me all their meat like male strippers, I wouldn't have dared to reconsider. 5/5"

10/25/2021,5 star rating,"Love this place!! The staff is super friendly and the ambiance is warm and welcoming. They cook your meat for you (which I like!) and their sides are really tasty. I think a member of staff overheard me commenting about how much I like rice paper with my KBBQ, and shortly brought over a huge plate of them without waiting for me to ask for more. It was so kind and considerate for them to do so!!! Their meat is flavorful and their ayce prices are so reasonable for the service and quality of the food. Will definitely be returning!"
7/27/2021,1 star rating,"Another Korean BBQ, another discriminatory policy. This establishment REFUSES SERVICE to single customers. HOW IS THIS EVEN LEGAL??? The fact that you would descriminate against a customer because their party isn't ""large enough"" is absolutely disgusting and a stain on your reputation. Would give 0 stars if possible. I'm absolutely disgusted."
7/25/2021,4 star rating,"Meats were tasty, rice paper was awesome too. This place didn't disappoint, being from San Diego, I've only got two KBBQ places to choose from(my personal favorites that is), I figured I'd get a legit kbbq experience while in K-Town. Service was great, waiters help you cook your meat, white rice was super good too."
7/25/2021,4 star rating,Great service and good food! Â Our server's been Â helpful on grilling the food! Â Highly recommend this restaurant!!
7/25/2021,5 star rating,"The price may be high, but the quality of the food justifies it!I ordered brisket, thin pork belly (they also have thick pork belly), unmarinated short rib (boneless, they also have a marinated option), mushrooms (they were sliced king oyster mushrooms) all of which were really tasty & had good texture. This was the only kbbq place ive been that had mushrooms!Their sides include rice & radish paper, bean sprout & radish & cabbage kimchi, spicy fish cakes, and potato salad. Their cabbage kimchi was super sour & the potato salad was really creamy but the other sides were really good!Definitely will be coming back here in the future!"

7/23/2021,3 star rating,"This is something that needs to be addressed to Hae Jong Chong Management.I'm only giving it a 3 because I feel like this place is pre-seating based on your race or if you don't look good or something like that...Came there last month. Our group was called. Everyone in the group got seated, we were the only ones left and no one was behind us. There were three tables that were open, two outside, one big one enough to sit 5 people right there by the entrance. Â To our dismay, those seats were all of a sudden filled up. I don't know where these people came from. Â There was no other group behind us. Then the table good enough for 5 was taken by two Korean guys..Talk about serving your own people first. We still waited another 25 minutes. They were waiting for a table in the back to be cleared for us. It was a crappy table where you could not even fit into. Â Is this some kind of prejudism. We looked more than descent. We were not Korean or White. Is that why? By the way we are Filipino, very descent humble good people. Â Are we a product only because people are jealous of us, is it racism? The people sitting at that table too prior to us were latino. After we got seated, the tables around us were filled with Latino's. Â Is this Systematic Racism...This is happening in alot of Korean Restaurants...They don't like Tanned or dark people. If any one is reading this, stand up for the cause against systematic racism in any eating establishment, especially Korean places. This happened to us to at Korean Bar B Q on Western. Â Food is good, but when you feel like you've been stepped on, the food all of a sudden doesn't taste good.Since then, we don't go to any Korean restaurants anymore. Never happens anywhere else, only Korean places."
7/23/2021,4 star rating,"Excellent staff, attentive and friendly. The meat choices are fresh and worth the price. The restaurant is very clean. I've been coming here for years and the quality is still the same. You may think that their pricing is little high compared to other places but rest assured it is all worth it. Thanks guys, see you soon"

12/24/2018,5 star rating,"This place slaps quite hard. Definitely the best Korean bbq I've ever had. Service was fantastic too, especially for a place as busy as this one was. 100% worth the hour and a half wait. Also, we saw Samuel L. Jackson in the parking lot so that was lit. I would give this place 6/5 stars if I could."
7/21/2021,5 star rating,"We went here for my boyfriends birthday and got the special that feeds 3-4. It was so much food but we have no regrets. Shout out to the lady that helped us with the meats, she's a chef foreal."
7/18/2021,4 star rating,The service and food was amazing. Great selection of meats. I would have liked to have been able to cook our own meat instead of the server cooking it for us. Also the table was so small there was just not enough room for everything. My drink got hot because it was so close to the grill.
11/27/2019,5 star rating,"The best kbbq joint that I've been too despite the horrible parking and long wait times. As u can tell this place is high in demand so plan ur time accordingly. If u ballin, highly suggest valet as its almost impossible to find parking. We parked in a nearby parking structure and it smelled like rotting fish! Reservations can only be made in person so once u do take time to browse around, maybe get some boba for the long wait.With all that being said once u get in its all coasting from there. U are greeted quickly and pre-set essentials are ready for you to nibble on, kimchi, tofu, greens, beans sprouts apple mash potatoes and assorted dipping sauces for the meats. My girlfriend and I ordered the brisket, octopus and ribeye cuts for the grill. So delicious especially with the dippings sauces and thin rice wraps! Service was quick despite the always busy crowd and we were able to complete our dinner within an hour's time!Though its a long wait as I mentioned, it makes part of the adventure. Highly recommend it!"
5/25/2021,2 star rating,"Honestly, this place used to be the spot. The food was great and is still great. However, the service has gone down hill. The host gentlemen (I don't know his name) but he was pretty rude. Also, they got more stingy with their seating policies. Previously as long as you got seated, you would be able to order an adequate amount of meat, seeing as it is all you can eat. Now, they told us usually close that the weight was two hours, and last call was in two hours. That means that after the ridiculously long wait, you would get one order as soon as you got seated and that would be it. Most restaurants would not be this greedy. They would close seating at an acceptable time to guarantee that people were able to order.Also, they still don't seat more than 6 people, even though LA county allows for more than that outdoors. Check out Yerim for an alternative. Similar food, but way better service."
12/20/2019,5 star rating,"My first KBBQ experience and in LA what more could I want? This place was amazing!!! I went here from a recommendation from a friend. I choose this place because the servers here help you cook and I thought that would be helpful for my first time. We came on a Monday night, there was a line outside but for a table of two we got in right away. We also lucked out on street parking and at that time it stopped metering.When we were sat the whole table was set up with all the side dishes and everything. Which I thought was a great touch rather than sitting down and servers coming and placing a million dishes around you as you get settled into your seat. Loved that they had the rice wraps and radish wraps there already.Our server Jake was awesome! He asked if we wanted steamed egg right away. He would literally put down the meat and then ask if we wanted more meat lol. My boyfriend and I would be like uhhh we will wait. After each round, they take a lot of care in cleaning the grill for the next which is appreciated. I am not sure how their system works with flipping the meat but different people would come around and flip it as well. A downside is that I would not really know when the meat was ready to be eaten unless I asked.The quality of the meats were amazing. I was amazed when they put an entire steak down on the grill. Like WOW! Our favorite was the marinated short rib and I wish we got it sooner in our meal because towards the end we were so stuffed we couldn't enjoy it as much.Also a big fan of their sauces they had chili paste, soy bean paste, sesame oil and then I think some kind of vinegar?At the end they make you kim chi fried rice but we were way too stuffed to even think about more food so we opted out. We got the pomegranate soju which was BOMB.I would definitely come here if it's your first time at KBBQ, it was such a pleasant and fun experience and took the load off of you to be cooking the whole time if you haven't been before. They don't skimp on the meat and keep it coming the whole time and of course it was so delicious!!!Can't wait to come back to LA to come here!!"
12/5/2021,1 star rating,"We waited 2 1/2-3 hours and it was not worth the $40 AYCE at all! We should've left when the valet warned us or told us to eat at the bbq next door that's just as good but we were here for only 1 night and wanted to know why there were 5,000 reviews here. If you want quality Korean bbq this place is not it! Especially the short ribs fell short, such a disappointment. I only can add that the brisket was good. You want a good ayce bbq, go to Vegas and it's only $25 with much better quality!!!"
10/5/2021,5 star rating,"I love this place so much!! Everything about this place--atmosphere and food-- reminds me of the kbbq I had in Korea. Their meat is so high quality, melt in your mouth goodness. The side dishes were on point and delicious--kimchi, bean sprouts, mashed potato, spinach/greens, and fish cakes. Along with the multiple meats, we also ordered cheese corn, kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice, which they actually prepare on the hot stone grill after you are finished with a majority of your meat. Servers are very nice and patient with you despite having multiple tables to tend to. Love the service here. This place definitely hit the spot after a long day of work. It was the perfect place to eat with my coworkers! I would 100% definitely come back!"
2/6/2022,5 star rating,So good bulgolgi and short rib are amazing...service even better than the food. It is the best all you can eat kbbq in LA and it's worth every penny. Get some soju too!!!
2/1/2020,5 star rating,"Best things about this place.1. Outstanding service. They cooked the food for us about 90% of the time and they were always on top of it. They have a very friendly and active server team.2. The food is tasty. Other than the bulgogi being just a tad too sweet for my taste buds, all the other food optIons are really good.Not so good things about Â this place.1. The looooong wait to be seated. But if you are prepared to wait then give it a shot.2. When you are waiting, the hostess calls your waitlist name only to tell you that she's only verifying that you are present. It teases everybody to think that our table is ready- Not!This is one of a couple of my go to places for kbbq"
8/5/2021,5 star rating,"So my family and I are from San Francisco.We visited the area and decided to try this place out because of all the reviews. The food and atmosphere is out of this world, I love how they decorated everything. Staff was very friendly. Alright prices are a bit high, it's most likely because of the overheads and quality of the food you get. But I also had the weirdest but funnest experience I've ever had at a kbbq place. So my water cup was about half full and we needed a grill change. So when we got a servers attention for a grill change. Our server came over and removed our used grill and I think he realized that the water bath at the bottom needed to be refilled. So what he did was glance around, grabbed my cup of half water and poured it all in there. And then he changed our grill. A job well done. Well afterwards you would think he would refill our waters. Nope we let 15 minutes go by before we had to ask for a refill on our waters. I get it it's busy but oh man it was pretty funny when they take your water and not refill it afterwards."
2/1/2021,5 star rating,"They are currently open for outdoor dining. My party of 3 went on a Friday night at 5:45 and ended up waiting for 2 hours. They don't currently take any reservations, so I recommend coming earlier then us to avoid waiting so long. They currently have about more then 10 tables and all very spaced well. Service is still pretty attentive. They check your temperature before you get seated."
8/14/2021,5 star rating,"We came here for lunch on a Friday at We and got seated immediately. The meat is amazing. I highly recommend marinated beef short rib, beef brisket, bulgogi and beef tongue, steak.However I don't think it's worth waiting for more than 30 mins or spending more than $60 on Uber to get here."
6/8/2021,4 star rating,Super busy location on a Saturday. Wait time was 2.5 hours. Food was absolutely delicious and definitely worth the wait. The service was not good. A couple times we found ourselves looking for help just to get water refills.
3/24/2022,3 star rating,It was ok. They said they use Prime grade meat but I did not think so. Maybe it was like that before.
12/20/2021,5 star rating,Came here while visiting from out of town. Whole experience was 10/10. Parking gets a little crazy but worth paying for the valet .
1/7/2021,5 star rating,"The best Korean BBQ I have ever had. I loved it all the meat was fantastic the sides where so good. The service was awesome. The only thing you have to be ready for is the wait. My party of 7 waited for 2 hours. Worth the wait. The brisket was awesome and the steak and then we moved on to the pork and marinated meat. e's a fun vibe and you'll be surrounded by lots of other people laughing, drinking and eating. There's enough space between tables so its not overwhelming. Great for a date or coming with the crew. You should go it's the right thing to do.I would definitely come back and mainly for their customer service. Other Korean BBQ's have had everything great, but they lacked that personality. You just kind of eat and go, but in this place, we actually joked and laughed with our server, and for that, it wins a spot in my heart."
11/17/2019,5 star rating,"I had my expectations set high from reviews and what I had previously heard about the quality of this AYCE destination. I must say, I was not disappointed. Highlights and recommendations: 1. Beef tongue - it comes thinly sliced and has a hearty flavor. SO delicious2. Steak - just so satisfying. You can cook it exactly as you want, so it was really tender and paired wonderfully with the sauces they provide. Â 3. Pay the extra $5 and get the veggies on the side. It comes with lettuce and sesame leaves (I believe) - you wrap some rice paper, kimchi, and brisket in this with sesame oil and salt. Perfection. 4. Kimchi fried rice!!! They cook it right there for you. The rice gets crispy and picks up the meaty flavor from the hot plate. The place was packed and we waited an extra 45 minutes even though we arrived at 3:30PM. But the staff clearly knew how to handle the volume of people, and our waiter still came back to check on us enough that we had a steady stream of meat coming. Lastly, this restaurant is quite pricey compared to others, but if you're really looking to commit to all you can eat, you won't be disappointed and you'll definitely get your money's worth."
11/16/2019,5 star rating,"Usually not the biggest AYCE fan, but if I have to do it, catch me at Hae Jang Chon!!The best thing about this place is probably the service. They are so quick and on top of it. We asked for so many things in a scattered fashion, and the servers that helped us throughout our meal were so great. I personally think the quality of the meat here is also much better than other AYCE spots in the area. We got around 11 orders among 3 (LOL rip), and we got a lot of different meats, but our favorites were Beef Brisket and Beef Belly. The Short Rib and Prime Steak weren't our faves, so I'd probably recommend you stick to the thinner cut meats. Love that they have rice paper, since I'm a huge fan of that. The freakin' Kimchi Pancake is so delicious and blew me away. Aside from that, their side dishes are pretty decent. Great experience overall :')"
8/3/2021,2 star rating,"I've been coming to Hae Jang Chon for around 5 years, and fairly often as well. I've seen the price jump from $24 for AYCE dinner to $40 through the years. The last time I went which was a few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I were told to hurry up to pay because they were closing the register (roughly 3PM). Our service has been mediocre the past few times as well but I looked past it because I've been coming here for so long I have seen the good and bad side of service. But lately the service being bad or outright terrible has been unfortunately more consistent. The grills are not the stone grills they used to use, and they are now made of what seems to be some type of metal, which doesn't give the meat the same flavor as it used to. They switched right when the pandemic started due to city ordinance mandating outdoor dining but they still use the inferior metal grills although indoor dining is allowed again. This is not worth the price jump and I'm incredibly saddened to say I think I have to find a new KBBQ spot."
8/10/2021,4 star rating,"As far as AYCE KBBQ goes, this places is probably one of the best in town. The grill is also different than your standard grill and there's so much variety. I'd definitely recommend if you're looking for some quality AYCE in ktown."
9/7/2021,4 star rating,This place deserves Â 4 1/2 stars. Everything was great except they had run out of rice wrap- which is my favorite. I probably would've left had I known.

8/10/2021,3 star rating,Meat quality is not consistent. Â Been here at least 5 times and sometimes it's good sometimes frozen. I think their recent price increase makes other places in town shine.
7/9/2021,2 star rating,"Due to covid, I always try to be as understanding as possible. While I didn't mind waiting for 30 minutes to be seated and couldn't careless if the food takes a long time to be served (the food always arrive almost right away), I was so disappointed in the way our server treated us. We have 3 adults and 2 infants in our table. We ordered the first 2 rounds and there were no problems. Then on the 3rd round, the server asked us if we want more meat? My husband said yes and order 1 item (I think it was the marinated galbi or something) because at this point we were kind of full and didn't want to order a lot and have the food wasted. Then the food arrived and my husband loved that one so much that he wanted to order one more. This time the server made it obvious that he didn't want to serve us anything more, he sighed so loud that our whole table can hear him Â we let that pass. After the galbi, my friend who was busy feeding her baby wanted to try the beef belly because she couldn't eat when we ordered it the second round and so I told her to order it. This time not only he let out that sign again, he stomped on his feet while walking away. At this point we are done with the food and ready for the bill anyways, but to our disbelief, another guy came to our table (the manager??) came and took away our menu lol (he asked us but still, what the hell??).I have no complaints about the food, but seriously I've never eaten in a highly reviewed restaurant that treat customers this way. Do they not need new customers because they are already popular?? That was so disappointed since we went all the way from San Francisco to here and we were so excited. Couple words to Justin (our server), if you are that unprofessional, I don't think you should work in anything related to customer service tbh, let alone in a busy restaurant that serve ALL YOU CAN EAT. Sighed and stomp feet at customers??? What are you? 2 year old?? Even my kid don't throw a tantrum like that."
8/5/2021,1 star rating,Horrible place. Supposedly has valet parking but the attendant sent us away because parking was full. I had my group go ahead and get on the list. Obviously won't let then sit until we are complete which is understandable. I followed in after 30 minutes cause that's how long it took me to find a parking spot. Another friend of ours had to ditch because he couldn't find a parking spot at all. They said they had to put our name on the back of the list when I arrived because we were listed for another number initially. This is after already waiting for so long. I pleaded with the front door attendant for my friends who had been waiting. Parking is impossible and they had already waited for me. They still put us at the bottom of the list. I've been here before and it's usually okay. But the people handling the front door are just horrible.
9/2/2021,5 star rating,My co worker asked if I was hungry for KBBQ after work and he suggested this place. Â  We got sat pretty quickly and the meats started to come out fast! Â Marvin our server was awesome. Â What ever we needed he got it for us and checked on us when it was appropriate! Â Definitely coming back!!!
9/4/2021,5 star rating,"Great food and even better service. Our server Jun was attentive, friendly, and always executed everything perfectly. Model employee. I would hire him in a minute. There are tons of kbbq places in LA and we would come back not only for the great quality food, but for the attentive and positive service!"
7/31/2021,1 star rating,"I don't enjoy writing reviews. But thought if management may read this, it's worth sharing. I made a reservation the night before. My bf had family visiting from out of state and I was looking forward to giving them their first kbbq experience. I usually go to my favorite hole-in-the-wall spots that I've gone to for 35 years, but I was happy to pick a popular spot that took reservation for seven.On the phone, they said they could seat 7. I gave my name and spelled it, and gave my phone number. I had to yell all this to them because it was so loud in their restaurant. They specifically told us they could seat us at 6:30, with all 7 of us there. The day of, we drove for few hours to take them up to LA, making sure we didn't eat too much and to make it to ktown in time. We arrived and valet shook their head at us because they were full. No problem, we managed to find street parking within 15 minutes and made it by 640pm.Soon as we arrived, a girl almost sat us but she had a different name for 7. She referred us to the host who said he was the one taking reservations and immediately claimed we didn't make one. I thought, it's loud in here so wouldn't be surprised if he wrote down the wrong name. He said there is no way that could happen because he was the one who took names. I wasn't trying to blame anyone, thought it was a completely understandable mistake. They said they'll see what they can do.They then sat other small parties and ignored us. I asked what is going on, if they are working on seating us. The host then said I seemed as if I wasn't sure I made a reservation, as if I'm trying to lie my way in. Getting a good sense where this was heading, I made my case and repeated what he told me on the phone. He asked if I came to the wrong restaurant. Again, been eating in ktown for over 3 decades, I know my restaurants here. I shared with him my phone history that obviously showed I called this restaurant and had a 2min conversation with someone. He kept denying it saying it didn't happen because he would have my name down. I asked if he took down our number because he asked for it on the phone, which he said yes to, but there wasn't any list of phone numbers, just names on a clipboard. Meanwhile, the hostess was still calling a name for a group of 7 that wasn't there.We ended up just eating couple doors down that had room and still great service and food. Everyone was so happy. Just wanted to share this with management: as a fellow Korean and former hostess of busier restaurants, please try to change your attitude towards customers. The host was a young gentleman who I know just didn't want to deal with us or acknowledge any mistake. But please try to change your defensive attitude.I know it's a busy place and hosting is stressful with entitled people, which is why I wasn't at all trying to blame someone. We just wanted to eat! And I'm sure you don't need our service, but it was embarrassing as a first time sharing our culture that you were gaslighting our family and disrespectful especially of the elders in our group patiently standing by. All you needed to say was, ""I'm so sorry, I don't know what happened but I'll add you to the list now and it'll be about 20 minutes."" If the customer can't handle that, that's their problem.Maybe also try a different system for your hosts, like a proper restaurant POS to take reservations more efficiently so it's more organized, better call history, and less stress on the staff to try and remember things.Thought I'd write this because I know koreans aren't known for customer service and I hope this changes things the next time it's someone's first kbbq experience."
11/21/2019,4 star rating,"Let me start off by saying this restaurant has some of the best quality meat I've ate thus far, everything was moist, juicy, melt right in your mouth and tender.Me and my homegirl came during a weeknight, we couldn't self park at the time instead paid $3 for valet, we went inside wrote our name on the waitlist, we didn't ask for the time but it went by quick we were sat within 30 minutes. For a party of 2 we still had a pretty big table and boy did that make us happy lol, I didn't really know what was going on with the sauces and sides one was a chili, sesame oil the other two?? The sides one was like mashed potato salad with giant carrots, the other looked spicy radish or something, this other reminded me of cooked broccolini then there were fish cakes...The menu was simple one price for dinner $28 per person your basic proteins, chicken, beef, pork etc We started off with soju, beef bulgogi, beef short rib and brisket, they gave us sides of rice and the salad was just chopped lettuce. They put the brisket on the grill for us, that cooks the fastest, we devoured that in no time flat. What I love was they would cook for us occasionally, I'm use to cooking most places we go but it was actually nice to sit back have someone else do it for a change, we didn't have to focus on it being over or under cooked. The grill itself is made from This stone so they don't ever have to change it, as long as you cook the food right, instead it has a hole so all the fat and juices leak out to the side. That was unique I've never seen that before, the food cooked evenly and we never had to keep adjusting the temperature.The second round we got thin sliced Canadian pork belly, and bbq chicken. I usually have thick pork belly which is more like bacon to me, this thin pork was good but reminded of the brisket but more fat so I left that to the homegirl. The bbq chicken was meh, I never really care for chicken at any location I've been at it's always so bland and cooks the longest. They'll bring the meat out soaked in juice but the chicken forget about it *NY accent Lastly we got more short ribs and bulgogi, by that time our buttons were popping off, but we always make sure to finish what we started. My friend complained about her stomach all the way home lol but In a good way. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, this isn't a favorite but will always be considered. Happy Eating!"

12/8/2019,5 star rating,"My wife and I came here after a show since it was open late. This was our first time and it was nearby our hotel, so we thought to visit and we are extremely happy that we did. Full disclosure, we are not avid AYCE type of customers, but cost wise, this made a lot of sense in regard to location and type of food.Upon entering, we were immediately greeted and seated, whereas, the restaurant was pretty busy with a younger type clientele. Our server was really friendly and open to helping us understand how to order as well as what each item was. We legit were curious what everything was and how we eat it as well as with what.We are on the keto diet and had to be conscious of our carb intake, but this experience made it worthwhile because there's tons of meat to choose from and I discovered radish papers, which are extremely low carb, but can be used like a taco!Alright, now we ordered Marinated beef and regular, shrimp, brisket, light pork, and we thoroughly enjoyed the radish noodles, which is also low carb. They do provide a good selection of sauces to go with the meats, which is helpful. We really enjoyed the marinated beef and light pork taste wise, but you're able to trial which ones you like and order more of it, however you cannot order and not eat because then you'll be charged. Thus, do small orders of what you prefer and feel free to ask the server to help as well.Overall, I will be returning and visiting again when I'm in the city. The customer service was beyond exceptional and our server was one-of-a-kind. It wasn't wildly expensive and the amount of food you get is worthwhile."
6/15/2020,5 star rating,"So, we showed up on the Post-COVID opening day at 11:40am. Seated immediately, servers are maintaining the mandatory 6' rule by standing on the obligatory dots on the ground. All food is served in plastic dishes and silverware, aside from the shears and tongs, have been replaced with plastic versions. The servers can not currently assist you with cooking due to restrictions, so you are left to cook your own food for the most part; They do try to help as much as possible, but i'm sure this will be massively reduced when they get busy. New addition to the menu is USDA Prime Steak (YUM!!!). Food was amazing as always, and for all you kimchi freaks (*raises hand*), the kimchi has had tons of time to ferment so it is AMAZING! Like curl your toes good; Normies need not apply :)Anyway, get back in and support this amazing AYCE restaurant!"
6/18/2021,5 star rating,"I have to be the luckiest girl in the world for THIS to be my first KBBQ experience!! We showed up around 5:15 and only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. Right now they have a large shaded seating area across the parking lot for those waiting.The food was incredible--SUCH fresh meat. We ordered the Beef Bulgogi, Beef Brisket, Bean Paste Soup, Beef Short Rib, Pork Belly, Steamed Egg, Steamed Rice, Korean Pancake, and BBQ Chicken. My favorites were the BBQ Chicken, Beef Bulgogi, and the Bean Paste Soup which was a surprisingly refreshing break in between meat rounds. The service was also great--our waitress was very attentive and cooked our food for us which made it that much more relaxing. The Kimchi and bean sprouts that are already at your table when you're seated are INCREDIBLE. They also offer you a couple things to help you make wraps out of your bites. Our group of 5 was SO full and satisfied by the time we left, LOVED this place!"
6/17/2021,4 star rating,"I have been here several times. Meat is good and i like the sides too. But queue here can be a headache. If you call their number, they say that they do not take reservations but while we are waiting in the line, employees helped some groups cut the line claiming they had a reservation."
6/15/2021,4 star rating,This place is very good. The price is ok for the amount of all you can eat menu. Drinks over priced. Valet is 4 dollars.
6/15/2021,5 star rating,"My new favorite kbbq place is definitely this one..sorry SJ kbbqs but this one is just so much better.We stopped by here on our first night around 8 close to 9 and the wait time was already 1-2 hours long, as well as the other kbbqs around us when we phoned in. We were already starving so we decided to grab bibimbap elsewhere and came back the next morning, which got us a table inside so yay!!After ordering, everything came out super quick and our server also cooked for us which is SOOO nice and relaxing. Our waiters, I believe Kevin and Jun(I believe?) were super friendly and helpful. Kevin came around many times to check in on us, refill our brisket sauce (this sauce was so yummy) and to grill our meat. Aside from the service, the quality of the meat is also MUCH better than ones that I've tried at other restaurants. I loved getting the brisket, pork belly, bulgogi and short rib (I usually don't order marinated meats at Gen's because it's too sweet but it's perfectly seasoned here!)The pork neck steak and the intestine (this was cut differently which allowed for more thorough cooking which was good!) were also surprisingly delicious.Overall, I'm super satisfied with my experience here and it's definitely worth the visit. Parking can be tedious but there are other lots and street parking you could try as well :3"
6/14/2021,1 star rating,Irritatingly poor service. Food started off ok but once we got the bulgogi everything went south. And then later that night I got food poisoning. So many other good places to go to. I regret going here.
6/10/2021,5 star rating,This place is a must!!! Love it so much. The service was good as well. They have the freshest meat in LA. DELICIOUS! Will definitely return and recommend to everyone!
6/10/2021,5 star rating,Workers there were super nice and would regularly check in to ask if i wanted any more food. the meat was really good and my four friends who'd never tried korean bbq before really like the experience and the food. would definitely come again!
6/9/2021,5 star rating,Went for the first time recently and I completely understand the following Hae Jang Chon has. I came about 10 minutes before they opened and was able to be seated as soon as they opened.Food: Their meat is definitely high quality. My group was a fan of most of the meats except for the marinated short rib. It was a bit too tough for our liking. Definitely get the beef tongue though! Service: The staff is super attentive and would often come by to ask what else we wanted to order. Meat comes out fast and cooks even faster so be ready to eat! We had an order of kimchi fried rice to round out the meal and I really appreciated that the staff moved some of the burnt bits off the grill before they cooked on it. Parking: There's valet parking available. Sometimes you'll be able to find parking in the residential area but it's pretty limited. Pro tip: Ask for sliced raw garlic. It's a game changer.
6/8/2021,4 star rating,Super busy location on a Saturday. Wait time was 2.5 hours. Food was absolutely delicious and definitely worth the wait. The service was not good. A couple times we found ourselves looking for help just to get water refills.

7/25/2021,4 star rating,"Meats were tasty, rice paper was awesome too. This place didn't disappoint, being from San Diego, I've only got two KBBQ places to choose from(my personal favorites that is), I figured I'd get a legit kbbq experience while in K-Town. Service was great, waiters help you cook your meat, white rice was super good too."
4/19/2019,4 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised that they have valet parking for $3, which was inexpensive and convenient. The wait was an hour plus to get seated, since the food was worth the wait. We were seated and our server was Justin. He was friendly, helpful, and constantly came around to check on our food.We got the AYCE for $25.99 per person. The bancha tasted okay my favorites was the green vegetable.We started out with brisket, rib finger, and short rib. Â We also ordered prime steak, thin pork belly, bulgogi, and steam egg. The best items were the brisket, rib fingers, and short rib which we kept ordering. The prime steak and egg were not as tasty. We also ordered fried rice at the end, a must have at this location.Can't wait to come back again when we are in the neighborhood!"
4/28/2019,5 star rating,Always my go to place when I visit LA! The wait is long but it is worth it. The servers kind of rush you but the customer service is phenomenal. They remember every single thing you order mentally without a notepad or anything. I am so impressed. The foods come out quick and they help you cook it. It's kind of intense having food shoved on your plate having to eat so fast but the good thing is you don't have to really cook much. They have a lot of different options and I like that they cook you the kimchi fried rice at the end. Also a plus that they clean the grill out for you too. Always love coming back to this place.

3/4/2021,1 star rating,"Let me tell you about the intellectually challenged people who work here. I placed an order for their vegetable bibimbap for to-go. The girl told me that my order would be ready in 15. I arrive for her to tell me that they don't take orders for bibimbap. Um, maybe you should have told me that before I came all the way out there!!! Or how about not take my order to begin with!!"
5/28/2021,5 star rating,"5/5 - Pre-pandemic4.5/5 - during pandemic4.8/5 - nowFor people who don't visit many KBBQ/ AYCE places, this MAY or MAY NOT be the place for you.To my fellow fat friends, this is THE spot. They will come at you over and over again asking you ""do you want anymore meat?"" Best KBBQ/ AYCE in Los Angeles. Even when seated in the parking lot with a folded table out. Definitely never leaving hungry.To the filthy casuals, be prepared to eat. You will feel rushed. The servers are there to work and they will work their butts off. Meaning, there might be no time for friendly greetings. I too have experienced a somewhat not so welcoming greeting. BUT they were busy as hell and they were trying to organize the line. All will be forgiven when you sit down.Honestly, you're going to an AYCE in Los Angeles. These servers serve what the majority of what frequent visitors want in an AYCE. More food! And if you're the type to take breaks and pause on ordering meat(s) only to decide to not order anymore, G T F O out of my fat*** way. Take your *** to a steakhouse where the rest of the greenhorns are. Here to eat gdi.Pro-Tips: 1. As you're cooking the meat, you send another order of meat over when they ask you. 2.Order of meats should be Un-marinated items first, then the marinated ones. It will be very hard to go back to the un-marinated ones after having something a little more sweet and savory.3. Save the rice for the end, whether it be kimchi fried rice or white rice. Goes well with marinated items."
5/24/2021,5 star rating,"Really great, here is what you need to know:All you can eat for $31 for lunch (before 3:00), $33 for dinner (after 3:00).The wait will be ~45 min to an 1 1/2 hours and you need everyone present to do temp checks and put down your name on the list.The parking lot is valet only so find a place in the neighborhood nearby.If you don't know what's going on or what an item is, just ask and the staff, they were super kind and helpful. The Steak and the Marinated Short Rib were amazing, get those for sure. One or two specific meats cost extra if you get more than one serving (I forget which ones, but they list it at the front menu where you check in) Get the marinated short rib. Get the marinated short rib. Get the marinated short rib, you won't regret it. The checking in process was a bit confusing so here it is:1) Go to the door on the left to put your name down (need everyone present to do temp checks)2) Wait at orange tents until your name is called (if you don't respond they'll skip you)3) Once called, wait in line on the stone sidewalk in front of the windows4) Go in and enjoy!"

4/28/2021,5 star rating,"I've gotten takeouts twice while staying at my hotel in LA. The first time went very well. The second time was nice as well but slightly different. They texted me during the second time which was very nice. However, while eating I bit on something hard when there's no bones in my meal. It felt like a tiny pebble so I don't know what it was. Or if it was seasoning because it didn't taste like it. I also wish they have a more variety of side dishes for takeouts but it's okay. Nice experience overall!"
6/29/2019,4 star rating,"I was in Koreatown with my best friend trying on wedding dresses as she's getting married and we thought why not have all you can eat in between trying on tight dresses! Lol. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and had about a 20 min wait. It was a little unorganized when we first arrived because the host did not take our names and as more people arrived, they started to take names and we had to remind the host that we had already been there waiting. Once we were seated, they already had a spread of all the amazing, pickled sides that you normally get at Korean bbq. We started with two orders of brisket which had quite a bit of fat, but I am a strong believer that is where the flavor lies so I was happy with that. Unfortunately, my friend didn't feel well so we didn't order any more meat but we did order kimchi fried rice. Just so you know, once we ordered the fried rice, they let us know we couldn't order any more meat which was fine since we didn't want more. They also help you cook your food and for being all you can eat, that was my first time seeing that. The server was also nice and didn't know my friend wasn't feeling well so he was shocked to see that we only ordered two plates of brisket. He told us that to get our moneys worth we should to go to a Korean bbq place that does a la carte as their meat is higher quality versus all you can eat places that typically serve lower quality. We thought it was nice of him to give that advice. Parking is valet for $3, but there is a neighborhood behind the shopping center if you want to try your luck. They do take reservations, but it is only for parties of 6 or more."

6/1/2019,5 star rating,"Delicious & quality kbbq! Heads up: there is always, always a long wait for this place & they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived. If you can wait until 1 or 1:30PM, you'll avoid the lunch rush & get seated immediately. They have numerous meats to select. We opted for the marinated short rib (AMAZING), brisket (a little on the fatty side) & bulgolgi. Also ask for the kimchi pancake that comes with AYCE. They come and cook the meat for you, and the kimchi pancake. This was so nice and lets you catch up with your friends. But, I do prefer my brisket cooked on the more well done side, so I had to put my meat back on the grill to cook it some more. Parking is valet only, and it's not a big lot. There is street parking nearby, but make sure you feed your meter!"
7/3/2021,3 star rating,"It's not worth the wait. The steak was dry, the beef short rib was a little tough. The pork belly and beef brisket were ok. I like their customer service though and the side dishes. But I'll rather go to Brother's BBQ for AYCE."
3/27/2019,5 star rating,"The wait can get pretty ridiculous but I think it's well worth the wait. I've been here multiple times with family, friends, and always leave feeling super satisfied and full. Their service is really good and responsive. You literally have a button at your table to push and call a waiter/waitress over. The meat is really flavorful and comes in huge quantities. And I always enjoy seeing them clean the stone grill... they don't replace it like most places until you are done with the meal. So during the meal when your grill starts to get dirty ask them to clean it and watch the little show. :) Also make sure to save a little room at the end for the kimchi fried rice."
2/1/2020,5 star rating,"To me, This is the BEST all you can eat korean BBQ place in LA!! Very reasonable pricing with great variety of meat. As always, Korean town parking situation is a pain in the ass. You may be able to find a street parking if you're really lucky. The valet parking is $2, make sure you bring cash. The valet parking shares with some restaurants and cafes at the same plaza. This time I came on a Friday at around noon. We got seated immediately. I've been here for quite a few times (usually in the evenings) and this was the first Â time I Â didn't have to wait for a table. Lunch time price is $25.99. I personally like the brisket, beef tongue, prime steak and pork shoulder. All the meat was great in quality and fresh. The special stone grill made the meat more tasty. Remember!! Save some space for the kimchi fried rice at the end. I like to ask them adding more seaweed and cheese. And I like to wait until the rice a little bit crispy at the bottom. That is definitely Â a bomb! I also enjoy the services here. The servers always make sure you have enough food, help you to grill and give you advices. I'd like to give a shout out to Steve (hope I remember his name correctly). He's super helpful and yet funny, good job! Of course! I'll be back!"
6/18/2021,1 star rating,"First time here from San Francisco. My entire party of four got Food POISONING from this place. I will never return. Especially for the Price point (almost $200) w/tip) $33 per person without TAXES, I expected better quality and service. 1. The wait time: We waited approximately 2 hours. 2. The food: Like previously mentioned: We Got FOOD POISONING! The only item on the menu that seem to have flavor was the steak. Rice was okay too. 3.Service: Extremely RUSHED! We Didn't even get a chance to be fully seated before our waiter harassed us, asking for our meats. 4. Cooking your own meats: We asked politely if it was possible to cook our food because we wanted the full KBBQ experience, but unfortunately they try and get you out of there as quick as possible. Your waiter will come and take the utensils from you to cook YOUR FOOD! I tried putting my meat back on the grill because we wanted it well done and the waiter would take it off to add the remaining meat. I was extremely disappointed. Gen Korean Barbecue is better in my opinion."
5/24/2021,3 star rating,"May 23,2021, We went here for dinner because we are from the Northern California so our food is different then Southern California. The wait was about 1-2 hours if your planning to go at night just know they close around 11:00pm not 12am so if you see the sign that's not what time they are closing anyways the reason why is giving this place a 3/5 is because they rush to our food so we can leave fast which some places don't do that anyways I thought it was open until 12am because that's what the sign and Yelp said 12am so I thought we would stay a little longer anyways customer service would be 5/5 food was good 5/5 would I recommend this place it is a maybe it all depends will they change the hours because it's false advertisement if you say it close at midnight."
2/2/2020,4 star rating,"Eating Korean BBQ is an art. Â Your palette must be tastefully diverse and you must indulge in the right amount to walk away wholly satisfied.LA is fraught with KBBQ spots so it's important to cut through the noise of shameless and hyper competitive AYCE marketing to find the right one. Â You can confidently add Hae Jang Chon to your list of top AYCE. Â While slightly pricier than the average, run-of-the-mill AYCE, the price differential is well-justified. Â The meats are superior in quality. Â The use of a stone grill makes the overall experience better without the worry of charring and burned meats. Â The variety of meats is made up of the all stars playing on many other AYCE menus.If you have a party of 6 plus, you can make reservations! Â Otherwise, your wait will be quite a while. Â The parking lot is very small during the rush so be prepared to park elsewhere or call a ride share, if you're reasonably local."
2/25/2019,5 star rating,"Ive been to several kbbq's in my life and I would have to say this place is the best. Going to keep this short (actually long lol):Parking:Valet 3$ or metered street parking for like an hour if you can find oneWaitlist:Expect to wait atleast 30minsPrice: 27.99$ AYCE 7 days a weekFood:AYCE menu is pretty simpleMUST - marinated short ribs and kimchi fried rice, thems be MUST.From the quality of the sides, down to the placement really surprised me cause although table was small I didnt feel cramped at all. They have the best sides Ive ever had. I found myself eating from all the sides compared to some other places where I might avoid some. All the sides and all the meats we ordered were nothing but great.Service: A1 First time I've seen a host actually call out and check on who is actually still presently waiting that is on the waitlist and did not bounce. Definitely helps with giving accurate wait times.They can kindly cook for you. Fast, kind, and deserve all the cash in my wallet. Overall, after going here and several different places over the past 5+ years its safe for me to conclude that this place tops all of the other AYCE kbbqs I've ever been to with no doubt. P.S: I know you probably dont want to wait or worry about the parking, but trust me it is so worth it, plus after you finish eating, the drive up to salt and straw is literally like 5 or so minutes, good luck!"

2/18/2020,2 star rating,"Believe or not, me and my boyfriend are loyal customers here. We have been eating at this restaurant for several years (every 2-3 times per week) now and regularly visit whenever we get the chance ( once time per week). However on a particular visit last Sunday (Dec 29) we experienced some terrible service for a waiter named KEVIN who was very disrespectful and ignorant. After already waiting patiently for 2 hours to be seated, we were met with the staff not heeding our multiple requests to change out dirty and charred BBQ grill to cooked out meat hygienically. We asked for the grilled to be cleaned but they said they would after the squid is to be cooked. The reason why I asked for that is the meal will burn very easily and will ruin the taste become bitter. Is that too hard when the customers ask for cleaning a dirty grill????? That aside we still continued to try and enjoy the meal but this was also hindered. We tried to order more meat throughout the night but the staff turned down our request in fear of over-ordering as that comes with a surcharge. We were well aware of this and managed our appetite accordingly and didn't order more until we had finished or nearly finished what was available.(Photos for reference of the cooked meat available before ordering). We ordered quarter and half portions to unsure this but the staff ignored our orders repeatedly. Finally, even when we were about to pay for the meal we were met with rude customer service when the waiter took the bill very fast without saying ""Thank You"" and opened it while he was walking, then condescendingly laughed with a female waitress at our order and deservingly low tip for a poor customer experience. I guess they talked back to us. What kind of service to customers ??? I should have taken my bill back and gave them no tip instead of $5.70 that I did. They didn't deserve a tip at all. I though he has worked there for long time at least he has experiences to be a professional to do not having terrible behavior like that. KEVIN is super RUDE and MEAN. He doesn't know how to respect and service customers. He just does whatever like owner of this place Â despite he is not."

The lady in charge of placing people seems to be prejudice. I felt discriminated so I will never return to this please and make sure all my friends know NOT to go here!When we got to this place we saw tables outside and inside; there were no people outside and a few people inside. We wanted to be inside too but the Lady said that we can't sit inside. I was surprised and asked ""then how come where are people inside?"" She got mad at me and said ""okay"". Once we were seated, she threw menus on the table and left. I had a question about how it worked since it was a bit confusing but she didn't even bother to answer my question. We decided to leave because it was obvious that she didn't need customers. Â These days going out is not as fun as it used to be and this place made even worse. It was a birthday celebration and it was almost ruined but we were lucky to find a better place after we left this one. To be honest, it seems they don't need customers so I recommend going somewhere else!!!"
11/19/2020,5 star rating,"Delicious KBBQ!! I came here on a wednesday for an early dinner (around 5 PM), the wait was about 15-20 minutes which was reasonable because all the tables were filled. First of all the banchan was really good, I especially loved the pickled radish! The meats were DELICIOUS and HIGH-QUALITY! I have been to so many korean bbq restaurants mainly north of LA, but this place is the best I've had. We ordered brisket, bulgolgi, spicy pork belly, steak, and short ribs. The brisket was good and not fatty at all, which is where a lot of other places cheap out on. The bulgogi marinate was very flavorful, since it also has onions! The spicy pork belly was the perfect amount of spice and was tasty. The marinated short ribs were similar to the flavor of bulgolgi, but nonetheless delicious. Lastly the steak was our absolute FAVORITE! The steak was so juicy and tender, yet so full of flavor! It was the epitome of steak you're craving! I highly recommend others to come to this place. The staff was quick and friendly, and the food was delicious."
4/5/2020,4 star rating,"I had a much better experience the second time around than I did my first time here. My party of 7 came on a Saturday morning and there was no wait. We got there around 12pm but couldn't be seated until the last person was here. There was still no line when 1pm rolled around so we went right in.+Meat: Quality here definitely reigns supreme as everything was fresh as heck (as it should be for the higher kbbq price tag). The beef tongue was the crowd favorite and we ended up ordering at least 5-6 rounds of that. I personally also really enjoyed the squid and beef short ribs. My least favorite was the brisket. Next time I come back, I'm going for their chicken and marinated short ribs!+Service: Very quick and efficient. Refilled water, dipping sauces, and banchan when asked and delivered our meat plates immediately. They help you make your kimchi fried rice at the end too.HJC is worth it if you're willing to brave the wait. It's not my personal absolute favorite kbbq spot, but it's a solid spot and renowned crowd favorite - you won't be disappointed."
2/12/2019,2 star rating,"Location/parking: almost no public parking whatsoever, although they do offer valet for $2. Not a place that's hard to miss considering the crowd of people at the front. Service: hit or miss, honestly.. we really got the feeling they try to get you out of there ASAP (especially if you happen to be there on the weekend). We asked our server for pancake 4 times and nothing :( so we asked a random server but received it after we finished eating and paying. When asking for diff meats they'll bring maybe? 2/4 that you order and maybe one extra that you didn't even ask for? Food: meh, it wasn't terrible but definitely not worth coming back for. Meat quality is subpar. The only meat worth re-ordering is the marinated short rib!Affordability: 25.99/dinner but 19.99 would have been more accurate. Â Especially with soo many other good kbbq spots in LA, I'd give this one a hard pass."
4/16/2021,1 star rating,I just drove here for dinner because it said 0 minute wait! I showed up and they said there's a 3 hour wait for 2!!! Be ware they do not update or use that system!
1/14/2019,5 star rating,"Literally my favorite restaurant I've ever tried in my 22 years of life!! This was the first restaurant we went to for my first LA trip and I'll never forget this experience. We got there around 7pm and it was so packed! Valet parking is available for $3 in the parking lot right in front. There was a line just to write your name on the waitlist! We were told the wait would be ~2 hours long, which we didn't mind because we really wanted to try this place. The suckiest thing about waiting outside is the smokers!!! Yuck. I wish smokers would be mindful about smoking here because there were young kids waiting outside as well.Anyways, ~2.5 long hours later, we finally got seated. The first thing I noticed was how clean our table was (compared to the 3 GENs I've been to in the Bay). Service was off the roof. Our server was so friendly, helpful, prompt, always checked on us, always helped us not burn the meat (lol we're not very good at this). I believe the price per person is $25.99, which is not bad at all for the service and quality that you get.We pretty much tried every meat and seafood on the menu. Everything tasted so good and fresh. It felt like food heaven. But my the one that stood out the most definitely was the Beef Tongue! I've never had such good beef tongue (at GEN or Road to Seoul). We got 3 more plates of it after trying everything else. Also, the small intestines were not stinky at all! It tasted like nothing...which is WAY BETTER than what I had at Road to Seoul...(made me gag).We also got Kimchi fried rice at the end with BBQ short ribs which is a must! The waiter makes it right in front of you so it was pretty cool. No pics of the food available because I was too busy eating...but I took a picture of the sign outside lol."
6/14/2021,1 star rating,Irritatingly poor service. Food started off ok but once we got the bulgogi everything went south. And then later that night I got food poisoning. So many other good places to go to. I regret going here.
2/18/2020,4 star rating,"My sister kept raving about this place so I finally made her take me here one day. We came with the whole fam and did an AYCE for lunch. We came here right before it opened to avoid the lunch rush because it does get really busy. They start you off with some banchan and give you menu with pretty decent selection. There's beef, pork, chicken and even a few seafood items. I liked how everything was cooked on a charcoal grill (as opposed to a regular metal grill) and the meats were pretty decent quality. There were a couple of items that were fattier than we liked, but it was good for the most part. All the marinated meats had really good flavor. There was something for everyone and we left feeling stuffed.Overall, come here for a solid AYCE KBBQ meal."
1/3/2019,4 star rating,"SoCal is known for great KBBQ, so of course we had to see what all the fuss was about. With no idea where to start, I asked Tiffany C. for suggestions. And, being a local (more importantly, dating a Korean man who knows his Korean food), she promised that for the value, Hae Jang Chon is one of the restos that tops her list. And with good cause!The food was fresh, well marinated, and generously portioned. Service was sincere, and the price was right. As of 12.30.18, dinner was only 25.99 for never-ending M-E-A-T (and sides, of course). YUSSSSSS!!!4k reviews can't be wrong. Â Go getchu some.PS - they don't have cheese corn, hence the -1 star. But you probably wouldn't miss it anyway. Food was fantastic."
1/12/2020,5 star rating,"Came in for lunch and were seated pretty quickly! Our service was excellent. They helped us out with cooking our meats, gave suggestions, and even had us try some new things that we've never had before!We were pleasantly surprised. The quality of the meat is very high and the service was the best part! All of the beef was delicious. And we loved the rice paper and radish paper with our meal.You should definitely try out this place if you're in the area! The only con is the parking is $2 valet parking, even though it's a small parking lot. But I guess that's Cali for ya!"
11/15/2020,5 star rating,"I came here with my friends on a Friday night at around 7 and the wait was about an hour. I have found it difficult to get some decent Korean BBQ during the pandemic. Other places that I have visited have NOT been worth the money or experience. Hae Jang Chon is located in a plaza with an extremely small parking lot, especially as the restaurants are seating outdoors. We parked on the street, which was free after 7 and super limited, which is the only downside to the restaurant. Other than that, the experience was great. The wait went by quick, and by the time our table was ready we were eager to eat A LOT. The staff was practicing COVID-19 guidelines by wearing masks and gloves. There is hand sanitizer available. Menus are provided by scanning a QR code.The service was more than exceptional. Our requests were fulfilled within a few minutes, and we were not neglected despite the dinner rush. They were more than willing to help us and extra kind. The food was great. I used to be super picky and not much of a meat eater, but I do love eating brisket. My idea night of KBBQ would be brisket and only brisket, which is exactly what happened Friday night. Don't forget to order the steamed eggs and soybean paste soup. I look forward to coming back here again. Stay safe !"
9/4/2021,5 star rating,"So so good. I would definitely recommend the pho. The service was also really good. If I didn't live in LA, I would be back all the time."
1/11/2019,5 star rating,"This was amazing Korean bbq for the tourist in LA! I had heard great things about kbbq in LA and I can surely see why.We came around 6 and there was not much of a wait around then but it definitely grows into the evening. My favorite was the short rib, but the bulgogi and Canadian pork belly were also good. I wasn't in love with the spicy pork and prefer the thicker cuts of meat. You can order up to 3 at a time and the waiters are very attentive with cleaning the stone plate, taking away the meat grease, and preparing essentially everything for you! I was shocked to see how prompt they were despite a full house. They came over to help flip the meat, cut it, prepare new ones, etc. Bonchan and some different sauces were included and already set down for everyone at the table. Water was never ever empty. This place made my heart so full and I would definitely go back!"
1/29/2022,4 star rating,"amazing food and service. just really loud techno music, hard to enjoy the mood and conversations."
8/19/2021,5 star rating,"Food was great. Be warned tho, they are popular and want to move you through. If you are looking for a slower paced ""chill"" experience, this is not it...folks wanna eat here, so they keep it moving. As soon as your meat has been cooked and you're eating one of your choices, they are throwing the next one on for you. Turning that delicious capitalistic crank Â keep in mind, I didn't grow up on K-bbq. I have a grip of Korean friends and have eaten Kalbi (short ribs) and other meats home made. This spot isn't as good as home made, but it was damn good. If there are two of you and you both want a beer and all you can eat, that plus tip is gonna run you $100-$140."
8/31/2021,3 star rating,"It's just okay and extremely expensive. Stay away from the all-you-can-eat KBBQ locations, it's just not worth it. You'll be paying for food you will never eat and the quality isn't there."
9/15/2021,5 star rating,It was amazing! I highly recommend to friends and family! Great service great food! Had a good time when i went with friends and family
4/14/2021,1 star rating,"go to a different Korean barbecue place. Unreasonable wait time (3hrs) at 7pm and horrible service/attitude from the waiter taking people's name. The center is overcrowded and overrated. I asked the waiter taking peoples check in how we are called for our table and he replied very harshly saying how he told me before. I get it. It is very busy and you work long hours, but it's rude and off putting to eat at a restaurant who don't respect their customers."
4/14/2021,3 star rating,"I would give it 5 stars for the food alone; however, just like most of the bad reviews/stars are for that blame goes to the host who works in the late afternoon/evenings. I don't know if this guy has a napoleon complex, but the guy needs to relax. I noticed that he has an attitude or mood swings every single time we come here. I saw him personally yelling at people and ordering people where to stand and curse out LOUD. I know it's minimum wage, but can you at least be a little bit professional? Or if you're that miserable there or stressed taking people to their tables, work somewhere else! It's not healthy for you or your mental state for you to be that angry all the time. You're the host, the face of the restaurant so check yourself at the door. Your attitude and eye rolls doesn't suit you at all. If you ever do that to me I will curse you out both in English and Korean like a little kid you are. LOL. Â I'm surprised none of your nunas or hyungs smacked you to get some manners. Overall go for the food and the waiters/waitresses. They're all friendly and work fast."
4/14/2021,3 star rating,"This place is great with delicious food, but the one flaw on the restaurant's image is the host's bad tempered attitude; there was one short guy in particular who you could tell just had it and wanted to quit or something, but instead took it out on the people who just want to eat. He rolled his eyes at me, had a condescending attitude and was not at all polite. The waitress was nice maybe she can teach this guy some manners.There was another host, a short girl, who also had attitude and screamed at me for no reason, she too is doing a bad job as a host.They need to find better hosts or train the current hosts or they'll be known as the restaurant with the pissed off rude hosts who make people want to turn away and head to another restaurant with better service. It's a shame too cause the food was great."
4/13/2021,1 star rating,"The waiter's service attitude is very bad, he even turned around and scolded bad words said ""fuk""and Very bad experience. and there food nuclean .so we changed to another restaurant ."
4/8/2021,5 star rating,"Excellent place! Worth the price. My boyfriend, myself as well as some friends we came here after work, and it was amazing. It is usually a three hour wait but we only waited 10 minutes, the service was excellent, the meat tasted delicious and our server was very nice. They do however, have a time limit of 45 minutes per party which seems a little rushed but they bring you so much meat every time you order that you will be full after your second round of meat. Definitely coming back again."
4/7/2021,5 star rating,"Great service! We got there at the perfect time, usually there's about a 2 hour wait! Go early you'll get in faster"
4/5/2021,3 star rating,5 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service. Wish they could hire more people to improve their customer service.
4/5/2021,5 star rating,One of the best bbq places around. Ordered here during COVID lockdown and the food was still good and delivered without hassle. Side dishes are descent.
4/5/2021,4 star rating,We waited in line for 2 hours 30 minutes lol. I think it was a good place to eat but I couldn't say it GREAT lol. The host was a little rude and unprofessional
4/5/2021,1 star rating,I ate here on Saturday and three days later I still feel nauseous and have a headache.
4/4/2021,1 star rating,Immediately got a headache after eating here and started feeling nauseous. I threw up all night. The quality of the meat is poor. Don't eat here! The all you can eat is not worth it
11/19/2020,5 star rating,Their beef brisket is the best quality beef brisket I've ever had. Beef and short ribs were delicious also. I love their outside setup because they have shields in between tables and it makes you feel safe! I would come back out here for outdoor dining
1/20/2020,5 star rating,"My friend recommended we come here after work one night; she said it was the best Korean BBQ she has had. She was so right!Now the first thing you need to know about this place is that you will be waiting if you decide to come here at night. You write your name down on the notepad near the host stand and chill. I know some people like to head to the bar next door while they wait, but I just chose to hang around. Â I heard the group next to us say they had been waiting for 2 hours, but since we showed up around 12:45, we got seated within 20 minutes. When they call your name, your complete party has to be there and ready to go. Or it's on to the next!Once you sit, you simply pick 3 meats to start and get going! (Also don't forget the beer and shochu!) We tried the bulgogi, beef tongue, thin beef brisket, shrimp, and spicy pork belly. The food was so on point!! Very flavorful and well cooked. We were starving so we went through 3 round of meat within 35 minutes!! The sauces also helped make everything that much more flavorful. Ask for extra brisket sauce!!!!The price was reasonable $27.99 and I definitely think we got our money's worth with the quality of food. The service was what you expect with a super busy restaurant at 1am, but we got everything we wanted quickly! They don't BS over here! Don't forget last call is 1:30 am!"
5/5/2021,5 star rating,One of the best KBBQ spots in Korea town! Worth the wait every time! High quality meat and great prices for all you can eat!
11/23/2021,5 star rating,"best KKBQ spot EVER. Unmatched service, amazing selection of meats and sides, such a fun atmosphere! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area!"
12/3/2019,5 star rating,"Might have found my new go-to AYCE KBBQ spot!Friendly staff and most importantly very quick service! I usually go to Road To Seoul and I'm usually stuck there for a long time because I can't wave down a server for whatever I may need. Here at Hae Jang Chon, someone was there at your table immediately. They even cook the meat for you so they're really on top of it!As for the meats, they have a beef belly so I am very happy. The steamed egg is great and their banchan and sauces are top notch! Definitely will be back and recommend."
7/14/2021,1 star rating,Sat down for lunch only to see $36.99 pricing for lunch. Left immediately. What was once an affordable meal is no longer. We've been coming here for years but I think that stopped today.
6/30/2021,5 star rating,I love this place! I ordered take out delivery as lunch and they packaged it so perfectly. It arrived on time and it was delicious. Thank you for the amazing food
5/8/2021,5 star rating,We walk to Hae Jang Chon Korean BBQ Restaurant several times with our staff during lunch and dinar. They have friendly staff with reasonable price for fresh meat. They have sufficient parking all the time.
1/15/2019,5 star rating,"I don't think I've ever had better AYCE KBBQ than Hae Jang Chon. Literally, the best I've ever had. I've been multiple times and have had great food and service each time! Some tips for newcomers:1. You can making reservations ahead of time for parties greater than 6.2. Avoid going during rush hours like 12PM or 7PM as the restaurant gets extremely packed. I personally like to go around 5PM-6PM and am typically seated right away with usually little to no wait. 3. Valet is $3 and is usually available.I usually get the 3 main BEEF items: Beef Bulgogi, Beef Belly (I couldn't remember the name of this meat and always refer to it as Yoshinoya Beef...the waiter was very confused), & Beef Tongue. YUM YUM YUM!!! The banchan is really good also. At the end of the meal you are served a very special desert in the form of KIMCHI FRIED RICE. Make sure to save enough room for this special treat. On my most recent visit, I had no idea they cooked the meats for you. Is this something new? I definitely don't remember this in my past visits. Anyway, another perk to the already quality food! GO TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF!"
8/8/2021,1 star rating,"Do NOT eat here. Our favorite spot was closed and so we looked up spots that had outdoor dining due to Covid. Ended up here. Biggest food regret of my lifetime. The sides were horrible. The meats - particularly their ""prime"" cuts - inedible. It was THAT bad. Literally a waste of $$. Had to leave and then go get food somewhere else. Heavily disappointed. Will absolutely never return. Should be ashamed of the food they served."
4/5/2021,4 star rating,We waited in line for 2 hours 30 minutes lol. I think it was a good place to eat but I couldn't say it GREAT lol. The host was a little rude and unprofessional
11/21/2018,5 star rating,"Hands down the best AYCE KBBQ spot in LA, but you will have to wait your turn. Came at around 5pm on a Saturday with a group of 4 and still had to wait 1.5 hours before we were seated. After that first bite of glorious beef brisket though I knew it was all worth it. Beware, overeating here is almost guaranteed!The quality of meat is shockingly fresh, especially since the price here is only $25.99 per person for dinner (hence the crazy line). My favorites were the beef brisket, beef tongue, and kimchi fried rice at the end. In addition to the amazing quality of meat, the service was also impeccable. Our server (Kang) was very attentive and was able to remember everything we ordered, even when we asked for like 7 different things. If it weren't for the crazy line I would be here more frequently, but maybe it's for the best that I'm not pigging out here regularly."
5/8/2021,1 star rating,The host was insanely rude. Had an attitude when we just asked where to sign in and even more attitude giving us the weight time. I wouldn't eat here if you paid me.
1/4/2020,5 star rating,"Chose this place due to it's multiple reviews and photos. We went in December so this is a late review (December 21st). We were traveling down to LA for the holidays and stopped by Korea Town to eat a late lunch. When we got there, it was valet parking, which was nice since I was able to go and get my family on the waitlist. We arrived around 2PM and there was already a lot of people waiting. But, I have to say that the wait was short. What I liked about it was that they did a pre-check to see if the people on the waitlist was still in the vicinity, if not they were crossed off. We waited a good 20 minutes I think before we were brought inside to our table. Our table was already filled with the dips and side dishes. We ordered Samgyeopsal (thin and thick), beef brisket and the short rib. Much like other Korean BBQ restaurants, they cook it for you in the grill on the table, which is always nice. The dips were probably the best I've had! There was the usual samjjang, but a milder version, and the sesame seed oil with salt and another one that was very good! We also ordered some steamed egg and kimchi-jeon~ which was really good too.Overall the meal was amazing! What I was super excited about was the kimchi bokkeumbap with mozzarella cheese on top! Like Koreans say, best part of the meal was the bokkeumbap!! Absolutely loved it! Would so recommend this place to anyone traveling to LA and Korea Town!"
11/22/2019,5 star rating,"Recommended by two separate people who aren't even from LA plus various Angelenos, and it was SO worth the hype. We made a point of getting here super early so that we wouldn't have to wait, which was a good life choice as this place gets PACKED during peak dinner hours. I am a huge AYCE fan, and this is the best AYCE kbbq place I've ever been to. The selection of meats, which includes seafood and other non-meat items like kimchi pancake and steamed egg and kimchi fried rice at the end??? is unparalleled. Every time it came time to order more we were just paralyzed by choice. All of the meats we had here were incredible, and you really cannot go wrong. Our favorites, though, aka the ones we actually ordered more than once, were the marinated short rib, bulgogi, spicy pork, and thick cut pork belly. God, just typing this out is making me salivate all over again. Meats aside, the sauces were delicious and the banchan here is great. I usually totally shun the banchan because I want to get my money's worth of meat, but I actually ate the banchan here. Pro tip: use the rice noodle and radish slices they provide! Fill that up with some meat and some of the shredded pickled radish, top it with some sauce and you have THE perfect bite. A little K-taco, if you will.Another thing...because their grills are solid rather than grated (I don't know the technical terms), they just scrape the grills off with a bowl of radish rather than changing the grill out, so you don't waste time waiting for a new grill to get hot. Also, if you're like me and you always end up being one of your group to do the bulk of the cooking, you will love this place because they tend to the meat for you the vast majority of the time! So you really can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the meat.Great place to come with a group of friends, excellent value, so worth it."
12/2/2019,4 star rating,"Ok so, the lacking star is due to the super super SUPER long wait. Got quoted 1.5 hrs and really waited 2hrs and 15mins to get seated! Wait aside, the food was super good! Good selection of meats, the radish wrap has a hint of wasabi. And the grill gives the meat a great flavor!! Service was good too with how busy they were!"
3/13/2020,4 star rating,"One of the best AYCE Korean barbecue restaurants in Ktown. Â Come on a weekday if you want to beat the large weekend crowds.Instead of metal grills, they use heavy stone grills, which do a great job of retaining heat. Â The only difference I can slightly notice is that the meat doesn't get as carmelized as it can get when directly exposed to the flame, but overall, the meat cooks very evenly. Â Overall the quality of the meat is high, but I particularly enjoyed the thinly sliced brisket and pork belly. Â The steamed egg is the only side I usually get, as everything else (like kimchi pancakes and rice) fill me up too much. Â At the end of your meal, you can choose to get the kimchi fried rice with cheese, which they'll come out and cook for you right on the stone grill. Â I was excited about it, because they do the whole melting the cheese in front of you with a torch, but it really wasn't all that great. The portion was super small (understandable, considering you've just finished AYCE), and I thought there was too much rice compared to the kimchi and cheese--it barely tasted like kimchi. Â Other than that, everything else was great with the meal. Â All of their banchan are delicious, and they have a good selection of meats to choose from.Service has never been lacking, and they're pretty quick about getting the next round of orders out to your table. Â They usually handle cooking your meat for you, but sometimes our server got caught up with other tables, and we did it ourselves, which was no trouble to us. Â Valet in the front is $3, and I've never had an issue where their lot fills up, although I can't promise that'll never happen.Overall, one of the better places for AYCE kbbq, in my opinion. Â I highly recommend coming during the weekday, when there's almost never a line, as opposed to the weekend, when I've waited up to two hours."
5/7/2021,1 star rating,Waitlist is very unfair and arbitrary. You can't make a reservation unless 6 or more and everyone else have to wait. First come first serve isn't true because if someone comes who is a bigger party without a reservation they will take them first. Fucking sucks. Been waiting for longer than 45 minutes.
1/9/2020,4 star rating,"Hands down the best AYCE KBBQ I have had ever! I am from the East Coast, so I read that this was a must try. The quality was amazing, the options were vast, and the side dishes tasted great! I am knocking it down one star because the service was slow. It was super busy, so I understand they were trying their best. Crazy how a random Monday night at 10PM can get so busy. When we left around 11:30, there was still a line waiting outside. This place is insane!"
4/8/2021,5 star rating,"Excellent place! Worth the price. My boyfriend, myself as well as some friends we came here after work, and it was amazing. It is usually a three hour wait but we only waited 10 minutes, the service was excellent, the meat tasted delicious and our server was very nice. They do however, have a time limit of 45 minutes per party which seems a little rushed but they bring you so much meat every time you order that you will be full after your second round of meat. Definitely coming back again."
12/11/2019,5 star rating,"Definitely one of the best AYCE KBBQ places in Ktown! While the price is a bit higher than some of the other, cheaper AYCE places like Road to Seoul, it is definitely worth it. If you can endure the long wait times, you should find yourself having a great culinary experience in no time. Since wait times can be anywhere from 1.5-2 hours, I highly recommend coming during an off-time on the weekday.Overall, I highly recommend if you are looking for a quality AYCE KBBQ place in KTOWN!"
8/19/2020,1 star rating,Don't think bc of the recent reviews they are open... Don't waste your time. They should at least update their voicemail to reflect latest hours... I wasn't the only one that showed up disappointed.
10/7/2018,5 star rating,"This is probably the best AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant in Los Angeles. Parking can be stressful. There are street meters, residential parking, and valet parking available. Valet parking is $3. Since Hae Jang Chon is in a plaza with Kyochon (Korean bbq wings), two boba places, and another kbbq place, the valet team are working hard. Don't expect them to get your car super quickly, be patient. They're trying their hardest.When you get here, make sure to put your name down with the host. Wait Â ranges on when you get there. Wait can be 10 minutes - 1.5 hours. Everything is just the best here. Staff are super, super friendly. They're quick and efficient. They're ALWAYS helpful. They help you cook the food from time to time. The quality of meats and side dishes are great quality. They korean pancake is my fave side dish. I will definitely be coming back again and again."
8/1/2021,3 star rating,"The price increased to 40 and the grill changed. I didnt like new but old looking grill. The staff was okay, but I remember they were nicer before pandemic. I used to to other place but i missed here so I went yesterday but something changed. If you miss the old times haejangchon you might not see the same place that we used to go to. The meat was great though."
12/18/2019,5 star rating,This is one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ ever...I'm from NorCal and got this while in LA. The meats are so high quality and it's great tasting! The sides are good too especially fish cakes. It's spicy. I like it. Beef belly and Canadian pork belly were the best. I'd go here a lot if I lived in SoCal. Go here for sure.
9/25/2018,5 star rating,"09/20/2018Yes, my first review was ten years old. So, fast forward to ten years later. Last Thursday, I'm glad to see they expanded into the next place next door. They needed more space but that hasn't changed anything. Not surprising, the wait is the same. The stone grill is the same. The service is the same. The price is the same, I think. What definitely hasn't changed is the marinade for the meats. Why have I waited so long to come back is all I could ask myself.Most places, I cannot go KBBQ by myself. So with someone that has been craving for KBBQ for weeks on end, I get to come here to indulge. The dipping sauce hasn't taste this good with a hint of garlic right in it. A few orders of brisket sliced so thin. It's not paper thin so you could load up on this and still get full. I wanted the marinated short rib meat which is like a steak all by itself. As long as there is the rice wrappers and raddish wrappers, I can keep making my own version of Korean tacos. I probably said this in my previous review but if you have cravings, I know the cook."
2/16/2008,4 star rating,"Since this conflicted with another UYE I'll be attending, it was not possible to come here on February 19th. The meat here is fantastic. The kalbi is thick, juicy, with great marbeling. Even better medium well instead of burnt to a crisp. The bacon is tasty but I don't like it that crispy either. The brisket is fabulous, thick cut instead of that really paper thin crap at other locations. Well worth it for the meats here and even more with our waitress, A. Lee, who got what we needed each time. She even cleans the grill after each order of meat so the cooking is that much better when you eat. The kimchi on the grill with the pancake thing is where you put the cooked meat so it doesn't get charred. We get lots of rice paper as she calls it and enough of the radish wrappers to make myself some K-tacos. Reasonably priced for what we get to eat. Will accompany anyone to come here to keep my clothes smelling like meat.One last thing, this is a fellow Yelpers treasured secret locations. To this Yelper, I hated this place with a passion. Will never come back here again in spite of the fact."
7/17/2021,2 star rating,"It was my second experience here at hae jang chon because I had a good experience the first time around a few years back. Came here around 9:45pm and was seated around 10:25pm. We ordered and rounds of meat and felt extremely rush because they wanted to clean up, didn't get to enjoy the food as much. Quality of meats was decent, nothing special. Additionally prices went up to 39.99, which I think is pretty steep for what many other Kbbq places in LA offer."
2/21/2020,5 star rating,"Service here is amazing! The meats here are absolutely the best quality as well. There's ALWAYS a wait here- people would rather wait 2-3 hours for a spot here rather than go somewhere, that should explain a lot. You can make reservations if you have a party of 6 or more. I recently stopped eating meat, but still come here with friends and I'm so glad they have a veggie dish (bibimbap). Not many AYCE KBBQ places have a veggie option, so this is a definite plus in my book! If you're visiting LA, I would definitely recommend coming here to try it out."
7/27/2021,1 star rating,"Another Korean BBQ, another discriminatory policy. This establishment REFUSES SERVICE to single customers. HOW IS THIS EVEN LEGAL??? The fact that you would descriminate against a customer because their party isn't ""large enough"" is absolutely disgusting and a stain on your reputation. Would give 0 stars if possible. I'm absolutely disgusted."
10/24/2019,4 star rating,Ahhh the one and only. My first KBBQ experience was here. The great service. Good price with a fair choice of meats. Bear ME when I tell you there will be a wait. I've come in both small and large parties and there is always a wait. A single women's restroom. The staff cook your meat and are very attentive. You don't need to ask them to change your grill they will do it before you have the opportunity. For always being a full house they're service is great. Good priced good food. What more could you want ?? Parking is a ..... nvm. You get the point zero parking unless you're lucky ? We get valet $4. Right out front.

7/14/2021,1 star rating,"I'm from SF and always love to come this place. My first time was last 2 years ago. In that time the price was 20 something. Moreover in that time all the meats were good. Then 2 days ago we were waiting for an hour for this place but it was find cause I really love this place. This first thing that was surprise me was the price that 39.99$ omg. But it was find for the price because i believe they are using the good meat. But in this time the meats that we got was disappointed us. It was not good like before. If compare to the price, I think it is not worth. Not only me, I post it on IG story. My friends ask me how was it. I told then it was not good like before. So, they told me they were here 2 months ago. It was not good too. Please bring back that good quality of meats. We really love to come back."
6/2/2021,3 star rating,"Waited nearly 1.5 hrs for a party of 9 this past Saturday. Got 2 tables inside side by side. Service was ok. Food was mediocre. Marinates were too sweet and the dressing on the drenched salad was too sweet too. Had several servings of the prime steak and marinated short ribs. The kimchi pancakes was too cakey and the bean soup was real salty. Â Thought this being in ktown would be more authentic, but 90% of the customers being non Asian pretty much says it all."
8/29/2020,1 star rating,"They are closed and I honestly hope it stays that way. The staff was ALWAYS extremely rude and their prices are outrageous. Never spent less than $120 for 2 here. The side portions are tiny and the servers were always bothered when you ask for more, I didn't even know ordering more sides was an option that's how uncomfortable they make you feel. This place is just hype now. Not to mention the wait is guaranteed to be longer than 45 minutes every single time. Pfff screw that. Eat elsewhere."
12/18/2018,3 star rating,"This place used to be a lot better. I came here on a Saturday night with a party of 12 for my friend's birthday. The brisket was SO DRY and gross. The beef tongue was super good though so we just kept ordering that. But I think a Korean ayce should have their brisket down. Also, their kimchi fried rice was not how I remembered it. It was really bland and dry this time too. Our female server Gina was so rude!! She had so much attitude and everyone at my table agreed. Our male servers were nice and that made up for it a little I guess. Parking is $2 for valet."
10/29/2019,5 star rating,"Probably my favorite kbbq for the price + quality of meats and sides you get. Truly, if I want to take my friends to an amazing place where they won't complain about the price + be satisfied, this place is it. The food is DELICIOUS."

3/2/2020,5 star rating,"AYCE Korean bbq!!!! Â I was told to check this place out in the Korea town in LA and I'm so glad that I did. Â Was also told to come early and once again very glad for that advice. It was a Monday night and we got there at 5pm and had a choice of tables to sit in. Â Within the next 40 minutes there was a line of waiting folks outside the restaurant. Â  The price was great!! Â 25.99/ lunch and 27.99/ dinner. Â Three of us ate all the kalbi( marinated and unmarinated), bulgogi, shrimp, flank, squid and vegetables to our delight. Â  The steamed egg dish and the miso soup was really good. Â Loved all the side dishes. Â Service was quick and attentive till it got a bit busy and that was understandable. Â  You can't lose with this price for quality and quantity. Â  Get here early!!!"
2/3/2020,5 star rating,"This place just jumped to the top of my list for AYCE kbbq. Holyyyyyyy my mind Â was blown. Coming from Texas, kbbq is the same price, but here they cook it for you as well?! Shook. The meat was so flavorful, juicy, and TENDER. Every bite was amazing until the last when we finished off with the kimchi fried rice. I wish I took more pictures! We came around 6 and the wait was starting to build up, so come early if you don't want to wait 1.5+ hours. I will definitely be back next time I am in town (which will probably not be too far away honestly...), so I can't Â wait to come back!"
2/13/2021,1 star rating,"I'm sure this place is great and it smelled great. However, I went in on a Saturday night, it was busy as expected. I went to put my name down for 4 of us and was told it would be a 3.5 hour wait and last call was in in 2.5 hours. I was fine with what the host told me. Then another worker interjects and said ""yeah you're not getting a table tonight"". WTF man? Not necessary at all. I told the first guy thank you and the second guy that his answer was rude and uncalled for, and totally unnecessary. He shrugged it off and walked away. Too bad. This post will probably go unnoticed by management so whatever."
12/28/2021,1 star rating,Don't ever order or go here. This is the worst kbbq there is. They don't know how to cook and don't listen to the customers. Believe me and save yourself the headache this place deserves to get shitted on. They don't care about the clients remember that!!! You will think about this post I promise you! Â DO NOT GO HERE!!! EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! FOOD IS TERRIBLE HERE AS WELL!!! There's plenty of better spot down the street!
6/24/2021,5 star rating,My favorite eat all you can Kbbq! Wait time will be ridiculous but it's worth it! You can go next door and have some drinks and some food while you wait for a table (especially on a Friday night)
12/23/2019,5 star rating,"First timer here. The place is really busy, and there's a reason why. You get a lot for what you pay. The servers are polite and friendly, although service can be a bit slow at times, maybe because there are so few servers for such a big place. The food was amazing, especially the marinated short rib and the bulgogi. Highly recommend this place!"
3/5/2020,5 star rating,"My bf and I were in the area and decided to switch it up! We had been to this location before and given our pleasant experience, came again. We got there right before lunch time (11am) and were seated promptly. Ordered our drinks as we decided what 3 meats we wanted. After much thought we went with BBQ chicken, steak, and shrimp. My tastebuds loved all 3. Our server helped cook our food although I would give it a turn or two. Our 2 round we ordered thinly brisket x 2 and shrimp. Again, tastebuds were happy! Our last round we ordered, thinly brisket x 2 and steak. With no surprise tastebuds were smiling!Atmosphere is calm and quiet. Unlike some other restaurants that you can barely hear yourself speak, it was perfect.The service was great! Server was attentive and always checked in on us to ensure we were good.As much as I would like to pin point negatives, there was none!"
6/20/2021,4 star rating,"Meat quality: I would say 5/5 quality on the meats and they were cut nicely and tasted very goodSides: there was a variety of sides that tasted amazing alongside the meats.Meat choice: 3/5 rating for the variety of meats. They have the most basic cuts and types of meats on their menu. They had brisket and pork belly and other classics, but I feel that there could've been a wider selectionService: 4/5 they were very efficient and fast with their orders.Wait: I waited about 2hours to get seated on a Saturday evening. It was not super difficult to wait that long but anticipate a long wait on the weekends. Also, as of right now the Yelp waitlist feature is not accurate."
1/6/2020,5 star rating,Absolutely one of the best Korean all you can eat in ktown!. If you want to make a reservations make it the day before. They dont take resos the day of. But damn worth the wait...... hahaha
9/1/2018,5 star rating,"I unknowingly came here on both of my last two LA trips but that was because the BBQ here is legit. When you think of KBBQ you've gotta make a stop in ktown and this is a great choice for meat. High quality meat here that comes with delicious bonchon Korean sides.The short rib and brisket are what I'd recommend getting multiple orders of. Spicy pork belly is also quite tasty. If you're adventurous you can try the octopus or less desirable intestines and cow tongue.The kimchi fried rice is amazing at the end of the meal and you need to get it! The service here is great, always prompt to bring out your food and take orders. They clean the grill using radish, which I've never seen anywhere else. Expect to spend between $25-30 a person here.Food: 4.5/5Value: 4.5/5Service: 4.75/5Overall: 4.5/5"
2/15/2021,1 star rating,Waited over an hour to be seated and when it was our turn the host gave the 2 open tables to guests who came after us. I wish she could have told me she didn't like us earlier so we could have went somewhere else. Thank you for wasting my time!
3/31/2021,4 star rating,Super long wait but its worth it. One of the best value meets quality AYCE KBbq places in LA. I used to go all the time when I lived in Ktown. Still lives up to the hype
12/5/2021,3 star rating,"DO NOT FALL FOR THE HYPE! . Waited 2.5 hours for our first time dining experience on a Saturday night (understandably busy). Lady told my wife roughly it'll be an hour or so wait. We waited for 2.5 hours. PROS: good service, large portions, decent meats, the steak is BOMB!, side dishes are okay; ban chan was good. CONS: typical kbbq place so not worth the 2.5 hour wait unless you're into people watching. I went there with my wife and 2 kids so my only purpose is to eat. Thought it would be a good idea to go to Ktown for some legit kbbq but turned out to be just typical that I could've has near our house with maybe 20-30 min wait on a weekend. I don't find it compelling to wanna come back here again unless I am in the area and there is not wait... Sorry. It's all a hype."
8/20/2019,4 star rating,Came here for lunch by myself so you cannot participate in ayce unless you pay for 2 people. Â But the good thing is that they have lunch specials so I ordered the short rib soup. It was very tasty and good portion for me. It came with all the banchans which was great $10.94 for lunch ! Wow. Great and cheap. Will be back again for sure!! Trust!!!
6/3/2021,4 star rating,"Long lines, this is a popular ktown AYCE spot. I wish they didn't charge extra for lettuce and sesame leaves because those are such a staple for Korean barbecue. Otherwise pretty good options for meat."

8/19/2019,5 star rating,"Must valet car on weekend or if you are lucky you can park outside on the meters. Valet is $3.00, worth it. Don't let the amount of people standing outside discourage you, it goes by pretty fast. We were seated about 10 minutes of getting there. Stone grill for kbbq is new to me, I couldn't wait to try. The meat doesnt stick to the grill like those other places, which frustrates me because the grill burn quicker and gets sticky. The service is great, the meat quality is delicious, it's a good place to go eat KBBQ if your out in koreatown. Must try. They also clean the stone grill in front of you with radishes. Mind blown..cost effective on the cleaning process and no harsh chemicals."
6/28/2021,5 star rating,"Came here a few times during my trips to So-Cal and I can't wait to go back. The first time I came here was on my birthday in 2018 and I still think about it sometimes. The wait time was long but 100% worth it. The service is good, the food and meat quality is good and the employees are very friendly."
2/7/2020,4 star rating,"Given that this place was listed as the first result on Yelp for Korean bbq in LA and that there was a 1hr wait (it was Friday night), I expected it to be really good. However, it was good, but not good enough for me to want to come again, as opposed to trying some other kbbq places in LA. Rather than getting the meat and cooking yourself, the servers take your order (3 items at a time) and grill everything for you. They come by occasionally to check on the meat or clean the grill. But sometimes, the meat was left a little overcooked, so we just ended up cooking it ourselves towards the end. When your plate is almost empty, they always ask if you want to order more, and they never seemed reluctant whenever you do, which was nice. They even encourage you to order more, since they can bring up to 3 things out at a time. I did find it kind of wasteful though because every time you do order anything, they bring you a giant plate with enough servings for the whole table. Most of the time, we just want 1-2 servings or to try a little, so we had to remind them every time to just bring a little out. Once you are seated, the whole table is also filled with all kinds of side dishes, which was also a waste since we don't finish them all.As for the food, I wasn't blown away either. My favorite kbbq dishes are always bulgogi and galbi. However, they both weren't seasoned that well. I also love eating galbi with the bone in because of the texture, but they cut out all the bone for you and only bring you the meat part. Still, everything was pretty tasty, and I would come back. But given that there are so many kbbq places in the area, I would rather try another place where the meat is phenomenal. All the places nearby, including here, are all $30/person for dinner, so I don't think the quality will be too different, just the seasoning/taste."
2/2/2021,1 star rating,"I've come here for years, love the food but today we just had a terrible issue occur. Â As we're waiting to be seated I asked if my handicap mother can have a chair to sit on. Â They said yes then disappeared. I borrowed a chair from a table with a spare one. Then the host came and yank the chair from under my my handicap mother and left. Â She almost fell. Â When I asked for a manager he apologized and said no chairs for waiting sorry. Â We could've just waited in the car, you don't just pull a chair from a handicap person ( double hip surgery btw).

12/27/2021,1 star rating,"I usually don't leave reviews but i've been here about 5 times and it seems that the servers discriminate against latinos! I have left good tips every-time for the reason being that I enjoy the food. But i went today & the service was absolutely horrible, our server Sarah was rude off the bat, I kindly asked for salad 3 TIMES Â and never ended up getting it, asked for water 2 TIMES and again never got to our table, it got to the point where i had to asked another server for it and he kindly brought it in no time. As i was observing me & my party noticed Sarah Â was attentive to her other tables and would bring out the things they would ask for in no time, she would pass by our table without even acknowledging us or asking us if we needed anything! Overall this restaurant should consider who they hire."
1/31/2020,4 star rating,"Ah, how can you resist going to a Korean AYCE bbq place in LA? The hubs and I definitely can't! We tried this place because of the vast amount of positive reviews. I really enjoyed the stone grill they used to cook our food. There's this hole where they scrape all the fats and oil into a separate dish for easy clean up. Servers come by and basically help you cook the food, so they stop by frequently and are observant of your needs. We tried everything under pork and ALMOST everything under beef (with exceptions of hot dog, intestine, and tripe). The hubs loved the octopus and beef tongue the most. I'm sure I enjoyed everything. We stayed away from rice (until the very end when we got the kimchi fried rice) and ate our meat with radish wraps (which were delicious and refreshing). Ah now I'm craving Korean BBQ. Yum. We left feeling round and satisfied!"
10/26/2019,5 star rating,"I wasn't sure how meat could taste different from all these amazing kbbq places in ktown.... but this place proved me wrong. Never have I once thought beef tongue reigned supreme over brisket or bulgogi, but I was proven wrong by this place.I would go so far to put the hierarchy of meat as beef tongue, brisket, bulgogi. The wait time was not that long, waiting for about 20 minutes and the parking is all valet. But I have heard about long wait times being a normal thing for this place.We were served extremely fast and had our requests filled, servers never forgetting our orders, etc.I was honestly so impressed what the quality of meats and the variety of options like steamed egg. This place goes beyond the quality of meat and shows their quality in their banchan and other orders. The only downside is that it can be a little pricey(paying up to $35). However, you get quality in every aspect of food and service - which to me is totally worth the hefty bill.If you had to take one thing from my review... ORDER BEEF TONGUE, an absolute must."
1/25/2020,5 star rating,There's a reason this place has a 2+ hour wait: the food and service are amazing! I love the fact that the food cooks on a cast iron for that delicious *maillard reaction*. My fave sides here are the fish cakes and rice paper. The best part of the experience though is how they clean the grill. They dump a bunch of radish noodles and scrape them around to clean. It's super efficient (and entertaining!)Protip: come here super early (like 4:45pm for dinner or 11:15 for lunch) and there's going to be a 15 min wait... even on a Saturday!
11/25/2020,1 star rating,"The Host was less than helpful. On the final night before lockdown, at 8pm we arrived hoping to get a table. The host tried to discourage us from waiting by saying ""We can add your name to the list, but it's an hour wait and the last call for meat is at 9pm."" Being in the service industry, we knew that it was a bluff so we decided to stay. After letting us wait for 20 minutes, he told us that in his opinion ""they weren't going to be able to seat us"".Why wouldn't you just say that to begin with instead of wasting our time? We were also the only black people in the restaurant, and I didn't see him telling anyone else that. JUST SAYING."
3/20/2021,1 star rating,"Absolutely horrible service. We had to wait ""20 minutes"" over and over again. ""Come back in 20"" they said. Well we've waited over 3 hours and we still have not been seated. You might as well call this place ""Cap Chon"" cause let me tell you they are not true to their word. We haven't even eaten so basically I don't even know about the food. I will post an update later. But as of right now, if it wasn't for my friend, I would have left already. This is my first night in LA and this has been by far one of the worst restaurant experiences that I've ever had. The host had no regard for us. 1 star."
5/22/2021,2 star rating,"I probably wouldn't go to this AYCE again. The meat quality was ok. The thinly sliced pork belly was dry. Main issue I had with this place was we felt rushed the entire time eating. It was just me and my boyfriend eating, we ordered 2 plates of meat and they brought out meat for like 4 people. So if you plan on going with one other person, I would just order half plates. We weren't able to try everything because they would throw all the meat on to the grill, we also didn't want the meat to overcook so we were shoving food down our throats. It was not enjoyable LOL. They even gave us our check before we finish the last plate of meat. The servers were nice. We went on a Monday for lunch, lines weren't long but they still rushed us."
10/3/2019,5 star rating,"Holy shit, yes. This is a top rated KBBQ spot on Yelp for excellent reason. Best value, quality meats, and actually not to terrible of a wait, at least at 2pm on Sunday! Over 30 items to choose from on the AYCE menu--knock yourself out with the meat but don't forget the kimchi pancake and steamed egg! They are so so very good. Top meats IMO: beef belly, bulgogi, intestine, squid. Of course go with the classic beef brisket and pork belly too!"
5/8/2021,5 star rating,Great selection of meat and amazing service! One of the best kbbq service you'll get. It's a bit pricey but I think it's worth coming here and giving this place a shot. My favorite are brisket and pork belly
12/14/2018,5 star rating,Food: This place is definitely one of the top 3 AYCE KBBQ restaurants I've been too. You can tell they take their time making all of their banchan. The protein selection was ample and every single one I tried was of good quality. Their steamed egg and kimchi pancakes are amazing!!Service: The waiters help you cook here and are very attentive! We only had to request things once and they brought everything immediately.I'm definitely going to come back... once I burn the 10k calories I consumed :(
1/11/2020,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is one of the best AYCE kbbq places I've been to. They have a decent list of options to choose from for AYCE and their meat is pretty quality.

11/11/2019,5 star rating,"BEST damn kbbq I've ever had!! From service, price, & quality, this has it ALL. We went here straight after getting off the plane from LAX/grabbing our rental car. The wait was about 45 minutes. We were seated about midnight. The wait was long but once seated, we were immediately taken care of. Side dishes replenished -- very generously, water filled without asking, gave us napkins without asking either!! On top of it all? THEY COOKED FOR US. This was my highlight. On TOP of that, at the end, they make you kimchi fried rice!!!! I don't know if we went on a good day, or the fact that we sat right in the middle of the front where the servers walked past, but mannnnn. This will be my go to if I were to go to any kbbq in SOCAL."

10/12/2020,1 star rating,"I don't understand how this place has so many good reviews! Horrible customer service! Can't say anything about the food because we didn't stay to try it! The lady in charge of placing people seems to be prejudice. I felt discriminated so I will never return to this please and make sure all my friends know NOT to go here!When we got to this place we saw tables outside and inside; there were no people outside and a few people inside. We wanted to be inside too but the Lady said that we can't sit inside. I was surprised and asked ""then how come where are people inside?"" She got mad at me and said ""okay"". Once we were seated, she threw menus on the table and left. I had a question about how it worked since it was a bit confusing but she didn't even bother to answer my question. We decided to leave because it was obvious that she didn't need customers. Â These days going out is not as fun as it used to be and this place made even worse. It was a birthday celebration and it was almost ruined but we were lucky to find a better place after we left this one. To be honest, it seems they don't need customers so I recommend going somewhere else!!!"

He said ""no closed"" My friends and I were surprised because we had checked their closing time before coming. Yelp indicated 11:30. We showed him our phone then he said ""closed, closed lights out"" and walked away. There was no waiting parties, open outdoor tables that were being serviced as if a party had just left. We had to scramble to find an alternative that was nearby, opened and had an outdoor sit down option on the fly. Please update your times to avoid this to happening to others."
7/11/2018,5 star rating,"I LOVE this place. Every time I'm in LA I insist on coming here. There is always a crowd at all hours of the day. NorCal Korean BBQ just doesn't compare.They have 27 different offerings - plenty of beef, chicken, pork, and seafood options. My personal favorite is the steamed eggs and thick cut pork belly.This place is different than the self-service BBQ restaurants. The staff comes around to cook your food. Depending on how busy it is, sometimes it's a little frustrating waiting for your waiter to come by. Regardless, the food is so worth it.The biggest draw to this place is the kimchi fried rice they serve at the end of the meal. Usually I'm too full by that point but it's so delicious."
12/17/2019,4 star rating,"Maybe one of the better BBQ place in the area if you are craving for Pork Belly. This place is known for their pork belly as well as their brisket. The BBQ grill is the best part of it, as it is meant to be for pork belly. They use a totally different grill from the ones they use at other BBQ places. The best part is that they are open til late (2am) and it's all you can eat BBQ. So if you are craving for pork belly, head to Hae Jang Chon."
8/1/2019,5 star rating,"Wowowow best ayce kbbq ever!!! Was in town, asked a Korean buddy for a recommendation and got this place. First off, be prepared for a wait. Their ""business"" level on google maps isn't very accurate. I tried to come two weeknights in a row and were quoted hour long waits, they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 people. The second night I decided to suck it up and stay - 15/10 worth it!!!!! You can order three meats at a time, really like that some appetizers/sides are included with AYCE like rice, kimchi pancake etc. We got brisket, marinated short rib, pork jowl, pork belly and beef tongue. The meats were all amazing quality, brisket wasn't marinated and still delicious. Marinated short rib tender and a little sweet. I've never had pork jowl before and LOVED it - tender and fatty, so delicious. Beef tongue is also a favorite, a little bit chewy and sliced super thin. I believe it was $27.99 per person and I loved every minute of it. Waiter was super nice and attentive, cleaning our stone grill multiple times and bring our extra kimchi. It was interesting that the grill was a flat stone top rather than the usual metal, I think less food got stuck and it got cooked better. Trust me - put your name on that list, go grab a boba down the block and enjoy the delicious meats!!"

The price is not to bad for take out compared to other places where for two people you spend maybe $100. My bf ordered two orders of bugolgi and two of brisket, came with sides and rice for about $60ish and it was enough to fill us up both! The meat was yummy, would have wish for a few different sides but I didn't mind and it was so nicely packaged!"

7/7/2018,4 star rating,"There isn't a whole lot to say that hasn't been covered. Not a whole lot of banchans and meat selection. But the meats they have are on point. Good quality for ayce and not overly marinated. Unmarinated and marinated short ribs, brisket are my go tos. Service is good and they check on you periodically while grilling for you. Stone grill is an added bonus. Steamed egg and kimchi pancake are ehhh."
6/6/2021,5 star rating,This is my favorite kbbq spot in K town. The wait is always extremely long (allow 2 hours) but it is worth it. The workers work really fast and are super helpful!
11/26/2021,3 star rating,"I think the list would be more efficient if they didn't let people who didn't answer their name being called to be placed back where they were. It just slows things down. If they didn't answer their name being called be placed in the back because it's holding up the line, thanks"
3/25/2021,5 star rating,Wow awesome!!! Â No wonder why ppl line out to street. Â Good food and amazing service. Â Love it when they cook for you!!! Will come back!! Thin slice pork was my favorite.
9/13/2019,3 star rating,"It's all you can eat, which that also means... lowest quality for their profit. I had Korean BBQ in South Korea before, so it's really hard to set my bar low after that. It's really good place for meat, but if you are a true foodie which respect quality and not quantity, this is pretty bad as Korean BBQ... might as well just dump package sauces you buy from Korean grocery on the meat you bought from costco and cook at home. That might actually tastes better than this. I understand this is a good place for so many others, but if you had the real deal, this is comparatively very low quality. Especially the bulgogi and the ribs. It's so thin cut or very chopped, I don't understand. Also the side dishes are bad. The kimchi is way too sour (in the fridge/fermented for too long?), the side dishes are all not cold but rather warm. Even the barley tea tastes like water... So disappointed. I hope people are aware that this is for quantity. If you are here for just the amount of food, then yes please come and you will get very full for one price; but if you want quality, please pay the price and go somewhere. Or? Like me, went to Korea, and never look back. lol I loved Korean food after the trip to Korea, their BBQ is also expensive but as my Korean friend told me, they don't usually go out to eat except for social event. So, Korean BBQ is something they only do for special outing. So,expensive for a reason! It's not worth it to wait 2+ hours for, go make your own or pay the price! Not recommended."

6/28/2020,3 star rating,"The staff replaced the grill regularly which definitely helped with smoke great serviceThe place is nice. Fast and friendly crew The meat was not fresh ,the fried rice was really good"
6/27/2020,5 star rating,I was blown away how great this place was. Â For the grill it is a stone grill top. Our waitress Amy 6/27/20 was amazing she very attentive. Best Korean BBQ I have ever been too. Â Honestly my new go to place for a special occasion. Do not order more than you can eat. Â They did a great job under the new Covid-19 social distancing regulation. They take your temperature via long distance robot scan before you enter. Â The seats are spaced apart and clear dividers to create some distance. Everything was amazing. Best octopus I have ever had. The best Korean BBQ brisket I have ever had. The marinated beef short ribs were great. No slow rolling the meat out to you. Â There was hardly a time meat was not cooking. A+
6/27/2020,4 star rating,"This is one of the better Korean BBQ spots in the area. Â Everything we got was fresh and tasty and service was great. Â We got short rib, pork belly, and Bulgogi, marinated and unmarinated, just to name a few. Â Everything was delicious."
6/24/2020,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is SUPER expensive. But that's only because their customer service and quality of meats is more top-notch than other Korean bbq places. They cook their meats for you, they make their rice for you, their employees are very hands on when it comes to treating you.I would say the quality of their meat is in the middle -- I've been to other Kbbq spots that are expensive because their meats are actually top-notch, not due to their customer delivery. I heard someone from my school got food poisoning from Hae Jang Chon right before graduation. -__-"
6/22/2020,1 star rating,"I'm really upset because we showed up on a Monday night at 1015pm, the host let us know that last call was at 1030pm. We decided we were gonna go somewhere else. Some older lady chased us out and said we could order as much as we wanted before they closed. Once we sat down the waiter said only 3 orders at once. I basically spent 150$ on 4 people for about one plate of meat. Rediciulous. Cmon guys, y'all should have just been honest with us, let us go elsewhere. Must be hurting post CoVID for $$$.Oh.. and 10 min into dinner they forced us to pay."
6/21/2020,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is always one of my favorite kbbq places in town. Just went there for dinner after lockdown - acye menu and price are the same as before lockdown (and as delicious!). I appreciate they had hygiene protocols: checking temperature before entering, putting hand sanitizer at every table, installing dividers between tables, using disposable dishes and utensils etc. The restaurant did a great job making customers feel safer with all these measures; just that other customers did not seem to follow them strictly: some of them did not put Â their masks back on when they went to washroom or walked out of the restaurant. When some walked right by my table talking to their friends without a mask on (literally like 1 feet away from me), I was really paranoid. Â There is only this much restaurants can do for us; I hope people can take the protocols more seriously - we're still fighting COVID, and should take extra steps to make sure we actually follow those protocols!"
6/15/2020,5 star rating,It has been 3 months since the last time I dine-in. Ari is an exceptional person! Fantastic customer service!
6/15/2020,5 star rating,"So, we showed up on the Post-COVID opening day at 11:40am. Seated immediately, servers are maintaining the mandatory 6' rule by standing on the obligatory dots on the ground. All food is served in plastic dishes and silverware, aside from the shears and tongs, have been replaced with plastic versions. The servers can not currently assist you with cooking due to restrictions, so you are left to cook your own food for the most part; They do try to help as much as possible, but i'm sure this will be massively reduced when they get busy. New addition to the menu is USDA Prime Steak (YUM!!!). Food was amazing as always, and for all you kimchi freaks (*raises hand*), the kimchi has had tons of time to ferment so it is AMAZING! Like curl your toes good; Normies need not apply :)Anyway, get back in and support this amazing AYCE restaurant!"
6/11/2020,3 star rating,Meat ok but way too expensive for the quantity and quality of the meat. Sides were good. Service was good.
6/27/2019,5 star rating,"Wow, okay this place exceeded my expectations to the nth degree.My friend and I came here for lunch, the parking lot is small, but they have valet, plus there's free parking down the street! When we first walked in, we were amazed by how nice the place looked, and we were excited to cook on the stone pan that they have. We didn't have any wait and lunch price was 25.99 for AYCE. With the price of 25.99, you get the option to order many things that other kbbq places don't offer for that price point. Their sauce trays have ssamjang, brisket sauce, sesame oil, and chili paste already. They also provide you with kimchi, fish cakes (spicy), potato salad with apple pieces, radish paper, and rice paper. For the meats, they have marinated beef short ribs, beef tongue, and so much more! Our favorites would have to be the beef belly, sliced pork belly, beef tongue, and the squid. The meat quality was great, but I think I'd pass on the brisket and go for the beef belly instead. For $5 they give you a full plate of lettuce wraps and perilla (sesame) leaves. I've never gone to a kbbq place that had the perilla leaves, and trying them for the first time, I would say the $5 was worth it! They also allow you to refill the whole plate once for no additional charge.For sides, they offer steamed egg, tofu stew, and also not common to other places, kimchi pancake. Lastly, you can choose to have it during your meal or after, they make you kimchi fried rice! This was soo good, we opted for cheese on it, and even though we were full, it brought back our appetite. The service here is amazing. Multiple people were helping us out and everyone was extremely nice and polite. Here, similar to Quarters, they cook for you, but you also have the option to cook alongside with them. Not that you need to, because they are sooo on it. They check on the meat constantly and let you know immediately. You're in good hands.This kbbq restaurant is amazing, and there are many desserts places to go after like Souffles and Cafe Bora. I swear, you just need to go, if you like korean bbq, this place is going to change your world!"
7/16/2019,5 star rating,"This is my boyfriends and my favorite KBBQ place! The price is medium ~$30 for AYCE dinner, but the quality of the meat is really good and the service is always great. I've never waited less than 1.5 hours to eat here, but it always seems worth while in the end. The hostess always surprises me with how she manages the line. There's $3 valet parking and a few cafes next door so you can kill time while you wait, but the hostess will periodically call out names just to see who is actually waiting there, so if you leave make sure you tell her when you get back. The servers are insanely hard working and they will actually cook all the meat for you here, which I thought was funny at first but really nice! My fave is the brisket and pork belly. I don't particularly care for the kimchi pancake or the kimchi fried rice at the end, but everything else I've had and the side dishes are awesome."
5/17/2018,4 star rating,"Whoa! What a wait! This spot is crazy busy, but with good reason! Prime cuts of beef, and great service make this spot worth it.Hae Jang Chon does Korean BBQ a little differently by utilizing a stone plate instead of the standard metal grate. They offer up a nice variety of meats, which are readily available and quickly delivered upon request.I'm not a fan of the bon chon, but they provide a healthy quantity if you're into it. The kimchi is not my taste, but the spinach was good!When the food is cooking on the plate, make sure you take it off when it's done. It'll be a sizzled crisp, if you don't!Don't forget the kimchi bokumbop (fried rice) at the end, if you still have room!"
8/26/2020,4 star rating,"This spot was cool, good food a bit pricy and the service not that great. This place has outside dining which was nice. I enjoyed cooking my own food but I'm not a fan but I wanted to try it anyways. Overall it was a different experience."

7/18/2018,4 star rating,"This is a great AYCE place with cool vibes. You are seated only when your full party is present. I have never been at a Korean restaurant where the pan chan or sides were at our table before we sat down. :) Choices: really spicy fish cake, spinach with sesame oil, sweet shredded radishes, potato salad with apples and fermented bean sprouts. Two friends, Korean BBQ first timers, loved the potato salad. I loved the simple steamed egg but why do otherwise good Korean places have meh kimchee? It was old, overly fermented.You can have for rice, rice paper and round white pickled radish slices as you stuff your faces.Great service - they cooked most of our meat for us. The meat is cooked on a stone, not metal. It was interesting that the stone is cleaned naturally between bbq'ing rounds with radish threads.AYCE dinner is $26 per person. Great deal given the quality of the meat but each party is limited to 3 meats from menu.Breakdown of our yummy proteins:Short rib is boneless and LEANSpicy pork was fatty and wonderfully spicyBeef bulgogi was average in fat content but delishLoved the steamed eggThe bathroom is clean and nicely decorated, hard to describe, but hip.Big flat screen tv also boasts the menu One big tv at entrance showing a sports game. I wish I had tried here sooner as I work nearby. It does get loud in hear but I can kick my voice up a notch so I'll be back!"
5/22/2021,5 star rating,"AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE, pretty much as close as perfect as you can get! Came in around 3pm and there was about a 30 min wait, don't get turned off if the hosts seem a bit stand-offish, I've worked at various restaurants and at places as busy as this you have to be a bit stern to get parties moving.I want to shout out Ari, our amazing server who was exceptionally outstanding. For catering to all our needs and just having an outstanding attitude, I would come here again just to be served by her! Justin was also great!Now for the meats the galbi, chadol(beef brisket), and beef fingers were top of the line! The pork belly was also great but not as good as I thought it would be, still very good though!Overall it's an amazing experience! A must eat place if you are visiting LA."
6/17/2019,5 star rating,"Korean BBQ is a Southern California staple. Delicious, plentiful, and available in several different neighborhoods. As a big fan of the all you can eat nature of (most) Korean BBQ places, I've sampled my fair share of spots around town where quantity rules over quality, but here at Hae Jang Chon, you can expect the quality to be high, service to be attentive, and the quantity to be more than your heart's desires.Located in a busy plaza in the heart of Koreatown, be prepared to fork over $3 for valet parking lest you spend several minutes circling the surrounding neighborhoods for parking. Once there, expect to find yourself at the bottom of a long list of parties itching for their turn to experience a blissful 2 hours of all you can eat meaty, greasy, delicious goodness. Lunch is priced at $25.99 and dinner at $27.99 with a 2 hour price limit for eating.HJC features a long menu of meat options, with my favorites being the thin and thickly slicked pork belly, beef brisket, beef belly, spicy pork, and beef bulgogi. Don't forget to order your kimchi pancakes and steamed egg on the side! Banchan (side dishes) include tasty spinach, fish cake, potato salad, rice paper, and radish wrap. Unlike other places that use a metal grill at the table for cooking, HJC uses round stone grills that make the meat cook quickly, evenly, and retains a lot of the flavor and natural juices from the meat. Delicious! Cooking utensils are provided and the servers are always willing to help you cut and cook the meats if you're a novice at the KBBQ experience. Make sure your pork and chicken products are fully cooked. Beef products can be cooked as thoroughly as you wish to fit your specifications for doneness.Top off your meal by saving some leftover meats, or go big and order some extra meat for your meal-ending kimchi fried rice, which is prepared with rice, seaweed, kimchi, and your available meats and is a delicious and tasty treat for the end of your meal. Leave space for this as it is incredible and cannot be missed! There are 4 dipping sauces served with your meal, with my favorite being the sesame oil with salt. The best!So, overall:-The good: Amazing food, long list of selections, effective and efficient service, and kimchi fried rice! The hype here is very real, and the wait is worth it! Open from 11am to 2am! -The bad: If you are impatient or hangry, you might be best eating somewhere else unless you come during off-peak hours. Wait can be an hour or more, depending on the size of your group. -The ugly: Parking in this particular lot is always hard to get. Suck it up and pay the $3 for valet. You may not have a choice in the matter, anyway. Minimum party is 2 people, so you're forced to have at least 1 friend to come chow down here!"
6/4/2019,4 star rating,"4000+ reviews!? You have my attention. I had to see what the hype was all about.The key to going to SUPER popular AYCE KBBQ places is to go...on a Sunday afternoon. Even then, our party of 4 waited for about 30 minutes, which is pretty good considering that some of my fellow yelpers have reported waiting 3 hours. **Make sure your entire party is there, because they circle your name and you get bumped to priority on the waiting list**Upon the first 10 min of being seated, it became clear to me why this place is so hype. Around the stone grill are various dishes of banchan already set up, ready to go. You can order up to 3 types of meat for the AYCE at a time, and the server brings them out almost immediately. Not only that, each person can get an order of steamed egg, or kimchi pancake. What is interesting about this place is that the server will swing by your table every so often to make sure the meat is cooking right. You're not left to your own devices, for those of you who aren't familiar with KBBQ! They will also come and clean your stone grill every so often!My favorite cuts were the beef cheek, beef intestine (abomasum), and the beef rib finger. The portion sizes for each order are also very plentiful!! With that said, nothing here particularly stood out to me, but everything tasted solid and well rounded for everything that they offer. At the end, you also have the option of finishing your meal with kimchi fried rice, which they help you cook on the grill. Parking valet is $3. But hey, if you come on a Sunday, there should be a lot of street parking available. PLUS, it's Sunday so you don't have to pay!"
9/3/2019,5 star rating,"I came here with my boyfriend on a Monday night around 7PM and it was soooooo crowded. There was a waitlist of at least 15 groups ahead of us and everyone was standing around outside. I put my name down for 2 and we didn't get called until an hour and a half later. At that point, we were starving and ready to eat. Our server came out and he provided some of the fastest, most attentive service at a KBBQ place I've ever had. Now with only 2 people, we couldn't order as much as we wanted to in fear of not finishing the food and getting charged $15 for wasted meat, but we sure ate to our hearts' content. You're allowed to order 3 different cuts of meat at a time so we tried the beef brisket, prime ribeye steak, and the bulgogi. I wasn't the biggest fan of the bulgogi since it was so sweet and the sauces we had were already flavorful enough. The ribeye steak was good but if you let it sit on your plate for too long, it got dry and tough. We ended up sticking with brisket and ordered multiple plates until we got full.One standout thing was the service and the side dishes they gave us. I have never had such attentive servers. Despite juggling many tables, the service was quick and phenomenal. The side dishes were delicious. My boyfriend loved the potato salad with apples and he asked for multiple refills. I loved the rice paper wrap and the cold spinach--soooo yummy. I recommend coming here with a big party and an empty stomach. If you're willing to wait, it is so worth it."
6/16/2018,5 star rating,"Best stop for us so far! Parking was a pain, we had to find street parking, didn't know if we were allowed to park in the plaza or not. We did the all you can eat BBQ. Best deal ever! All the galbi (short rib) and bulgogi you can eat. The meats were very flavorful, soft and not chewy. So good that after hours of eating it, our burps still smelt like it. Gross, I know. Side dishes were fresh, and the waiters were attentive.$25ish per person is a good deal! This one is a keeper."
5/18/2021,5 star rating,This place was absolutely amazing. They have all you can eat with some fantastic meats. Their restaurant is clean the service is very great. My dinner was perfect. I would recommend pacing yourself before ordering so you don't over order. Â Also plan on having dessert at home. Overall this place is great. Parking is awful around this restaurant I will say so bring four dollars for the valet and extra for a tip.
5/8/2018,2 star rating,"The service was super awkward. Didn't appreciate that at all. We were overlooked many times when we needed help. They don't have a lot of the ban chan that I'm used to. Like the noodle dish, and that was disappointing. The meats were ok, nothing special. They cook for you here or at least try to. I will not be returning."
11/7/2021,5 star rating,"Delicious. This place it worth the wait. The meat is amazing, sides are on point, and it's a great environment. I don't like seafood pancakes but this place made me change my mind."
10/22/2019,4 star rating,"There's a Korean BBQ restaurant on literally every single block in Koreatown, LA. With so many to choose from, we just ended up going to the one with the most reviews which was Hae Jang Chon. We arrived at around 1:30pm on a weekday and there was a 10 min wait but about an hour later as we were eating, we noticed that there was no wait time at all. Definitely come during an off time if possible because I read that the wait times can range from 1-2 hours during peak dinner hours on weekends. The banchan was waiting for us at our table as we were being seated and they included the usual kimchi, bean sprouts, veggies, etc. but more noticeably mashed potatoes with apples. Sounds like a strange combination but it's actually really tasty. Our server then came to take our meat orders and also offered us a kimchi pancake and steamed egg. The kimchi pancake was good and not too spicy but I'll pass on the steamed egg next time. The servers do all of the cooking here and instead of servicing only one table, they walk around and help multiple tables flip and cut up the meats when they're ready.Must try:Marinated beef short rib- Best kalbi I've ever had!! So good!Black angus beef bellyThick sliced pork bellyPork shoulderOk:Beef brisketBad:None!At the end of your meal they also serve you a portion of kimchi fried rice on the grill. Wasn't the best kimchi fried rice I've had but definitely passable. One thing that I particularly liked about this restaurant is that they give you smaller portions of each cut of meat. That way, you get to try more types of meat without getting full too quickly and you can always order more if you like it since it's AYCE. I did see some reviews that say that you can only order 3 types of meat at a time but it didn't seem like the case when we went. If anything, the servers were actually encouraging us to order more. $25.99pp for weekday lunch and $27.99 any other time so it's slightly cheaper than some of the AYCE KBBQ places in NYC that can easily run you close to $40 ahem Picnic Garden. I can't say this is the best KBBQ restaurant in K-town since there are so many of them but I definitely found it to be a solid and affordable option."
5/20/2021,5 star rating,"Such good quality meat, all you can eat. Get there earlier if you're going to dinner, as I've waited up to 2 hours for a table. It's not so bad if you're not in a rush, but definitely plan to wait a bit. So worth it though!"
6/17/2021,4 star rating,"I have been here several times. Meat is good and i like the sides too. But queue here can be a headache. If you call their number, they say that they do not take reservations but while we are waiting in the line, employees helped some groups cut the line claiming they had a reservation."
1/28/2021,5 star rating,"Best KOREAN BBQ in the West Coast, LA, HANDS DOWN. Even with COVID-19 precautions HAE JANG CHON continues to come thru with delicious food, great service, at a great price. FYI come early or join the wait list, because the wait time could be a bit longer than usual."
3/9/2018,5 star rating,I have to be reminded that this KBBQ place is the friendliest of all. I got nothing to say but you may read my previous review. I am updating it just because i wanted to make a shout out to the best staff ever in K-town! We were overwhelmed with attentiveness and just pure energetic and sincere service! Where can we get all of these? Just here. Here at this place.
10/15/2013,5 star rating,"Updated price of $18.99! I will consider this as the king of all AYCE. I don't know their secret. It'll remain a secret. But the meats are super tender and juicy. I would say the most tender and the juiciest cuts I have ever had. I think their meats are brined well. There should be a reason. Take note of the BEEF TONGUE, how could it be Â so perfect? Unbelievable PORK BELLY! Fantastic! It could also be the STONE GRILL! For HJC, stone grill produces various healthy minerals; it's nature's best cooking surface; it absorbs and decomposes heavy metal ions and on sorbs oil to bring the exquisite taste of pork. Whatever their reasons behind the heavenly made cuts, I was extremely impressed. The servers were quick and attentive. Dining here doesn't require changing the grill but cleaning it with some cut unknown veggies. I forgot to ask but it scraped a whollata oily materials. They cut and flip the meats, refill waters, and make the kimchi fried rice on the stone grill. Exciting!Not to mention that they have hotdogs and squid! Ohhhh lala! Valet parking fee is $2. Happy place of meat!"
1/29/2021,5 star rating,We make the drive from Montclair due to the fact that this place always serves quality food. The atmosphere is always lively and the staff very friendly. We will be returning as soon as possible.
1/29/2021,5 star rating,My friends recommended me this place they said it is the best Korean BBQ in town and you know what? They was completely right!:) The waiters did not keep as waiting the meet was so tasty Â my highly recommended!
3/9/2021,5 star rating,"Came here after a 5 hour hike on a Saturday late afternoon and it was so satisfying. I just wanted meat and lots of it. Expect wait time, it was an hour for me. Service was speedy and food was pretty good! I'm not big on kbbq but I'd come back here for some decent AYCE meat that's not too expensive."
5/31/2018,5 star rating,"For the price, the flavor, the quality, the service, and being AYCE... absolutely amazing!This is probably my favorite Korean BBQ dining experience so far and I've been definitely been making the rounds in Ktown. It's already unique in itself since you are grilling your meat on a VERY well seasoned hot stone and just continue to build in flavor with your multiple rounds of meats. Our table tried it all and it was all amazing. Pork shoulder, bulgogi, brisket, spicy marinated beef... our table's favorites though were the beef tongue and thinly slice pork belly. The egg soup and the kimchi pancake was really good as well. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the kimchi fried rice at the end. Not my favorite in flavor but I could see why people like it though because of the crisp rice soaking up the remnants of flavor from the stone. I will definitely be back for sure. The wait was pretty bad on a weekday night so I can't imagine how it would be like on the weekend."
4/14/2021,3 star rating,"This place is great with delicious food, but the one flaw on the restaurant's image is the host's bad tempered attitude; there was one short guy in particular who you could tell just had it and wanted to quit or something, but instead took it out on the people who just want to eat. He rolled his eyes at me, had a condescending attitude and was not at all polite. The waitress was nice maybe she can teach this guy some manners.There was another host, a short girl, who also had attitude and screamed at me for no reason, she too is doing a bad job as a host.They need to find better hosts or train the current hosts or they'll be known as the restaurant with the pissed off rude hosts who make people want to turn away and head to another restaurant with better service. It's a shame too cause the food was great."
7/4/2019,5 star rating,"Came here right when they opened Sunday morning with my roommate and her parents which is probably the only time there isn't a wait! Even so there were three other parties there too. While it is one of the pricier all you can eat kbbq places, the variety of choices and quality of the meat makes up for it. Definitely over ordered but so satisfying. Would highly recommend! Just be ready for a wait."
3/8/2018,5 star rating,This place was delicious! It was our first time and we were not disappointed! We decided to have a mini LA day and plus we wanted to try out a new KBBQ spot since we always go to the ones in Cerritos or our favorite spots. This time we really ventured out to experience something new. Our waiter was very attentive to us and brought us all our requests quickly as possible. The meats did take a little time but according to my boyfriend he thinks that the meats are cut to order. We didn't mind at all. The thing that was the coolest was the stone grill. We weren't used to that but it cooked the meat perfectly. Our favorites were obviously the brisket and bulgogi. The salad was great too which complimented the meat perfectly. I don't usually eat any of the other sides since I can't eat anything spicy so I didn't really try anything else. I def recommend this KBBQ and can't wait to find more like these in LA!
8/3/2018,5 star rating,"So many kbbq spots in ktown. Which do you choose?! Hae Jang Chon is good spot to hit up. I like how the selection isn't tooo big so it doesn't get too complicated to decide what to order. I definitely recommend getting the beef short rib and the pork belly. The bulgogi was good as well and you can't go wrong with ordering the beef brisket. My friends really liked this place and the meat quality is superb. I like the sauces they had and side dishes. It was really simple and went well with the meats. They have other sides you can order like kimchi fried rice, steamed egg, kimchi pancake, salad, etc. They also cook the meat for you! They did a wonderful job cooking the meats for us and came over to our table often. Good service. Overall I'll give this place 4.5 stars."
8/21/2019,5 star rating,"If you're looking for awesome Korean BBQ in the heart of K Town, this is as authentic as you get!! There were so many meats to choose from and had a great time being up close to our chef who cooked for us. We even tried the beef tongue (and loved it)!! Fair warning, we arrived a little before 6 PM on a Saturday night and waited 2 hours for our name to be called. We grabbed a drink at a nearby bar while we waited, but don't be gone too long! They periodically check to see who is waiting outside and will cross off your name from the list if you aren't standing outside! If you're willing to wait an hour or two, the food is totally worth it!"
6/24/2020,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is SUPER expensive. But that's only because their customer service and quality of meats is more top-notch than other Korean bbq places. They cook their meats for you, they make their rice for you, their employees are very hands on when it comes to treating you.I would say the quality of their meat is in the middle -- I've been to other Kbbq spots that are expensive because their meats are actually top-notch, not due to their customer delivery. I heard someone from my school got food poisoning from Hae Jang Chon right before graduation. -__-"
6/9/2019,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon has to be my boyfriend and I's absolute favorite all you can eat joint in K-Town. Everything about this place is incredible- the stone grill, entree choices, side choices, and atmosphere. It is always busy here and the wait can be up to two hours if you go for lunch or dinner during the weekend.The only problem that I have with this establishment is the wait system to get a table. It is a HUGE unorganized mess. Since the wait is so long, people leave and come back and the seating order gets totally warped. I really think this place needs to utilize a digital waitlist through Yelp to minimize any confusion.The staff is friendly and helpful. It can get pretty loud with all of the people and music so if you don't like the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant, this is not the place for you. I will continue to eat here whenever I get the opportunity because it is just that good."
9/29/2019,4 star rating,"TLDR: good meat, fast service, hate that they cook for you because we kept getting scolded for taking food off early even though that's how we liked it.Came here on a Saturday afternoon (12pm-ish) and there was a small line outside. We used the valet service (don't recommend trying to find your own parking) to speed up the process. Took us about 15 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad, but the lines outside picked up really quick after us and I heard the hostess saying wait times were around 45 mins by the time we got in. The set up here is very interesting because it's a small round table and the ""grill"" is really a stone surface. The sides were set up and we were greeted promptly. The service here is quick and efficient, but lacks in making the customer feel welcomed. Everything happens super fast here. They told us to pick 3 meats and he was back in less than a minute for the order. All together were ordered beef short ribs, pork belly, beef brisket, beef finger rib, intestines and bulgogi. All the meat tasted great and mixed well with the sauces. 2 of my friends really enjoyed the spicy sauce, but the sweeter brown sauce was so good to me! Anyway, what threw me off was that they cook for you here. He put the meat on to cook and when he was gone I put some other meat on and he came back and took them off and said I had to wait so I didn't cook at all. Some people may like this, but I hated it! He checked on us every 2-3 minutes and I just never felt like we had any peace. We tried to take meat off the stone and were told to wait. The girl at the table next to me also was told to wait before grabbing the meat. I like my meat cooked a certain way so having someone tell me when to eat was horrible. For some of the beef items I didn't care and started pulling them off early. Everyone at my table felt ""scared"" to eat because we kept getting scolded or if we started to cook anything ourselves they would look at us weird. Overall, it was good for the price ($25) and we were in and out quick."
7/29/2018,4 star rating,"This place did not have the best Korean BBQ I've ever had, (that title for me goes to Picnic Garden in Flushing, New York) but it is pretty much a go-to if you're ever in Koreatown LA. There are often crowds of hungry patrons waiting outside this place for seats, so thats pretty much always a good sign. My party and I came here for dinner on a Monday evening last week and there was about a 45 minute wait. The service here was pretty good for a place as busy as this. Everybody from the person who called out the names by the front door to the servers cutting up your meats and making sure they weren't overcooked were courteous and effective at their tasks. For starters, my party and I feasted on the banchan dishes as we ordered and waited for our main dishes. Some of the main dishes we ordered were the thin/thick pork belly, bulgogi, spicy BBQ beef, kimchi pancake, steamed egg, squid and the beef brisket. All these meats were nicely marinated and tasted extremely delicious with the soy sauce drizzled lettuce that they provided. My favorites would probably be the thin pork belly, bulgogi and squid. If you're a big fan of fattier cuts of meat, the pork belly will practically melt on your tongue. The bulgogi is always a Korean go-to favorite. Not much to say about that. Lastly, the squid that they serve here is about the size of a grown adult's arm, no exaggeration. Overall, I pretty much enjoyed my first experience here at Hae Jang Chon. If you don't mind the wait at first, I'd say give this place a try if you haven't been here before."
6/15/2019,5 star rating,"Star 1: how was the service and atmosphere? - Atmosphere was very busy and crazy! But they got us in within 30 minutes, we had a big party of 6. Our server was kind and worked fast to serve the 3 tables he was assigned. He arrives with our choice of meat and cooks it for us! There will be times when he will not be able to cook your food so you'll have to do some of the work. Star 2: How were the portions to the price? -its an all you can eat buffet! There is a time limit so order as much as you can but beware, whatever you don't finish you will be charged extra. Star 3 and 4: How was the food?- Food was excellent and well marinated! We tried pretty much all the meats and by the time we got full, it was too late to try the kimchi fried rice. The grill is cleaned by the raw radishes so it's different than what we are used to (which is them replacing the entire grill). Star 5: would you come back? I definitely will when we come back to LA!"
7/26/2020,4 star rating,"Location is quality Korean bbq with good cuts of meats. This is the first experience of kbbq for me so it always hits a good spot in my heart for me. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good meats, good vibes, and awesome grills."

12/24/2018,5 star rating,"This place slaps quite hard. Definitely the best Korean bbq I've ever had. Service was fantastic too, especially for a place as busy as this one was. 100% worth the hour and a half wait. Also, we saw Samuel L. Jackson in the parking lot so that was lit. I would give this place 6/5 stars if I could."
2/1/2018,5 star rating,"This place has amazing service. Everyone was eager to cook our meats for us. They set up the table for us with all of the banchans out. We each paid $25.99 for AYCE dinner. The dinner has 27 options including brisket, galbi, pork belly, shrimp, mushroom, octopus, squid, bulgogi, kimchi fried rice, kimchi pancake, etcetera.The meat was very fresh and everything was very flavorful.The parking is $2 for valet."
8/28/2021,5 star rating,"Great food and service! Our server really made the night. She was nice, on top of it, quick and remembered literally every list of item we provided. The quality of meat and sides was also good, not the best but still pretty up there. The wait wasn't that long neither considering the amount of people waiting outside. We went to the bar next door for a couple drinks, came back and our name was called. Probably the only thing I could complain about was the person at the front as she had a bit of an attitude and was moving us and everyone around like cattle. I get it she was busy but not any busier then the waitresses and they didn't seem condescending like the girl at the front. (A note for the girl at front - seeming extra pretentious to the clients because you're ""busy"" doesn't make you seem more important or that you're working harder, it makes you look like you are falling apart and over hysterical."
1/18/2018,5 star rating,"Being a Bay Area native with only Gens KBBQ to compare, I visited LA with very high expectations of Koreatown and wow did they BRING IT! Hae Jang Chon is the BEST KBBQ I've had and it thoroughly exceeded all of my expectations.We were seated almost immediately since we lined up 10 minutes before opening. Thankfully we read the reviews before coming because once we were inside, the line was already forming. There is $2 valet parking in front, but if you're lucky there should be free street parking in the residential area.Upon sitting, you are welcomed by a beautiful setup with a reusable marble grill as its centerpiece. This is very different from Gens with their replaceable stainless steel grills. Now for the MEAT! Our favorites were hands down the brisket and the marinated short ribs. OMG the quality of the meat and the flavor of the marinade was BOMB! Don't get me wrong, the bulgogi, beef tongue, pork shoulder, and pork belly were great, but the brisket and short ribs were DELICIOUS! And the banchan is abundant and realllllly tasty.The service here is better than I've ever had at any KBBQ spot. The servers actually walk around and help cook and cut the food while we stuffed our faces. On top of that, they even clean the grill with shredded daikon so the grill stays hot! Sooo cooool! The cherry on top is literally at the end of the meal. Once the last order of meat arrives they will cook KIMCHI FRIED RICE! YASSS! Mix all the remaining yummy meat in the rice and you'll know that this place is king. SAVE ROOM for this because it is STRAIGHT FIRE!I love this place and I can't wait to come back. At $23.99 it's really tough to beat AYCE KBBQ that is this awesome with service like this. I highly recommend this to everyone and I can't wait to come back with more friends."
4/4/2018,4 star rating,"This was such a fun experience. The only time I've had anything remotely similar is Japanese Steakhouse. And really the only similarity is that that it's cooked in front of you. The meal starts with an assortment of sides like spinach, potato salad, a tasty radish dish and a few other things. You then order your meats three at a time. I liked almost everything. The exceptions were the chicken and the octopus - didn't love these as I expected. Favorites were: short ribs (me), brisket (my daughter's) and spicy pork (my husband loved this and the short ribs). The only thing not to like were the policies. It says on the menu that if you leave too much they can charge you $15. Seriously? We didn't want to get charged and were worried about the chicken and octopus. Ugh. That wasn't fun. But we didn't get charged so it worked out. I'd definitely consider coming back on a future visit to L.A."
9/16/2019,4 star rating,"We came here at 6:30 on a Monday night and got seated right away. By 8pm though, it was packed.This is a lot of people's go-to place for decent quality meat and a lot of options. They even have shrimp, which I don't see often. Really good bang for your buck, and it's not overcrowded with college students like Road to Seoul. I appreciate that unlike other kbbq places that are good bang for your buck, this place isn't as loud, or as smoky, or as crowded. That said, it still is pretty loud and somewhat smoky. Given the round table size, the ideal seating is probably 5-8. There's very few tables for larger groups.The service is great for an Asian place. They cook your food for you, but by that I mean they toss the whole pile onto the stone grill and kind of mix it around periodically until it's more or less cooked (or overcooked). If you don't like your meat well done, you should just keep an eye on it and take it off whenever you want because their signal for the meat being done is to just pile it on the side of the stone plate to make room to dump more meat on the plate.The environment and pace is good for if you have a group of hungry boys, or out of town visitors, but possibly stressful if you're just trying to relax with your significant other or taking your parents out. I personally prefer to eat slowly and not feel rushed and the franticness of the cooking and waiting staff kind of made me feel pressured to order and eat quickly. Valet parking was $3 and they'll ask for it up front."
8/17/2019,5 star rating,"Wow! Â Wow! Â This place is amazing! Â Everything is super delicious. Â The bulgogi, especially, is the tastiest I've ever had.Seeing reviews of long waits, I got here at 4:30 and got seated right away - although the restaurant was 2/3 full already. Â We were given a few bon chons on the table, and there was the famed stone grill in the middle.The waiter took our order, brought us food, and cooked for us. Â The service was impeccable.Only complaint: even though there are 30 things on the menu, you can only choose three at a time and they are cooked one by one. Â Therefore, in the time limit it's impossible to even try half of the meats. Â This is also inconvenient if people in your party prefer different tastes."
4/2/2019,4 star rating,"They take reservations, but only for parties of 6 or more. And for our group of 8, no automatic gratuity is added either!Weekend lunch price is $25.99 per person. You have a list of meat and seafood options to select, but you can only put in orders of 3 different items max at a time. The AYCE includes rice paper, radish paper, banchan (such as fishcake, potato salad, bean sprouts, kimchi, etc.), steamed egg, and kimchi pancake. They grill the kimchi pancake for you so it comes to you hot and slightly crispy. What makes this place different is that they use a stone grill rather than a metal grill. What you also shouldn't miss is ordering their kimchi fried rice, which is cooked on the stone grill itself, after you're done with the KBBQ. What's also great is that the servers help cook the food for you. They get your beef items started on the grill (the beef cooks faster than others) and cook and cut the massive slices of pork belly for you. I'm also impressed that they are on top of refills for water, banchan, and rice/radish paper.One thing I did not like was how cramped the table was for the 8 of us. The space is really meant for 5 comfortably. We all sat at a round table, practically shoulder to shoulder with another. In fact, my leg was falling asleep from sitting with my feet together, not wanting to get into someone else's personal space and not being able to stretch.The parking lot is $3 for valet and the money is collected upfront. There are some street parking around; just look at the signs carefully for limitations."
9/14/2019,5 star rating,"TLDR: Great all you can eatMany different cuts of meat. Speedy service. Great banchan. Not sure what else you want from a Korean BBQ place, because this place has it all."
2/24/2018,5 star rating,"This place was so good!First of all, they accept reservations in advance if you have a party of 6 or more. Â Otherwise, you need to come in and sign up on their waitlist. Â We made reservations, but I heard that the wait was about an hour so try to get a group together to ensure your spot.Parking is a breeze. Â They have valet right in front of their restaurant for $2.00. When you get seated, they'll start your table with some banchan (variety of delicious sides). Â You then get to order off the menu. Â They have a variety of meat and seafood options. Our table tried the bbq squid, octopus, pork belly, short ribs, chicken, and pork belly. Â We also got to try the kimchee pancake and salad.I loved the bbq squid! Â My table really enjoyed the chicken. Â We all just thought that the shrimp was okay- I would probably pass on the shrimp the next time.One thing to note- once you get the kim chee fried rice, you can no longer order food. Â Our table made that mistake which was sad since one person was still hungry. Â So don't make that mistake.Pros:-great, fast, service-all you can eat!-yummy banchan-cheap valet parking -they have lollipops by the entrance-they have heaters outsideCons:- reservations only for 6 people or more- a bit tight with the seating depending on where you sit. Â One person on our table got hit by people walking by"
5/24/2018,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon was easily the best Korean bbq I've ever had. While it's a popular spot in K-Town and the wait was 2 hours, it was definitely worth the wait. The service is fantastic here. The servers come by often to make sure your meat is cooking well and clean your grill and make sure you have enough banchan and water at all times! They also advise you when to end your meal with the kimchi fried rice and cook it for you. The kimchi fried rice was amazing but the star of this place is definitely all the meats. The quality of the meat is extremely high. By the time you eat it, it almost melts in your mouth. The brisket and pork belly were some of my favorites. They have all the banchan options you could ever want and if they don't have it on the table, you can ask for more. This is one of those places that's an easy 5 stars from me. I love it here and can't wait to come back. I will happily sit and wait for 2 hours for this meal because it's 100% worth it."
4/22/2021,5 star rating,"The way they set up their waiting area and seating arrangements made it easy to follow. We didn't wait long on a Wednesday night. The meat was top notch, highly recommend the beef belly and short rib! The sides and especially the kimchi are high quality as well. Service was fast and efficient. All in all, my go to spot that I'll keep coming back to"
4/25/2018,5 star rating,"Service (5/5): Our waiter was Ming and I've never had a waiter more attentive than him. He kept up with all my boyfriend's needs and wants. Whatever we asked for, he made it his first priority - he's definitely an A+ server! This is also the first time my boyfriend and I have been to a kbbq where the server cooks the meat for us.Food (5/5): They claim to serve only high quality meats and I definitely taste it! The stone states to soak up additional oil and fats but it personally didn't impact me in anyway shape or form. The meat was just bomb af and the sides complemented the meats so well! I thought it was creative that they serve kimchi fried rice, but only at the end of the meal. We were too full so we cancelled it.Ambiance (5/5): Because of the popularity of this KBBQ, expect to wait at least 1 hour to 1.5hrs. Every table is full but it doesn't feel crowded and they play loud hip-hop music, which may bother some people but I personally didn't mind it. Price (5/5): If you'd like to get more for your money, and avoid getting the Â $15 fee from not eating all your meat, order half orders of your meats! You can only get three meats at a time and a full order is pretty huge especially if there's only two of you. My boyfriend and I compared the price of some of the kbbqs near and I believe you get more from your money in quantity and quality considering it is AYCE."

11/30/2017,5 star rating,"For AYCE kbbq, Hae Jang Chon is at the top of my list. There's a reason why there's always a huge line outside when you drive by. It's legit. On top of the food being spectacular, the service is excellent and that's hard to come by at kbbq joints.Hae Jang Chon takes reservations for parties of 6 or more so I highly recommend making a reservation if you're planning to come with a big group. I don't think I'll ever come here with a small party because the line is ridiculous (can be up to a 2-3 hour wait)! The meat quality here is superb. There are a bunch of different options but my favorite is the marinated short rib. So good!!! Juicy and tender! The grill used here is different than other places and I'm a big fan. By not changing grills every 3 meats, it allows for the grill to retain the flavor of all of the meats. The banchan is good too. Not to mention, they have endless rice paper!Shout out to our server Suzy who was attentive and quick with all of our requests!"
6/5/2021,1 star rating,"Didn't even make it in the door. They don't take reservations. We got there around 5:10pm, and were told about 45mins to an hour for a table - which is reasonable due to COVID capacity limits and staffing issues. However, every time we checked in with the host for an update, we were told an additional hour to hour 15. After an hour 35 of waiting without being seated, we left for another restaurant. Staff should have a better estimate of wait times, and update groups accordingly. Most people don't mind waiting for a table, but be better at setting expectations with your customers."
4/7/2019,5 star rating,"This place is amazing. They clean their stones with radish and you don't even have to ask them! The servers are constantly walking around and checking if you need anything. My group ordered a little of everything which was bulgogi, tongue ( yea that's delicious don't judge), brisket, fatty belly brisket ( I think that's what you call it...this was the best btw), some other meats and kimchi fried rice. Their sides are really good too. I liked the spicy fish cakes and veggies marinated in sesame oil.Aside from the annoying bbq fumes giving me a face sauna and the two hour wait, this place lives up to the hype. Quality meats and attentive service makes this one of the hot kbbq spots."
3/5/2019,5 star rating,"Hands down the best AYCE Kbbq i have been to. Be prepared to wait but let me tell you, its worth it. For the price you pay, the meat you get are high quality premium meats.Waited 2 hours on friday night. Valet is recommended at 3 bucks but it gets full real quick. Once we were seated, we were greeted by our server right away and began ordering meats. 3 meats could be ordered at a time. The grill is not an ordinary bbq grill, its more like a stone plate. Never have to change the grill throughout our meal. They simply throw radish on it and clean it that way. Very satisfying to watch.Beef tongue and thick pork belly were my favorite. The brisket and marinated beef short ribs were just as good. Those were the top 4 i would recommend. Let them sit a bit longer on the grill for better texture from the char. The server will cook your meats but you can grill your meats they way you want to once its on the grill.Food came out fast and the service was amazing. Like i mentioned, best bang for your buck for kbbq. Already looking forward to our next visit."
10/4/2017,3 star rating,"Of all the Korean Barbeque places in and around Koreatown, I have to admit that this place is one of the more crowded ones. Crowded indeed, but I honestly believe the quality of their AYCE bbq has gone downhill. With gratuity, it's about $30.00+ a person. And it's already automatically added into the bill... Just a fyi.The wait on weekends can be up to two hours. The valet parking really stinks! Too many cars inside, and it can also be quite a wait before the valet attendant squeezes out your car. So, I recommend parking elsewhere.Now, for the food part. The waiter/waitress will allow each party to order three items each time. Fair enough... To minimize food wastage. The quality of the meats can be a hit or miss. It seems to be more of a miss nowadays because quality of the meats are not as lean as before, and it's just not as flavorful anymore compared to other kbbq ayce places. Maybe not enough time for meat to absorb its sauce, since they're so busy? I really don't know. But I do like their Beef Brisket, Galbi, and their Spicy Pork. I'm not a big fan of their squid, nor am I into their beef tongue.The service is still decent though. At least the waiter/waitress comes right away after ringing the bell. I like the fact that they keep an eye on the food being cooked. They'll come and flip the meat for you so it won't burn. The ayce part is still good as usual.One part that bothers me is that I feel so rushed when eating there. I feel like livestock in a production line where you get fed and then kicked out. Also, they use to serve you kimchi fried rice after your meal, where they mix all the leftovers with kimchi rice, as it's cooked on your table. Now they don't do that anymore. What a bummer!!Anyhow, I really want to give this place a good rating. But I'll be lying if I did because this place is too crowded as the wait is an eternity. And thus the quality of their food has gone downhill. I don't know if they could even expand...because they're stuck in the middle of a small plaza.Definitely not a five stars place, and now it's not even close to four stars. I'll rate a very weak three stars since they really try, but might be too overwhelmed.I suggest to come only if you have time to waste... Or else elsewhere is just as good, or even better.I hope this place will do something to improve again. Good luck!"

10/10/2017,4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place out for a really long time and finally got to dine here after I arrived from LAX. I was extremely hangry and still had to wait about another two hours to eat and it was already 9:30pm!! It was actually definitely wort the wait though. The pricing for premium meats is really inexpensive and you have 27 items to choose from. I also like how they don't use a traditional grill either, but a stone grill instead. When we sat down, a bunch of ban chan was already waiting for us. We ordered the spicy BBQ pork, beef tongue, miso soup, steamed egg, brisket, bulgolgi, barbecue chicken, salad, and thick pork belly. I'm surprised I didn't eat as much as I usually do, but I was really stuffed.Service was pretty friendly and prompt. Several workers would walk by and help us cook our meats and made sure everything was to our liking. I would definitely come back to get my AYCE KBBQ fix from here, but I hope next time the wait won't be so long."

We waited over 2 hours+, and supposed to enjoy the good food. But the food is nasty. It is not fresh at all. The beefs seem like is been there for a long time. It has black color and smells stinky. The important thing is after we got home, 3 of us are getting food poisoning. We have stomach upset very badly and vomiting. Also, the waitress was rushed at us. She tried to pull all the meats on the plates into our grill which included all the stinky beef's blood. I had to tell her to stop doing that. This is my first and my last time too!! I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!!!PARKING: 1/5 (very hard to find parking slot; even valet parking)ENVIRONMENT: 1/5 (too small and dirty)SERVICE: 2/5FOOD: 0/5 (WORST FOOD EVER) !!!"

I would be happy if they turned this into a banchan-and-rice place and only had a la carte meat options. The deets:- Hot stone-style grill- BEAUTIFUL, BOUNTIFUL banchan!!!- The meat quality here is actually not that great compared to Hobak in Las Vegas, but it's consistently enjoyable. The banchan here though are the reason why I'll dream of this place. Â - Three meats at a time. Don't have any leftover or prepare to suffer the consequences! - Korean aunties will cook it for you. - Kimchi rice is at the end.

1/25/2020,5 star rating,There's a reason this place has a 2+ hour wait: the food and service are amazing! I love the fact that the food cooks on a cast iron for that delicious *maillard reaction*. My fave sides here are the fish cakes and rice paper. The best part of the experience though is how they clean the grill. They dump a bunch of radish noodles and scrape them around to clean. It's super efficient (and entertaining!)Protip: come here super early (like 4:45pm for dinner or 11:15 for lunch) and there's going to be a 15 min wait... even on a Saturday!
1/24/2020,5 star rating,"I'm just gonna wrote this review since I'm a California native attending grad school in Cincinnati and I'm just gonna hope some other Cincinnati people read this: this is a REAL five Star Korean BBQ experience, not that overpriced Korean BBQ place in NKY where the meats aren't as high quality, and the selection is extremely limited. (It also makes me sad that it's the only Korean BBQ place in the Cincinnati area, but oh well, least I'm graduating soon and moving back to California where good Korean BBQ is at) This is pretty much what any good Korean BBQ place should be: generous selection of meats, high quality food and side dishes especially the short rib, and reasonable prices for what it is. Also never had a Korean BBQ experience where the grill is a stone one instead of an open flame grill, but there's just something about it that makes cooking the meat extra special. Also, would love to add extra stars if possible in consideration for the kimchi fried rice experience at the end of the meal where they torch the cheese on top. That is a satisfying end to a good Korean BBQ meal, and I would totally comeback to K-town for this kind of experience again."
1/24/2020,5 star rating,"One of the best korean bbq spots in koreatown! The waitlist can get pretty long even on weekdays, but the food makes it worth it. I used to go here a few years ago and stopped for a while because the quality of the meat became so-so but I revisited a few times within the past year (2019-now) and the quality is great now! I recently came with my bf and we enjoyed our meal~ we waited about 30 min to get seated. The meat cooks quickly which is great unlike other kbbq places where the meat doesn't cook fast. The service here is great as well! Super quick and attentive. I've gotten Steven as our server twice and he's great! Parking here is valet for $3 but if you're lucky you can find street parking."
1/23/2020,2 star rating,"Love the food, not the service. We have come with friends over 4 times and the last time was the worst customer service we have ever had before being seated.Our guests where at the door at 6pm, we where seated Â at 9pm. 3hours waiting to be seated while we were right next door waiting our turn with one person checking in every 20 min with the seating waitress. Every time we were told 20 min, 20 min, 20 min, 20min...40 more min.??? Wait What? Our name was on the piece of paper that they ripped off???We where all here but one of our parties couldn't stand outside in the cold so they told us to wait patiently in the bar next to the restaurant. Side note - I'm appalled that after waiting for so long they told us that we could reserve tables 6 or more. Why they didn't tell us before hand I do not know....Ok, dinner though great as usual, our server was super nice, way more inviting then the waiting waitress.This little detail is kind of sad though at the end of the dinner, after leaving over 20% tip i see that the balance at the end had 10$ more charged to my card that was added with the tip to it....Ok it's nothing but the fact that they think I didn't see that, plus the fact we ate everything with no waste was a little of a low blow. I'd come back I guess because great of the good food but man guys work on your seating issue....and next time don't take your customers for imbeciles."
1/20/2020,5 star rating,"My friend recommended we come here after work one night; she said it was the best Korean BBQ she has had. She was so right!Now the first thing you need to know about this place is that you will be waiting if you decide to come here at night. You write your name down on the notepad near the host stand and chill. I know some people like to head to the bar next door while they wait, but I just chose to hang around. Â I heard the group next to us say they had been waiting for 2 hours, but since we showed up around 12:45, we got seated within 20 minutes. When they call your name, your complete party has to be there and ready to go. Or it's on to the next!Once you sit, you simply pick 3 meats to start and get going! (Also don't forget the beer and shochu!) We tried the bulgogi, beef tongue, thin beef brisket, shrimp, and spicy pork belly. The food was so on point!! Very flavorful and well cooked. We were starving so we went through 3 round of meat within 35 minutes!! The sauces also helped make everything that much more flavorful. Ask for extra brisket sauce!!!!The price was reasonable $27.99 and I definitely think we got our money's worth with the quality of food. The service was what you expect with a super busy restaurant at 1am, but we got everything we wanted quickly! They don't BS over here! Don't forget last call is 1:30 am!"
1/20/2020,5 star rating,"Like everyone else one of my favorite spots in Ktown to grab some AYCE KBBQ, the wait is long unless you come early on a weekday/weekend. Check it out! I'm sure if you haven't been it won't be your last."
1/19/2020,5 star rating,"One of my favorite kbbq places! The price is very reasonable for kbbq considering all the options, and the service is spectacular.FOOD (5/5):They have a great selection of side dishes including steamed egg, kimchi pancakes, kimchi fried rice (so good), etc...The quality of meat is really good. My favorite thing here is the beef tongue - so bouncy and chewy! Their beef belly and brisket are also amazing. Banchan is delicious as well!SERVICE (5/5):They come around to cook the food for you and are always checking up to make sure that everything's okay, or if you want to order more. Fantastic customer service.AMBIENCE (5/5): Very nice, clean, and cozy."
2/23/2020,3 star rating,"Decent meats, fair price, iffy service. Been here on both weekends and weekdays, and I feel that the managers are always a little rude. First, before I start ranting, the food isn't bad. I've definitely had better BBQ, but theirs is pretty good too. I am a huge fan of the stone pan/plate they cook on. It definitely helps with the cooking and flavor of the meat, and there's no issues with getting meat stuck to the grill like so many other AYCE joints. Price is $28.99 a head, plus fees for other stuff that are specially marked. The booze is fairly priced too. The servers are always really nice, though their quality of service can be hit or miss; some are just more experienced than others. For example, one guy my table had before came over and just sort of brushed the meats around with the tongs even after we had laid them out for even cooking. Nice enough kid, but he clearly had no idea what he was doing. On another visit, the waitress for our table was much better. She was probably more experienced, and she was much better at helping us with the heating of the pan and the cooking process. Hardly had to touch the meat ourselves!Unfortunately, on both occasions, the managers (I assume. They were older than the rest of the staff.) were super pushy. A male manager we ran into during lunch kept trying to take our check when we hadn't even put down a card or money yet! We were still eating too. On another visit, the older lady walking the floor straight up felt like she was chastising us and never said anything when she came by to check on the pan. Every time she walked by, we hoped she wouldn't stop at our table, hah.Parking sucks. It's typical for Ktown, with lots of the street parking taken up by the apartment dwellers in the area. The small lot has valet, and there's metered parking across 6th.Wait times can drag during the weekend. Typical for a more popular spot in the area."
3/5/2020,5 star rating,"Definitely one of my fave AYCE kbbq places here! There's so many different options of meat you can choose from and they're ALL delicious! Highly recommend the galbi, bulgogi, rib-eye, pork belly, and beef stomach! My fave part is the kimchi fried rice at the end! I literally crave eating here all the time"
6/30/2017,5 star rating,"My go to spot for Korean BBQ. It's very reasonably priced and the variety of meats available are all of good quality. Make sure to come here with time and with everyone in your party. They will work with you, but generally won't seat you until your whole group is there. Also, be aware that there is a sign in sheet,so sign in your party as soon as you get there. The food quality is bomb! Make sure that towards the end of your meal you save some space for the kimchi rice that they make for. It's usually the last thing you'll eat before finishing up. Also, I feel that their special stone grill makes everything taste better than at regular Korean restaurants. Lastly, like most places in Korea town the parking is a challenge. You will likely have to get valet, so make sure to bring cash. The fee is fairly reasonable, two to three dollars if memory serves me well. This is definitely a place you should check out."
9/10/2017,3 star rating,There is no lack of customers here. Popular with younger crowds and non Koreans this place has a huge waiting line especially during dinner time on weekends.I prefer the open flame bbq. The stone cooked bbq is probably healthier because of less caramelization but this means also less flavor. There were lots of meats and banchan available and the service was attentive. Worth a try if you have not been here before.
2/20/2015,4 star rating,This is the only stone grill BBQ I have been to and I have to say I like it. Great taste and reasonable price. Don't really have any complaints on this place except when it gets busy the wait could be rather long. But with a Korean BBQ on every block in this part of town you can easily find a place that is less busy.
2/21/2020,5 star rating,"KBBQ is always worth the price bc it's ALL YOU CAN EAT. But this place is unique for its stone cooking plates. The wait was long, almost an hour on a week night! But it was worth it. The food was good and the service was good as well. They come and cook the meat for you and the ventilation system is amazing! If you've been to smaller kbbq spots you will appreciate a good ventilation system and them cooking the meat for you bc when you get smoke in your eye and grease all over your arms... it ain't fun lol.Highly recommend!"
6/16/2019,5 star rating,"Man this place is the bomb! I alway love Korean BBQ and this place was amazing! I came around 6pm and there was hardly a wait time. If you have never been to a Korean BBQ place it may seem confusing at first.My only suggesting is that the server grilling the meats ask how you would like your steaks prepared instead of running the meat by cooking it well done, and assuming that's how you wanted it to be cooked. A part from that I had a great experience here."
12/11/2018,4 star rating,"I will admit that I have become a huge snob when it comes to KBBQ, and I don't usually opt for AYCE restaurants anymore. However, Hae Jang Chon is still one of my top AYCE KBBQ restaurants simply because of the top meat quality and taste, and amazing customer service.Most recently, I came here for Saturday lunch and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for two. I wish they would start to utilize some type of communication system, such as texting/calling you when your table is ready. I remember previously waiting for almost two hours for our table to be ready, and know that the wait times usually vary when you come here.Valet parking is available and you will most likely have to take advantage of this service, as street parking is scarce in the area.HJC offers USDA Choice and prime meat, and I definitely enjoy most of the meats from here. My favorites from the menu are: beef brisket, marinated beef short rib, BBQ beef, pork shoulder, kimchi pancake, steamed egg, rice wrap and kimchi fried rice. I also appreciate that they let you order half orders for when you feel like you're getting full or to try something that you haven't before. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu!The ventilation here isn't the best, but you should already know not to wear your ""best"" clothes when eating KBBQ. Overall, the restaurant was clean, the banchan and meats were delicious, and the servers were friendly, efficient, and helped cook the meat to perfection. I will be back!"
7/11/2017,5 star rating,"BEST AYCE KBBQ SPOT IN K-TOWN!!! I have been coming here for years with my wife and cousins. They are always busy, but they are totally worth the wait. Parking can be difficult if the valet service is at capacity. They are open late which is definitely a plus. The usual times I have been here is around dinner time and as late at 1:30am. Nonetheless, if you can bear the long wait, you will enjoy the dining experience. Service is great. They are always attentive and check on tables constantly. The thing they separates them from the other KBBQ spots is the black stone grill. I have not been to another AYCE KBBQ with a grill like that. As for the meats, they are high quality meats and flavorful. Another cool thing is you never need a grill change here. They use radish strips to clean up the stone grill. You will have to come here and see the magic cleaning technique for yourself. Personal meat recommendations are: Brisket, bulgogi thick sliced Pork belly and thin sliced pork belly. If you have room after all the BBQ, don't forget to try the kimchi fried rice. They will cook it in front of you and it tastes great as well. Good to know they are still going strong. I'm always down to come here to Hae Jang Chon!"
12/25/2018,3 star rating,"*** In Short ***A mixed bag of (m)eats.*** In Depth ***I haven't done AYCE or buffet anything in over a decade now, with my stomach capacity having diminished well past the point of making these types of establishments cost effective or sensical. With that said, I was entirely taken by surprise then when arriving at Hae Jang Chon to celebrate my sister's new job, not having Yelped it prior to showing up.At $24 a head for lunch, you better come packing an appetite, though their selection of only USDA Choice and Prime meats does help counterbalance the wallet hit a bit. With that said, the only options I found particularly worthwhile were their selections of pork, beef tongue, marinated kalbi, and the steamed egg. Meanwhile, their beef brisket and unmarinated short rib were unusually mushy in texture, possibly from being tenderized a bit too much.Service was attentive and friendly, and there basically wasn't a wait for lunch (though we also had reservations), making lunch a more appealing option for the time and cost conscious.***Accessibility Info***Venue - Good sized venue with pretty accessible seating options.Bathroom - Didn't check them out."
2/9/2019,4 star rating,"The most reviewed kbbq spot in Ktown so I had to give it a try! Hae Jang Chon always has a crowd waiting outside almost every single night so this place is always buzzin for dinner. What separates this joint from all of its competition is the fact that they use a stone grill versus the regular metal and mesh wire grills. Apparently it makes the meat taste better! Meat quality is USDA Prime so you're definitely getting one of the highest cuts of meats you can get for kbbq. I usually start with the brisket since they're thinly sliced and cook really fast so you can eat right away. Then I usually go for the short rib which is usually the best cut, then do a little bit of exploring and diversification.What I like about this place is the fact that after you finish your meal they make kimchi fried rice for you, amazing! Great way to cap off the dinner."
5/20/2019,5 star rating,It's like eating Korean BBQ on the street. Lot of activity around us. Servers walking around making sure BBQ stations are up and running hot. Diving into the BBQ grilling process if you want I take a rest from grilling yourself. The wait is worth it! Waiting outside is like a social event with common ground. Pre KBB selfies and posts are everywhere. People watching who comes and goes from valet service.The food is outstanding and delicious. I wish we had larger appetites that day...like a food whore.
4/25/2019,5 star rating,One of the best kbbq places I've ever been to! Not only is the food good but the service is A+Expect to wait around an hour for a seat. I came on a Wednesday around 8PM and still had to wait 1 hour+ for a seat but it was so worth it! I really enjoyed the beef tongue and bbq squid!
5/15/2021,5 star rating,"Great atmosphere, clean environment and fresh food! The service was also very fast and waiters were helpful. Loved what they did with the tables outside due to COVID."
8/31/2017,5 star rating,"Definitely one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ places I've been to!They allowed us to make reservations for parties of 6 or more so that was convenient. Be warned though- this place is packkeddd and even with a reservation, you'll likely still be waiting a bit for a table. Once you are seated, the service is very quick and efficient. They're definitely on top of getting your orders out and table turnover.They have so much available on the menu and they're very generous with all of the banchan. They also have this lemon syrup thing you can add to your shots of soju for some soju-lemonade~ yum :) They even make kimchi fried rice for you after your meal but I was so stuffed at that point I couldn't even eat any."
2/7/2019,5 star rating,"This is probably the best KBBQ place I've ever been to so far. Food:* Meat quality was excellent! It didn't make me feel oily and gross after eating the meat as compared to other kbbq places I've been to. The meat seemed fresh and not like those ones that were frozen for who knows how long. * I looooved the thin pork belly slice!! The short rib tasted awesome as well!! Even though it wasn't marinated, it still tasted bomb! It was just so amazing how the meat could taste so different depending on the KBBQ place you go to. * We also tried the kimchi fried rice and man, I could eat that every day! We added some thick and thin pork belly mixed in and it was heaven. * The side dishes were okay. Some of them were too spicy. The potato salad was kinda weird cuz it had apples lol. Service:* Our servers were awesome! We got everything we asked for pretty quick. If you go to kbbq franchises like GEN, it will take forever for you to get meat and stuff so I'm glad Hae Jang Chon wasn't the same! * Parking was valet for $3. We went for dinner on a Monday and we got seated after like 15 minutes, which was cool, considering that it was a popular place. After like 7pm though, it started getting very packed so I'm glad we came an hour early. Overall, I will definitely come back! My $30-35 was worth it so take my money!! Lol."
6/4/2017,5 star rating,"Brisket is life! Love the stone grill they use and their banchan. Service is pretty on point.Wait can be ridiculously long, but kimchi fried rice at the end is always worth.Cost is considered pricey, especially when you compare to $10 kbbq you can get in other places in Koreatown."
4/15/2018,5 star rating,"Wow, this was my first experience with Korean BBQ and it certainly exceeded my expectations!I had been planning on going to Korean BBQ with my coworkers for a while and heard that this was one of the best all you can eat Korean BBQ places in town.Luckily one of my friends speaks Korean so she had no problem ordering for the whole table. We tried a lot of different types of meat including the brisket, marinated beef, BBQ beef, pork and everything in between. Each meat we tasted was better than the first. The thinly sliced brisket was my personal favorite and we ordered 3 servings of it. They also bring an assortment of side dishes to go along with the meet from potato salad to regular salad. The dips are where the meats can really differ. There is a chili paste, a sesame oil, and a bean paste for dipping. Each has a distinct flavor but if you like spicy things then you will love them all!The Thursday night we were there was incredibly busy but we never felt rushed by any of the staff who was also very attentive. We never went without anything we needed or wanted. Overall it was a fantastic experience and we are actually planning our next Korean BBQ dinner!Tips:1. Make a reservation. We had a reservation and still had a bit of a wait. I can't imagine what the wait would be like without a reservation. Make sure your party is all there on time because they only hold the table for 15 mins before giving it to another party.2. Valet parking is only $2. It's worth it and cheaper than most parking meters, if you can even find one!"
1/1/2019,4 star rating,"Recently came to Hae Jang Chon with friends for Korean BBQ dinner. A few of the people I was with had already gone and raved about how great the food was. There was a bit of a wait to be seated, about an hour... but I Â hear that's good compared to earlier times.. as this restaurant is very popular.Once seated, our waiter/server Jay quickly took our order. We tried lots of different meats including: short rib, tongue, bulgogi, etc. Everything was so delicious. The side dishes were fresh and delicious. Overall, there is a lot to love about this restaurant. The one negative aspect was our waiter/server Jay seemed like he was just so inconvenienced anytime we needed something. It's an AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant, and we were paying customers.... and I even made an extra effort to be suuuuper nice and thank him anytime he did bring us something. But the look on his face just kind of killed the good vibe. Kay on the other hand was amazing. She had a great smile and gladly got anything we needed without complaint. I look forward to coming back and hopefully having Kay (or anyone else even remotely friendly) as our server."
12/8/2018,4 star rating,"I've gone to many Korean BBQ's before, but this one didn't particularly have a wow factor hence the four stars. Everything else was very nice though. It's perhaps the only place where I have had the best service at a Korean BBQ restaurant. Their rice that is served in the beginning with the spinach is extremely good, I was surprised. They serve per every three choices of meats, and if you order three more but don't finish everything, then you get charged for leftovers. This is the kind of place where you want to take advantage and eat a lot since its AYCE style. For people who don't eat much, it would be preferable to choose a Korean BBQ that isn't AYCE but the quality of meats is a higher specialization.I would definitely come back and mainly for their customer service. Other Korean BBQ's have had everything great, but they lacked that personality. You just kind of eat and go, but in this place, we actually joked and laughed with our server, and for that, it wins a spot in my heart. I suppose there's a reason why it's known as the #1 Korean BBQ spot in K-Town, and I suppose, the reason for that is simpleThe people."
8/1/2021,5 star rating,"My new favorite Korean BBQ restaurant! Sure the wait time is long and the price per person is expensive, but the service and food quality made up for it. Came here on a Friday at 5:30pm and had to wait almost two hours before getting seated. Once we were seated, our server came immediately, took our order, came back with everything quickly and started cooking for us. He was very kind and answered our questions about the popular items on the menu. We think our server had six tables assigned to him and he was attentive to every single table. He checked on us often, helped cooked and cut our meat all night. Not once did we have to flag him down because once he saw our meat was either cooked or low on the grill, he came to our table and started doing his thing."
11/26/2018,5 star rating,"There are so many kbbq places in Cali. We came upon this because of proximity and yelp reviews. Boy, it did not dissapoint. I love that it is open late for the night time folks. We were a party of 5 on halloween night and we got seated right away.Parking was super easy because there was valet for 3$. The sides were premium side dishes. Good kimchi, rice paper wraps, daikon wraps, pickled things. You had salad served right away and the waiter was ready to take your order.First off the grill plate they used was pure stone. I loved it. It cooked the meat so well and fast since we were starving. We ordered the beef brisket to start and it was such good quality. Next was the beef tongue which at other places limit how many orders you can have, this place did not!Then we started ordering the marinated stuff which I think was good but I like the natural flavor of quality beef. They eventually changed our grill as well and we continued to order the brisket.This place is such good quality and such a good deal I would not pass up the opportunity to try it!"
1/23/2019,5 star rating,"This place is AMAZING. To give you an idea, we waited for 45 minutes for 2 people on a random weekday at 10pm, and I'm still giving this place 5 stars. When we finally got seated service was quick. This place is all you can eat and we decided to mainly stick with the brisket (in my opinion pairs amazing with the sesame oil or the sour sauce) and the short rib. The short rib here is different from other Korean BBQ places bc there is no bone and the meat is SO tender. Â We also tried the bulgogi which was perfectly seasoned and the pancake (honestly I could have done without the pancake). The servers here do all your cooking for you and are very attentive. They're also quick to take your orders which I appreciated and very nice. The grill is a flat surface instead of the metal bars which keeps all the juices and fat with the meat so you're not losing all the flavor through the grill. Parking is in a lot or on the street. Â If you come here expect a long wait but then also expect really good bbq at a pretty reasonable price."
7/6/2021,4 star rating,Food wise not a lot of options and the quality was ok. I want to rate 3/5 for the food here 5/5 for service though. Overall a good experience and just wish they had more options.
3/29/2017,4 star rating,"If you want some ridiculously cheap AYCE ktown bbq, this is it. Â Warning though...their dinner lines can be crazy. Â We're talking hours...not minutes. Â Best advice I can give you? Â Go at lunch. Â No lines...$21.99/pp...done. Â So gauging a Korean bbq spot really depends upon their kalbi. Â Unfortunately, it was just way too sweet here. Â It was so sweet that we only stuck to a few orders and went for the other stuff on the menu. Â Their banchan was pretty good...I was happy with the kimchee, radish wraps, rice paper wraps, salad, and daengjang. Â Service was alright also. Â They refilled items quickly and took our meat orders constantly. Â They try to cook for you as much as they can but it can be difficult with so many tables to run around to. Â Don't forget to ask them to make you bokkeumbap (fried rice) at the end. Â Really decent quality of meat, good service, and super duper cheap."
3/7/2019,5 star rating,"Ohhh, I love this place. This KBBQ spot is definitely on my list of favorites. Their items on their menu are all very good in flavor & their kimchi fried rice is so great omg. The customer service is so good here too. My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday & the waiter made our kimchi fried rice in the shape of a heart. So sweet of her :) I believe our total was about $60 with 2 dinner specials & drinks included."
3/4/2017,4 star rating,"Yay! My friends decided to take me to Hae Jang Chon for my inaugural visit to Ktown! I don't think I've ever gone to Ktown prior to this trip and this was the first of many of my ""Ktown Bookmarks"" that I have ;_;You're probably gonna find out that parking in the plaza is going to be $2 (they have a valet service as well in case that there IS not parking) but that's not bad for LA :) Going in around 11:15AM on a Saturday also helped. You're gonna need your entire party before you get seated as well. Once everyone arrives, sit down and enjoy. Prior to you getting to your seat, they will prepare the side dishes and plates on your table already. You also see the flames and the stone ""grill"" that is in the middle. Their (banchan, is it?) is just alright. Not as wide of a variety as you'd expect. You have salad, soybeans, the potato with apple inside, rice noodle, daikon, radish, and 2 or 3 more options if I recall.You have a max of 3 meats per turn so you have to make sure you choose your meats wisely! Another thing here is that you gonna get half orders after your 1st order (which is a full)- which we found out after..... :( So get your meats!Beef tongue is delicious. Looking at the amount we got... ooh.And listening to them, we also got the thin pork belly. You're gonna need to mix it with some sauce on your table or just have it with the oil xD but regardless thin is definitely the way to go!Their brisket isn't mostly fat! Or it doesn't feel like mostly fat which is a great thing! Their squid has so much flavor packed in it (and is the thing you should get if you're tired of meat and need a break from it). Their bulgogi is fun to eat and should be shared with the rice because it has such juicy flavors in it. And last but not least, their marinated meat is what we finally ended up with. Is it weird that I felt a delicious glaze all over it? :PYou can keep going but I knew there was more coming after this so I decided to stop after these meats.The final thing is the kimchi fried rice which is so delicious. They have a spiciness in there even after it is cooked and some more spices that are in there after. You have to choose between the white rice (with all the meats) or the kimchi fried rice and you definitely need to get this! The servers started to help cook with some of the meats and came to check up every so often but if there's no one around, you'll have to cook your meat. And if you have no meat on your grill, you're gonna need to have a harder time getting a server to come by. :/Although their quality tho man... :)~$22pp for weekday lunch ~$24pp for weekday dinner and all day weekends.AYCE!"

Parking is difficult so you may have to find street parking."
4/12/2020,5 star rating,"This place is probably the goto place in Ktown for Korean bbq. Their beef short ribs and their beef tongues are both killers. Every time we visit here we feel like no cows in SoCal have ribs or tongues anymore because we just cannot stop eating. However, there are some meat is not as promising as our expectations. But the majority of the food here is pretty authentic and good. You are allowed to order three different kinds of meat per time and the server will cook for you so you have both great food and service."
7/5/2016,5 star rating,"This is probably my favorite ayce bbq place! For $25, you get a wide selection of quality meats as well as steamed egg, miso soup, kimchi pancake, and all the banchan. My fave meats to order are the brisket, bulgogi, and marinated short rib, I also really liked the shrimp-it was very fresh. The squid, octopus, mushroom, and chicken were also very good. Basically, everything we ordered was delicious! I also love that they make a kimchi fried rice for you at the end. Too bad I'm usually too full to enjoy it. Service here is great. They usually have a staff member come by to help you cook your meat, and they keep coming by to ask you if you want to order more meat. This is one of the few places that I didn't have to keep flagging down a staff person to ask for more food. The only problem with this place is the wait. I've had to wait about 1.5-2 hours each time, but I do feel that it's worth the wait and the wait will definitely build your appetite."

7/9/2016,4 star rating,This place is probably one of the KBBQ I actually like. The ambience here is causal and it is very clean inside! I've been to kbbq places that I actually walk back out because the floor was just trashy... I like how they have 27 items all you can eat for only $23.99/person on weekend and weekday nights. It is $21.99 for lunch if you come before 3 PM on weekdays. Service here is average because you don't really have someone assigned to the section you're seating... It was kind of hard to just get more water... Lol My favorite meat here would be their beef tongue and marinated beef rib. The beef tongue was fresh and it was not frozen. The marinated beef rib was very juicy and flavorful! I would definitely recommend coming here since they have a valet parking in the lot. The wait here might be long because it's pretty popular compare to other stores near them so do come here early on weekends!!!
2/4/2020,5 star rating,"Hot damn! I can't say enough good things about this spot. Best ACYE KBBQ spot in town with a great vibe and super friendly staff.Also I love that they have a healthy non-beef and non-pork offering with chicken and seafood.It's affordable, delicious and the waits aren't usually that long- just enough to make you appreciate what you're eating!"
7/10/2016,4 star rating,"De-luscious! Great KBBQ located in the heart of K-town. My favorite is the brisket. I love those thin ribbons of meat! The salad is also delicious and all the meat is good quality. It's easy to see why this place has so many positive reviews.Lucky for me I have a friend who lives within walking distance so parking is not an issue. Valet gets pretty full so you may have issues trying to park.Also, this place gets crowded & you can only make a reservation if you have 6 or more."
6/10/2021,5 star rating,Workers there were super nice and would regularly check in to ask if i wanted any more food. the meat was really good and my four friends who'd never tried korean bbq before really like the experience and the food. would definitely come again!
8/28/2018,4 star rating,"We came here the day of my wife's cousin's wedding. Â My sister-in-law picked this out based on reviews. Â Yeah, I would have to say that it was a good choice. Â We got there right as it opened and the place quickly filled up. Â The all-you-can-eat allows for 3 meats at a time so we chose wisely. Â My favorite would have to be the squid which my wife and I liked. Â The bulgogi was also good too. Â We were not impressed with the brisket and also didn't have room for the kim chi fried rice. Â Oh well, we smelled like BBQ after leaving here. Â The pancake was a little mushy but others seemed to like it."
1/10/2019,5 star rating,My favorite AYCE KBBQ in ktown!! I love their as it's not the typical metal grill most places use! Helps the meat grill a lot more evenly without burning too quickly! The workers were really nice and laughed along with my weird dancing/antics!The best is the kimchi fried rice at the end!! DO OT FORGET!! It's so good and helps end the meal perfectly!!
12/23/2019,4 star rating,"First time in Koreatown and knew I had to visit a Korean BBQ. With so many options, it was very difficult to choose! Â Hae Jang Chon was right next to where I was staying, and looking at the amount of people waiting outside, I knew it had to be good.There are no reservations accepted, they take your name and your party's size and call you when they do. Â Make sure everyone is there or you loose your spot! And many people leave because they don't want to wait, so the list does move. Â We waited a little under 90 minutes for our table on a Saturday night. Â It's an all you can eat menu with a 2 hour limit for $37 per person for dinner.Once seated, they have an arrangement of sauces, Kimchi, rice paper, and radish to roll your meat selections in. Â Service is pretty quick so have your selections ready! You're only allowed 3 meats at a time to come to the table at a time. Â The sides are endless and you can do up to 30 items total.We started with Kimchi Pancakes and a steamed egg. Â I thought the egg wasn't great, and the pancake was pretty good, but not as flavorful as I thought it might be.We started with little octopus, marinated beef short rib, and bulgogi (seasoned BBQ beef). Â The little octopus was ok, I could of done without it. Â The beef short rib was delicious! They come to check on it continuously and cut it for you to make sure it's cooked. Â The bulgogi was by far the tastiest thing! Really enjoyed it! Â After we finished those, we had room for one more protein and ordered the Beef Brisket. Â This super thin sliced meat comes rolled up and cooked fast! Â It was tasty, had some crisp, and the right amount of fatty. Â It did need a little sauce on it to enjoy it better.Overall, I did enjoy everything here, the service was not 5 star, but I did think it was good. Â It's what you expect in a high volume AYCE establishment. Â I would come back and try more sides and meats, but the winner was the Bulgogi for sure!"
3/18/2020,5 star rating,My buddy brought me here I'm not too big of a fan of Korean barbecue but let me tell you the quality of meat and food is really good customer service not the greatest but the food made up for it the only thing is he ready to be waiting for hours to get in without a reservation and even with the reservation sometimes a wait time is long so be ready
5/29/2018,5 star rating,"By far one of the best AYCE KBBQ places I've been to. I came by for lunch on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all for a table of 4. Service is super quick, meat comes out quickly and they help you cook sometimes. I don't really mind if they cook, it just means less work for us. Plus right at the beginning, they gave us extra large portions of the rice paper without us asking! Always a huge thumbs up for that. You can order rice to go with your meal. Kimchi pancake will also come out at the beginning if you want it. The only thing is that if you order Kimchi fried rice, that comes at the end. That wasn't clear to us, so we were confused and too full at the end of the meal. But really, the quality of the meat is what makes this place great. Delicious pork belly, solid brisket, bulgogi and much more."
7/5/2016,5 star rating,"I discovered this place last year and recently went again this year in May. This is hands down my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant, it beats all Korean BBQ restaurants in Washington. The first time I came here, it was late at night around 10 PM on a weekend which meant a 2 hour wait. It was so worth it, and definitely took my sweet time eating all the yummy meats! The second time, we came on a weekday during lunch hours around 11:30 AM and there was no line at all. It was just as good as I remembered and the service is always spot on. They were always there to refill our sides and cook for us from time to time. The stone grill is amazing! I love how they clean it with white radish instead of having to change out the grill like most places. My favorite cuts of meat were both the thick and thin pork belly, the boneless short ribs, bulgogi, and brisket. The kimchi fried rice is amazing as well but it's cooked at the end so make sure you save room in your tummy for that! I love everything about this place. This will forever be my go-to stop when I visit L.A.! :D"
5/31/2018,5 star rating,"I absolutely love Korean BBQ. It is one of my top meals...period. And out of all the KBBQ places I have tried from SoCal to NorCal to alll the way in Chicago... this one is the absolute best. The quality of meats and the service is just top notch. The dinner price is 25.99 for AYCE, which is not bad at all considering the quality you get. The location is in a small business strip in Koreatown that has a couple of stores/restaurants. The parking lot in front of the restaurant is valet only (costs $2) which is nice in case you don't want to find parking, however you can usually find a spot a block or 2 away if you drive around. They usually have a wait if you come during rush hours so make sure to come early or be prepared to wait about an hour.Banchans (4/5): When you are seated there are a large amount of banchans(side dishes) that are good for both snacking on and eating with your meats. My favorite banchans would be the kimchi(always a favorite with me) and salad which has a nice vinegar dressing that can somewhat balance the absurd amount of meat you will consume. Meats (5/5): The meats at this restaurant are the highest quality I have had at a KBBQ place. I love every meat that I have tried here and have no complaints or suggestions that would make it better.Beef Brisket (5/5): Brisket is always my number one KBBQ meat just due to the fact that it's fun to cook and perfect for dipping in sauce. The brisket here is great and I always get multiple servings when I visit. Just be careful not to overcook it, as it is sliced fairly thin.Marinated Beef Short Rib (5/5): So this is probably my favorite meat at this location because it is so tender and flavorful. They give you a large strip of this meat that caramelizes nicely on the grill. The server usually cuts the meat into thin strips at the end, which is great because I would butcher it. The flavors and texture is just so good, make sure to try this if you like tender beefs.Prime Black Angus BBQ Beef (Bulgogi) (4.5/5): Bulgogi is always one of my favorites and they don't disappoint here. They give a good heaping portion that has a good balance of sweet and savory.Spicy BBQ Pork (4.5/5): If you like gochujang(korean fermented chili paste) you will love this. It has a strong but not overbearing gochujang flavor coating juicy and tender pork strips. I really like this dish, however eating a lot is a bit much flavor-wise for me, so share!A couple notes on the meal: there are several sauces that are at the table and I would recommend to try them all. Mix and match or just dip solo, the sauces really add flavor to each meat and this is one of the reasons I love KBBQ. My personal favorite is the sweet soy with the brisket, which adds a nice balance of umami and sweet. Also make sure to ask for some rice because nothing goes better with grilled meat than some carbs. I personally LOVE making a wrap with the meat and rice. I use the rice wrap, put some rice in the middle and then dunk the meat in sauce and put on top. Roll it up and pop your mini KBBQ wrap into your mouth for a satisfying mouthful. Overall this place is amazing and you will leave full (sometimes overly) and satisfied. I wish I lived in CA just so I could get this KBBQ every other week."
8/14/2019,3 star rating,It can get busy here. The parking situation is valet parking for about $2. It isn't a bad AYCE Korean BBQ spot just nothing special for a guy like me that doesn't eat pork/shellfish. They also have a specialty of making a kimchi rice on your stove when you're done with your meats.
12/8/2019,5 star rating,"I honestly think this is the best acye kbbq in Koreatown. I've always avoided coming here because I'd see the ridiculously long lines outside, but now I really feel that it's worth the wait and price. First of all, the servers really know what they're doing. I did not have to ask for anything twice and they're always checking up on you to flip/cut your meat. The meat quality was incredible and the kimchi fried rice with torched cheese at the end of the meal was amazing!!The only slight complaint I would have are that the stone pans they use get extremely hot and you can literally feel the heat on your face. It might just be because there was less air circulation in the corner spot I sat at... but it would be nice if it was cooler so I wasn't burning up during my meal."
8/4/2018,5 star rating,"Everyone is right - the meal here is really good.I want to bring a little more color to the pre-event.I brought my grand girls (9 and 14) for an excursion to KTown and it did not disappoint.We checked in here kind of late. I know how it goes, so we were aiming for 7 but got here at 8.Don't do this! It resulted in a 2 hour wait.But since this was a night in the town, we used the hour to talk over to the new mall on Western and it was worth it. The $1.50 Daiso Japan Store is worth a visit as are the dessert establishments on the 4th floor. The whole place which Includes a movie complex on the top floor that serves mini wontons Â has a cool vibe that says you are ""some place new"", maybe outside of the States...After an hour we returned to the restaurant for another hour wait, which we did in our car.There are a few benches outside but you can't count on seating, so be preparedThis is a place for meat eaters and heavy eaters at that.We had short rib, brisket, bbq beef,bbq chicken, shrimp and calamari and tasted most of the quite good side dishes.We were next to a table that was clearly enjoying themselves- like for 3 hours. Now that's how you do it. Turned out they were all chefs there to introduce their Italian colleague to the cuisine. And one was from ""Master Chef"" who jumped up brought over Italian salt and proceeded to cook and finish off our pork shoulder! It was fantastic- he was fantastic! Â I love living in LA.The girls had a night to remember and after finishing at 11:30 we left, happy, full, thinking this can only be done once a year and ready to fall into a food coma.Which we did!"
4/29/2021,3 star rating,"First time in LA. This is an average Korean BBQ, was not impressed. They were so busy, they barely come to see you and check if you need anything. Drinks and side dishes weren't refilled. Not sure if worth a second visit for me."
5/31/2016,4 star rating,"Still as good 2 years later from my first visit. However, prices raised to almost $25 a person for dinner. =(I actually really liked the kimchi pancake this time around as I mentioned 2 years ago I didn't like it. The parking lot is very small, but the valet is only $2. We ordered the brisket, thick pork belly, and beef tongue. All very good quality. I loved how the brisket was nicely marbled every time. Other places in the Bay Area isn't like that at all. We know how to cook our own KBBQ but the waiters kept coming around throwing our meat on the grill and we felt really rushed. I understand there's a lot of people waiting to be seated but we felt pressured to hurry. Other than that, they had pretty good service (taking orders and refilling waters, banchan, and sauces) for being so busy."
5/28/2014,4 star rating,"Under $20 for AYCE korean bbq? SHOOORE!! We got squid, octopus, brisket, bulgogi, and something else i forgot but was SUPER good. Don't cook your meat well done unless you like hard and tough meat. I like them medium rare. It cooked enough, but not too cooked so it still has a lot of flavor. The wait time was about 2 hours. We went to chicken place next door as appetizers...yeah appetizers to an AYCE. LOL. The steamed egg was good, didn't like the kimchi pancake, didn't get the kimchi fried rice but I tried it (it comes at the very end) it was different but pretty good. I liked it when it was extra crispy."
4/3/2020,1 star rating,"Love the food not the service ! Especially the person at the door named Hannah She was not welcoming at all, very rude and unprofessional. After waiting 2 hours, she called us finally. I saw that we were the next ones on the list and when I asked why she choose another regroup of 4 over us. She responded "" it's not because I call you that it means that it's your turn !!! I'm just checking if you are here"" Sorry but after 2 hours of wait and asking several times, of course we are still here ! And it's fair to treat people like this. I'm not from LA, I used to be very impressed by the quality of service in this city comparing to Paris where I'm from, and this time I was shocked"
5/20/2021,1 star rating,"Food was great. Customer service was terrible. Truly unreal. I am a food critic, so I travel to a lot of restaurants. This one was the absolute worst. I made a reservation 2 days in advance and learned that ""reservations don't matter"". Cannot make this up. Reservations don't reserve anything. Mind you, I had 2 more restaurants to critique that night, so you may imagine my dismay when I had to wait an additional 1 hr. 15 to be seated.This place had pure potential, but was tainted by it's incredibly rude management. I was belittled and told to ""calm down"" after inquiring on why my reservation had not been honored. Here, the customer is NOT always right. Wow, can't wait to publish."
6/3/2018,5 star rating,"Probably the best all you can eat Korean bbq I have ever had. LA has so many of these options which is a nice compared to Chicago. Among the 7 of us, the short rib was a clear hit over the brisket. We also tried the shrimp (good), pork belly(good to try once), marinated chicken, pork shoulder, spicy pork(good), bacon, and baby octopus. The variety of ban chan was sufficient...I like the steamed egg, spinach, fish cake. When you asked for more banchan, they gave us a bigger helping on the repeat requests. The soju was prefect compliment. The service was spot on as well. They staff was receptive from grilling to cleaning to getting us food.The wait time can be ridiculous. I would say get there at 6pm and hope for a shorter wait."
5/18/2016,5 star rating,"This is a good AYCE Korean BBQ and what makes them stand out is that they use stone grills. After you cook your meats, they make you some fried rice! It does get busy and crowded, so if you're local, you might try other options; however, they are good and I think it's worth the wait if it's reasonable. They do valet parking if you're worried about not finding street parking. Of course you start out with ban chan, Korean side dishes. Try the rice paper with the meat if you can. If you're new to KBBQ, start with the brisket because it cooks fast. Bulgogi is also good. I like pork belly and try to cook it a bit longer. Of course, if you get chicken, make sure it's cooked all the way. Meats taste great here. The pricing is based on what selection you're getting, so if you pay more, you have a greater selection. They have good quality meat and the experience here is good, so it's worth it. Service is good here and you'll typically find the button to push when you need service (water refill, refill the side dishes, more meat, the bill, etc.). For KBBQ, this is on my top list. Definitely give it a try."
10/20/2018,5 star rating,"This is probably one of my favorite Korean BBQ places. I find myself coming back here every time I crave Korean BBQ. Some of my favorites were the pork belly, the bbq chicken, the kimchi pancakes, steamed egg and beef brisket!! To top it off, the service is also amazing. They constantly check to make sure meat's being cooked/not being over cooked and I never have to wait to order more.I always end up valet parking in the complex for $3. Sometimes you can get seated right away and other times it can take up to an hour or more. I usually try to go around 2 or 3 pm for lunch or really early for dinner to avoid too much of a wait. Typing this review made me crave it again, so I'll be back soon. Definitely recommend to anyone trying to find a solid korean bbq spot in LA."
10/29/2018,5 star rating,The best AYCE Korean BBQ ever! No wonder the restaurant going strong since 2002. They use only USDA and Prime beef. We came on an Sunday afternoon and the line was not too bad for 20' wait only. The server come right after you seated to welcome you. They cook at the table for you and make sure you not lacking of any item during the meal. Best customer service for an AYCE bbq style with a very reasonable price. A must try experience.
10/29/2019,5 star rating,"What an amazing all you can eat experience! Â Friendly service and they cook and cut your meats for you! Â Everything was well seasoned and not overly salted. Â Super tender meat selections were all great! Â We ordered the soybean paste soup, steamed eggs and salad, and all were very delicious as well! Â The stone grill kept our meats from cooking and burning too fast. Â Midway through our meal, a sever came and cleaned our grill by scraping off the residue with what looks like shredded white carrot. Â Servers move fast in this restaurant. Â They do get busy, so I had to reorder a couple items after they forgot to bring out the first time, but it was no big deal, since they brought out the items immediately right after. Â No need to flag anyone down for food or drink refills, servers will come by frequently to check on your table. Â Parking is valet only for a small price of $2. Â If you're feeling hungry, this is definitely the place to visit."
2/3/2020,5 star rating,This restaurant was amazing ! Words can't explain what a good time I had with me and my girlfriend. The wait time was worth it. Shoutout to the staff there costumer service is incredible from checking on our food every so often to asking if we need more sides. They really know the time to ask. The FOOD ! Let me tell Â you. The food was out of this world delicious. Really would recommend this to anyone.
9/26/2016,4 star rating,"This place is so bomb!!!!!! I loved every meat that was served. Price: $23.99 AYCEArrived at 5:45 Â pm on a Sunday for 2 and only waited 10 minutes. They sat us at a round table that seated 5, however this seemed easier since as we ordered the meats, the waiters would cook the meat on the opposite side of us which was awesome. I tried cooking the meats in the beginning but quickly the tongs were placed too far on the opposite side of me and the waiters would come by every 2 minutes to flip the meats which was fine except that a few times the meat was burnt and I didn't have the tongs to flip it....or place into my plate....Their brisket, marinated beef short rib, and bulgogi was delicious!! I have to say the short rib was my favorite and really juicy.Cons:I really didn't like how the chairs were sticky, the plates and side dishes were sticky which bothers me on how good they clean their dishes. Also the fact that the vent didn't seem to work as the whole time the really minimal AC was making me sweat and kept blowing the smoke into my face which was not cool. Seriously need the vent to be working. Oh and Soda was $2 which was just a regular soda can, are you guys crazy?! But I still give 4 stars for waiters and delicious food!"
4/2/2018,4 star rating,"I have been here around 3 times now and I decided to finally write a review. There is always a line and the wait is usually at least 2 hours. We had a big party and decided to call ahead to make reservations but they only had an available time at 9:30pm. We didn't really have anything to do either so we decided to go early and see if we could get a table before our 9:30pm reservations. Got there around 7pm. Waited until 9:30pm and the table was still not available. Since reservations has priority, we still got seated at 9:30pm. Parking sucks! You can valet for $2 unless it's packed. Street parking is nearly impossible to find. We ordered the all of the beef selections which I have to say is pretty good. The quality of the meat stayed consistent throughout the night. Cooking on the clay also made the meat taste better. The sides were also just mehh with potato salad, radish, kimchi, spicy fish cake, and chinese broccoli. The service was great because they cook for you too! I just dont think this place is worth the 2+ hour wait. If I come next time, I would make reservations. The meat quality is great and service is great but just not worth the 2 hour wait. At $26/person for dinner, I rather just eat somewhere else with less wait."
11/14/2020,5 star rating,"The best and greatest, tastiest Korean bbq all you can eat resto I had in my whole life! I tried a lot in many different places/states etc this by far is the best. Price is good, the only thing YOU NEED TO KNOW you might need to wait 1 hour before you get seated especially dinner time! No wonder! Still I will always come back here when I get to LA!"
7/9/2016,5 star rating,"Personally, I never understood the price difference between all the kbbq restaurants in Ktown. For me, meat was just meat, they all tasted the same to me. However after eating at Hae Jang Chong, I truly understood the meaning of the word ""quality"". I have to admit, their food is definitely tastier compared to the other Kbbq restaurants such as Castle and Road to Seoul. They use a stone grill as opposed to the traditional metal plate oven. I'm not sure if it's the stone grill or the actual quality of the meat, but I had a very enjoyable dining experience at this kbbq restaurant. The beef brisket was extremely juicy, soft, and tender, and the texture just spells out the word ""quality."" This pretty much goes for all the other meat I tried. In addition, their service is great. The staff were all very friendly and all were eager to cook the meat for us. For the first time in Ktown, I don't have to speak Korean to get good service. Price is kind on the pricier end unfortunately, but in this case, I think the price justified the quality of the food."
4/7/2018,5 star rating,"Okay... I SERIOUSLY love this place. My friends and I went here after hiking, so of course we ate back all the calories we burned.The place is decorated nicely and there were many people eating as we came in, but we were seated right away. The side dishes are really good and spicy!! -especially the fish cakes. The first few meats we ordered were cow tongue, pork belly, bulgolgi, and brisket. My favorite by far was the cow tongue! It was soooo tender and filled with flavors. I really think the stone grill is a great addition to this place and makes it all the better because it conducts heat well and evenly, so all in all no meat burned that day! The bulgolgi was marinated in a rich, sweet sauce but I'd choose the cow tongue over bulgolgi any day. As for the pork belly and brisket, they were also packed with flavors and savory. To sum it up, the quality of the meat was off the charts so dont worry, you're getting what you paid for.As for the customer service, everyone here was very welcoming! I really appreciate how the servers cook the meat for you instead of the normal cook-it-yourself type situations. Super happy that we went here to eat, but sad it's so far away."
1/11/2020,4 star rating,"Great food and fresh! Makes you wonder why the lines are long and wait time can take to an hour. Con: sometimes the host would not come all the way out of their door and would call your name on a medium voice and if you don't answer within a minute or two, your name will be crossed out. Suggestions, stay by the door and make sure your party are all there. Recommend: Dont put a host who has a soft voice in a rush day or dinner time."
3/15/2021,3 star rating,"Mediocre at best. They have many rules such as, only ordering three items at a time, you can only order fried rice At the end of the meal, and they charge you $15 for leftover food. The tofu soup was a 5/10 and the fried rice was a 4/10. Bulging And brisket were the best they had. Wouldn't go back."
4/25/2018,4 star rating,"It is very hard to choose a Korean restaurant in Korea town Sonny choices! Â I have tried several in the past, ranging good to pretty awful.I read several reviews on this particular Korean BBQ which is All You Can Eat, and it seemed to be a popular destination in the area.We were seated after a five minute wait, staff were super attentive. Â You can order only three items at once, which stops the AYCE crowd from being wasteful, and they charge for leftovers.I liked the thin sliced pork belly and the squid! Â I also ordered intestine and trip - because, why not!Overall a really nice dinner, full of locals, and when we left the line and wait for a table was REALLY long. Â  I would recommend."
10/1/2019,5 star rating,AYCE is the place! If it's slimy and slithers this is where you wanna be! The price is right too! Hope you have thr Immodium AD handy! Oh and it can get loud but you know you've survived worse! This is what I have to say when Yelp! forcefucks you to type more than you want to say just to hit their minimum requirement for the length of a goddamn review LOLWTF?
7/21/2019,5 star rating,Service is great - they occasionally check up on your food and cook it for you rather than giving you your orders and leaving after. The allow you to do half sixes do you don't waste so much. Food was tasty.They do have valet parking and I forget if it was free to $2... But def worth to avoid finding parking when it's busy.
3/17/2018,5 star rating,"I came the second time on a tuesday around afternoon and got in right away. Just basically order every kind of meat in that they have lol, but I prefer squid to octopus here.I have never had kimchi fried rice here because I always end up eating too much meat. There are more types of banchan here comparing to other korean bbq places. The servers here are awesome, attentive and helpful.My most favorite korean bbq place ever tbh."
4/3/2017,5 star rating,"We got here at around 7:30 PM on sunday night so the wait was like an hour. But it was so worth it!I expected a lot here since it's really popular on yelp & been waiting to come. Even though there were lots of people, the restaurant didn't look chaotic. Especially, the servers are awesome!!!!! They really know what to do. And I was amazed when they used something like onion to clean the grill.I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves korean bbq."

7/31/2019,4 star rating,One of my favorite Korean BBQ spots! The meat quality is always great and the service is top notch. The only real downside is limited parking and a long wait.
5/22/2019,5 star rating,"This is the king of all you can eat KBBQ. I've been here several times and it's always excellent. The quality of meat seems a notch or two above other AYCE joints, and the service is excellent. Parking is a problem--but hey, that's Koreatown."
4/13/2019,5 star rating,"This will always be my favorite AYCE kbbq in LA. Yes, you'll have to wait up to 2 hours at times for a table, but isn't that part of the experience to get great food in Ktown? Love that they help cook your meat for you on the hot stone (which doesn't burn everything constantly or need a grill change!) and the additional steamed egg and kimchi pancake are bomb, as well as the yummy side dishes! Super attentive service, and they never get your meat orders wrong and it always comes out super quick. The brisket is to die for and gotta say the pork belly (recommend getting the regular as well as the thinly sliced option) is comparable. Every time a group and I go we have a standard rotating order of brisket and pork belly, beef belly/tongue, then angus beef/ribs and more brisket. We've noticed the quality of repeated meats isn't always up to par as the meal goes on but it's AYCE so there comes a point in time where everything starts to taste the same (lol?) but this place is always worth coming back to."
4/5/2021,3 star rating,5 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service. Wish they could hire more people to improve their customer service.
5/9/2019,5 star rating,"My first time having AYCE KBBQ in LA (I'm from New York) and first time waiting 1.5 hours for KBBQ... I have to say, it was pretty worth it! My party of 3 came by on a Wednesday night around 8:30 PM and this place was packed. You put your name down on a notepad and they call you when your table is ready. This place isn't too big so I guess it's not surprisingly the wait was long.This is probably the best AYCE KBBQ I had and the price is excellent. $27.99 per person and you get a variety of GOOD and QUALITY meats to choose from. Their thin sliced Canadian pork belly was amazing. They end your meal with kimchi fried rice with the option of mozzarella cheese on it - this was the BEST kimchi fried rice I had. The service here is quick! You literally get your order within 5-10 minutes. The employees here are super nice as well. The wait is worth it!"
3/27/2018,4 star rating,"Go hungry and come out stuffed, portion sizes were so big I had to request for the server to bring me half orders so I can try everything on the menu. The rice wraps and radish wraps were a great alternative to a bowl of steam rice so you can eat less carbs. Inexpensive valet parking available as you drive up the lot."
3/29/2018,5 star rating,"My favorite kbbq spot. I think one of the allures is the convenience of having a bar right next door. This place is always packed. So you'll absolutely have to wait a bit. This is actually the first kbbq place I ever tried upon moving to LA About 6 years ago. It's reasonably priced, and the menu is direct. All you can eat, everything. Easy. I keep hoping to find marinated short ribs at other joints that are as good, but they just don't ever really compare. In terms of quality, there are places with higher sourcing, but the prices are reflective. Valet in the front for like $2... $25 a person for dinner. (We even brought a vegetarian here once on accident and she was still stuffed when we left...so that's pretty cool). If you drink (which we always do... you're looking at like $45/person after tip and everything). Maybe it's because I've been coming for so long, but it's definitely my comfort spot for all you can eat! Great sides, great sauces, and quick staff."
8/6/2019,5 star rating,"One of the best KBBQ places I've eaten at in LA. They use a stone grill too? No other place in NorCal has that, so this is always a go-to spot for me if I'm ever visiting the area. The only set-back of this place is the 2 hour wait, so try to get there early before it gets packed. I know the workers do their best to accommodate everyone, which made the wait time SOOOOO worth it! I could not complain about anything else. The service was more than great, our server was attentive and also helped us cooked our meats. He made sure to refill our waters, check up on us every now-and-then, and knew when to ask us for meat orders. The beef brisket was delicious, but they also had other meat selections that were good too! Overall, this place never disappoints! I've been here twice and I plan to keep coming back again!"
5/12/2016,5 star rating,"I came on a Thursday night as a party of two and waited about 40min before getting seated. My boyfriend has been coming here for years and still loves this place! The restaurant is fairly small but it's worth the wait! The meat seems to be pretty good quality, the kimchi fried rice at the end was also very good. I may have been too full to eat much of it but it was better than some other kimchi fried rice I've had at other places. Servers are very friendly and always checking in on your table as well. I will definitely visit again if in the area!"
1/31/2016,3 star rating,How funny. Â Just realized my last review in 2012 was written 2 days short of being exactly 4 years. Came here for a gathering last night. Â Still have no idea what the dealios is about this place. Â $20. Tastes standard. Â My party had a reservation but we still waited 30minutes. Â Beef tongue was the only memorable cut last night. Â Everything else was standard. Â Service decent. One BIG PLUS was the unlimited rice paper and ssam mu radish.
1/29/2012,3 star rating,"Came for a birthday and had a party of 8 or 9...waited FOREVERR even with the reservation...so I'd say either come super early or just try coming later... as compared to the wait, the food wasn't as BOMB as I expected but still great. The waiters were really friendly and atmosphere was appetizing. Â The music was great as well. Â Had your average korean bbq choice of selections.. though I thought their bulgogi was a little bland for my liking... felt like it would do better if it were marinated a little longer.I also tried pork shoulder for the first time.. love it as much as I love pork belly. Â If you like crunchy fat, definitely give that one a try. all in all, I like Road to Seoul a tad bit more.. but this place is definitely up there in the ranks. they also had $2 valet up front..not that bad for LA... overall a great experience! Would come back again !check out my pictures : Â  )"
11/22/2019,5 star rating,"I know it's crazy to come on a Saturday but I did. We came at 4:30 PM and we waited for an hour to get seated. But when we got sat, the customer service was really great and unexpected for being so busy. We ordered brisket, beef belly and marinated Kalbi. Brisket and beef belly were good and easy to eat. I'm not too fond of the marinated sauce because it made it seem sweet. On a sidenote, we did order unmarinated Kalbi but the waiter didn't hear us. Banchan were all good, steamed egg - great, salad was OK. Favorite part was the customized kimchi fried rice at the end with torched cheese on top! Droolzzz."
4/8/2018,4 star rating,Thanks fellow Yelpers for all the tips and reviews that made our dinner so great! We were able to make reservations for the six of us on a Saturday night. We only had to wait 15 minutes until our table was ready. The small dishes were good and we even had enough choices for our non red meat eating friend. Enjoyed the kimchee rice at the end- the waiter will remind you that there is no meat after that. Tasty!
9/13/2019,3 star rating,"Food is delicious here. Their waiting system, not so great. It is currently 11:44am and the restaurant has multiple open tables for 3 however they do not sit the party unless everyone is there. 2/3 people are here and they do not allow adding on another individual even if it's not busy. Understood if it is completely packed however there is no one here! Why not make customer their first priority? Thank you"
11/22/2015,5 star rating,"THE BEST!!! I need to preface this review with the fact that this was actually the first KBBQ restaurant I've ever tried in LA (I've been in NYC a few times). However, my experience at Hae Jang Chon ranks as one of the top dining experiences I've had. The food - AMAZING. I came here without really knowing exactly what kinds of meats/food to get, so I asked the first waiter that came to our table. He recommended the kimchi pancakes, which were chewy, tasty, and overall balanced the rest of the meal pretty well. He also recommended the kimchi fried rice (which we did not end up getting) and the steamed egg, which complemented the spiciness of some of the other side dishes/meats. As for the meat, we started off with the black angus beef brisket, marinated beef short rib, BBQ beef, and BBQ pork, all of which were great. If I had to choose one that wasn't as good as the others, it would probably be the pork. We also tried the squid, octopus, shrimp (which is given in portions of ~5), and pork belly. All were great, and I would recommend them especially if you're a fan of seafood, but I think our first order with the beef was better. The service - one thing that really struck out to me about this restaurant was how well the servers worked as a team. While the servers didn't stop and chat a ton with us, they were very efficient, and different servers came to our table throughout the course of our meal to ask if we needed anything (or to help us cook our meat). At one point, one of the servers accidentally tilted the stone (?) plate into the fire/heat, then shouting for another server to come help her. The other server came over immediately and helped her fix the positioning of the plate.One last detail - there's valet parking for the small parking lot outside the restaurant. Overall, an amazing experience. I'm not a huge meat person, but I left super full and happy. Don't really have anything bad to say about this place. Definitely try it out if you're in Koreatown/LA!!"
6/27/2020,5 star rating,I was blown away how great this place was. Â For the grill it is a stone grill top. Our waitress Amy 6/27/20 was amazing she very attentive. Best Korean BBQ I have ever been too. Â Honestly my new go to place for a special occasion. Do not order more than you can eat. Â They did a great job under the new Covid-19 social distancing regulation. They take your temperature via long distance robot scan before you enter. Â The seats are spaced apart and clear dividers to create some distance. Everything was amazing. Best octopus I have ever had. The best Korean BBQ brisket I have ever had. The marinated beef short ribs were great. No slow rolling the meat out to you. Â There was hardly a time meat was not cooking. A+
8/3/2019,5 star rating,"Went in for lunch today. Was our first time and thought everything was great. The meat we chose was not too fatty and flavorful, the sides and sauces were great. The service was on point and the restaurant itself was clean and ample. Parking was convenient because of the valet system. Will most definitely be back!"
7/15/2019,5 star rating,"Buckle up kbbq fiends n girls Hae Jang Chon is POPPIN and for a good reason! This is one of the many really good ayce kbbq spots in Ktown. There is allllllways a wait and I understand why. The meat quality, the banchan, the $2 valet parking, the SERVICE!!!, and even the little metal cups of water that keeps your water cold, perfect. Honestly the only thing that really grinds my gears here is the menu! It's like it was made on ms word like what's up? The funny thing is they have a giant tv with a fancy menu with photos and bullet points like... pls just print that out!! Lol Otherwise amazing meat, the banchan was literally endless they would refill it before we even asked!!! There was even 5? Different types of dipping sauces ooof. The thing that really, really, makes Hae Jang Chon stand out though, is the service. Kbbq places are notorious for having difficult service because of the fact that the servers have a lot to do (which I understand as they literally bring us everything) but WHEEEEEW every. Single. Time. They do it all!! I went to go grab the scissors to cut up the kimchi pancake and our server grabbed it a literal second before me and started cutting for everyone!! Honestly my dream man, Andy this one is for u. He was fine and had tattoos AND was so fast I have a video of him cutting our short ribs too and sheeeesh if there was a korean version of The Flash, he's working the scissors here at hae Jang chon. F quarters and Kang Ho dong, I'm coming back for u Andy! HAHAHAHA"
12/16/2019,5 star rating,My favorite KBBQ spot in Koreatown. They offer all you can eat and the meat quality is really good. The service is also fantastic. The servers help you with cooking the food. Since the food is cooked on a hot stone it's less smokey than other KBBQ spots. There's usually always a wait on the weekends but it's totally worth it!
4/29/2016,4 star rating,"Came a little after midnight and to my surprise - there was a wait. The aroma of marinated meats filled the air and made up our minds for us. Yes, we are waiting.Think we only had until 1:15am or so to place our refills as this is an AYCE joint. Also, you're only allowed 2-3 refills at a time. Pretty smart actually as after the first refill, I was full. My favorite was their thin sliced pork belly. A lot of other KBBQ places make it differently. Some have a thicker cut, more fat and dry. Hae Jang Chon got it just right. Their short ribs was off the bone. I typically like it with the bone but it was still pretty yummy after we cooked it. For the amount of food you eat, the $22 price tag on weekdays is worth it. The servers were also very attentive and kept coming back to make sure our food was cooked properly as well as picking up any orders we may want to place with the kitchen. It was just what we needed for a late night fix."
10/21/2015,4 star rating,"I've had this place bookmarked for a long time and finally got a chance to check it out. Â We came on a Tuesday night around 9 pm, Â and waited 15-20 minutes for a table of two. They take reservations, which is a plus and unheard of for kbbq. Â They didn't have too many Banchan, but I really liked the small vegetables. Not sure what it's called, Â but looks and tastes similar to Chinese broccoli. Â Onto the meat, Â we tried the brisket, Â bulgogi, Â spicy pork, Â thin pork belly, Â honeycomb intestines, Â pork shoulder, Â marinated short rib and small octopus. My favorite was the short rib, Â spicy pork, Â thin pork belly and the honey comb intestines but all of the meat was pretty good. Â I think Â cooking on the hot stone grill adds flavor to the meat so everything tasted better!! In between cooking, Â they use sliced radishes to clean the grill which works wonderful. Â At the end, Â they cook kimchi fried rice for you. Let it cook a little longer on the grill so it gets nice and crispy. Â The service was very good, Â but it wasn't too busy so I'm not sure how they deal with crowds. Â Overall, Â a great spot for $21 for ayce and opens late."
7/12/2019,5 star rating,"My ode to meat. Â Meat how I love you, I especially love you when you are all I can eat. Â A few days ago I went to Hae Jang Chon. I pretty much fasted for 10 days surviving on the Jack Dorsey diet to prepare. I did stomach stretches everyday in preparation for my date with this dining establishment. On the day of, I woke up with a thrill in my belly! It was the day I had been working towards! I drank 3 sips of water and off to the gym! I couldn't concentrate on work thinking about the Canadian pork belly, or beef brisket, the bulgogi, Kimchi pancakes. My mouth kept watering and I realized I needed to step away from my laptop before I destroyed it. I had to decide on what to wear as I needed pants that could stretch for the occasion. I got to the restaurant and awaited my friends, sadly one of them was over an hour late and we could not be seated, so I waited whimpering softly in a corner. Then the moment of truth came, the friend show up and the nice hostess was quick to seat us. The smell alone carried me to the table. Our friendly waiter showed up and got us all of our fixings and our order. We made it through 3 rounds, I thought I had 5 in me, but no go. As I sat there in a meat induced coma they were kind enough to wheelbarrow me out, or maybe thats how I remember it? The meat is top quality, the waiters are attentive, the price, just right. Thank you Hae Jang Chon, I will be back, with more preparation I will go the full 5 rounds as I now know what I have to do!"
11/11/2017,5 star rating,"WE WAITED 90 MINUTES. On a Saturday night at 6pm. And I would do it again in a HEARTBEAT. When we finally left at 10pm, there was still a huge crowd waiting to get in. And I understood why.Best AYCE KBBQ ever. For the low price of $25.99 for dinner, you get all the fresh delicious meat you could wish for, banchan, steamed egg, and kimchi pajeon. (And salad I guess if you're into that.)We ordered (3 meats at a time):-beef tongue-short rib X2-shrimp X3-bulgogi X2-spicy bbq pork-intestines-tripe-baby octopus-thick-cut pork belly X2-mushroomsAnd at the end they make you kimchi fried rice on the grill. Our grill master Tiger was a pro, stern but fair with our meat-turning frequency and very on top of the ordering. I couldn't imagine a better KBBQ experience TBH. Will def return."
5/13/2018,4 star rating,5/5 on Food & 3.5/5 on ServiceFOOD - amaaazing! The food was sooooooo danky! I loved all the items that came through our way! I loved that food quantity per order is really filling. The marination is also delicious !SERVER - he was on point with his service. The orders came in quickly after we received our first plate. He was on top of it and assisted us when we needed SERVICE - the service was decent. Only issue was that waiting time was constantly changing... their waiting system is also quite confusing. We were not aware that they take a role call; we were told to check in 45 minutes. We then got back to check and noticed we got an x... meaning the wait is now longer. That's the only issue I had.
6/15/2019,4 star rating,"Made reservations for 8 at 8pm. The line outside on a Friday night was ridiculous and parking is awful. Valet was full and we parked down the street at a paid lot. The whole party must be present for them to get you a table. We waited about 20mins past our reservation for a table. The table was a bit crowded but the food was awesome. Great meat quality. The bulgogi, short rib, steak were my favs. The fried kimchi rice at the end was amazing. Great spot in K-Town for KBBQ"
2/26/2019,4 star rating,"My bf and I were visiting from TX and decided to make this our last meal. We left stuffed and satisfied.Things we got:1. Unmarinated brisket- our favorite meat here. Even though it wasn't marinated the quality was very good and the meat to fat ratio was just right. 2. Bulgogi- again, quality of meat was amazing and the flavor was pretty yummy too.3. Squid- I'm usually not a huge fan of squid, but theirs was the best I've ever had. There wasn't any kind of weird fishy smell or taste and the texture made it so good.4. Marinated Short Rib- it was too chewy for my liking and the marinate wasn't that great. 5. Pork Belly- it was way too fatty and the portion was so big, which made it impossible to finish. 6. Kimchi pancake- we thought that we wouldn't want to waste any stomach space, but it was the perfect balance. 7. Steamed egg- very good. It's great to share some bites when you feel like you've had too much meat. 8. Kimchi Fried Rice- this was my personal favorite. It was spicy and packed with flavor. We had some leftover brisket at the end so our server mixed it in and it was delicious. This was probably the best Kim chi fried rice I have ever tried, so be sure to save room for it. The only reason why I've knocked off a star is because I felt like the flavors weren't all there for the short rib, which is my favorite kbbq meat.Regardless, it was a great experience. The servers will cook all your food for you and never once will they forget to flip your meat. I was shocked at how attentive the service was and wished that more AYCE kbbq places would do this. The entire strip is valet only at $2. The wait can be long, but the bar two doors over has amazing happy hour, so it's worth grabbing a drink or two before your meal. Overall, I highly recommend checking this place out for yourself."
7/26/2020,5 star rating,"Such delicious marinated short ribs and other meats. Â Stone grills are key to the best taste. Great service from super friendly young wait staff. No attitude, KBBQ newbies welcome. Relaxed, popular, busy atmosphere. Â Just expect a bit of a wait. Â Suggest COME EARLY!"
10/6/2017,5 star rating,"Ktown has so many kbbq, but which one is actually good ?? My friend looked thru all the yelp reviews for each place and we ended up with this one. We got here and there were many people waiting outside so ofc we had to put our name on a list. The restaurant is considered big for a kbbq place bc most kbbq places are tiny. The wait went by super quick and we sat down within ten minutes of waiting. This place is different because of a metal grill, it's on a stone pot instead. They offer all you can eat for $26 per person during dinner. The portions are big each time so we only got two rounds of meat and the kimchi fried rice that we couldn't finish. The meat and the cut here is very fresh. Tiger, our server possibly even the owner was very nice and patient despite the amount of people he had to serve. We left this place full and $100 gone, but man I was satisfied."
9/18/2015,4 star rating,"Another AYCE KBBQ to check off my list. The banchan (sides) are good, the meats are fresh and the service is good as well. You get that trifecta and you are usually good when it comes to all you can eat. The per person pricing is affordable (if i remember, about $20 per person). They serve beer and soju, the restaurant isn't totally big and they have tvs, the wait staff speak good English and clean establishment. Valet parking (hate valet parking) or find metered street parking. Good to go for KBBQ! Fyi...if you go with a Korean speaking friend, the serve is a lot better! :)"
9/1/2019,4 star rating,"First time trying this Korean bbq.The pan gets oily due to fats not dripping. It can be good due to its flavor but it gets way too oily.You can order 3 meat at a time. They'll charge you if you don't finish. And will not be given meat if there are still uncooked meat.Their mashed potato has apples in it. It's weird but in a good wat. Meat is premium and you can taste the difference from other kbbq. They sometimes will cook for you, so enjoy eating.Save some space for kim chi fried rice. Kim chi fried rice is good and a different kind if fried rice. You can add cheese to your fried rice. It is served last and only if you ask for it.Valet parking only. We didn't wait that long on Monday night. It wasn't that busy at that time.Must try kbbq if you're in the area."
3/23/2020,5 star rating,"I could not figure out where the front door was but I did not need to. During this atypical time of Coronavirus protocol, they brought our hot, delicious food out and packed the back of our car. We have been supporting or favorite restaurants but this day we wanted to try a new restaurant. This was a great try. The soup is tasty. The salads and other vegetables were fresh. Their signature dressing is sweet. I was not expecting that. Overall, we were happy."
12/9/2019,5 star rating,Super friendly service. Very helpful and explained everything on the menu and on the table. Nice upbeat music also! Meats were great and fresh especially the short rib. Yum!
3/13/2019,4 star rating,"It's been a few yea s since I have been here. But it is still one of my favorite spots. They would have had 5 stars if they would have honored our reservation. Even with the reservation it was a 45-50 minutes to be seated. That being said, Andrew was our server and this guy is amazing. Made us feel welcome and was always right behind asking if we needed anything. The food here is amazing for the price. They use a flat stone instead of a grill. It's great for the flavor of the meats. The brisket here is wonderful, and the fish cake is one of my favorite in LA. Till next time Andrew thanks again for turning out night around."
8/7/2017,3 star rating,"I'll begin by stating what I DIDN'T like about this location. -All people in your party must be present before sitting (forget someone being late or you're all screwed)-Some of the tables were so close to each-other , I couldn't even stretch a leg and the neighbor behind me accidentally hit me with his elbow-HOT - no cooling fan or anything to keep me motivated as I cook the meat off the burning grill AND MY FAVORITE:-You get charged $15 for any ""left"" meat Â - whaaat?I tried to understand the concept about charging you for leftovers since it's AYCE - why put food to waste? BUT then after serious and concentrated thinking, I realized that I paid $25 for AYCE and between two people, paid $67 w/ only 3 soda drinks. So then I thought - it's my problem if I leave a bit of meat that I thought I could eat and realized I couldn't actually finish. I just paid almost $70 for 2 people so I am entitled to my leftovers and what I choose to do with them.So after overeating, we left a bit of brisket. To my surprise, the server had an eye on us, grabbed the meat and distributed the remainder to mine and my husbands plate and topped it off w/ "" it's only a little bit, you can do it"" LOL- yes, that was funny. After we had our giggle, I got annoyed. I tried to finish it and almost vomited in my mouth. I was chewing on a single piece for minutes until I realized I wouldn't be able to force it down my esophagus. I had no choice but to wrap some brisket in a napkin and quickly toss it in the trash at my first opportunity. Now to share some positivity - I enjoyed the meat. It was good quality and their house sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and chili. We were seated quickly and the server was attentive but seriously I can't get over the ""leftovers"" situation...In fact I'll also add it was pricey. This is giving me anxiety - 3 stars THERE.I've made up my mind."
12/29/2017,4 star rating,"4 stars because of the food, which is the most important part.Authentic Korean BBQ experience (I think). Did not like the potato salad, had chunks of a mysterious dark orange fruit. Spinach and spicy tofu strips were fine. The steamed egg and kimchi pancake were decent, but the meat (we got beef bulgogi, short rib, thick pork belly, pork shoulder) and mushrooms were SO good. Juicy, Â flavorful and fresh, in one package. I like how they give you 4 sauces to begin with, then you can get more if you need to. The pickled soy sauce was actually very good--a touch of sweetness and not strong like the other ones which were either salty or spicy. Plus, $25.99 per person is not bad for AYCE. 1 star off because 40 minute wait for 2 people when arriving at 6:05 pm. Lettuce or sesame leaves wrap is an extra $5 (luckily you can get the salad and kind of work with it). The sizzling from the grill is terrible; DO wear long sleeves or a cardigan when wearing here. Hot oil droplets popped off and I wasn't even sitting that close to the grill. Also, toward the end when we said we didn't want any more meat, the waiter just brought the receipt while I was still finishing the rest of the meat and salad. When I cleaned off my plate, I realized I wanted more short ribs, but the waiter said that the receipt was a done deal. If I realllllly wanted more short ribs, I would receive another AYCE charge of $25.99. I don't understand, because isn't the point of AYCE that I can eat as much as I want? Why does it matter if the receipt was given (by the way, again, I didn't even ask for the bill)? A look at the receipt also showed that they recorded what I ordered, which I've never seen before for an AYCE KBBQ restaurant."
3/11/2019,4 star rating,"I'm normally gung-ho about Korean BBQ but because of their steel plate instead of the usual grill, our meat wasn't crunchy enough for my taste. It was good but was not well-done enough for me. The service was great and the look and feel of restaurant appealed to us. Not sure if we will be back though."
7/29/2015,4 star rating,"Came here at 11:30pm and got sat right away. On my Korean BBQ food diaries I have ventured through the various tiers of kbbq that koreatown had to offer. My friend brought me here since it was open late and because of their kimchi fried rice.Their side dishes are standard consisting of potato salad, Korean greens, spicy bean sprouts, kimchi, and fish cake. As well as the rice paper and four dipping sauces normally provided at kbbq restaurants.The meats, We ordered the usual brisket, marinated short rib, thin pork belly as well as the thick pork belly and of course the steamed egg (smiley face). In comparison to the other kbbq places I have ventured to, Hae Jong chon has the best quality brisket out of them all. And though the short rib was good, the meat itself was way too chewy and therefore I did not thoroughly enjoy it. Pork belly was soooo yummy! At the end of your meal, the servers will ask if you'd like kimchi fried rice. SAY YES. It is the perfect ending! And here's a tip, save some brisket to chop up into the fried rice, it makes it so so so much better than it already is. For a dinner price of $21.99 it's rather high in comparison to others, but if you sit through 2 hours of grilling and continuously eating it's most definitely worth it."
3/30/2018,3 star rating,"This place is definitely overrated.The service is great, no doubt.But there is nothing special about the food. They cut the meat into very thin slices and I don't like that.Valet parking is $2."
6/19/2019,4 star rating,"Came on a weekday and yes it gets busy but if you come by 630 or earlier, there isnt a wait. I always feel a little hesitant judging service at kbbqs because I understand, it gets crazy, cooking for tables but also bussing meats and side dishes. Still, some places do it better than others and the night I went, it was slow and I had to request for things multiple times. The quality of meat was very good though. This place is truly a 4.5 review."

And this place is different than any other place I've been too because you cook on an iron casket instead of metal so the food definitely tastes differently. Only down side is if you don't finish it they charge you... But my party didn't have that problem in finishing food! Overall, great food, experience & Â good customer service"
2/19/2021,1 star rating,Called and said and hour wait. Arrived all the staff was telling me an hour wait. I put my name on my list and guy says 4 hour wait. They lie. Wasted my time here when they could have saved me a trip. They were closing in 4 hours so don't believe when they say they will stay open later.
10/24/2019,5 star rating,"Love their service and their quality of meat. It's great if you go around 5PM on weekdays, not so much of a wait :)) I'd say going with 4+ people would be perfect since you'd be able to try different types of meat"

3/9/2018,5 star rating,"I've been to many kbbq restaurants, but this one is probably one of my favorites. The quality of meat was great for $26/person. It can a little bit more of the price, but it's worthy. Not to mention it's pretty common for LA area. I also loved the side dishes here. They had a good variety of veggies and meat choices which made it more exciting. The decoration is also very homie and catchy that made me feel like I was eating in Korea. ^-^ It was pretty spacious and their vent was pretty powerful, so it didn't leave me too much of the barbecue smell afterwards. They also cooked the meet for us so that was awesome. Definitely will come back when I'm in LA. -Tip: Free valet parking as well."
3/14/2020,5 star rating,"Best kbbq spot ever! Definitely my go-to kbbq place whenever I'm in LA. The pricing is reasonable for the quality you're getting. Highly recommend everyone to come here if you're around the area. The only downside is the long wait, but that just shows how bomb this place is. I think if you have a party of 6 or more you can get a reservation so definitely do that if you're going as a big group to skip the wait."
9/9/2019,5 star rating,"This place blew our expectations away! I was trying to find a good KBBQ place for my boyfriend's birthday and at first I was put off by the mentions of long wait times in the other Yelp reviews. However, we only ended up waiting 45 minutes for the two of us. The meat selection isn't as large as some other places, BUT the quality was more than obvious! If you go, you have to try the beef tongue. I know, I know, it sounds gross, but the meat is thinly sliced, tender, and mouth-wateringly delicious. Their beef bulgogi wasn't as sweet as some other places, but it melted in our mouths like butter! I can't believe we got to have such delicious meat for a steal of a price! Aside from the meat, we loved the staff! They were kind yet to the point, and we never felt rushed during our dining experience. The waiter that cooked our meat for us was very kind and and didn't let our meat burn. Also, the ventilation was good, we barely saw any smoke. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and we'll definitely be coming back!"
5/18/2016,4 star rating,"I think it's become a habit of ours to come here every time we're in Koreatown. I've been here plenty of times, one of which was for my birthday. I really enjoy cooking the meats on the stone pot instead of grills. It tends to taste better in my opinion. Also, the quality of the meat here is top. We ordered the brisket and the marinated short rib: both are amazing choices. They also cook the food for you which is both a good and a bad thing to me. On one hand, I usually prefer to cook my food myself but on the other, I do like to enjoy my food without having to be constantly cooking at the same time. Like everyone says, the parking area is valet all the time (this time, we came at 3pm and they were here) so just be prepared to have cash if you want to park conveniently."
2/11/2020,4 star rating,"My go to for ayce kbbq. Meat quality is still quite good for an ayce spot and the service is great. Only problem is you get here during peak hours, the wait time can be 1-2 hours. Recommend going for lunch on a weekday for the best experience."
3/7/2018,5 star rating,"If you're in Koreatown (or LA for that matter) this is the Korean BBQ restaurant to go to. It is hands down my favorite place. I have been here for dinner with a large group and again with just one other person. Either way, the best way to go is to do the all you can eat for $25.99. There are 27 options on the menu, as well as an array of sauces, sides and steamed rice paper wraps prepped on the table. Brisket, short rib, tongue - I loved all of it. If you like meat, you won't be disappointed. Â This place has a fun vibe and Â the music can make it a bit noisy. The service is amazing! Everyone there is working as a team and is incredibly efficient. Â Helpful tips: $2 valet parking Reservations for parties of 6+ ONLYThis place is always packed, expect to wait"
2/20/2020,4 star rating,"Delicious! No photos as I was very hungry & eating tf out of everything Wasn't paying much attention to other tables but our waiter cooked mostly everything for us which was a first for me. Korean bbq restaurants I've been to (in Houston) we cook it ourselves. They also give you more sides to accompany the meat like steamed egg, kimchi pancake (SO good) & kimchi rice with mozzarella at the end!There isn't much variety to choose from in the actual meat aspect though. Despite that, almost everything we tried was so good. The exception being the brisket, it was over cooked but even then it was too thin & had no flavor. The sliced Canadian pork belly wasn't a fav of mine either.I'd definitely come again if we're back in LA especially because the area has lots of other interesting Korean places to try. Only when it's not busy though, wait was about 45 mins around 7 at night & parking in the lot is valet, 3$. You realize why when you come out & they have cars double parked & sideways because of how busy this place gets!"
5/19/2015,5 star rating,"My new favorite AYCE KBBQ restaurant! I was thinking that I better get the money's worth when I came in because it's pretty expensive compared to other KBBQ restaurants, but trust me, you definitely will get your money's worth here. Everything you pay is worth it! The meat is sooo good here, you can tell the quality is MUCH better than the other places, and I love steamed egg and they make it delicious. They help you cook the meat, but you can cook it yourself also so I love that part about it! Plus they don't shove it in your plate when you're done or anything, you're free to get it yourself. Other places, you either cook it all by yourself or they cook it for you and put it all in your plate without even asking. The service was great -- especially Sarah. She was so funny and kind to us and really attentive :) I don't eat spicy so she styled a fried rice at the end! I'll definitely be back whenever I'm craving KBBQ! There's street parking and valet for $2."
6/18/2017,4 star rating,"Came here with a rather large group on a Sunday afternoon. The wait wasn't that bad considering there were eight of us. We waited approximately 20 minutes, but I imagine it gets pretty bad for dinner.Their menu has a lot of options for AYCE. Definitely get the kimchi pancake. It's so good and I wish we got more of it. Their meats are also pretty quality! No complaints. They also have an option for kimchi fried rice. In my opinion, their kimchi is definitely more sour than others, so not a fan, but if you like this, then I'm sure you will enjoy it. So, I didn't really like their kimchi fried rice, but overall I enjoyed my experience here.The service is really good! Often times, the servers would come over for us to cook and cleaned our grill for us. They have a stone grill, which isn't that common, so that was nice to see. They also have this little tray that gathers all the oil and fats when they clean the grill. It was a little unpleasant to look at, but really loved their service for cleaning the grill. Wonderful service and were very fast in bringing out food and side dishes. However, you would have to cook for yourself sometimes, they do not do all of the cooking for you.For parking, they have a valet for parking, so bring cash for that!"
8/3/2017,5 star rating,"This place is absolutely amazing! The meat is fresh and super tasty. A definite must try is the short rib. The short rib is well seasoned and has a ton of flavor. They have two different pork belly dishes. They have thick cut and thin cut. In my opinion, thin cut is way better. They also serve salads, steamed egg, and kimchi pancake with every table other than the typical banchans. You also get the option of having either regular rice or kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal. Kimchi fried rice is the way to go. Service here is good. The servers are super busy but they do take the time to remember all of the orders people put in. When they have time, they do help cook the meat for us too. The location isn't big, so large parties aren't advised. The wait is long due to it's popularity. They have a parking lot, but I think it is all valet parking. Valet parking isn't expensive so it's worth it to use the service."
12/24/2018,5 star rating,"Wait time before getting seated: ~ 1.5 hrsI will tell you right now that wait time is worth it.There's a lot of KBBQ places here in SoCal. Â In K-town alone, there's almost one on every block (over-exaggeration ... maybe). Â So why wait over an hour, sometimes two, to get seated when you can just go to one a block over and get that KBBQ fix? Â Because this isn't the place to satisfy that KBBQ craving.This is the AYCE KBBQ place to eat REALLY GOOD QUALITY KBBQ.The quality of the meat is top notch. Â And there's probably something about that stone grill that help bring out the amazing flavors of the meat. Â My favorite, the beef tongue. Â For me, THE BEEF TONGUE was THE STAR of the show. Â So much so we ordered a few orders of it.The service is also amazing. Â Unlike a lot of KBBQ places, they bring out the meat pretty quickly (probably also in part to turn-over the tables quicker), the plates of meat don't get smaller and smaller as you progress in the meal, and they don't give you dirty stares when you order more sides. Â Yes, I have experienced all the above at other KBBQ places, but not at Hae Jang Chon. Â The servers are incredibly helpful, and will even help cook the meat as they pass by.$25.99 for dinner. Â Great service, delicious food. Â WORTH IT!"
7/26/2019,5 star rating,"Get ready for the sweats, meat sweats. It will drop down your face in pure gluttonous pleasure. There is no shame in this game. This will be one of the best korean bbq experience you will have outside of Korea (this is an assumption, never been).This place is no frills, limited ban chans but no limits when it comes to quality and quantity. Their gimmick for you is to focus on the meats, the quality and not the frills and thrills that mask it. The marinated meat seasoned well enough to still taste the pure beefy goodness and not the sugars.The staff are excellent. Just the right amount of service to not be hovering. For most part they help cook your meal while you chow down on what has already been cooked. They keep the food flowing like a seamless machine. Plates after plates to the table. Flip after flip on the hot stone plate. Our server suggested that we order our next round of carnivorous pleasures before we finish what we already. This is due to the impact of patrons and orders. He made sure we were fed and happy without disruption.If you're a glutton for punishment, this place will sure to punish your Â gastronomic Delights."
7/27/2017,3 star rating,Be prepared to wait for at least an hour... We came here on a Sunday evening and waited for over an hour for a party of 3. The place is not very big and is located across the street from Haus. Good selection of meats at a decent price. $26 for all you can eat. Their beef brisket and thick pork belly were pretty good.I was pretty disappointed with their Kalbi as it was rather tough and didn't have too much flavor. Their spicy bulgogi was a bit too much like shredded beef.. Service was really good.. the servers kept checking up on us from time to time and made sure our meat was cooking properly. The grill did tip over at one point and oil was all over the place.. luckily it didn't get on anyone. I might try a few other places before coming back.. but all and all not bad.

12/15/2018,5 star rating,"Best AYCE around. The quality of meat is reaaally good for ayce and the selection makes this spot always exciting and fulfilling when craving a kbbq-pigout session. The marinades are well done and sides are always fresh and spicy. I recommend y'all to try the tripe, beef tongue, intestines, and thin pork belly! Service is also quick and the wait isn't that bad. We always have an early lunch (11am) or early dinner (4:30pm) to beat the crowd."
3/8/2017,4 star rating,"Came here on a weekday at 6pm with a group of friends and there was no wait. Parking was easy with their valet for $2 so that was great.The quality of the meat is pretty good and our favs were the pork belly, galbi, and beef tongue. Yes, beef tongue sounds gross but once we all tried it, we loved it so much that we ordered a total of 6 more!Service is great here, but it can be a little slow in terms of waiting for your meats to arrive. Overall I liked this place and love that they grill kimchi fried rice after you are done with the meats. It definitely got crowded by the time we left (~8pm) and there was a long wait out the door.Will definitely be back :)"
12/9/2017,4 star rating,"The bf and I decided to find a spot closer to home and this is it. We did the all you can eat for $23.99 pp the bf likes trying all the crazy stuff on the menu like tripe, beef tongue, octopus, intestines and so on. The service is top notch and get this the server does the cooking every time we tried to cook he appeared lol he didn't want us messing up the situation. All the ingredients were quality the color was vibrant and smelled great. All the condiments that come with it were tasty. Overall great experience and would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to try. It's in a small plaza they have street and valet parking which is a whopping $2. I'm just saying you may spend more on the meter so splurge and go valet."
7/18/2019,4 star rating,"This is the best all you can KBBQ spot in LA. The quality of the food is great, they have a variety of options, and the price is reasonable. I must warn you.. it does get busy.. sometimes a 2 hour wait. The restaurant is clean and the staff is nice. The restaurant is a bit small and it can get loud. The restrooms are not the cleanest. And they only allow up to 2 credit cards per bill. I would definitely recommend this place! It's in a shopping center and they have valet parking available for $3 (great deal)."
7/17/2019,5 star rating,"It's been about 5 years since I've been here, this restaurant is one of the things I miss the most about living in SoCal. The food is just as good as I remembered. Amazing meat quality. Since they're a small place, they do have to rotate out customers pretty quickly. I did feel rushed by our server but I understand why it's necessary. Overall, I'd come back here in a heart beat. Too bad I'm only visiting :("
2/25/2019,5 star rating,"For someone with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), there are TWO things that I hate.1) Traffic (driving to Los Angeles)2) Restaurants with ONE restroom!But damn! This is the best KBBQ I've ever had that I could careless about the traffic or the one restroom (kind of). Pretty cool to cook the food over some ancient looking 2000 BC stove or whatever.The meat is delicious. The kimchi fried rice is great. Parking is alright (valet). Go go go!"
1/28/2018,3 star rating,"My first time trying authentic Korean style BBQ. I came here with a friend after attending the Gay Pride Festivities in West Hollywood. According to my friend this is one of the best Korean BBQ spots in LA. Due to all the hype I could not wait to try it.We arrived we had to put our names on a list and patiently wait to be called. I am glad we came when we did because our wait was 30 minutes and anyone after us was an hour to an hour and thirty minute wait. So while we waited we walked around the plaza and checked out unique stores. When we came back we were seated.I thought Korean BBQ is where they cook the food right in front of you and give you a show. It was kinda like that but for the most part my friend and I had to cook our own food. Every now and then a woman would walk by and move the meats around. Since we were seated at a two table, our grill or castor iron stove (whatever you call it) was pretty close to us, to the point I can feel the meat juices popping in my face, which burned. So I was definitely left with some PTSD scars lols I let my friend do all the cooking while I observed the wait staff and patrons and focused on not getting burned.Luckily I survived and was ready to go back to the parade. Korean BBQ is not for me, maybe on special occasions but will not be going out my way to dine at these places.The staff was friendly and people were definitely chowing down on the food due to unlimited meat selections for 3 meats you choose. Great experience but I will be trying out other KBBQs that won't leave me scared for my life. But definitely I can mark this off my bucket list for sure."
12/17/2019,1 star rating,"We drove 35 mins been there around 1:02am, and the sever told us last call at 1:20am, and they sad they will set up the table for us, after 5 mins, they told us that we only can order two round before 1:20 am, it's ridiculous, the restaurant open until 2:00am, we been there 1 hour before close, but......."
1/18/2017,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon was amazing, and one of the best Korean BBQ I have had.They have a wide selection of 27 different items to choose from in the All You Can Eat option.For lunch, 11am-3pm on weekdays is $21.99.For dinner, 3pm-Closing and all day during weekends is $23.99.Here is a link to their mobile website to view the full menu: haejangchon.com/mobile/mâ¦I went on a Sunday evening at 7:30pm during MLK Weekend, and I had to wait 2 hours before getting seated. The wait was gruesome as I was extra hungry.. but as soon as I got seated, the service was great and extremely fast!The servers prepare the table before you get seated with all the side dishes, and ask what you want to drink immediately. Then they ask you for the meats you want, you can only order 3 different types at a time. ****Try ordering the Prime Beef Brisket and the Unmarinated Beef Short Rib, those are my absolute favorites!****Once you finish, at the end, you can choose to get the Kimchi Fried-Rice, which is something you don't want to pass on, even though you may be too full from all the Korean BBQ you might've eaten right before. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try out some great Korean BBQ, however, keep in mind that this restaurant actually is geared towards Americans. If you want the authentic Korean BBQ, you might want to check out a few doors down, and dine at Byul Gobchang. This place has the pure Korean taste. But again, Hae Jang Chon was still great and you can't go wrong with a visit here!!"
3/9/2019,5 star rating,The service was really good here and the food was super tastyWill definitely come back here
8/8/2016,5 star rating,"Best KBBQ ever! I don't say that lightly. ""But Pauline, it's literally just grilling unmarinated meats..."" Trust ya girl. We waited about 50 minutes to an hour when we came at 8pm on a Thursday night. $23.99 AYCE with a decent selection of high quality meats. The brisket, thick pork belly, marinated and unmarinated short ribs were my favorites. I've had my fair share of KBBQ back home in Tejas but Koreatown LA has got Tejas beat. Good banchan with nice and crispy kimchi pancake! The only thing I was disappointed about was wanting kimchi fried rice but not being able to get it. The thing with Hae Jang Chon is that they don't offer kimchi fried rice until the very end of your meal after you are completely stuffed with AYCE meat. They wait until the end to cook the fried rice in front of you on your stone surface. There's just no way I can carb-load at the end when I've protein-loaded. Oh whale.So what's unique about this place is you do all your cooking on a stone surface which is actually pretty awesome because the meats don't burn as much as they do on a metal grill. At other KBBQ places, you constantly have to get your grill changed. Here at Hae Jang Chon, they come by and clean the grill with radishes (?) it's pretty efficient and much more practical. Stellar service here. The staff is always eager to come by and help you grill and cut your meats. My dad gave all the staff two thumbs up as he was leaving the restaurant (so embarrassing) but if this place got my dad's seal of approval, it's a 5/5."
12/25/2018,4 star rating,It was really good but the wait was 40 minutes long. Service was good although you do have to ask for water refills yourself since they are very busy. Would give 4.5 stars.
9/30/2018,3 star rating,I guess I'm just still not sold on the whole cook it yourself thing. So this is the second Korean bbq place I've been taken too and I'm not sure if I'd return. I came here with a friend to meet up with two other friends. The hostess was a little pushy about we can't sit you until your whole party is here. I don't understand why. We were in time crunch as we came here on our lunch break. But once we sat down the service was incredible. Someone was always there to take more orders bring more food clean the table cook the food. They were amazing. And for such a great price- all you can eat for $20.So with great service and a nice restaurant- that's great. But I just don't like the way the food tastes...
3/5/2020,5 star rating,"Love this place, usually seats you pretty fast. There's a beer spot next door where you can grab a Pint while you wait, if there's a line."
12/21/2018,4 star rating,"This Korean BBQ is amazing! When eating the food, you can taste how good the food quality is. I personally enjoy having the beef brisket, the beef bulgogi, and to top it off, the kimchi pancakes are to die for! The servers are very attentive and are quick to bring your orders to the table. The reason I am giving this restaurant 4 stars is because the wait can be very long. On a few occasions, we have had to wait close to 2 hours to finally get seated. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if they expanded the restaurant or opened a second location."
6/12/2019,1 star rating,"Crap... Tried to dilute with Korean #1 SoJu...Did not work.... Never go wrong with SoJu, but not this place. Â Crap... service crap... meat crap... over all crap... Also, no Korean customers which means not a Korean restaurant. Â One star rating is too much."
11/21/2020,1 star rating,We called before we show up to this place and they told us it 15-30 minutes of wait. We got there with a family of 5 with 3 kids and the manager kevin told us it takes 1 1/2 to be seated. I was misinformed over the phone and the place didn't even have good service and looked dirty with a tent set up outside. They need to change their management and keep the place cleaner. Very disappointed
10/21/2018,5 star rating,"Omg...so worth the wait! All their proteins are so yummy!!!! The people still cook the food for you which is fine cuz I'm lazy and I can't cook at all even if you try to make it easy for me.I had to like compose myself cuz I was like ""ahhhhh, I'm on a diet."" Then a friend told me this is kept diet so it's fine, but I'm Asian and I need rice to live lol. Definitely worth the wait and the food is amazing!"
6/4/2018,3 star rating,"A fun, extremely crowded all-you-can-eat joint that has some really good Korean BBQ. Is it worth the hour wait, and impossible parking? Kinda. The service is good, although you'll cook the meat yourself as they have a little trouble hitting all of the tables. Same goes with liquids. Kind of short on trips for that too. They bring out as much as you want, but don't over-order, or they'll hit you with a charge. Meat quality was good, not amazing. Gas fired trays are not my fave, as I like the wood fired. Not awful. Not amazing. Loses a star overall, and a star for the hassle of getting in and out. After waiting ten minutes at the valet we were told that they didn't want to park our larger car, so we wandered for blocks looking for a space."
6/30/2016,4 star rating,Haven't and back here since 2014. Only because this place is busy all the time even on off hours. Great place for non-Koreans as their whole menu is on English making it convenient for many. One thing that did change is their prices! From $17.99 to now $23.99!! However they did add more meat selections. Love the Stone Grill! The meat tastes much different and tastier in my humble opinion. Their side dishes are all flavorful. Love how they give the rice paper/radish slices + kimchi/Bean sprout plate. They have all the dipping sauces already laid out so its very convenient. Meat quality was very good.Orderednot marinated short rib *** V Recommend Marinated short ribBrisket ChadolBeef tongue Pork belly *** perfect to eat with bean sprouts/kimchiBulgogi Spicy pork ** but everyone can agree we come for the Kim Jong fried rice. It was full of flavor and perfect to end the night.
12/4/2016,5 star rating,"Excellent KBBQ restaurant! The servers were very attentive and focused. Atmosphere is relaxed and calming. Parking is available in the lot, I believe it's only valet but super cheap at $2.00. The food was amazing, (your typical kbbq place), but much better than most! Definitely on the cheaper end for kbbq pricing. A spot I will 100% be returning to!"
7/3/2016,5 star rating,"Sometimes I end up waiting in line for a restaurant and it disappoints. Sometimes I Â wait in line for a restaurant and IT HITS THE SPOT.This was the first AYCE Korean bbq spot I've tried in LA and I really don't think I need to try anywhere else. The meat selection was expansive from the standard bulgogi and pork belly to tripe and octopus. All the meat was delicious but make sure you try to beef tongue. My absolute favorite. Also, there so many additional things with the AYCE including steamed egg, kim chee rice at the end, side dishes, and salads. What was even better than the meal was possibly the service. AYCE Korean bbq places and be slow in bring you your next grill selection, but the service was attentive and prompt, and just overall nice.We waited in line about 30 minutes on a Wednesday night for a table of 2, but I'd do it all over again. All other AYCE Korean bbq joints, bow down."
7/12/2018,3 star rating,"Though they boat 27 meats/items to order, I only ended up ordering a few of them. The wait was super long, which I expected.We ordered a ton of the beef tongue, beef short rib, and thick cut pork belly. While I loved the beef short rib and pork belly, the tongue was a bit off to me. After a few pieces, I began to taste some chalkiness or grittiness that I've never experienced before with beef tongue. Odd. I did not enjoy the smaller octopus either. When cooked, it wasn't crunchy and didn't have a bite to it. Pretty soft and bleh.I liked watching our server clean our grill with the daikon, that was pretty cool to see. Here, they like to serve your meat and grill for you, but I honestly like to serve myself lol. It felt awkward just watching; also if I was already flipping meats or cutting up meats on the grill, they'd come by to take over and it was just weird overall. I know some KBBQ places are like that, it's just my personal preference. Overall, my impression is just meh. There are tons of KBBQ places in the LA area, and I'm gonna try another place next time I'm around."
1/20/2019,5 star rating,"Honestly, one of the best Kbbq of all time! Of-all-time!!!The beef tounge and beef belly are amazing here. I usually avoid brisket because of poor quality at other places, however brisket here is sooo melty. Great quality meat, good-ish service. Be prepared to wait though, specially on the weekend"
7/27/2016,5 star rating,"Another AYCE KBBQ place in socal off my list! I went with two other guy friends during the middle of the day on a Friday where it was blazing hot but we were still craving some good korean bbq. It wasn't crowded here and we got seated right away. Their banchan consisted of a little side of mashed potatoes, salad, kimchee, sprouts, fish cake, rice paper, and some greens!For lunch their AYCE price is 21.99 with a good selection and have all the staples you need. We got lots of their brisket, bulgogi, steamed egg, pork belly, and the spicy pork. Service is great here as the workers are always giving carafes of water and helping us cook our food when the raw meat comes out. This is also one place that uses a stone bowl to cook the food in which I've never seen before! As the bowl gets burnt oil on it, they come around and use onions to clean it up.I definitely think this is one of the best places I've been to for KBBQ because of their service and how friendly the workers are. Parking can be pretty easy as they have plaza parking but there may be a chance you would have to find street parking instead."
5/9/2019,5 star rating,"Arrived at 5pm, sat at 6pm on a friday. (1hr wait)Very good quality food, and staff was friendly. They did all the work for you and recommended some good types of meat.

7/12/2014,5 star rating,I think I like this better than road to Seoul ! Dinner is 18.99 and it comes with 19 options and a bunch of other side dishes including a really good kimchi pancake !  Me and my boyfriend came here at 535 and waited only 20 minutes on a Saturday night which is not bad at all. The restaurant is very nice and has a homey feel with wooden benches and tables. It wasn't overwhelmed with smoke nor was it very dark like a night club (yeah I'm talking about you moodaepoo lol) The key thing is that they use a stone grill which brings out the flavor of the meat and is healthier. The table they gave us for 2 people was very large and generous so we weren't cramped ! And we got the best seat which is right in front of the serving counter. All the ahjummas were so friendly and they were not at all intimidating. They also cook for you here which is WOW because I've never had that at any all you can eat place ! The brisket was really good and I enjoyed everything. One of the best kbbq spots ! Nice to add this to my list (: BTW the kimchi is a Lil extra spicy and sour here (: but they refill everything super fast even without us noticing. Five stars !!Ps this is in a busy plaza in a busy part of the street so come early to find parking !

I'm half Korean, and very picky about my Korean food!!! Everything was flavorful to include the ban chan!! If the kimchi taste good, the food is good!! I wish this was in my state!!"
8/7/2019,5 star rating,"Came in for lunch on a Tuesday and was seated right away. One of my favorite Korean bbq spots to go to! The meat is always so fresh. The side dishes, kimchi fried rice, and steamed egg are bomb! The staff are always friendly and will help cook your meet for you too. There's a valet outside for $2 which isn't so bad considering parking in the area is pretty tough. Highly recommend this spot!"

11/19/2017,4 star rating,"This place was AMAZING!! Background story.. My brother and I went here last minute. We were going to go to This food fest in Hollywood, but the parking sucked. I quickly found this place on yelp. We endup going with probably a 30 min wait. I started w the usual; brisket. Then my brother picked spicy beef bbq and then i ordered the short rib. Everything turned out delicious! I came home and went to sleep like a baby. I woke up from 4-6 am, on and off puking and pooping (TMI) my lungs out. Overall, it was so tasty, but it felt like i was about to die in the middle of the night. The food was amazing, that it was kinda worth it!"

5/20/2018,5 star rating,"Whenever I'm in LA, this is my go to KBBQ place! The restaurant itself isn't very big compared to some other KBBQ spots like Gen KBBQ so the wait can be long--I've waited as long as 1.5 to 2 hours before. Hae Jang Chon is located in a plaza and parking in the lot is done via valet service (I live in the Bay Area and this is still a pretty strange concept to me). I've been able to find street parking only on a few very rare occasions. They have high quality meats, very cool stone grills, and superb customer service! The waiters/waitresses are always extremely attentive and will even help you cook/turn/cut your meats to perfection which is something I never expect but always appreciate! My favorites are the beef tongue, brisket, short ribs, and bulgogi. They also throw in a steamed egg in a stone bowl (love this!) and kimchi pancakes if you ask for it. Plus, if you have room for it at the end of the meal, they'll make you some kimchi fried rice on the grill! With KBBQ, it's easy for your eyes to be bigger than your stomach--keep in mind the fact that you can actually order half portions of meats to avoid having leftovers and being charged a fee. We all want to avoid waste so half portions are a great way to do it! Dinner is $26.00 per person which is well worth it for the quality of the meat they provide."
10/16/2019,2 star rating,"The BBQ marinated food were too salty. no veggies, only three sea food. Don't go there unless you are a meat lover"
11/22/2018,4 star rating,"They have so much variety here i love it!! We ate so much!! The bulgogi is so yummy!! We have, squid, shrimp, 2 rounds of bulgogi, pork belly, tripe, spicy bulgogi, steamed eggs, and miso soup! The side dish is so good, especially the kimchi!! Its to die for! I didn't really care for the miso soup though, its not that great!! They offered steamed rice or kimchi fried rice at the end so we chose kimchi FR. I've had better kimchi fried rice somewhere else, so if u like steam rice then go with it because ur not missing out much. Before i've tasted the kimchi FR, i really wanted to buy it to go but they had told me no. I just don't get it, why couldn't i buy it? I felt like the waiter didn't understand what i was trying to ask him. It's a good korean BBQ place though, so i would recommend it."
4/22/2020,5 star rating,"BEST KOREAN BBQ EVER!!!!! End of story! The service there is the best because the employees cook the food for you because not everyone can bbq their food, so I thought that was really nice of the employees to do for my family and friends. The meat there is FDA approved and it's high quality. I think the beef tongue is the best beef there because the meat is chewy, and it can be cook all the way or half-cooked. I want to recommend adding rice paper or radish paper with fish cake on the beef tongue because it would make your mouth melt."
4/29/2018,4 star rating,"My friends and I went there for early dinner at 4pm with reservations made a week ago. On Saturday 4pm in April wait wasn't too long and valet the car $2 in front. The party has to be present before getting seated. The place was busy at 4pm with all tables filled up. Once we were seated. All can eat $25 something and choice 3meats. I quickly ordered Hite beer and soju and it was delicious. We ordered short ribs, brisket, Bulgogi, pork belly, spicy pork came and it was sizzling and it wasn't too Smokey. The banchan items-bean sprouts, fish cakes, spinach, kimchi, potato apple salad, sauces. The server was friendly and cooked our food for us and we would flip the meats once while. At Times, it was hard to get refills on water or banchan items. At the end, the server made kimchi fried rice and it was delicious and crispy if left on cast iron pan. By the time we left, the place was super crowded waiting to get in. FYI, Best to eat early. Best to ask for leaves and salad for extra $5."
5/20/2014,5 star rating,"I took a friend visiting from London to get KBBQ for her first time. Since she's only going to get it once, I decided to take her to the best of the best. We got to the restaurant around 5 PM on a Friday and did the $2 valet. We got seated right away but I did notice the restaurant became much busier as it got later into the night. When we left, around 6:30, there seemed to be a lot of people waiting in front of the restaurant for a table. So definitely, go before 6 PM if you don't want to wait for a table.The side dishes were delicious! My favorite was the green veggies, I think it might have been green collards or some type of Chinese broccoli.Since there were only 2 of us, there were more meat per serving so we only got to try the bulgogi, shrimp, squid, octopus, and marinated beef short ribs. OMG the beef short ribs were delicious and veryy juicy and tender!! My second fave is shrimp. I love seafood so have shrimp at AYCE BBQ is a big plus for me. The shrimps are huge sized, too! My third fave would be the bulgogi, perfectly marinated!Each time we order another plate of meat, the worker would clean our stone grill so the meat doesn't get charred.At the end, we were full but we still wanted to try the kimchi fried rice and see it cooked in front of us. I did try the pancake, bean paste soup, and the steamed eggs and they were all delicious, too.No complaints about this place!"
4/20/2020,3 star rating,Decent but definitely not worth the hype. A very decent restaurant. I would never recommend unless you were in that parking lot shopping center and the other places were closed.
11/3/2020,1 star rating,I wish I didn't have to give them one star even to review. This place is all u can eat but we couldn't last 30 mins. Food arrived after 18-20 mins on top of that they were rushing us to finish eating and in our 2nd round a lady came to us and said this is our final round. we can order for the last time. I was so shocked with their service and behavior. Not only their greedy service was bad the lady who was service us was horrible. If they knew they cannot serve us more than 30 minutes because they have to close then why did they take us? They could tell that sorry we cannot serve u more than 30 minutes. This restaurant is the worst bbq place I have ever been. I never been to any restaurant where I have to finish food in 10-12 mins.
4/3/2018,5 star rating,"Coming from Hawaii, it's very difficult to find AYCE for a decent price while expecting to be served quality meat. I am beyond glad to have come across this gem of a restaurant when searching for KBBQ on yelp. Hae Jang Chon provide quality meat, side dishes and service for the value of $26.99. It might seem a little pricey but I definitely think it is worth it. The only downside is the WAIT. We waited about an hour and a half for a table and I think this seems to be the norm since there were so many other parties willing to wait as well. They provided many different options for meat and allow you to order 3 plates of meat at a time. I highly recommend their beef tongue! They also offer a variety of side dishes including steamed egg, kimchee fried rice, rice paper wraps, radish wraps, etc. I'm a huge fan of having a variety of side dishes when eating kbbq so this definitely topped off my rating! Service and ambience: A very casual setting (wear junk clothes that you don't mind having the kbbq smell on). The service is spot on where the waiters come every several minutes to cook your meat for you and to refill your water or side dishes (I think this was mainly to keep the flow of customers going since the wait is so long). Parking: There are some street parking but if you want to park in the lot in front of the restaurant, it is valet only."
1/16/2017,4 star rating,"$23.99, 27 item all you can eat!Lunch price is $21.99 but not on weekends or holidays.This is my first time trying this place and the inside is spacious, airy, and not too smelly.Service was on point and the food was very very good - especially at this price point.Not the #1 best KBBQ ever, but for the price, it could easily become your regular spot.Valet is $2."
7/2/2016,4 star rating,"The wait is absolutely horrendous...but if you can get past that this place is great. For our party we waited two hours and 45 minutes. I was getting pretty hAngry near the end but glad we stuck it out. The food is really really good.Their meats are very high quality and not cheap ""leftover"" cuts you find at other KBBQ places in KTown. Their waiters are really quick and very very nice. They bring out the meat really quickly and if they see you reaching for the meat to flip they'll come and help you out. They won't stand there and cook for you but they do their best to assist when they see that you're in need. I love how their really good at taking orders as well. A lot of KBBQ places will be like yeah yeah this meat okay sure i'll be right back and then come back 10 minutes later. At Hae Jang Chon they'll actually be back right away with your meat. They also had really great sides that were unlimited like the steamed eggs, miso soup and the Korean mixed soup. I know lots of places will limit you to the amount of steamed eggs you can get. I highly suggest ordering the tongue and pork belly. Both of those are solid choices and of course beef brisket."
4/14/2017,5 star rating,"This is our first time visiting! We had AYCE BBQ. Everything is perfect here! We have enough choices of meat and the meat is fresh and flavorful. Recommend marinated short rib and octpus.We were pretty full after 3-round order and we did not have the fried rice, which looks sooooooo tasty!Our waiter could speak English, Korean and Chinese! He is really nice and thoughtful!Will come back again!"
2/12/2017,5 star rating,"This is definitely one of my favorite all you can eat KBBQ restaurants! It's AYCE for $25 dinner... seriously, how can you beat this price and taste? They cook all the meat for you and there are so many varieties of unlimited side dishes. I personally always get galbi and bulgogi because they're the best meats. (Tip: always get galbi).Unfortunately the wait for this place was insane. We waited almost 2 hours! Avoid coming here from 6-10PM... no matter what day of the week it is. The wait is just insane."
2/19/2020,5 star rating,Amazing service! Quick to come over and ask if you need anything. They're very attentive. Definitely somewhere I would come back to. The selection is good too. Unfortunately not many spicy options but still a good selection nonetheless
12/25/2018,5 star rating,This is an authentic Korean bbq. Make sure you make reservations and they won't seat you unless everyone is present. There is also valet parking. The meat quality is pretty good. The favorite was the brisket and the bugogi. The kimchi was my absolute favorite. The food was excellent and the service was great. Our party
8/8/2020,3 star rating,"i second the review Vince wrote, I guess he went the same night. we went last night as well and no surprise but they definitely gave the Koreans that could speak their language preferential treatment. we were waiting to be helped and a Korean lady (customer) straight up walked past us, cut in line and got her and her party seated before us. normally id say something but I didn't have the energy. Other than that food was fine. except for the hair my boyfriend found in one of the side dishes. service was fine. i feel bad for restaurants during this time so don't want to knock them too hard but the whole language barrier situation did suck. they're also doing set combos instead of ayce and there didn't seem to be that much meat. expensive for what we got. We'll be trying other spots next time."
8/5/2018,5 star rating,"This is probably my favorite Korean bbq. There always a line so I'd recommend going, putting your name down, then heading next door for a beer two spots east. Be sure your checking to make sure ya don't lose your spot on the list at Hae Jong Chon.Get all the meat you can handle. It is all you can eat, so if you don't, I'll be very disappointed in you and so will your wallet. The bulgogi is the best best best. That's three bests, so you know i mean business. All of the meats are good but depending on the day and which cut ya get, the meat can be kinda tough in texture. But the bulgogi is always fire!! Seafood is good too. I'm keen on the kimchi pancake. The kimchi friend rice isn't as good as I had hoped. Idk, you should probably order it anyway since it's all you can eat.Enjoy!"
8/21/2018,5 star rating,"This is hands down me and my husband's favorite KBBQ restaurant (we just wish we didn't live so far!) We've been here twice and both times it was delicious. Sure, the wait is insanely long, but it is worth it. Their menu is extensive and has a wide variety. The servers are quick and make sure that you aren't sitting around waiting for your food. Yes, they help you cook your food, but they know what they are doing. You can totally cook it yourself, but why not let the pros get in there and help? I read on here that someone didn't like that they just jumped in and cooked it without saying excuse me. I'm sorry, but that's a ridiculous complaint. This restaurant is so busy because so many people want to eat there. Therefore, the servers are doing their best to make sure your food is there fast, that it's cooked right, and that you aren't waiting around for them. The last time we were there, our server killed it. Our sides were constantly refilled, he noticed what we liked and made sure it didn't run out, and he even gave us a half order of one of the meats because we wanted just a tiny bit more but not an entire order (they charge for leftover meat). TIP: If you are thinking of going here, go EARLY. Otherwise you can wait over 2 hours. And yes, it's THAT good."
11/10/2018,5 star rating,"This is the popular spot because of their stone cooktop. Â  Good food overall, but specially love their special rice at the end of the meal. Â  Great friendly staff."
2/17/2016,4 star rating,"#21/100Definitely one aspect of LA I do not miss, Â the congestion everywhere. Â  It's soooooooooo crowded! Â The tiny parking lot sucks. Â Even though there is valet available, Â your car is pretty much double parked. Â So good luck finding street parking on a super busy day. It's also a small space. Â Perhaps it's because they have the tables and chairs pretty much near each other. Â  Service was ok. Â Wait time was twenty minutes for a party of four. Â The meat selection was good and fresh. Â Great selection of banchans as well. Â And whats different from this kbbq place to other kbbq places is they use hot stone stove top not your regular grill. Â I thought that was pretty cool.So after smelling like kbbq yourself, your server does Â this awesome show at the end. Â He makes kimchi fried rice on your stone stove top. Â It's super flavorful and friggin spicy HOT! So proceed with caution. Â But indeed very delicious!"
8/29/2018,5 star rating,"Please don't come here, the wait for a table is already long enough! In reality, HJC is the BEST KBBQ in town. The meats are tender and the kimchi is aplenty. Be prepared to wait for a table, we've waited 2 hours!, but it's worth the wait... and more. Get the bulgogi, you can thank me later."
5/4/2018,4 star rating,"If you can come around lunch instead of dinner, please do lunch because there's usually no line at lunch. If you like bbq and can eat a lot, please come as well! Although if you are like us who doesn't eat that much, it's not the best deal because they only have AYCE for bbq. Lunch is $24. They have the small dishes and all the sauce, and the server constantly walk around and cook for you. They have I think 15+ items to choose from, from meat to veggie to rice, all included in the all you can eat package. I'm personally a fan of tripes but theirs is meh. However the beef tongue and short ribs are a must! At the end of your meat meal you can order kitchen fried rice stirred in all the meat juice/oil. Yum!Again if you eat plenty, this is the spot for you. I only wish we could order plate by plate instead of all you can eat. Be aware that there's a charge of $15.99 if you don't finish the meat you ordered. And no take outs for bbq."
6/3/2016,4 star rating,"4/5 stars for the food. 3/5 stars on the service. This place is your traditional Korean BBQ. The meat slices are great in quality and a decent amount each time they bring the plate. They also offer you fried rice at the end because they cook it on the grill you used to cook your meat. FYI, they also cook for you. You may end up putting the meat on the grill, but the servers come and start cooking. The reason why I gave 3 stars for service was because one of the waiters spilt on my friend. At first, the waiter was a bit clumsy with the food he brought in, but then when he picked up the plates, he dropped the plate with a lot of chili oil on my friend. The dinner price was about $24.99 I believe. His shorts were roughly $60. Yes, they can be washed, but have you ever tried to wash off chili oil? There's usually the oil ring stain that stays there. The other waitresses were great though. They assisted us as much as they could. The waiter who spilt (male, bald) also barely acknowledged he spilt. He just said, ""I don't know what's wrong with me today"" implying on his clumsiness but didn't fully say sorry to my friend. I would definitely like to come back for the food, but hopefully the waiter doesn't have any butterfingers again lol."
2/15/2016,5 star rating,"My favorite kbbq spot of all time! All time! Sometimes I'm not even in the mood for Korean bbq, just use it as an excuse to check out all the Korean guys that mob up to this place. Like: hey kimchi cutie it's gonna be a long wait, why don't you sit on my lap, lemme talk to you for a min.You better be ready for AYCE. The sides are good & the servers just keeping bringing out the meat! They even come around every so often & move around/cut up the meat for you, bring you more sides without hesitation & quick when you ask for another round of beers. Why you treat me so good though? THIS... Everything I just explained doesn't happen at other spots. Other spots aren't so generous & quick with it. You'll be sitting at your table, hoping some one passes by so you can ask for more potato salad w/apple chunks in it, ringing the doorbell on the table like a witness on Saturday morning trying to hand you a Watch Tower zine...Your Homegirl,Violy"
2/16/2016,5 star rating,"For my carnivorous ways, my buddies brought me here after meeting for a study session. It's in K-town, and parking was not an issue. The place was pretty busy, but we were sat down quickly.We ordered an all-you-can-eat lunch for several of us. It came with a lot of meat dishes, of which the chicken was my favourite. The egg was pretty good too, as was the beef when wrapped in starch paper. Normally, I point out that places skimp out on the meat portions. Well, this place had the opposite going on. They had huge potions, enough for a party of 6 or more. At the end of the meal, one of the attendants made some kimchi-fried rice right there at our table. I tried a bit, but I had already eaten a good amount of white rice with my meal. To drink, we had green tea and some rice wine. It was an overall lovely experience. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some Korean BBQ. And bring some friends, because the portions are HUGE."
3/11/2018,5 star rating,"4.5 stars total for me because the wait was insane. We waited about 2.5hrs before we were seated so I don't recommend coming here at dinner time on a weekend.. When we finally made it in, everything was already set up at our table (salad, spicy fishcakes, potato salad, radish, rice paper, etc.) and the grill was already pretty hot. Service was quick and they always knew when we needed something somehow. They always noticed whenever we finished our meat and asked if we wanted more. Even when we made a comment about perhaps changing our grill, someone popped up right behind us and started cleaning. The meat is noticeably a higher grade than other ayce kbbq places. My favorites were the bulgogi and marinated short ribs. Definitely recommend if you prefer marinated and sweeter meats. The cow tongue was also pretty good. The portions here are also really big compared to other places. We finished about 3 rounds (of 3 meats each) between 4 people. They also cook kimchi fried rice for you at the end if you want!Overall, the food is good here and I can totally understand why its more pricey ($25.99 dinner) but I don't think I would wait 2+ hours to eat here again."

2/23/2016,4 star rating,"I had to try this place when I came down to LA. I literally looked up ""Best AYCE Kbbq Places in LA,"" and found this place to be number one on many of those lists. They close around 12, and come early, because the wait can get crazy. The parking lot is very tiny compared to all the activity that goes on there, and I think to park there, you have to valet your car for like $2. We had no problems with the valet.Our wait was about an hour and a half, and I was starving by the time it was our turn. We basically had a chance to try everything. There's a huge selection, the biggest selection I've ever seen at an AYCE kbbq. Regular hot dogs are part of it, LOL. I always enjoy the pork belly, bulgogi and beef tongues, but everything else is really good too. I love how they cook the meats for you so you don't have to worry about it. I also love how when you're done with the meats, they cook you kim chi fried rice as a part of your meal. It's definitely worth the visit. I'm salivating just thinking about it, hehe."
12/12/2014,4 star rating,"The place is clean and the decor is nice. Â The place can get extremely busy and this was a week night. Â The side dishes are tasty and really good. The Potato Salad is mixed with apples and is very tasty. The Bulgogi ( BBQ Beef) has a sweet flavor to it and it's delicious. The Canadian Fresh Thick Pork Belly is really good, and the the BBQ Pork is awesome. Â The Korean Paste Soup is flavorful and not too salty, but at that time I was full. You will have a good time here and you will not leave hungry.On a side note: Traffic in K-Town can be really congested. I highly recommend taking the Metro (The Purple Line stops two blocks away)."
1/16/2020,5 star rating,Love love this place so much!! During the weekends the wait time gets very long so prepare to wait a while. It's worth it in my case. Service is great as well as the staff.
5/23/2018,5 star rating,"We travelled to LA for a vacation and didn't really know where to korean bbq at. When we first googled for a place that is near by, this restaurant came up. It certainly did not disappoint with the service and the quality of the food. We did arrive around 7ish, so we had to wait in line for a good hour an a half. Even though the wait time was long, it was still well worth it. Our server Min was wonderful. He was very attentive and consistently asked if we needed to order anything else. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Even though the portions are small, it is all you can eat. Definitely would come back if I'm in the area again."
4/20/2018,5 star rating,"This is my favorite KBBQ place. Let me count the ways. 1. Stone grill. What? Yeah, if you're on keto, this is what you want. The fat stays on the stone and makes everything that much tastier. 2. Meat. Oh my gosh, all the meats are yummy and flavorful. They have everything you could possibly want to grill. 3. Banchan. They have a variety of yummy side dishes. Crunchy, sweet, hot, sour, salty, all the yummy. 4. Kimchi fried rice. Please don't forget this. All that fat that has been keeping the stone non stick will make some of the best kimchi fried rice you will ever have. 5. Steamed egg dish! It's like a palate cleanser. Kinda of. Lol! It's really good! So give this place a try. I'm sure you'll love it!"
3/9/2018,4 star rating,"First time trying ayce kbbq using a stone grill to cook the meats. Our party of 13 were able to make reservations prior (only available for parties of 6+), otherwise the wait can be over 2 hours long.Pros: - Meats don't burn on the stone grill.- Meats are good quality and good variety.- Solid banchan selection.- Beer and soju were pretty cheap.- Overall price was decent.Cons:- They will not seat you until your entire party is there. We had a friend who didn't get off work until 9pm so we had to sneak her in.- With reservations, we still had to wait around 30-45 minutes.- They use the grill to make fried rice at the end of your meal (which was tasty), but by the time we're finished with the meats, we were too full to enjoy it.In conclusion, I would not wait here without a reservation. There's plenty of other great kbbq joints in ktown. But if you're patient and have lots of time to kill, then this is above average."
3/22/2016,2 star rating,"Pretty rad spot. Â I gotta say, one thing my girl always looks out for is a clean restroom. Â SO she wanted me to make sure I let all ya'll womens know this place got some clean A** restrooms. Â OK now let's break it down:Service: Bad - our waiter was a bit presumptuous. Â Like sorry dude, we are a Caucasian and Latin person, not Korean, we don't know how it works. Â When we come to a place like this we would prefer some guidance or something, not talking to us like we are idiots. Â Made me think of Napolean Dynamite the whole time(Hypothetical Conversation)Us: ""Excuse me, sir. Â Does the fried rice come now or later?""Waiter: At the end of the FREAKIN MEAL...GOSH!Not to say a Korean Napolean Dynamite did not provide for an interesting experience. Â On top of it all though, the kid mostly forgot stuff we asked him for three or four times in a row, but whatever.Price point: The place is nice, but not $25/person nice. Â Good selection, but eh, really the benefit here over other All you Can eat KBBQ is that they include stuff like the steamed egg at no extra charge.Time: Dang, it takes forever and a day to get a table up in here. Â We waited an hour and a half. Â at like 10PM on a Sunday night!Food Quality: Nothing too out of the water here. Â Pretty good mixture of condiments, and variety of side dishes. Â I like the Bulgogi here, very flavorful. Â The beef tongue didn't seem like normal, and the octopus was awful, but there is a shining light in the Pork Belly. Â Also kinda weirded out that they don't de-shell the shrimp.All in all, this was our fourth choice on the list of KBBQ to try Sunday night, and we only stayed here cuz we already walked 2 miles in every direction, and said eff it.You could probably get a better meal at CottonHi next door - the organic soft-serve cotton candy joint."

8/7/2019,2 star rating,"For being the most sought out KBBQ place in KTown, with all the insanely high reviews it was actually the most underwhelming and disappointing experience yet. Â All KBBQ places in LA have been whatever, the ONLY plus here was that they actually gave you lettuce wraps, which should be standard but at least they had it, but it wasn't even free it was $5 and it barely was enough for 2 people. Â  Super mediocre meat, sides sub-par, hots stones, more like colds our meat was soggy after we ""cooked"" it. Stones couldn't even get hot enough to char the meat all of it pretty much turned grey. Â Probably wouldn't go back."

Something about cooking on a stone pan makes it more fun and delicious. Would recommend coming here with a group, however the wait can be long at times."
12/30/2015,4 star rating,"It has been such a long time since I've been here where I kind of forgot why I don't come here too often. It was Sunday night and my sister wanted to eat here. The parking lot was jam packed and I was directed to park in the other lot on the other side of the street. After returning from dropping off my car to that valet my sister tells me the wait is really long and maybe we should go somewhere else. It was too late. We were very tempted to just grab some Kyochon but we really wanted to eat here and didn't want to ruin our appetite for the AYCE by snacking on chicken wings. So we ended up waiting about 1.5-2 hours for our table out in the cold. The food was delicious! Or was I so hungry that anything tasted good? I guess there's a reason why it's so packed here; the meat was good and you get the kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal. There were a few sides; not too many though-salad, fish cake, potato salad, kimchi, etc. It felt like the workers were rushing us a bit or they were just very attentive; coming over to cook the meat for us every 10 minutes or so and asking us if we wanted more meat. I suppose it was a good thing. But next time if I'm hungry I may think twice about coming here due to the wait time."
8/9/2018,5 star rating,Holy shit balls!! I'm so full! I've never eaten at a place where you cook the food on a cast iron plate on the table before and it was worth every penny. You can eat as much food as you can handle and I ate enough for all the points for anyone who has ever been on weight watchers. Eat here or miss out!BTW I burped 2 hours afterwards and the taste was still amazing!
1/11/2020,1 star rating,"Came here to eat after been here lot of times, but it will be my last time after receiving bad service. my bf and I went there to eat few days ago, after 2nd round of meat, we still have extra meat to eat, but doesnt mean we wouldn't eat it. then, I ask the server to clean the grill, but seem like he thought we would order more meat after cleaning, so he asked us to finish the meat first. My bf told him we just want to clean the grill so we could cook our meat, but the server keep denied doing it, only if we could finish our meat first. Then, I told him we will, please clean it first, then he finally did it but look upset about it. this place is crowded, the price is ok to us, but the service is terrible. Like I mentioned above, we been here lot of times, but we never face anything like this."
1/10/2020,5 star rating,"This place is really delicious. We went around 7pm. There was a ton of people but they move very quickly. The food was great and they give you a lot of Korean ""tapas"" to start with. I would definitely go back."
3/16/2019,1 star rating,"This was my favorite spot for Korean BBQ. Great meat and so many options. But this last visit will unfortunately be my last. We had a party of 5 and were sat very early on a Friday when there was no wait. We had been planning this dinner for a week as we were then going to walk down the street to be at an early show. So when we were seated at 5:40pm, we knew we would be leaving in an hour. We were also sitting at a table for 6, and next to me was an empty chair. We had one more in our party I told to come our way thinking it would easy for him to join us.15 minutes after we were seated, he arrived. The hostess would not let him into the restaurant. I went to the front to tell her we had an actual empty seat next to us, and would obviously be paying for an additional head and we still had to leave by 6:45 regardless (at this time it was about 6pm), and she still refused. He left to go to the bar next door, and I asked to speak to the manager. The manager looked at me, looked at my table with clear space at, and then looked at the hostess, confused. The then briefed him on what she told me and when he asked her why not just seat our last guest she just said shook her head and said no. So the manager then told me that it's policy to not seat incomplete parties. I explained that we had one empty seat at our table anyway, we were a party of 5 who had a 6th join us 15 mins later not realizing it would be an issue to have him, and he said they can never seat late guests. I told him this couldn't be true as the previous time I had been at the restaurant a couple weeks back, I was next to a party of 3 who had been there a good hour before they had a 4th person join them. And that 4th guest was welcomed without any drama. The manager told me that didn't happen. Well, it did. I remember the conversation they had with their server distinctly. It did happen. And that's when I lost all respect. Have your policy, whatever. Don't call me a liar. I'm telling the truth.So after 15 minutes of this arguing, I go to get my purse from the table so I can leave and join our lone refused party member next door. I take my credit card out so my friends can use it to pay for me, even though I didn't end up eating anything (I was at the front desk the whole time). Then the waitress proceeds to spill an entire glass of water and a dish of sauces on me and my leather purse. It was a total accident, fine, but on her way to get a towel, she also asked the manager something - probably if she should compensate us at all for the spill - he glanced over and saw it was me, and shook his head no. Our whole party wanted to leave but at that point, food had hit the table, and we are not the dine and dash type, so we felt a little stuck. It was certainly unideal and unnecessary tension on what was supposed to be a really fun and celebratory Friday night out with a great group of friends. So I left. Went next door. No drama adding to a table there. My friends stayed until 6:45pm just like we had planned and I told the hostess and manager we would be doing.I'm so saddened by this unfortunate experience. I really really loved this place but just can't support a restaurant that not only refuses to be accommodating in such a simple situation, but then becomes flat out rude, calls us liars when in fact we absolutely did see them seat someone late to a table just a couple weeks ago, and then vengefully ignores addressing their waitress's spill. I don't care how good your food is - you don't treat customers this way."

The service was really good they were super on it!i was excited for the kimchi fried rice at the end they make it for u at ur table but they put alot of seaweed in it and it over powered everything else.

1/18/2017,5 star rating,"My friends and I wanted all you can eat KBBQ in LA's Koreatown because we've heard so many good things about it. We came across Hae Jang Chon on Yelp and decided to go here for dinner. At $23.99 per person for all you can eat KBBQ, we thought it was reasonable and came here. There's valet parking on the premises but since we took an Uber, we walked straight to the restaurant and added our name to the waiting list. Although we were a group of 3, it took about an hour and half for us to get seated but this wait was well worth it.When we were finally seated, we wasted no time in ordering and immediately ordered 3 servings of the marinated short rib and they were absolutely DELICIOUS. To get our money's worth, we mainly stuck to ordering the short rib but also got some orders of the brisket, pork shoulder, and pork belly. Everything was amazing and I'm actually salivating as I write this review. Service was excellent and every time a server came to cook the meat, he/she would always ask if we needed more water, sides, etc. One server actually complimented me on my Korean, which I think is very subpar LOL. In any case, we were satisfied by the end of the meal and was probably the best KBBQ I've had in a while. Like some previous reviews have stated, the only downside of the place is the size of the place and the wait time. However, it's not fair to blame the business for the size of the place and to take away a star for that sole reason. All in all, definitely check out Hae Jang Chon if you're in the mood for AYCE KBBQ and you'll be blown away not only by the quality of their meat but also by their superb service. I hope to be back, even though I live on the other side of the US."
11/29/2019,5 star rating,Excellent food and decent service. Â This may be the best AYCE Korean bbq place I have so far. The service is decentWill come back.....but the line is long :(
12/27/2015,4 star rating,"Best service at an all you can eat Korean barbecue place ever. They also have the most awesome grill I have ever seen. It is a stone grill with a hole on one side for excess juices and garbage. Â The neatest thing is that the workers continually come by to clean your grill with radishes. This keeps your meat from getting charred and just feels much more clean and healthier than other places.My favorite was the potato salad with apples as far as the free dishes go. As for the 19.99 all-you-can-eat price, the bulgogi and the galbi were the best. Â  I'm always a fan of steamed egg and I was a bit surprised that they offered mushrooms as well. A very nice touch is that there is a blowup version of the menu in the middle of the restaurant so that you do not have to keep referring to a menu. Â Lastly, they make kimchi fried rice when you're finished with your meal. However, keep in mind that you are getting charged for any meat leftover.Parking options are limited and the lot turns into valet only after 12. Â A trick is arriving before then since they open at 11."
12/23/2019,1 star rating,"I'm from Orange County and heard great things about this restaurant but their customer service sucks. I made a reservation for a party of 6 for my 30th birthday.  Two from my party canceled last minute as we got there (I was bummed that they told me as soon as I got to the restaurant). The lady was ready to seat us until I told her the other two cancelled. Then they told us we lost our reservation and have to wait 2 hours. It was raining, it was my 30th, friends cancelled, we had plans to meet up with more people after dinner (time constraint), BUT they couldn't accommodate. It was the worst customer service ever. We even offered to pay for 2 additional people to bill, but it was a No. We ended up going to another kbbq place 5 minutes away that had better service, busy but not as cluttered, with good meat."

2/21/2018,4 star rating,"I came on a Saturday around 12:45 pm with a group of friends. There wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant yet, so we only waited around 5 minutes. My group came in 2 parts, and the first group had to wait for the rest of us because they only allow us to sit if everyone comes, which is reasonable.Our orders came really quickly; we ordered brisket, short ribs, and chicken for the first order. The staff helped us place the meats on our grill, and they always stopped by to help us cook our food. They even brought kimchi pancakes, which were a bit soggy but still really tasty. The meats didn't look frozen, and cooked pretty quickly. All of the meats were really tasty, and we kept ordering the brisket. You can reorder the steamed eggs and kimchi pancakes, which we did. The staff cleaned our grills about 2 or 3 times the time we were there with the sliced radishes; that was super cool to watch them scrape off the burnt parts. The price came out to be about $30 per person after tax and tip; I think its pretty good price for the food you get, but honestly, as a cheap, broke college student, I wouldn't come back until I start making $$. For people who don't have $30 to spend on KBBQ but still want something decent, there are cheaper, but slightly-lower quality places I would go to instead."
11/26/2019,4 star rating,"My first experience with KBBQ was very good. We tried thin sliced pork belly, thick pork belly, bulgogi, shrimp, octopus, squid, and short ribs. We enjoyed the sides, a steamed egg, a kimchi pancake, and mushrooms. At the end, we had kimchi fried rice with cheese. There was plenty for my family of 4. Â The waiter cooked almost all of our food. We really enjoyed it. We did wait for an hour on a Tuesday night, but all agree that it was worth the wait. My sons think I should give a 5 star review, but I rarely give 5 stars, if ever."
10/17/2015,5 star rating,"Probably the best quality meat you can get at an ayce kbbq. Â The brisket here is so much better than any other place I've had. Â Came with a party of 3 a little past midnight on a Monday night so we didn't have any problems getting parking and seats. Â They have a couple of items you don't see at other places. Â Personally I like honeycomb but it lacked flavor. Â Service is good, we didn't have to wait too long for meat refills and they occasionally help you cook.$22 per person for good quality meat and they're open until 2am everyday."
3/6/2016,5 star rating,"So we just had this place wasn't sure what to expect saw it on yelp and decided to drive from the San Fernando Valley all the way to Korea town to try this place. We get there it is packed, a lot of people there, we were told it was gonna take approximately 30 to 40 minutes to be seated there were only two of us. To our surprise it only took about 20 minutes which was absolutely great to get seated it's an all-you-can-eat location so come hungry, Â let me tell you...... The waiters and waitresses are on point never once were we sitting down and not being asked if we were OK or if we needed more meat or any of their condiments. The meet was perfect delicious some items are marinated others aren't so ask your waiter or waitress is for suggestions their sauces complement all of their meats each one has its own specialty for each meet. I would highly recommend this place be prepared to wait if you have a large party makes reservations which they only make for parties of six or more people the tables really only hold about six people so if you have a party larger than that be prepared to be seated in separate tables.Like I said the service is excellent there on point, they're always on top of everything making sure you're not missing meets they only serve one type of beer which is a Korean beer sort of like a light beer, but very delicious. I would suggest go hungry as there is unbelievable amounts of meats some seafood you can order for the same price if you're ever in that area, going to enjoy it it was absolutely delicious you will never regret it and I guarantee you it won't be the last time you attend this place."
8/23/2016,3 star rating,"So apparently this place is quite popular... Â I was slightly disappointed that despite having a reservation, we still had to wait 30-40 minutes. Â I thought the meat was just average. Â HOWEVER, their thin sliced pork belly was outstanding. Â I could just eat that the entire night with some soju and I would be quite content.The service was solid. Â The waiter that served us tolerated our rowdy behavior... an excellent specimen of human patience. Â Despite all this, I think this place is worth coming back to. Â It wouldn't be my first pick, but it's definitely not a bad second pick."
8/21/2016,4 star rating,"I'd recommend making a reservation for this place on weekends as it's not very large for a kbbq restaurant. But here's the catch: They only let parties of 6 or more make reservations. Even with a reservation, expect to wait ~10-20 mins. Without one, I'd say the wait could be up to 2 hours.Dinner is $23.99 for AYCE. Service is quick here and the servers usually help you put your meet in the grill. Their beef tongue, brisket, Bulgogi, squid, BBQ chicken, short ribs (boneless!) were all good. Their very quick to refill any sauces, side dishes, etc."
12/19/2019,5 star rating,"Great spot. Excellent quality meats, sauces, and service. There is always a huge line for this pace so make reservations in advance. The staff take care if you throughout your meal and are more than willing to keep bringing out dish after dish til you're stuffed. Menu isn't incredibly extensive, but what they do, they do well."

8/15/2018,5 star rating,"I can't say I've been to every AYCE Korean BBQ in LA, but I also didn't keep dating other women after meeting my wife. The selection and price can't be beat and it's always worth the wait, but they're open until 2am so you can try between dinner and last call for faster service. The meats meets all expectations and there's plenty of variety for non-meat eaters like the Kimchi Pancake I always order at least a few times. The variety of side dishes are life saving when you've been waiting outside and are even better combined with the entrees. You'll always ask for refills. My favorite sauce is the dark brown with bits of tofu added. Ask for a larger bowl of it and dip everything in it. You'll thank me later with a thumbs up. They could use some additional staff to help send out the food and flip tables, but they do a great job and you'll be completely satisfied so thank them accordingly and I recommend you order a tall Hite beer and soju!"
9/4/2017,2 star rating,"this place is not worth the wait. we've tried multiple times to come here but there's always a long wait. today my sisters and cousins wanted to go and put in their name before we arrived so we didn't have to wait long, yay!anyhow, i'm not really sure what all the fuss is about. for 25.99$ the meats were fine, the sides were fine and the service was fine. some complaints: - they didn't have the meat that i normally eat (prime sirloin) so i wasn't impressed- the potato salad had huge chunks of apples and carrots which was weird- the steamed egg was watery and miso soup was super salty- the grill is a huge thick slab of cast iron and it took super long to cook the meat"
3/28/2016,3 star rating,"Got to Hae Jang Chon just before lunch time, so we beat the crowd. Started off with some brisket, bulgogi and spicy pork. Pretty much the three mains if you want to determine a good Korean BBQ place.I liked the brisket, but the bulgogi was chopped a bit too fine. It made it hard to pick up. The same goes for the spicy pork. We also has some pork shoulder, which had a nice fat consistency to meat ratio.But on the whole the choice of meats could be a little bit bigger. Honestly, could I get a bigger cup for water?And I wasn't so sure about the waiters helping me cook the meats for me. Not sure why but it made me a little uneasy. I've never been to another Korean BBQ place that did that. The potato salad was nice for a change, it has apples cut up into it, and the spicy fish cake added a good flavor to the meat with the radish."
5/16/2018,3 star rating,"Wait.... Wait.... Wait.... ok Rush! Eat! You want more?! Here let me cook this for you eat faster!!! You done?! Want more?! Here let's put this on the grill!!! Ok you're done?! That's pretty much my experience at Hae Jang Chong... It's good. Not stand out good. It's $25 all you can eat good. I'd love to give this place 5 stars but we had to wait 1.5hrs to eat there only for them to literally cook our food for us on our grill and rush us out in maybe 25-30min. It felt like competitive eating. The waiter wouldn't leave our table. Â Its probably better to go with a large group of people i don't think they'll rush you quite as much but it's literally a Chinese.... i mean Korean fire drill in there ;) I'm sure there are better places that let you enjoy your food and take your time but the meat here is actually pretty good. I'd go back if i don't have to wait so long to get a table. Then i wouldn't mind the frenzy of panicking Korean dudes scurrying about the place shoving food down people's throats then asking if ""its good right?"""
1/4/2018,5 star rating,"Read all the other posts for the dishes. All I gotta say is that I used to live nearby and this place NEVER disappoints. Kyochon is nearby as well! Good quality ingredients with great service, DONT BE LATE TO YOUR RESSY, these guys don't play games, if you miss your reservation because your ass can't be the punctual person like you should be, don't go crying, whine and throw a fit. You'll look stupid bit. I'm still full from it 2 days later! Great tasting marinates for their meats!"
10/27/2019,5 star rating,Left with a happy and full stomach. It was so good! I was impatient wanting to eat the food since it smelt so good. But they kept telling us to wait since it wasn't ready to eat - which for my sake that was a lot safer. All the meat was delicious and I'm so happy we picked this restaurant. Also the Korean pancake was delicious! Parking- valet $2-3 (depending on time of day).
7/11/2013,3 star rating,"This was probably not one of the best experiences for me for AYCE Korean barbecue. Â You tend to expect quality would be lower at an AYCE but and at this place, it was noticeably average for sure. Â That being said, I did enjoy the pork belly however.Banchan was decent not having as great a variety as other places. Â The service was almost slow to non-existent as we had to ask several times for things such as more water and more banchan.With so many better choices in K-town and southern California in general for Korean barbecue, this will most likely be my first and last time to eat here."
9/27/2018,5 star rating,"All the customers were Koreans so I guess this was considered quite authentic cause they catered towards Koreans. I could be wrong, don't quote me ;) Food was alright, exactly what you expect from a all you can eat."
4/9/2016,4 star rating,"When I heard we were coming to this place I was definitely very skeptical. $22 kbbq in Korea Town where the average price is $12 better have some great quality food. Well their food was definitely good and the service was pretty legit. They DO NOT let you cook on your own because they do not want you to burn all your food. The servers cook your food for you and they provide you with quality options (32 to be exact). The place is small so there's definitely a long wait. Don't get the hot dogs, they are literally just hot dogs. Kimchi fried rice comes at the end when you'e done eating, which is weird cause I wouldn't want to eat rice after im stuffed with meat. If you get kimchi fried rice, you can't have white rice so make your choice wisely. Overall a pleasant experience."
8/19/2019,5 star rating,"One of the best ayce kbbq experiences for me coming from bay area. The service is excellent, they cook for you! That was a pleasant surprise and something i was not used to. The quality of meat is delicious and high quality. My favorites are the brisket, galbi short ribs, USDA prime steak, bulgogi, and thin sliced pork belly from here. The price is reasonable and the hours are late until 2am. The establishment is very clean. The staff are very friendly, organized, and timely with their service. Overall the place deserves the high rating and referral. Will definitely come back again."
6/16/2016,4 star rating,"Ended up waiting 40 mins even though I had a reservation and we were all present on time. Â HUGE bummer. The guy could have seated us earlier but we would have had to sit on two different tables that were farther apart. Â Granted the ones that we did end up sitting at weren't connected, at least we were in the corner area and closer to each other. The set up for the grills is amazing and I'm surprised why more people don't do it this way. Â They have a hot stone that is positioned on an incline so that the liquid fatty stuff drains into a small hole in the stone and into this little metal tray that catches everything. Also the waitress came by once just to clean the top by scraping off the burnt particles and debris (as opposed to other places where they replace the grill); this was surprisingly entertaining to watch.Top three AYCE menu items:1. short rib. Holy crap is this stuff addicting. Â It is the perfect thickness and the waitress cuts it up into pieces that you can eat instead of looking like a barbarian trying to rip off huge chunks of meat with your teeth. 2. kimchi pancakes. Â Awesome flavor with yummy onions and greens inside. Â The best savory pancake I've had. Also you can put them on the stone for a bit so that it gets warm and cooks a bit more so that it has a crunchier/toasty texture.3. thin sliced pork belly. yes I said pork belly.The service here is amazing. They are always attentive by making sure you have all the food you want and with tending to the grill. Â Most importantly, even though the line outside was crazy long, we didn't feel rushed to leave. Â Also they gave my friend a little brownie/cake dessert with a candle for his birthday and played some lively themed (maybe Korean?) birthday music."
5/27/2014,4 star rating,"My first time eating at an AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant and it definitely did NOT disappoint! I came here when I was visiting SoCal for the weekend with two friends who are veterans of eating all you can eat Korean BBQ. I basically let them order for me since I was an amateur. (I'm a fan of the food, I just don't know how to order it)We had reservations for 7p but didn't arrive at 730. The line was out the door! Service was accommodating and after waiting 15 minutes they gave us the option of splitting our 8 person party into two tables which we took. If you plan on coming here, make reservations (and take it seriously! Nobody likes to wait when they're hangry) When you get seated, they already have the small side dishes set up. You can choose what type of meat you prefer and then they bring it to your table and help you get started on grilling it. I fell in love with the beef brisket! Everything was delicious. I gave it 4 stars because of the service. Wasn't bad but wasn't anything spectacular. One of the servers there was very antisocial. At one point he grabbed the tongs from my BFs hand to help us flip our meat. (Funny only bc it was so awkward) At the end of the meal I tried to take a picture and asked the same server to smile and he ignored me. Lol. That's not in his job description to pose for pictures but humor me a little! Other than that, food was great!"
5/26/2016,4 star rating,"On a Friday evening, it was about a 2 hour wait. There are options for AYCE and regular ordering of portions, but the better deal for more variety is obviously the AYCE. It is on the pricier side (about $24 per person on weekends I believe). The set up was very nice once we were seated with sides already out for us and a huge stone grill. There was a large selection of different types of beef, pork, chicken, and even seafood. My personal favorites were the beef bulgolgi, marinated choice beef short rib, and marinated squid. The shrimp seemed fresh and octopus were unmarinated so plain but a great option. The thinly cut black angus was unmarinated and a bit dry after awhile. I enjoyed the spicy beef but I do want to warn that it was very strongly spiced. There are some other options such as fresh mushrooms which is also nice. Portion sizes of meat were great since it allowed us to try several different things. Other notable sides include kim chi pancake, steamed egg, and kim chi fried rice at the end. The kimchi pancake was very starchy but went well with the quantities of meat in front of us (kind of like a rice). Steamed egg is always one of my favorites. At the end of the meal, a very simple kim chi fried rice (consisting of exactly what it sounds like with some seaweed) is grilled in front of you to end the meal. It was alright but a nice touch (maybe we should've added some meat into it for a more interesting end). Service was fantastic for such a busy place. To be honest, none of the meats were to die for but they were decently good and I was very satisfied. The spectacular service makes it worth going back for. Perhaps not worth a 2 hour wait again, but worth checking out as a one time thing."
7/11/2015,5 star rating,"I've been here four times now and each time I need to be wheeled out because of over eating. Everytime I have someone visit SoCal, I try to take them here, it's simply affordable, delicious, and excellent quality meat. The only issue is parking (valet when it's busy) and the wait, because it's always busy. If you go on a Friday night or weekend, bring your smart phones since you'll be waiting for an hour minimum.I've never been a fan of waving my hands in the air like I just don't care (because I do) or glaring at someone for service, so any place with the bell button for service gets bonus points."
3/27/2018,4 star rating,"This place was a lot of fun, but prepare to wait forever. We went on a Friday night and were told it would be an hour, but if you aren't there when they call you, they take you off the list and you have to start over. We went next door for drinks, and came back within the hour, but we had to wait another hour and a half, so it was 10:30 before we got seated. I was seriously close to fainting. It's about $25 per person, and you can ask for anything on the menu, as many times as you want. My favorites were the calamari and kimchi pancakes. The guys loved the bulgogi. The dipping sauces were great. We left after midnight and people were still waiting to be seated. Bring a snack for the line!"
11/6/2019,5 star rating,How have I never reviewed this lol. This place is great! Every time I have eaten there it has been on point and great service. My only issue is the parking but it is LA so expected. Be there with ample time because the wait can be very long.

1/29/2018,5 star rating,"TL DR; Its never to early for Korean BBQ, ~$24 per person for AYCE KBBQ Lunch, Restaurant was filled by 11:30am, Wait time was about 10-15 minutes after 12:30pm, READ THE RULES before ordering, FAV cut of meat (Marinated USDA Choice Beef Short Rib (They claimed it was the most expensive cut)), Can't wait to come back!The Hype is REAL!!! I am by no means a stranger to Korean BBQ, but I'm not an expert either. Â I just know what I like and this place was amazing! This place is a little on the pricier side for an All you can eat KBBQ but it was well worth it! While visiting LA, we had to visit Koreatown for their famous Korean BBQ. Â Walking around Koreatown, there is literally a Korean BBQ restaurant on every corner. Â So we turned to our trusty yelp app and looked for the most popular, non-disputably delicious restaurant near us. Â The app lead us to this restaurant :). Â On Friday at 11:05am, we waltzed in and the restaurant was completely empty... Â We looked around and just had the most confused looked on our faces. Â We soon realized that they just opened at 11am and we were their first customers ! Â After we sat down, not even 5 minutes later there was a line outside the door for the all you can eat lunch! Â We were given 4 sauces (vinegar and soy sauce pickled veggies, fermented bean paste (doenjang), chili dip, and a sweet soy sauce). Â The sides we were given were, Korean potato salad, kimchi, sautÃ©ed bean sprouts, pickled radish thinly sliced and julienned, steamed rice paper wraps, boiled spinach with sesame oil dressing, and fried fish cake.We were given the option to either have white rice or kimchi fried rice but it's only to be eaten at the end of the meal, which didn't sound too good to us, so we opted for the white rice . Â I lost count of how much we ordered, but we had at least 15 orders of meat or 5 rounds (Each round, you could only order 3 different types of meat). Â My favorites were the thinly sliced pork belly, USDA Prime Beef Brisket, Prime Black Angus BBQ Beef (Bulgogi), and Marinated USDA Choice Beef Short Rib. Â We didn't get a chance to eat the Beef Abomasums (intestines), BBQ chicken, and the kimchi fried rice.The marinated beef short rib was my all time favorite though! The thinly sliced canadian pork belly was a super close second. Â The short ribs were so flavorful and tender when cooked on the marble slab. Â My favorite way to eat the short rib was wrapping it in lettuce leaves, sesame leaves, a little bit of rice, pickled radish, doenjang sauce, and a raw clove of garlic forming a pouch and eating the whole thing in one bite!After about every round of meat, they cleaned the slab with a water and shredded radish combination, it was like a lunch and a show! Â The movements they used to clean the slab was really mesmerizing! Â The wait staff was really attentive and we didn't have just one server/cook, we had about 3 people helping us from drink refills to refilling our side dishes to helping us with ordering more meat! Â Suggestions:-While enjoying my lunch, I overheard on the phone that their dinner reservations were completely full and it's possible to walk in if you don't mind waiting. Â If you want a dinner reservation, call a week in advance!-If you just want to try this place, don't like waiting in lines, and have a couple hours to spare during the afternoon, I think it's the best time to come! Â The max I saw people waiting was about 10-15 minutes for a table.I can't rave about this place enough!! If I ever find myself in LA again, I'm definitely making my way out here to eat here again!! Â This as been one of the most amazing KBBQ experiences I've ever had!"
7/18/2017,3 star rating,"""Meh I've experienced better"" is an appropriate rating.My dinner had pros and cons. Definitely not as good as I thought it was going to be. There are many better Korean BBQ spots nearby.Food:Marinated short ribs - this was the best. Very good, super flavorful and tender.Bulgogi - this was good as well.Shrimp - peel on, no flavorChicken - boringBaby octopus - boring.Miso soup - inedible.Kimchi pancake - cold, sour, limp. inedible.Vegetable Sides - very few, not very tasty.Other things:Service -great ! very attentive, even while busy.Ambience - fun, although super hot, not enough ventilation.Wait time - not so bad.Try it and see for yourself - some people on here seem to love it but there are much better places around with really delicious sides and better tasting meats (other than the marinated short rib and the bulgogi, which were both yummy)."
9/6/2017,1 star rating,"To be honest, very honest, our experience at this establishment was disappointing. Pros: valet parking for $2 in front of the restaurant Cons: -No air conditioning -minimal selection of meat and side dishes-poor service-did I mention no air conditioning?Understanding that I came to LA during a heat wave, i thought air conditioning would be on full blast since it was so hot out. It was unbearable to enjoy and eat AYCE Korean BBQ at this joint since I was sweating so much! I couldn't really sit and enjoy eating next to a hot stone either. I asked the waiter if they had air conditioning and apparently they had 4 air conditioners running, however due to the excess heat from the stone - we couldn't feel the air conditioner said the waiter. Minimal banchan (side dishes) of 4 and can only order 3 choices of meat at a time. The waiter gave us an option if we wanted some of the meats cooked in the kitchen - we asked if the bulgogi to be cooked from the kitchen, however it took forever and was served 45 minutes later. Service is snail speed slow and our waiter was super forgetful. Additional charges for a basket of lettuce for $5 each. Won't be coming back anytime soon. Maybe if they place more air conditioners, maybe."
12/19/2015,5 star rating,"Great place for late night all you can eat KBBQ! There's usually a long wait to get in here so prepare yourselves.I have to acknowledge that the service here is also really good. We showed up very late, a little before 1:00AM which they probably weren't thrilled about but they got us situated fast enough to beat the kitchen closing at 1:20AM. They were very speedy about bringing us the meats and helping us cook them faster so we could order more food in the short amount of time we had."
6/19/2015,5 star rating,"Quick service, friendly staff, and don't feel the need to rush with little wait. Food itself was so good.We had a birthday there and full disclosure they put a candle on a choco pie lol, I'm not kidding. It was fun and they play music and get everyone else in the restuaraunt involved. Fun atmosphere. Love this placeStone grill by the way and the food is so good. They use radish to clean it. Plus sometimes the meat may not be enough, just ask for more. They are not annoyed by the bell.Given that we had soju and hite beer, very fun and for four of us with two bottles of soju and three beers, total of around $130-150. Fun time."
5/20/2015,5 star rating,"I might have found my go-to korean bbq place. Excellent service, friendly staff, food that doesn't burn... and drinks! Small place, so expect a wait if you come with a big group. We had a reservation but our group didn't come on time but they still sat us an hour later when everyone finally showed up and didn't hassle us about being late. The atmosphere isn't too loud or smoky. Quite different from the typical cook on a metal grill, this place offers a stone grill for the food. The Â staff stopped by probably every 5 minutes to help us cook, cut, and the meat always turned out perfectly in the end. No burnt pieces!!! Not only that, but the staff also constantly asked if you want more meat. No more silly buttons, no more waving your hand for a server. These guys were on point. It's hard to believe!!!!The only downside is that they don't have a large variety of drinks, which I guess for the non-alcoholic is fine. Other than that, service, food, selection, expect a good time~!"
8/22/2016,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) Korean bbq establishment that has repeatedly satisfied my meat cravings. It's located in a small shopping center next to KyoChon off 6th St. The meat quality is pretty good, whether it's beef brisket, kalbi, pork belly, or beef tongue. The compliments of ban chan, rice paper, steamed egg, and pancake are all good. But the best part is towards the end when they make kimchi fried rice on the grill. It feels sort of like when you're fighting the final boss in a video game - victory when you finish everything off.HJC only takes reservations for parties of 6 or more. Just get there early or else play the waiting game. The shopping center offers valet for a small fee too, but you could get lucky and find a parking spot on the streets nearby."
6/15/2015,5 star rating,"When I used to live in LA, this is the spot my friends and I came for all you can eat Korean BBQ. I was able to come here again on Saturday for dinner ($21.99) and it was just as amazing as I remembered it to be. There are 22 items on their menu. You can choose between white rice, or kimchee rice which they make for you at the end of your meal using the stone top grill. Quality of meat is pretty high- better than other places in the area. My favorite meat on the menu is the marinated short rib. I also enjoyed the beef brisket, BBQ chicken, and octopus. I'm allergic to shrimp, but my fellow dinner companions said it was good. The bulgogi was all right, but a bit stringy. The kimchee pancake, steamed egg, and the banchan (side dishes) are great. Particularly, I enjoy having the rice noodle and thinly sliced radish wrap to accompany the meat. Dipping sauces are provided as well. This place is definitely busy, but the servers do their best to get you your meat and respond to your requests. They even help you cook and cut the large strips of meat if they see you struggling lol. I highly recommend Hae Jang Chon for KBBQ if you are in the LA area!Note: Wait can be a little long (30+ minutes), and they only take reservations for parties of 8 or more. If this is your first time at KBBQ, I'd suggest you try a bit of everything :D And if you have an event to attend afterwards, bring a change of clothes unless you don't mind smelling like meat for the rest of the night :P Enjoy!"
7/22/2017,2 star rating,"To me, their specialty is their stone grill. But I do not get any excitement about that.Their so called USDA Choice meats are not as good as they marketed. Because their beef briskets are water coated after grilling which affecting their meat texture. It is not juicy but because meat are frozen and sliced when cold, water is from ice not from meat, which overwhelms meat flavor. Their price does not meet their quality, especially in Korean Town. Service is ok but sometimes, they ignore customer's request, which kinda embarrassing.It is in my waiting list, not my ""Must-go"" restaurant ATM."
8/1/2017,5 star rating,"Definitely the best KBBQ place in Los Angeles. After trying to eat here twice, we finally made it at a time when there wasn't a mad rush. The AYCE menu is exquisite, as there are some 27 options to choose from. The banchan is already laid out as soon when you get the table, and has everything! The quality of the meat is excellent, and the service is the fastest I've seen. I would highly recommend the bulgogi, short ribs, pork belly and brisket! I also drank the makkoli for the first time and it was delicious!I have absolutely no complaints about the place itself. But my only advice would be to go either really early in the evening or around 11-12 at night or you are definitely not getting a seat."
7/7/2016,4 star rating,First timer here.Came here around 5 ish and was ridiculously packed. waited about an hour and a half just to get some barbecue.Selection is awesome. love the kimchi friend rice although the pancake tasted pretty bland.The place is nice and i love the fact that its grill on a stone rather those metal grills.It was definitely filling. a little disappointed they dont have the unlimited refills on soda ( comes in cans)
11/20/2017,5 star rating,"DELICOUS!Come early if possible, because the lines and crowds are crazy. Â We came for lunch and arrived before it was open. Â There were already people lingering waiting for the restaurant to open at 10:30am. Â So take my word and come early!!  Â PROS:They were quick on serving food and refilling and reordering. Â They didn't rush you out like some KBBQ places that only want you to eat within the 2 hour limit and are slow with service. Items to order: - beef bulgogi was REALLY good. Â So make sure you order it - Prime steak- brisket- short ribs- beef tongue- steamed egg"
12/1/2015,4 star rating,"I've only been here once, but it was a blast.I came in not being hungry, & only wanting a beer; this all chagned quickly.When it comes to the banchan, their fish cakes were on point; I was extremely baked when I showed up, & ran through about 3 plates of those hahaaI don't eat pork, so I have no comments on that, but they probably have the best beef in the neighborhood. Having so many other kbbq restaurants around, that's saying a lot, but the quality of the beef was consistent while we were there; most places will have one amazing beef item, & everything else is a dud.Also, the waiter/waitresses are overly helpful. They pop in constantly w/ suggestions, flipping & chopping meat, pouring up for you, & so on; you'd be crazy to not leave a tip.I can respect the hype, this place is pretty solid; just be Asian when you get here, & don't make things weird hahaa order, drink, eat, drink, & get out; keep that up, & you'll love this place too."
6/13/2016,5 star rating,Amazing service. Meat quality is great again!! Mike is the best server we've had in a long while. Tip him well!
10/8/2013,5 star rating,Amazing place! One of my top recommendations. Cross your fingers for Sunny or Michelle as a server. They are the best!
9/24/2013,3 star rating,"Uh oh... Something was wrong with the meat today. I don't know why, but the marinated Kalbi was very tough even when we cooked it medium rare. Also, the marination was a little off. Â I usually love ""Little Piggy"" though--and I'm pretty sure tonight was just a fluke. Nevertheless, the pig shoulder was amazing. Got 3 plates of it. I think the side dishes were good too because my roommate ate them all, plus refills. Overall, I still really enjoy the ambience. Â The workers are always friendly, especially Sunny. Make sure to tip her well!"
5/26/2015,4 star rating,"This place is definitely pricey, but for all the options that you get, I think it's worth it. I went with a small group though, so we didn't get to order everything on the menu (out of fear that we'd get charged for wasting food). But I was pretty satisfied with everything that I did get to try. The side dishes were good and varied (seafood pancake was so good), and they were very generous with the refills. As for the meat, the chicken, beef tongue, and bulgogi were my favorite. They were all marinated very well and the meat came out tender and filled with flavor. The best part about this place is how they do most of the cooking for you. They cut up everything, cook everything, and let you know when things are ready to eat. And once you're all out of meat, they ask you for your next order right away. I was VERY impressed with the customer service here.At the very end, they make you the kimchi fried rice. Unfortunately, I found it to be a little disappointing. The kimchi was so sour and the rice came out a bit too soggy for my taste. Sad way to finish off an otherwise delicious lunch. But even then, I'd still rate this place 4 stars. I can't say that this place will be my go-to KBBQ place from now on since it is quite pricey...but if I'm ever in the mood to splurge, I'll be back for sure."
1/30/2019,5 star rating,One word- Delicious. This place really deserves 5 stars. The waiters were around any one moment we needed them. The quality was spectacular.
2/24/2018,5 star rating,If you've been you know. If not do yourself a favor and get there pronto. Just be prepared to wait 45-60mins pretty much any time of day/night.
5/3/2019,5 star rating,"This is by far some of the best Korean BBQ I have had in LA. It is all you can eat so make sure to come hungry. There is a parking lot with reasonable valet parking. We went on a weeknight at dinner time and had a 20-30 minute wait for a group of 10. The grills were nicely ventilated so the restaurant wasn't smoky. Definitely a louder, fun, vibrant atmosphere for a group gathering. Good service. The meat was decent quality and I really liked all of the sides and sauces that came with the BBQ. Restrooms were clean and easily accessible. I had a great experience and am hoping to be back shortly."
3/16/2016,5 star rating,"I have only 3 words to describe about this place-Oh-My-God! This place is FREAKING AMAZING! I felt like a thief paying for the price they asked for in return for the amount of food I gotten. This should be a foodie crime! They had about 22 different meats to choose from for only $23.99. Again, that was $23.99 ladies and gentleman. That deserves a round of applause!!! Â I order the BBQ beef, ribs, pork, squid, and steak. The quality of meat was definitely fresh, and the star was the marination they use for their dishes. Nothing was to overwhelming and the employees would always come around after a few dishes to clean the stone plate. Very friendly atmosphere and the wait was not short. Be prepared to wait at least an hour to get a table for 4 at the minimum but the moment that you sit down and take that first bite you'll realize why the demand for this place is so high! Usually when there's a line outside a restaurant during dinner time means you're in the right place for good food and this place is one of them!"
6/21/2015,3 star rating,"Yelp 100 challenge 2015...this is my first time here, it is in k town in la. It is only 21.99 and open till 2 am...the sides were really great except I felt the kimchi was too vinegary...also if it's an ayce place the only part I didn't understand is they make kimchi fried rice at the end, but why must u choose from kimchi fried rice versus white rice...it was weird the meat is ayce but not the rice...they made me choose that's why I gave it 3 stars..."
2/18/2018,5 star rating,"Love this KBBQ spot! For an all your can eat spot the food is delicious and the staff are very attentive. Tips- Â Sign your name on the clip board at the entrance, note you're entire party must be present before will seat you and Valet parking is $2"
5/14/2019,5 star rating,The food was absolutely Devine and authentic! The meats were tender and juicy all the condiments had so much flavor. The services as exceptional and I would come back more often if I didn't live so far.
7/21/2018,5 star rating,"Had to wait two hours for a table BUT it was well worth the wait. The atmosphere was a little hectic but my table was luckily in the back of the restaurant so I felt like there was more intimacy there. Our waiter was an absolute delight and was very attentive to our needs! I ordered most of the beefs, the pork belly and bbq chicken. Everything was perfect, and of high quality. I have to say, they also had great side dishes, which is something I value as I enjoy things that can compliment the rest of the meal. Again, if you're questioning whether or not you should wait, DO IT. My group checked out some nearby places while we waited the two hours for our table here, and were very unimpressed and quickly returned back to this establishment. Enjoy ;)"
3/1/2019,5 star rating,"ACYE can be really hit or miss. I get it: the restaurant still needs to turn a profit, so they aren't going to set out prime cuts for people to hemorrhage money. That said, Hae Jang Chon had good quality meat for the price. My personal favorite was the beef tongue, which came highly recommended by our waiter. He suggested eating it with the salt and pepper in sesame oil sauce, which was amazing. There's a bit of a wait here usually, but it's very much worth it. Next time I'm in the LA area, I'll be sure to come back!"
9/25/2017,4 star rating,"Waited 1 hour on Â Sunday 9/24, Â seated at 930pm. Not disappointed at all. The wait well worth it. Â 2 doors down a bar to pass time. 25.99 pp, ayce. Of the 27 item's we ordered brisket, boneless marinated shortribs, shrimp, pork belly and chicken. All good cuts and quality. Ban chan a little to spicy for me but good. Service was good, they have a great system, servers check up with you, Â help u cook and take reorders. I would go back. Great for friends."
10/2/2019,5 star rating,"The food is above average quality in what you would expect from a typical korean bbq place. Â This includes their meat, their sides, vegetables and soups.The service was nothing short of amazing. Â Everything was refilled proactively, our food was cooked for us, and the servers were kind and helpful.I would recommend anyone looking for a great kbbq experience to check this place out!"
8/12/2017,4 star rating,"They have 2 dollar valet parking which I do recommend. They do have restrooms not gender netrual but still clean. I came after lunch time so it was about 25 dollars for all you can eat. Plenty of options from meat to seafood which is amazing!!! The side dishes vary from the steamed egg in the stone dish, kimchi, salad, different dipping sauces, an plenty of veggies to grill with your meat."
7/18/2019,5 star rating,"This place was amazing. I have been to numerous korean bbq places around the country, and this has been my favorite. it's due to the excellent service. they were quick and attentive."
4/16/2015,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is a definite MUST every time I come down to LA. The restaurant has a warm, casual, and inviting vibe, like entering someone's home. It's a great place to catch up with friends and family. It's easy to find and is located along 6th street and Serrano, in Koreatown, LA. Once you enter the strip mall parking lot, there is valet parking available for $2. Â Generally, weekends are pretty busy. If you're pressed for time, you should probably make a reservation. I usually take a chance and don't make a reservation. However, if there's a lot of people waiting to get in, you'll need to put your name on a wait list...but don't be discouraged, it's worth the wait!Now let's talk food. There is a HUGE selection of All You Can Eat food to choose from! It's great but can be overwhelming to decide what to order. The staff are very helpful in making tasty recommendations. Each table is equipped with large hot stone grill and set up with various Korean condiments for each person. The meals are served with steamed egg, potato salad, tossed salad, daikon radish, rice wrappers, and kimchi pancake.My ultimate favorite meat is the thinly sliced Black Angus beef brisket. When I eat the beef dipped in the sesame oil and salt, with the side salad...I'm in food heaven! Another tasty choice is the marinated beef short rib. This meat has more flavour to it but I'm biased towards the brisket. There's a variety of seafood available as well. At the end of the meal, you can choose to have your leftovers made into fried rice.Overall, the staff are generally very attentive and friendly, even when juggling multiple guests. They have a team oriented approach in providing service, often taking turns in checking to see how you are doing. If you're not confident in your cooking skills, the staff are very willing to help you. They often ask to see what your next meat order will be (not waiting until your hot plate is empty) and will clean your hot plate when needed.Because of the consistently excellent service and quality of food, this place feels like home when I come to visit LA. For roughly $20, you great value for the meal you get. Â I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try Korean barbecue! Your stomach will thank you!"
10/5/2013,4 star rating,"What: Date Night DinnerEats: AYCE KBBQ meats: 1 order of brisket, 2 orders of marinated short rib, and 1 order of bulgogi) + kimchi pancakes + steamed eggs + sidesTakes: First time eating Kbbq in K-town! After missing last call by 5 mins at my local default kbbq place, we were recommended to drive to k-town to try this place! Recommendation definitely well noted! Of the meats we ordered, hands down MARINATED SHORT RIB fills the void in my stomach! YUM--it's the marinade that makes it and the short ribs were so tender; it's def. some mouth watering goodness right there! Brisket and bulgogi were on point too, but they weren't on the same level for us as the short rib. Kimchi pancakes had a kick; I've never been served these at a kbbq restaurant! Steamed eggs and sides rounded up the delicious meal.Down side: They ran out of tortillas to make the tacos. Granted we did come at a little passed midnight, but still, what a bummer! I really wanted to try them!First timers: Be sure to read the excerpt on the menu (They have a lot of additions you don't necessarily get at other places, so read what you can get to get your money's worth!)Ambiance: Large restaurant, yet even with a lot of tables/people, it didn't feel claustrophobic at all! Decor is modern and tasteful.Parking: Shared private lot. We missed the valet service (closes at 11pm). Bottom line: Go here for your K-town AYCE KBBQ fix! Highly Recommended."
7/18/2018,5 star rating,"My manager took our team here after work. My first time. Nothing but good things about this place. Food is at the table when you arrive, tons of items to choose from for both meat and non-meat eaters, cool atmosphere, and great customer service! Again, nothing but good things. Only down side is parking, but it's K-Town... it's expected. Highly recommend stopping in. Try to reserve because it can get packed."
7/5/2019,5 star rating,This is definitely worth the wait. The meat is great quality compared to kbbq chains.
8/30/2019,4 star rating,"All the BBQ was great, less octopuses ones!! Customer service was amazing, but wait time is too long (we waited for a table around 1 and half hours on Thursday). Parking is terrible. I didn't like the kimchee rice sorry hehehe. Little bit pricey. Thank you."
8/4/2017,2 star rating,"Overall the food at the restuarant was excellent but the service was lacking. We went at 11AM and had to wait another 15 minutes for the people who made a reservation at that time or the customers who signed up before us to be seated first. Once in, we were seated in the corner of the room, and attended to for the first 10 minutes. Afterwards, our two servers were mainly focused on their other tables and especially the two tables next to us while ignoring our needs. We only ordered 1 round of meats (galbi, pork belly, and bulgogi) and sat with only side dishes for 10-15 minutes after completing our course of meats while the two servers saw, ignored us, and continued to serve the other tables until finally one of them approached us and asked if we wanted more meat. However, that also took 15 minutes before he updated us that our order was 'the next order coming up' although the table next to us ordered 5 minutes ago. I cancelled the order and just paid to leave since I lost my appetite waiting the whole 30 minutes for nothing."
1/21/2019,1 star rating,"Made a reservation for my bf's birthday at 5:30pm for 7 people. Â When I called to make the reservation they did mention that all of the party needs to be there to be seated and they only hold our table until 5:45.Five of us got there at 5:40 and checked in with the girl at the front calling for tables. Â I asked if we can sit down and order first, she said no because it's ayce and said just let her know when all of us are here. Â At 5:45 knowing 2 of our friends are still 15min away I went to the girl again and asked if she'll keep our table, again she said yes just let her know when all of us are here. Â At 6:02, when all of us went to the front and said we are all here, the girl instead told us that because we've past the 15min grace period we are removed from the reservation and need to put our names on the long waiting list.. Â Then the manager came over and kept blaming us for being late and reinforcing that they've made the policy clear when making the reservation. Â We argued that the girl at the front never told us that we've already been removed from the reservation and if she did, we would've put down our names on the waiting list or left at 5:45. Â When the girl tried to explain for us she was pushed back by the manager, who wasn't even there to witness the whole story, preventing her from proving us right. Â Ok we knew we were late but that wasn't the point we were making, and the manager only repeatedly said that we were late to try to make us feel guilty.It almost ruined my bf's mood for his birthday dinner. Â We ended up going to another kbbq place nearby which was great and no line. Â Don't understand how this place stood out in ktown where good kbbq is everywhere. Â NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN."
2/9/2017,5 star rating,"Review numero 200!I've frequented many KBBQ places throughout the years and this was one of the best! However, the only time I come here is when I have friends visiting. Probably because it's one of the highest rated and most reviewed places in Los Angeles. After coming here a few times I can see why! This place is unlike most KBBQ restaurants. First, they use stone grills which doesn't get too hot so meats don't burn. Second, you don't really cook your own meats here. Since the grill is so unique, the waiters cook your meats and cleans your grill with vegetables! They have to do this because the oil stays in the grill and can get a bit greasy if you are cooking it by yourself. They trained their staff to be quick and very responsive, like a well oiled machine (pun intended ). What takes this place to the next level is that at the end of your meal, they can take some of your leftover meats and make you kimchi fried rice. Some of you may think think it's a waste because you can be having more meat, but I say it's totally worth it! The parking and wait can get pretty ridiculous. Valet, like at most K-town spots, is pretty affordable; definitely worth the couple of bucks. The wait can be up to 2 hours if you come during a busy time. I would shoot for coming around 3pm for a late lunch or an early dinner."
4/3/2015,4 star rating,This is another popular AYCE kbbq in koreatown. It has the usual things on the menu but what makes this place stand out is that they come and make fried rice on your grill pan after you are done with the meat. Make sure you leave room for this! This place does get packed and parking is either valet or street. Â Get there early for no wait and easy parking.
2/19/2013,4 star rating,"All you can Eat Korean BBQ for 17.99. Must get here super hungry because you will for sure leave full and satisfied. The BF and I were looking for a good AYCE Korean BBQ and came across this place. It had 4 stars and over 1300 reviews so I was like damn they must be good. When we got here, there was a line. I called and asked how long the wait was and the hostess said about 1 and half hour. Well we decided to wait, normally we never wait but we wanted to check out what all the hype was about. But to my surprise, we were seated within 40 minutes...it wasn't so bad.When the hostess seated us to our table, all the side dishes were already setup for us. Service was good, the manager comes around with a smile and cuts our meat for us. Servers would check up on us consistently and make sure we are grilling the meat right.The meat and seafood were good...we ordered the brisket, pork belly, beef bulgogi, baby squid, octopus, and beef short ribs. They were all so yummy!!!Overall, this place was good but not sure if we will wait longer than 1 hour if we were ever to come back here."

9/2/2017,5 star rating,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Make a reservation with a group of friends and have a good time. Highly recommend the bulgogi, spicy beef, and short rib. Kinda underwhelming pork but o well. And for $25 you can't beat it."
10/9/2017,5 star rating,"This place has delicious Korean bbq. The highlights were the beef brisket, beef bulgogi, and the thin sliced pork belly. Super flavorful and mouth watering. The items are cooked on your table on a stone grill. This seemed to lessen burning of items and the waitress came around often to help you cook. The only downside is that some of the items were just way too spicy: the fishcake appetizer, the kimchi, and the kimchi friend rice burned upon contact with my mouth. 4.5 stars. All in all, pretty great food and service. A bit pricey at $26 a head though.Expect a one hour wait, even on weeknights."
10/9/2017,5 star rating,"This review is solely based on the food. Everything is so delicious. With so many Korean BBQ spots all around Koreatown, you might get stuck having to choose any random spot -- but this place has such great quality meats and a good variety to choose from. Definitely a go to!"

5/18/2018,5 star rating,"This became one of our favorite KBbq & we can't wait to go back! My FiancÃ©e & I waited for so long(45mins) but we were glad it was worth it. Their meats were high quality & their stone grills are pretty unique, i like that they don't have to change grills like other typical korean bbq places. They do clean the stone grill in front of you tho, but super fast & easy. I like how servers here really check up on you & even help you cook your meats. Joe was our server & really he's a hard worker guy!So many selections on their menu! Soups & sides were also so bomb! I had like two orders of steamed egg lol. Their kimchi was crunchy & fresh. Avoid coming here during rush hours, because parking is so crazy! Took us about an hour going around. There's a valet parking outside but it looked stressfull so we didn't bother & got a side street parking instead."

2/20/2016,5 star rating,"Top 5 AYCE KBBQ I've been to in my life. As you would expect with any decent KBBQ spot in LA, expect a wait. Then on weekends they do have valet parking, which I thought was odd. The guys were cool though and let me park my own car. Then they complimented my car lol. I would have been a little hesitant letting these ""strangers"" park my car in a public lot and have my keys. The place is relatively clean, quick, and efficient. What I really liked compared to other places is that you cook the food on hot stone. It heated up quickly and cooked fast, and we required 0 annoying grill changes that you typically do a few times on traditional grills. My gf and I are pretty simple when it comes to KBBQ. We order lots of brisket and shrimp. Overall it was a great dining experience, decent meat, and quick service. I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area and looking for ayce KBBQ."
12/20/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious! We were a party of 2 and arrived round 5pm, only a 5 minute wait. But after we left round 6 there was a long line outside the door. You can order three meats at a time. If you don't eat most of it you will be charged $15. When it gets busy they often forget your order, just give them a friendly reminder and they get it for you (: The employees come by to Cook the meat for you."
3/11/2019,5 star rating,"Best KBBQ restaurant in the business. I've tried multiple restaurants and to simply put it: nothing else compares. Their food is delicious, especially their sides! I love how the food is cooked on a stone top thus cooking your meat evenly and not burning it. This place usually has a line over an hour long but it is well worth it! Definitely a place I'd recommend!"
2/1/2016,5 star rating,"So it's Saturday around 2pm, you figure people have eaten lunch already and there should be little to no wait.. Um yeah, no.. haha. There's a crowd of people waiting outside and it's packed inside. Hour plus wait, but IT'S SO WORTH IT AND NO REGRETS indulging in gluttony and eating so much food coma hits before you can walk out of the door.Venue: clean, stone or maybe it's cast iron grill/cook top, aroma of KBBQ fills the air and if you're hella hungry makes you salivate even more b/c you want to eat everything on the menu (minus intestines.. I don't like intestines O_O) Food: order to your heart and stomachs capacity. It's all you can eat for 2 hours. Kimchi pancakes are bomb and the fermented soy bean and chili hot sauce.. YUM!!! Try the salad they give you, you'd be surprised how nice it is to eat some leafy greens along with all the protein you will consume. Staff: Are friendly, attentive and prompt. Sometimes I wonder what they are thinking when they see all these people coming in and gorging on so much food and waddling out. Haha.Parking, if you can find free street parking - awesome, most are metered. there's a small lot that they force you to valet ($2 cash only)"
3/1/2019,5 star rating,The wait is long but it's so worth it! Visited back in 2017 while on vacation in LA now that I live here it's my go too spot for Korean BBQ
3/23/2015,5 star rating,"Location: In koreatown! It is within a very small plaza and believe it or not they have valet parking. Sounds a little bit silly because the plaza is so small but I guess it is worth it. Better then trying to go around the whole neighborhood looking for street parking. I would recommend just paying for valet because the wait for this place could be long! Imagine looking for parking for a long time then having to wait even longer for your table. (They do not take you in until your whole party arrives, so don't be stuck looking for parking!)Customer Service: My bf called in I would say an hour before because we were coming from WestMinister and when I had called they told me I couldn't Â make a reservation but when he called I have no idea what he said but they let him put down our reservation! Whatever works for me!!! So thank you to Kevin (I believe that's his name)Decor: Â Not too big not too small, a good amount of tables. They have what they serve on big baords which is good. You don't always need the menu by your side.Presentation of Food: Â Big round clay pan type of cooking ware which is wear you bbq the meat. First time seeing krn bbq cooked on something like this and it cooks well! They have little banchan unlike the other krn bbq palces I've been to in the bay but it's ok. They had some sort of potato salad which was good because it had cut up apples in it, some greens that reminded me of mini chinese broccoli but I doubt it's chinese broccoli (just some sort of steamed greens), a fish cake banchan which was spicy but good, and also small little rice papers. Also they had the spicy bean sprouts and kkimchi for banchans of course! They had 4 different dipping sauces (sesame oil, another type of oil, two different chili paste). We picked the kimchi pancake along with the steamed egg(steamed egg wasn't too good but the kimchi pancake was up to par).How did the food taste?: All the meat that came out was PERFECT, except for the spicy pork which was very dissapointing because we were all expecting this to steal the show. Both the thick and the thin cut of the pork belly was sooo good but I prefer the thin cut. We got squi, baby octupus, and shrimp which I could have opted out on because not much flavor because it's not completely seasoned but good none the less. The brisket, well you can never go wrong with brisket and that was amazing! The bulgogi was good, but the one that toally stole the show was the beef short rib. zOMG! It was so tender and so juicy, and just sooooo good!!!!Overall Experience: We actually came here before two years ago but the line was so long that we had to drive back to the bay area that we just said forget it! BIG MISTAKE! The wait is worth it and we should have went the first time. Now this will always be on the list on the way home after a trip to LA!Would I Come Back?: YESSSSSSS"
3/5/2015,3 star rating,"I think I've met my quota for lard for the year after visiting here. Yum, but ouuuch my belly!FOOD QUALITY:The meat here is very tasty but it's because all the cuts contain a lot of fat, and with a grill that only has a single hole to drain down all the fat your food will be covered with a fat. Therefore you will mostly just taste ... fat. So be prepared to drown your taste buds with that rich, fatty, buttery flavor with chunks of overshadowed seasoned meats; you'll be thoroughly pleased if you're looking to raise your LDL levels.However, if anything were to be this restaurants saving grace, it would be their banchan and their kimchi fried rice because they were fresh and refreshing. The touch of nori in the fried rice really brought a strong earthy, umami, add a good kick of spice and acidity to cut, and you're with a tasty bite.Overall though, I can't help but feel that everything is just way too fatty.SERVICE:Please stop touching the meat. Please stop touching the meat. Please stop touching the mea--oh please don't cut the meat. Well! There goes all the juice in my tender chicken down that hole and mixed in that fat. Â Well, I'm not penalizing them on that but it does bother me that I've had to ask three times for more rice paper ... They're a tad forgetful here due to the hustle and bustle, but they're nice and courteous at the least. ENVIRONMENT:If I had to be honest, I didn't care about how this place looked or how much of a wooden dump it looked like since I was too hungry or too busy stuffing my face with food. Since all the tables accommodate more than two people, you'll either have a lot of room if you're just there with 2-4 people or not enough room anything more than that. The waiting area is terrible when it's cold though because it's outdoors with little seating and no heat lamps to keep people comfortable. Oh, and the wait on a Sunday 3:30pm was an hour and half wait. Overall, I get this place is tasty -- but the wait and fattiness of the meats make me not want to really come back here again."

I'm from Chicago where there's only a few good Korean BBQ places but I've never experienced AYCE so Hae Jang Chon was SO WORTH the wait!!! The service is fantastic; our server kept the meat, banchan, lettuce, and rice wraps coming nonstop even though he was busy with other tables. He would check in on us and sometimes help cook, cut and serve the meat. The meat and fried rice were absolutely DELICIOUS (I don't remember what we got because I came here with 3 Koreans and put my trust in them since I'm not Korean..) This place has set my standards for Korean BBQ very high.."

4/14/2017,5 star rating,"If there's any other KBBQ joints around Los Angeles that you guys are skeptical of, look no further. I've never waited for more than 1 hour for a KBBQ restaurant before, especially at night when it was super cold. Food was cooked on a stone grill instead of a regular grill. Me and my friends waited for approximately almost 2 hours for this because we came on a Friday night and the line was just super long. But the wait didn't phase me at all. I've heard great reviews from this place before and I just couldn't wait to actually sit inside and try it for myself. After finally waiting, we were finally seated inside the restaurant. You can tell by walking inside already that people were having a good time drinking and eating in here. The vibe here was different compared to many other KBBQ restaurants. First things first, we got our traditional side dishes first and our drinks. Kimchi here was pretty decent. Service was pretty good despite it being a very busy night. Our server Yurim (hope I spelled her name right) brought our drinks and side dishes pretty fast. Their potato salad was pretty good that I would always ask for more every time a server came back.Now let's go straight into their meats. The servers cook their meat for you instead of you cooking it, which I find pretty surprising. We first started off our round with the classic brisket and bulgogi plates. What I like about this brisket is that it is very lean and neatly sliced with little to no fat. I judge a place strictly by their brisket options. Bulgogi was pretty good since it was marinated in a sweet/savory sauce that complements well with the meat. If a place does not have good brisket, it is not a good place in my opinion. But this definitely surpassed my expectations. The next plate of meat we tried were pork shoulder and pork belly. Usually, many KBBQ places serve their pork belly with a huge slob of fat, which makes the meat not too enjoyable. Once again, the pork belly served here is very lean and tasty, with little to no fat at all. In the end, with all of the leftover pieces of meat and sauce, we get asked an option if we want to have the leftovers cooked in their kimchi fried rice. We say yes and our server Yurim gets the job done well. It was definitely surprising for me because this was the first KBBQ places that I went to that serves kimchi fried rice in the end. Even just thinking about it and remembering the kimchi fried rice makes me want to go back again and try.Overall, this place was definitely worth the wait. The meat was fantastic, service was fantastic, and the vibe overall was fantastic. Hands down, this is my new favorite KBBQ restaurant as of now. Until we meet again Hae Jang Chon"
1/28/2015,5 star rating,"Yelp - you have officially redeemed yourself from the Road to Seoul disaster with Hae Jang Chon. I've had this place bookmarked for some time but had lost hope for good AYCE KBBQ in K-Town after my experience at R2S. My friend had a hankering for KBBQ and suggested we try an a la carte spot - well, that wasn't something my wallet could handle, so I suggested Hae Jang Chon, instead. I figured I'd give one more K-Town place a try before I completely dismissed them. I am so glad I did. We arrived around 5 on a Monday night and were seated immediately. The restaurant itself is a nice change of pace from what I've experienced at other KBBQ joints - wooden floors, round and square tables with the traditional cast iron grill for cooking, plenty of ventilation, and an open kitchen design. Impressive! The menu is vast but not overwhelming - which makes for easy picking. We dined on:brisketbulgogimarinated short ribthin & thick Canadian pork bellypork shoulder (seemed more like pork jowls or cheek)spicy porkBBQ chickenshrimpkimchi pancakekimchi fried riceBanchans were good too - great flavor and all very complimentary to the proteins we selected. The kimchi was some of the best I've tasted in a while. The steamed egg pot left a bit to be desired as it was a bit bland, but the texture was on point - light and airy. The soybean paste was amazingly good. What impressed me the most was the level of service. I've been to a few KBBQ joints in K-Town and this is the only spot where service is professional, warm, friendly, and customer focused. I was blown away and pleasant surprised as I expected service to be cold and robotic - it was far from that.There is valet parking or metered street parking. We opted to park on the street (1 hour max) and were able to find a super close spot. I highly recommend this place - quality proteins, excellent service, affordable price - what more can you ask for? We'll be back, for sure!"

1/9/2018,4 star rating,"When I went to LA for New Year's Eve, it was a priority of mine to make sure I got Korean BBQ and I knew many places would be open but wanted to go to one that did it right. With 3500 plus reviews and they're open till 2am on NYE, hell yeah I went with this place. We only had to wait about 20 minutes (amazing for a holiday) and we got such a spacious table for two people that I almost felt selfish! I give it four stars cause the service was awesome and the environment was perfect but not a lot of meat options, see I don't eat pork. The chicken was ....okay, but the beef brisket and rib was so delicious! The marinated steak and the shrimp were also great! We filled our cravings and had so many bites and appetizers (along with salad) to eat prior! Seriously was a great way to end 2017 and here's to more Korean bbq in 2018!"
1/7/2019,5 star rating,"During our visit to LA, we took our family of 7 for dinner when most of them had never had Korean BBQ before. All of us decided if we visit again, we'll be back to this restaurant. It was a highlight of our trip. We loved the staff's service and the quality of the food. We ate marinated short ribs (4 times!), bulgogi, shrimp, Â mushrooms, brisket, pork belly, octopus and kim chi fried rice (which must be served at the end). They serve two items at a time and we could only order after we finished what was already cooked. this gave us the ability to pace ourselves, accurately decide what we wanted and save us the fees associated with left over food. Everyone loved the short ribs, brisket and kimchi fried rice. Most of us got jasmine rice with the meat, but I avoided rice on the side and opt for the wraps they provide to leave more room for the meat."

9/21/2013,4 star rating,"Out of the millions of KBBQ places in Ktown, it's hard to have one really stand out, but Hae Jang Chon is one of my favorite for many reasons. Parking is ridiculous, but expected of any plaza in the area. Valet is slow and on a Friday night it seemed like there was just two guys running back and forth. Expect to wait for over an hour for larger parties, but we got lucky and there was no wait for 2 Friday night at 7PM. This almost never happens for KBBQ places.The meat selection is average but it comes with steamed egg and korean pancakes. I love korean pancakes and the fact that it's on the menu and FOR FREE is even better. Although I have to say I've had better elsewhere, it's not bad. The sides (ban chan) were pretty good but the rice paper was a bit too thick and the salad had too much sauce.The service here is top notch though. We never had to flag anyone down to refill our waters and they made sure to ask we wanted more beer or soju. There's always a server walking by every once in awhile to make sure the flame for our grill wasn't getting too crazy or to cut up the meat for us. When we were getting too full but our eyes were still hungry, the waiter was kind enough to give us a smaller portion of our order. Now.. that kimchi fried rice is what sets them apart from other KBBQ joints. It's cooked right in front of you in the leftover meat grease. You know it's going to be delicious but so bad for you. Who cares? You're already stuffing your face with KBBQ."

I wish I had pictures of the menu but o was so excited. We had marinated prime rib which I thought was the best! The meat was flavored and so tender when cooked. We also had other cuts of beef and pork. We also tried octopus. In addition to the meat, we also had different side dishes such a kimchi and different types of pickled vegetables. I really really enjoyed my dinner and was beyond full. I would highly recommend this place to try for Korean BBQ. Even my friends who live in LA thought that this was one of the better Korean BBQ restaurants they have been to in the area!"
6/22/2017,5 star rating,"If you're looking for good quality AYCE KBBQ with great service, this is a definite MUST.Tips:Valet - There's no use driving around aimlessly looking for parking. Valet is $2 or $3 (can't recall) so save yourself some time and just let them handle the vehicle. (unless of course you always have luck with finding parking)Be patient - There is ALWAYS a long line here and if there isn't, you got very very lucky! Be prepared to wait around the two hour mark if you are a party of 6 or more.Meat choices:As you cannot go wrong with anything here my favorites are the bulgogi (marinated_) and the short ribs. All of the meat is fresh and you can tell in comparison to other KBBQ locations, that their choice in meat is on the leaner side. My reasons for this being a great KBBQ in comparison to a few different AYCE is basically their fast/efficent staff and attentive service, meat quality, and their use of a hot stone as oppose to a grill. Most KBBQ locations i've experienced have had absolute terrible service. It's good to have locations like this who have attentive staff with great personalities. What I love about Have Jang Chon is that they are a little different than the usual KBBQ spot that has the interchangeable grills. With the stone, Â I think the flavor remains on the stone and it enhances the meat flavors as you continue to cook more and more meat.In addition to the sides and the meat, we ordered steam egg and kimchi pancake roughly a half an hour into our meal. It was perfect timing because we weren't completely stuffed yet. The steam egg was sooooo good and I asked or one more following because I just couldn't get enough. Something about the egg being so fluffy and perfectly salted made it taste so yummy. As soon as the kimchi pancake arrives, dig in! It tastes so good fresh but once it cools, it's not as appetizing. It's great in between meat selections. Although it takes so much longer to be seated as a large group, it's highly ideal because you don't get full off of the first two meat orders. It takes some time to get full and it creates an eventful dining experiencing. I would highly recommend this spot for any future group gatherings."
5/18/2019,3 star rating,"The service at this spot is quick which is amazing! Their bulgogi is very flavorful and tasty, but the quality of their sides was pretty disappointing.

Â From now on, I will be coming here every time.Why?- takes reservations- great service: refill water, rice and radish wraps, banchan, sauces; often cuts up the meat for us with scissors, cleaned the cooking stone 4 times- great food across the board:ordered: brisket (fresh, thinly sliced and great in radish or sauces), beef tounge Â (similar to brisket, more flavorful), octopus, mushroom, steamed egg, korean pancake, bulgogi (good, but prefer the brisket), short rib (solid, but better other places), spicy pork- left room for the kimchee fried rice, which was delicious Â (seaweed, kimchee, rice). An egg or leaving some meat to eat with it would have been great!"

1/23/2017,5 star rating,"This Korean barbecue has one of the best all-you-can-eat menus, some of the most helpful and friendly waiters, and an excellent atmosphere (literally--the ventilation is great!) for a Korean barbecue restaurant. I make plans to come here when I feel a craving for Korean barbecue but also want just a little bit more for my dining experience. The crowds outside the restaurant every night speak for themselves. Make sure to get there early, because the wait can often be longer than an hour! Luckily, valet parking is provided for $2 on site.Although it can be a tad expensive for those on a tight budget, customers definitely get what they pay for at this place. The waiters seem to be experts at barbecue and prepare everything for you. Grills are cleaned efficiently using radish upon request, and refills are quick. In addition, the waiters will essentially prepare fried rice on the grill for the customers toward the end of the meal, topping off their excellent service."

1/20/2017,2 star rating,"Idk, I have mixed feelings of this place. I had high hopes of coming here, but it was shattered by the poor service. My group and I came during lunchtime. The interior was very cute and pretty clean. I'll give that a plus. We were seated within 5 minutes, but assigned in an area where we were probably forgotten, hahah. The service was mediocre. We had two servers -- one who looked like they hated their job, and another who didn't know what they were doing half the time. They were pretty rude, and ignored us during our time there. Fortunately, the other group of people next to us complained about their service, so they attempted to fix it...I guess. Their meats tastes like any other KBBQ. I guess the only thing that stands out is their banchan -- it tasted pretty fresh. I guess I'll give them another chance. Many others had a great experience, but my first impression is kinda low. Hopefully they'll be better next time."

I loved seeing the diversity of ethnicities of people here but it makes me wonder... Have Koreans found a new spot that we just don't know about yet? I have been coming here for years. Service has improved immensely (not that it lacked before). They are quick here- quick to help cook and serve your meat and take your next order. Tonight's wait was 1.5 hours, having arrived at 9pm. I left at midnight and there was still about 20 people waiting outside. You cannot call in and get your name on the wait list."
12/30/2010,5 star rating,"I'm so impressed. Â Mostly by the great service here. Â The waiters were super friendly and took their time to clean our stone grills after each round of cooking. Â English isn't a problem either, so don't be intimidated by the Korean name of the restaurant. Â (BTW I first heard of this thru the latimes coverage and have since ONLY been to this korean restaurant!) We ordered rounds and rounds of galbi and ventured to try the beef tongue which was quite good. The banchan is generous and a good complement to the meat as well. Â The odaeng (sp?) (fish cake) isn't my favorite here but everything else made up for it. Wish I had saved more stomach room for the kimchi fried rice at the end because it was really yummy! Â Thank you to our waiter Mr. Choo for an entertaining and delicious experience at dinner!PS I'd make sure not to wear your best dress that requires dry clean only to this place. Â You'll surely have to launder your clothes after eating here because you're cooking and the fragrance will follow you, understandably so. Â I usually wear my cozy sweatshirt or a machine washable shirt."
10/1/2014,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is the second-most-Yelped Korean barbecue restaurant in Los Angeles, and I managed to miss it until this summer. It's a solid AYCE place, though I don't really get its evident wild popularity. I'd never take an out-of-towner here. Road to Seoul and Oo-Kook are both a good notch better for AYCEKBBQ.Still, Hae Jang Chon is good. I've been twice for lunch, once for a quick a la carte sit-down meal, and once for the whole barbecue experience. I understand that this place gets packed at night (and actually, I'm pretty sure I stopped in once to say hi and have a drink with friends who were eating here), but lunch is much less of a scene. Both times I've gone the restaurant has been busy but well short of full. The atmosphere has been pleasant, comfortable, homey-Korean, and service excellent. Rare to have such attentive, friendly service at a Korean joint, let alone an AYCE.The food's good. Nice banchan spread with two kinds of kimchi, spinach, ssam, potato salad, spicy odeng, and cold blocks of egg. The lunch specials are very affordable, almost all under ten dollars. I did not like mine, unfortunately. I got the gochujang yangnyum sambap. This was a hot plate piled high with spicy grilled pork and octopus. Good in theory, but the marinade was strangely flavorless and the pork was tough and gristly. I took leftovers home and only are the octopus, which was fine but not great. My mom had the yangpun yeolmu bibimbap, a bowl of barley rice and summer greens. It was nice and light. Both dishes came with daenjang jjigae, which was good but thinner than expected. Our barbecue lunch was much better. I went with a group of five and we all feasted on meat. We had chadol, kalbi, BBQ chicken, and BBQ squid, as well as kimchi pancake, steamed egg, daenjang jjigae, and kimchi fried rice at the end. We also had ddukbossam, radish wrap, and mushroom to eat with our meat. Everything was really satisfying, though I thought the best things were the squid and the fried rice, no question. Don't skip on the squid--it has good texture and a great grilled flavor. The fried rice was a bit much to end a big meal, especially one in which you are penalized for leaving food on the table, but it was very tasty.Like I said, Haejangchon is not my top choice for Korean barbecue in L.A., of even for the AYCE subcategory. Still, good food, service, and atmosphere. Can't go too wrong."
6/29/2019,5 star rating,"Went to this restaurant on a Friday mid night. They have a nice ambience. It wasn't difficult to get the table. The service is really good. It's all unlimited buffet and there are many options for meat lovers. I really liked the beef brisket, marinated beef rib, thin sliced pork belly, and shrimp."
1/14/2020,1 star rating,"I remember coming here a couple years ago for the first time. From what I can remember, it wasn't that great. But I decided to give this place another try last night. We came in around 11:00pm on a Monday night and still had to wait 10 minutes for a table. When we got sat, we were greeted immediately and ordered our meats. I believe for every round you can order up to 3 plates of meats. That may not sound like a lot but they actually give a huge portion of meat on each plate so that's a plus. To be honest, most of the meats weren't that great. They had a weird taste to it and after spoiling myself at great Korean BBQ places like JJUKKU and TK92, I felt like it just didn't taste right to me. The best kind of meat to order here is honestly the brisket. If you leave it on there to cook for a while, the meat gets crunchier and crunchier. If I were to go here again, I would only choose the briskets because those were the only thing worth eating here. The banchans were not good at all....the fishcake tasted weird as well and I found a hair inside (I also found a hair inside one of the meats too) and it wasn't my hair at all because it was a straight blonde hair and I have wavy black hair. The mash potatoes are so gross...it had carrots and apples inside...I felt like that was the fyre fest of mashed potatoes. Only good banchan they provided was the radish...and even that wasn't that great. The steam egg was so flat...and not tasty. They need to add more salt into it because it tasted bland. Only yummy side to order was the kimchi pancake and the kimchi fried rice was decent.Service was ok. But not great. The server showed up whenever he needed to, just to cook for us. We never had to lift a cooking utensil. But the server wasn't very personable. He also dropped off the check on our table even though we never asked for the check.There are much better Korean BBQ places around here. And this place is not it."
10/27/2014,5 star rating,"In my humble opinion, this is my favorite AYCE KBBQ place. Located in K-Town, so you know it's authentic. Great banchan and salad.Make sure you bring a Korean friend along! I think those that speak Korean get better service here. Yes, parking is horrible here. Valet parking in the lot. Attempt to find street parking but it is K-Town.Wait times get long so come early!"
12/8/2018,1 star rating,The way this business is operating is stupid and no respect is given to customers. Doesnt take reservations and make people wait by the door giving false promises for waiting time. Currently waiting a group of 8 people for more than 3 hours. Keep sitting people from same orientation and not giving a damn about other customers. What a waste of time
6/30/2020,5 star rating,"Definitely the Korean place that you have to visit in LA. Everything is perfect. I highly recommend the pork shoulder. The employee there is super nice. He did everything for us and all we had to do was eating, which is kinda astonishing since we had to do everything in Seattle. To me, this place is the best Korean restaurant not only in LA but also in America."
2/3/2017,4 star rating,This place can get really packed. The wait can go from 30 minutes to an hour? I would perhaps go earlier and wait for a table.We had a party of 8 but ended up splitting up into two smaller parties since it was faster that way to get seated. Wow this place is just amazing I've been to a lot do Korean BBQ places before but this is by far the best service everywhere. Steve our waiter was talkative and cooked for us a majority of the time. The only time I cooked was to flip the meat. The quality is pretty good I'm sad they don't have large intestine here but I like the the grill is a stone grill instead of the other grill.The grill opens up and the oil would drain out. Would definitely come here again.**Parking isn't too great here but they have valet than again your in K-town**
7/14/2017,5 star rating,"So many choices for their AYCE menu. Â Staff is quick and friendly and the stone grill heats the meat super fast. Â Banchan is also really good.They usually don't seat your party unless everyone is there, so plan accordingly and don't let those slackers in your group slack!Parking is tricky, but they do offer a $2 valet."
6/11/2017,5 star rating,"This is my FAVORITE KBBQ spot I've been to EVER. And trust me, I've been to A LOT of them.The wait here is ridiculous, why? Because the food is that good. You need to come here on a slow night during the week and after the dinner rush if you don't want to wait.The meat options are awesome, it's all you can eat and man I try and eat all. The sides are delicious and plentiful. I can get full just off of the sides. The service is wonderful although sometimes the staff touches the meat too much. Lol I'm a control freak and I like to have control over the grill lol. I like to get the grill steaming hot and then put the meat on there and let it get a really good sear on my meats before flipping it over. It just seals in the favor more and you can get that delicious char taste.KBBQ hack, I get a separate bowl of kimchi that I can marinate some brisket in. Delicious outcome trust."
4/29/2019,5 star rating,"HJC is a staple in our household and has been approved by my Korean in-laws. The meat is good and the service efficient. HJC is usually packed, loud and smokey, so don't go there expecting romance or a civilized discourse. This one is a loud and fun affair."
12/18/2014,4 star rating,"We went for All You Can Eat Korean BBQ for only $19.99 for lunch! (For dinner it's $21.99)I was looking at the menu prices for individual dishes, the AYCE is a really good deal. Â And for around $20, that's an amazing deal. Â They advertise $22 for 22 items (so I'm assuming this is dinner). Â They do not count ban chan as an item. Â So the selection is pretty wide.The customer service was fantastic. Â I also liked that the wait staff brought your meat out and helped you grill it. Â They get the grilling started for you, which I thought was quite nice and helpful.I figured that I'd skip carbs this meal and tried an order of each of the following meats from the ACYE menu: Â Beef Brisket, Pork Belly (thin), kalbi, pork shoulder, bulgogiAll the meats were very fresh tasting. Â Their kalbi and bulgogi was marinated well. The other meats had no marinade at all. Â I wish they had salt and pepper on the tables instead of having to ask. Â But no biggie, since they supplied about four different sauces and what I think was miso, so there was zero blandness.I have to say that the pork shoulder was amazing. Â It's not something that I'd normally order, but we decided to try it. Â I will definitely be ordering that again, it was really fresh and grilled up perfectly. Â The coolest thing at this place is the grill setup. It's slanted to the side and has a hole for grease/cooking liquid drainage. Â I was really impressed that the design took into consideration drainage! Â The waitress we had cleaned it for us with what look like grated radish (again, another thing new to me) and wow, it worked amazingly!I also didn't smell like Korean BBQ (probably because there weren't too many people in the restaurant, I went after lunch rush per usual), or at least I didn't notice it. Â And I'm one of those people that will dress in crappy clothes because I know they'll reek after.Yes, I definitely like this place and will come back. Â There are a lot more of the ""22 items"" that I did not try. Â Their portions of meat are pretty big, so even with two people eating just meat, we only got through five different meats. Â Though we got two orders of kalbi."
7/12/2019,5 star rating,The bruce is almost $30 but the quality is well worth the price I would definetly spend more to come here
4/28/2019,4 star rating,"The meat is good. And there are many many meat choices to choose from. But the 'panchan' was just 'ok.'The service was 'ok,' but I thought it could have been better especially considering our family arrived for lunch @1130, it was a Tuesday, and the restaurant is small. FYI, it was good we arrived at this time because at noon there was a line of folks waiting to be seated.Considering the price of Korean BBQ at non-AYCE restaurants, this is a great deal!"

Highly recommend reservations."
9/20/2014,1 star rating,"I've never hated a kbbq place as much as this location. The pork belly Â had bones. I chipped my tooth. Â My friend did as well. Â Not a lot of meat selection, Â waiters were whatever, Â they don't excuse themselves when going to cut the meat, elbows in my face. Overall Im pretty upset with this location, and I never write bad reviews but this place deserved it.Not to mention the bathroom smells and was soo disgusting."

10/29/2016,1 star rating,"I have no idea why they got 4 stars from yelp. Bad service here and food are not good. I prefer to go other kbbq restaurants in ktown, but not this restaurant anymore...."
11/20/2016,5 star rating,"This isn't my favorite spot for KBBQ but for what it is...$25 AYCE they deserve a 5 star. You can't beat the price and the food is pretty good for the variety of the unlimited portions. The banchan is pretty solid...just like how my mama makes it..not too sweet just right. They had kimchi, radish, potato salad, fish cake, spinach. There's not much meat variety to choose from...but those few meats they do have it ain't bad at all!! My favorite is the thin slices pork belly. I'm not really a fan of the thick cut, and there's only a handful that do the thin slices! Comes out very crispy! You can order up to 3 meats at a time but there's no maximum for al the other stuff (kimchi chigae, bean paste ""miso"" soup, kimchi pancake, steamed egg, etc.). I like how they have radish, rice paper, salad, mushroom, and onions. You can also get intestine, shrimp, and octopus along with the meat selection. Sorry I don't remember the menu off the top of my head! Anyways, we added the spicy beef BBQ to the kimchi fried rice..it added a nice greasy, hearty flavor and I highly recommend it!! Hour and half wait when we arrived Saturday around 6:00 pm. Go to the bar two doors down and grab a beer while you wait! I probably wouldn't come back here again, since the wait was to crazy and there's so many other places around Ktown, but I'm glad I got to try it out. -Favorites: banchan, kimchi pancake, thin pork belly, kimchi fried rice with spicy BBQ beef, marinated galbi -Skip: ""miso soup"" and steamed egg -Servers are super nice too and fast!! -Valet parking is $2"
6/12/2019,4 star rating,"Probably one of the best KBBQ in the area with good price and good quality of meat. Due to their busy business, you kinda feel getting rushed by the waiter to serve you more meet and fast fill your stomach. And they could get the new customer in. For that I give a 4 star."
2/17/2018,4 star rating,It is a good place for meat lover If you have good appetite you need to come here they have live barbecue on every table all you can eat for sides they give mashed potatoes kimchi hot sauce rice paper for drinks Korean beer and soda We went there on valentines night waited 45min may be regular days are less Over all good place.
12/25/2014,4 star rating,"I honestly can say this is one of the best all you can eat restaurant. We ended up coming here for Christmas Eve dinner and the restaurant was busy. I had to write my name on a list but only had to wait 10 minutes for a table. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive.Pretty much the food was delicious. My friend thought this was the best Korean BBQ she had in a long time. Pretty much try everything on the list. The brisket is to die for it melts in your mouth. By the time we left the restaurant, there is a line of people waiting to eat. Definitely check this place out if you're near Koreatown!"

1/20/2018,4 star rating,"1.5hr wait on a Saturday night. We knew we wanted Korean BBQ so did a Yelp search in LA area and this place had the most reviews of over 3.3k. And no wonder! It was goooood!! It was worth the wait and ppl raving about it. Tried several Korean BBQ in koreatown area and we all agreed, we had the best meal here. First of all, service was nice. There were 3 servers attentive to our table. The meat was brought on quickly, in good portions too, one of whom seemed like a manager. They cooked for us, and made sure we had what we needed. Valet parking only for $2. Unlike the other AYCE Korean BBQ place, as we ordered more meat, the portions got larger. Definitely a return!"
1/20/2018,5 star rating,"Come here and come early. Best advice is to beat the crowd, sit down, and enjoy your all you can eat experience. They give great service here for an all you can eat. The selection and quality of meat is one of the best I've found, especially in a place where korean bbq is plentiful. Will be back for more."
1/19/2018,5 star rating,This was only my 3rd Korean BBQ experience. I have to say the food was excellent! Our server was excellent; very kind and hardworking. The spicy meats were really spicy for me and our server beforehand offered us a half portion in case we couldn't handle the spicyness. It was a Saturday night when we went so we did wait 2 hours outside with a heater but it was well worth the wait. I will definitely be going back after my next Universal Studios trip.
1/19/2018,5 star rating,The quality of food is great and I like the side dishes a lot (shout out to the potato salad with apples in it) - the price is reasonable but the wait kills us every time - almost always an hour wait- you can only make a reservation for parties larger than 6 and even when you do you still have to wait 30 min to an hour - the food is great but there are other really great KBBQ places with shorter wait times (we've eaten here a dozen times though)
1/18/2018,5 star rating,"Being a Bay Area native with only Gens KBBQ to compare, I visited LA with very high expectations of Koreatown and wow did they BRING IT! Hae Jang Chon is the BEST KBBQ I've had and it thoroughly exceeded all of my expectations.We were seated almost immediately since we lined up 10 minutes before opening. Thankfully we read the reviews before coming because once we were inside, the line was already forming. There is $2 valet parking in front, but if you're lucky there should be free street parking in the residential area.Upon sitting, you are welcomed by a beautiful setup with a reusable marble grill as its centerpiece. This is very different from Gens with their replaceable stainless steel grills. Now for the MEAT! Our favorites were hands down the brisket and the marinated short ribs. OMG the quality of the meat and the flavor of the marinade was BOMB! Don't get me wrong, the bulgogi, beef tongue, pork shoulder, and pork belly were great, but the brisket and short ribs were DELICIOUS! And the banchan is abundant and realllllly tasty.The service here is better than I've ever had at any KBBQ spot. The servers actually walk around and help cook and cut the food while we stuffed our faces. On top of that, they even clean the grill with shredded daikon so the grill stays hot! Sooo cooool! The cherry on top is literally at the end of the meal. Once the last order of meat arrives they will cook KIMCHI FRIED RICE! YASSS! Mix all the remaining yummy meat in the rice and you'll know that this place is king. SAVE ROOM for this because it is STRAIGHT FIRE!I love this place and I can't wait to come back. At $23.99 it's really tough to beat AYCE KBBQ that is this awesome with service like this. I highly recommend this to everyone and I can't wait to come back with more friends."
7/23/2014,4 star rating,"One of the better AYCE BBQ places in Koreatown. I ate here with a bunch of friends during a 3-day food trip around SoCal. I appreciate the fact that they're open till 2 a.m. Quite a heavy grub for a late-night spot. Delicious meats!The short ribs, brisket, and bulgogi were my favorites. Each of them, along with all the other meats and seafood offered, were nicely marinated and seasoned; the cut was quality, too. Their huge circular stone grills weren't the most comfortable in terms of cooking the meat and sharing the food. It was protruding high in the middle of the table, leaving very limited room for the side dishes (banchan) to be distributed around it. I prefer the flat built-in rectangular grills many other Korean BBQ restaurants have; they're much more efficient. Their side dishes aren't as plentiful as other places, but they're still very delicious. All for $18/person -- not a bad deal at all. The service could be more attentive, but other than that, I enjoyed every other thing this AYCE had to offer. Count me as a fan :)"

My best recommended ones are - marinated beef rib and spicy marinated pork. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to taste the best of barbecues Korean style."
6/22/2015,3 star rating,"Six years later, it's time for an update. Â The wait to get in for dinner is long. Â Expect 1.5 hours at the very least (at least on a Friday night). Â And they don't make it very easy for you since they won't take your number and call you when your order is ready. Â They won't even let you go to the bar next door while you're waiting. Â So they expect (and clearly people do this) for their customers to just patiently wait for multiple hours just to get in. Â Unfortunately, the food is definitely worth it. Â The meat is delicious and well-marinated. Â The servers are fast in bringing more food and will usually make it for you, so you don't even have to cook. Â The side dishes are plentiful and the staff is very good about giving extras whenever you ask for it. Â Unless you're ready to be rude, don't expect this to be a relaxing experience. Â The way they make sure to have high turnover is to continously ask you if you want more food as soon as you finish your current portion. Â So you can either keep eating (and eventually explode) or stop, and get the hint that you're no longer welcome. Â So the big question is are you will to sacrifice experience for incredible korean bbq? Â You decide."
5/17/2009,3 star rating,"This place is pretty good... but I still like Manna better. Â $16.99 for All You Can Eat Korean BBQ is a great price. Â The service was great. Great for this type of place. Â Meaning, they're not going to be too attentive, or too nice, or speak too much (if any) English. Â But here at least they bring stuff out pretty quickly and the refill water and sides as often as we wanted. Â So service, for a place like this, was great.The biggest thing I have a beef with (pun) is that they won't bring out their fried rice Â or soup until after you're completely stuffed full of meat. Â Why not bring it in the beginning, or in the middle? Â Why bring it when I can't stand to look at food anymore? Â Is it some type of torture technique? Â Well it worked, I ate after I was too full. Â Are you happy, Hae Jang Chon???"
1/3/2018,5 star rating,"First, come here away from peak hours. The service will be much better and you will want to come here hungry because there is a massive amount of food to be had. Massive delicious food to be had. All you can eat in portions of three meats. You will not waste any of it. Wait for rice at the end.The only issue is the language barrier, but that is completely beatable. Our deal was asking if the shrimp had feet/poop vein. The server said no, the shrimp had them. No big deal in the end."
12/27/2018,4 star rating,"Pretty good AYCE bbq! The quality of meat and side dishes were good. But, the wait was insane and the inside of the restaurant did not have good ventilation so I went home smelling like meat. Servers were attentive but I felt rushed throughout my meal."
5/31/2017,4 star rating,"There's always a wait when you go so prepare yourself. I went twice in the same week on two separate occasions. The short ribs are definitely my favorite, but they do a good job with all the classic beef orders. The service is not the fastest, but they will get around to you. Overall, a positive experience and fun to go with a group around 4-6."
11/16/2014,4 star rating,"This is either #1 or #2 on my BEST KBBQ OF KOREATOWN list. I seriously love this place and cannot get enough. The only reason I don't frequent this place as much as I want is because they often increase their prices. Currently it is $19.99 for lunch on weekdays, and $21.99 for Holidays, all day weekends, and weeknights. It used to be $16.99 when I first came here. Let me just wipe a tear from my wallet...Though even for the price, I highly recommend this place because the quality of their meats and their selection of meats is one of the best in Los Angeles, if not the best. We love getting their beef brisket, beef tongue, squid, shrimp, and other menus. The meat was often less fatty than other places, with the brisket and beef tongue being one of the highest qualities and reasons why we love to come back. Their bulgogi is also very good, even though I'm not a big fan of it usually, their marinate is not overbearing. At the end of your meal, they will make their kim chi fried rice, and I just absolutely love it. It has so much flavor. So save some room at the end!The grills are actually stove top and they clean it with radishes, which is actually super cool! This place definitely has a wait. Since the restaurant itself is quite small, the attention to detail and service is actually very good. I've never felt disrespected and always welcomed. The decor is like ""autumn"", and is super nice and bright inside.However during my last visit (November 18, 2014) the waiter who was cleaning the grill accidentally splashed my chest and my friend's arm with oil. He seemed very unapologetic and didn't make eye contact or stop cleaning to apologize; he just kept cleaning and then immediately left. I was unhappy with his service, but besides that the waitress who helped us was very nice. I definitely recommend coming here, even if there is a wait, it is worth it.[Edit made November 19th, 2014]"

I assumed this place would be good because it seems to always be popping with people but trust me when I say that this.. This place is not worth your time and money.My friends and I first asked for the wait time and they said 20-30 minutes but it took 1 hour and 30 minutes to seat us.Regrettably we decided to wait and we finally got seated, and the service was so so so bad.. They never came every time we used the bell to call them over (and my friend eventually got a little trigger happy using the bell about 20 times out of frustration) but when we eventually got their attention the request we made (like water, sauce, MEAT) they didn't bring it out till the 2nd or 3rd time asking.The food wasn't cooking properly due to the stone plate they use and it literally took us 5 minutes to cook one set of meat. Lastly, they gave us our checks without even requesting it, and they came literally 7 TIMES within a span of 10 minutes to get our checks. Overall, they're inconsiderate liars who don't know the meaning of service and rude (af).Trust me people, there are so many Korean bbq joints in koreatown that are much better than this. I'm never coming back and definitely not recommending this to all my friends. Watch this business plummet if it continues like this."
12/20/2018,5 star rating,I will definitely be back. Â I went here with my coworkers and the food was amazing. Â This was my second time trying Korean BBQ. Â The dipping sauces are mouth watering and the food cook so well on the stone oven. Â Overall Yummmmy
1/10/2019,5 star rating,"Best KBBQ experience I've ever had. I was blown away by the service, as everyone we encountered was super helpful and friendly. The price was more than reasonable for such a delicious and copious meal. I love how we never had to ask for refills for meat and bonchon, and the staff cooked the meat for us! I wish we had a place like this in Seattle. Can't wait to go back!"
10/14/2018,1 star rating,"Waited two hours for a table, but more disappointed the staff were so rude while we were checking out place in line. Food quality was worth the price. Sidedishes was decent. Wish there was more water service. Our rice never arrived."
4/2/2016,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is my go to KBBQ spot whenever I'm in SoCal. Lunch is around $21.99, while the dinner weekend price is $23.99. Everything is at the highest quality from the banchan (side dishes like kim-chi fish cake and potato) to the thin sliced pork belly and marinated short rib (my faves!). What really sets this place apart from the rest is the stone top grills that they use which is easy to cook and clean. Most places use steel grills to cook, which chars way too fast, resulting in frequent grill changes. Hae Jong Chan will always be at the top of my priority list when in LA!"

9/22/2014,5 star rating,"This is my second time coming here and I love this place! They have such great options ranging from seafood to pork and beef! They also have such great varieties of dipping sauces for your meat! The servers also cook the meat for you so you you'llknow when it's perfectly done'So if you need somewhere cheap andgood...this is them place to come! Total for two people was only $75 dollars including two all you can eats, two beers, and one soju."
5/9/2019,1 star rating,"Worst seating experience ever and worst restaurant I went to in Los Angeles.Four of us has to be here and can't leave while waiting. Plus, we can only wait outside in chilly wind.It's our first time here and we waited for about an hour and saw larger group of people behind us going in just because the waitress forgot to tell me that we have to inform her when everyone is here (She didn't apologize and refused to admit it's her mistake either). They even do the stupid head count here. Here I am, starving, still waiting to be seated."
9/10/2017,4 star rating,AYCE kbbq. Quality is good. Service is good. Note: Long wait during peak hours. Can't sit unless your entire party is there. Valet is $2 in the lot there I think.
11/12/2012,4 star rating,"The price was a bit higher than I would have liked for Korean BBQ place.. The meal was delicious, and I liked that staff members came over every few minutes to help you cook (whether you like it or not). I was not as impressed with the bulgogi pork. They brought it over wrapped in foil so we weren't too sure what to do with it for a while haha. I also loved watching them clean the grill with the radish. My favorite thing about the dining experience was when they made kimchi fried rice at the end! yum!"
10/15/2009,4 star rating,"AYCE Korean bbq, $16.99 a head, how can you go wrong? Located in a plaza where parking out front is valet only. If you can find street parking (meters), go for it but read the signs carefully as I always heed this warning. From my opinion, what differentiates this place from other AYCE Korean bbq joints is the grill. It's a special type of cooking grill which is more like a black stone grill. It's slightly tilted so the oil and fat runs out a hole on the edge. Instead of them changing out the grill constantly, they will just come over and scrape it down. After that, it will be like Star Wars IV, A New Hope.The ban chans here are very limited. They cook the kimchi and bean sprouts on your grill on the side. Of course you have the option to not cook it and just eat as it comes out. There were only about 4-5 max other side dishes. I guess it's better because now instead of getting full off the side dishes, you'll have more room for what you originally came for which is the meat. Don't forget the Korean pancake as well.We tried three items off the menu that was marinated: the kalbi, the bul go gi, and the squid. All three were marinated in the same style sauce. To me, it was a bit on the sweeter side. I prefer the non marinated meat: the honey pork belly (thin) was the best here. It was just out right perfect. Their chadol baege and beef tongue was pretty legit as well. Perhaps next time I will just stick to those items where I dictate the taste of my own food.Save some room for some kimchi fried rice at the end. I think you have to request it. It's free but only comes out if you ask for it. When you're done with your meat, just ask your server for it. They will come out and clean your grill then cook the kimchi fried rice right on your grill in front of you. They also brought out the soy bean tofu soup. Man, I felt like Jabba the Hut after eating all that.The service was surprisingly prompt and helpful. One lady stood out, she was an older lady and she took the best care of us. She definitely deserves recognition. Overall, we didn't have any issues with the service because they were on cue. Kudos to them for breaking the non-Korean patron service stereotype.In conclusion, I'm going to add this AYCE restaurant to my list of Korean bbq arsenal. Did I mention they close at 2am? Crazy. The force is strong with this one."
3/25/2012,4 star rating,"What is abomasum?!-----------------------------So we were debating between a korean fried chicken afternoon (think Bon chon chicken) vs. AYCE. I know, what a random choice. Anyway, thanks to Yelp, we ended up here. Here's the lowdown, and why it earned only 3.5 stars:$2 for private lot ""valet"" parking - why on earth am I paying you to pull into a parking spot that I can do myself, especially since you don't double park?AYCE for $17.99/person, 2 person minimum. A bottle of OB beer costs $6.50 - a bit on the pricey side. Menu is expansive (see below), which is a definite plus:Black angus beef brisket Marinated beef short rib BulgogiCanadian fresh pork belly Pork shoulderBeef tongueBBQ pork BBQ chickenBBQ squidBeef abomasum Beef honeycomb In addition, it comes with: kimchi pancakeSteamed eggKimchi Fried riceAlthough most of the meal was a hit (including the bean paste dipping sauce), the abomasum and honeycomb were definite misses. In particular, the honeycomb sounded good, but tasted awful - it takes a certain diligence to fully clean the honeycomb and get rid of the stink, which didn't happen here. Â Also, the BBQ Pork was overly mushy, with a heavy emphasis on the paprika - not a fan. Also, the ice water comes from an open air bucket, next to the kitchen. Why??Oh well, 85% of the meal was pretty tasty, so definitely 3.5 stars. The only regret is that we couldn't even last to the kimchi fried rice (which other Yelpers have raved about)"
12/27/2017,4 star rating,"Almost everything about this place was fantastic. Great selection and quality of meat, delicious banchan, and super-attentive waiter. What I didn't like was that they wouldn't seat my three friends and me (so that's 4 people just having to stand by the door) until our last friend showed up. You would think that if 4 out of 5 showed up then we would definitely be ordering food (a lot of it) and wouldn't be a 'waste of space'. There were plenty of empty tables as well when we were waiting. I do recommend this place though. If you're going w/ a group of people, just make sure everyone gets there on time so you don't have to just hang out by the door while everyone else gets seated before you despite how long you've been waiting."
10/8/2018,5 star rating,"Bomb aF!! So good and yummy only bad thing is the wait, they won't let you sit unless everyone is present. And you can't make a reservation. Usually about a 2 hour wait on busy Friday and Saturday nights! Besides that the sides are amazing and the meats are always fresh !"
6/3/2014,5 star rating,"Due to the extremely long wait time, a friend and I decided to wander into the bar next door. We were there for about an hour with a pitcher of beer and shortly after I started to think about my ex. I knew I was drunk at that point and before I could drunk text him, my phone died... Saved!At that point we decided go check out how far along we were in line. We still had 30 minutes left to kill. We decided to walk around aimlessly for those 30 something minutes until we were called. We were so hungry we started to look for other places to go. 30 minutes seemed like 30 years. My belly was growling. ""I wants food!"" I swear it said that...Perhaps my belly was too loud because we were approached by some random Korean guy. He asked my friend and I where we were going. I told him we were waiting to get some KBBQ at Hae Jong Chon. Then I asked if there was any place he would recommend because I could not wait any longer and that's when my belly said, ""FEED ME!""He said Hae Jong Chon was probably one of the best KBBQ places in K-Town. ""Well worth the wait."" Of course I hesitated. How good can it possibly be? ....It was amazing! He was right! It was well worth the hour and a half wait. They had everything you could possibly dream of! They had 3 kinds of sauces and they were all sooooo tasty. They had a large variety of side dishes and all were fantastic. The meat was delicious, the kimchi pancake was delicious, even the water was delicious!I still think of this place every now and then. It's actually a common topic of conversation for me. If I ever find myself anywhere near this place again, I will most definitely drop by. I just wish it was closer, but at the same time I'm glad it's not. I'd probably gain 100 pounds."
4/15/2017,4 star rating,"Super crowded place. Â Get there early if you have a small party. Â If you have a large group, reserve a table. Â There had to have been 20+ people waiting outside at 6pm and more at 8pm when we left on a Sunday night. Â Good quality AYCE Korean BBQ here. Â The bulgogi and short ribs (boneless!) were particularly good as were the octopus and squid. Â Banchan was limited in number, but good quality. Â What was unique here was how good the service was. Â The servers came over and cooked a number of items for us (which really helped with five kids in our party) and cleaned our grill multiple times! Â I have never seen this type of service in a place as reasonably priced as this one. Â Great job! Â Recommend this place for sure - just know how popular it is and plan ahead."
9/8/2017,3 star rating,I gave this place 3 stars because it was ok.I prefer a few of the other Ayce places. Didn't like how the meat was cooking on a stone grill instead of the other kind that allows my meat to get a char.What I can say that's good is that the quantity of banchan you get is definitely more than you can eat. The lettuce costs extra for some odd reason. Why call it ayce if you can get lettuce with that. So I guess it's ayce for meat?Parking: there is a lot but its valet.
2/20/2020,3 star rating,"I mean, for a KBBQ, it was mediocre at best. When I go to KBBQ, I like and expect autonomy, like dude, can I cook my own food please? The round block you cook on doesn't get hot enough so In essence you're eating warmed/boiled meat with hardly any char on it. And by the time you do manage to get some char, the meat is dried out already. Some people might like others cooking their food for them but I like doing it on my own, that's the whole point of the KBBQ experience imo. The servers kept moving the tongs and scissors away from me for ""their convenience"" which I found very annoying. First of all, they didn't wait for the grill to heat up properly before dumping everything down in a clump in the middle of the grill and let it simmer til cooked. I would spread the meat out and they'll come by and clump it back in the middle. I told them I wanted to cook my own food but the guy insisted on doing it for me. Definitely would not come back here. I should have gone back to Brother's instead of trying this place."
3/27/2011,4 star rating,"The Good: Super friendly staff. I feel like they do half of the cooking for you which is nice. They serve some of THE BEST MEAT I've personally had in Korean BBQ. Their sirloin was thick and juicy, the beef tongue was meaty and flavorful, the pork belly was savory and to die for. I could eat their brisket all day and the bulgogi was marinated very well. The salad was fresh and I like their dressing. They make you kimchi fried rice at the end was nice, but I was so full from the meat.The Bad: Lacking in side dishes, but it makes you focus on the meat. The side dishes present were good, but not great. Questionable bathroom cleanliness.The Ugly: A full 2 hour wait for 6 people on a Thursday night. I suppose I can blame spring break?The Verdict: In terms of meat, this place probably has the best Korean BBQ I've had while living in Southern California. Their wonderful service is a fantastic plus. At $16.99 a person you really can't go wrong. Unless you show up late."
4/11/2017,5 star rating,"This is one of the few KBBQ places that has good service! The server, Shawn, returned every so often to check on us and our meat and helped us to cook as well as place new meat on the grill. He promptly brought back the side dishes and rice paper we kept ordering too. The meat itself tastes like normal KBBQ meat, what was special was the Kimchi pancake and fried rice! That was so amazing, I can't wait to go again! The steamed egg was not the best, don't get it."
10/7/2014,5 star rating,"This is no $10 AYCE Kbarbs here. Â  The minimum AYCE is like $16.99, I don't really remember, it's somewhere around there. Â  But it's sooo worth it!I've been to many AYCE kbarbs places,...but this is what made me really crave for it after... Â  I never eat pork, but my friend swears by their spicy pork.... it's actually spicy and not too sweet. Â  AND I AM hooked.The service is pretty good, but the wait can suck! Â  Good luck finding parking on the street, if worse comes to worse, there is valet for $2."
4/14/2019,4 star rating,"YUMMY, great service, and you don't leave reeking like bbq!! Highly recommend."
12/25/2016,5 star rating,"Now I understand why this restaurant has 3k+ reviews. $23.99 dinner prices for AYCE, 27 items. They take orders of 3 items at a time so our table just kept ordering brisket, beef tongue, and kalbi. The meat quality didn't decline with each order (as I noticed some ayce places use as a tactic to make you order less meat). Using a stone grill instead of metal grill make the experience and food much better. And there was no need to change itMy favorite part of the meal was the fried rice happy ending. So much flavor, and it was even better since they mixed our leftover bulgogi in it. Definitely save room for that at the end"
2/13/2017,2 star rating,"Great food, and we had a great server.Sadly, the service for getting a table was awful. We were told a 45 minute wait, which turned into TWO hours. Wish we were told TWO hours so we could've gone somewhere else. As angry as my friends were, we tried asking if we can get comp, like free drinks or discounts. We got nothing for it, they kept saying ""this is the biggest table we have"" and kept dodging the question.My advice is, go in groups of 2-4, or make reservations for group of 8. Groups of 2-4 magically kept getting in front of us. Anything in between, and you get shafted. Many parties that night waited a long, long time."
2/9/2018,5 star rating,"I'm literally writing this review at the table after finishing up! Second time eating here. It's the best! I'm from Minnesota, and don't get to eat good KBBQ often. Whenever I get the chance to come to LA, this is where I'll go for KBBQ! The staff are so quick and friendly. The service is pretty good! Food comes out pretty quick for All You Can Eat.Thumbs up from me!"
5/22/2014,5 star rating,"Came here for a casual night out on a semi busy Wednesday night. We waited about 45 minutes (still longer than expected). Once we got seated, the table was already set with little side dishes, salad and some sort of dipping sauce. Dear yelpers, there're too many items on the menu to choose from like others have already said. I believe we had pork belly* both thin and thick cut, brisket*, marinated short rip* and bulgogi. I love the quality of the meat very much. Bulgogi* was bomb dot com of the night. It's so juicy, sweet and tender. Or maybe it's our server, lol. I would love to come back just for that. Speaking of something beside red meat, kimchi pancake* was decent. I'd rather save room for something else more tasty. Oh! Our server, Tiger, was so friendly and attentive. Gotta give him credit here. We didn't have to press the 'magic button' Â the whole time! Weather we wanted spoons, another beer or more meat, he's always around making sure you're having a good time. Highly recommended Hae Jang Chon over many overrated places in the same area. *valet $2 or use your charms for metered parking"
5/1/2016,2 star rating,"Atmosphere: smaller KBBQ location, inside a Korean strip mallOrdered times: thin sliced pork, brisket, spicy bbq steak, short ribs, miso soup, strip and fried rice.I don't understand how this location has great reviews. This place is one of MANY in Korea town we were on our way home and opt to try this one, we were sat promptly witch was ONE pro, but from there in out were treated extremely rude. We were sitting for about 15 minutes before someone helped us, after we pressed the service button and flagged the staff down. Once we received our first round of meat I went place it on the grill and one of the ladies that worked there came up to me and grabbed the thongs out of my hands and started to throw all the meat on the grill then put the thongs away and turns the grill off and walked away. Sooooo I grabbed our thongs and rearranged everything and put the grill back on and continued to cook our order. Once we were ready to order more we told the same lady and she took out order then turned off the grill again, so once our second round came out the grill was cold and she had to relight it and we had to wait until it got hot again, then this was a repeat of her fighting with me to place the meat on the grill, and Turing down the heat, so I told her we don't want the heat turned down and to please stop throwing things on the grill when she pleases. Again we finished that round and would of liked to order more so we got this guys attention, again so was horrible. I asked him if we can order and he just stared at me, so I said may I? Then he said ""What do you want!!"" Yelling at us, I ordered and he repeated it back and got it incorrect so I repeated our order once more and he said that he said that and I said no you didn't, then before he walked away he walked over and turned our grill off so I said please don't the he said our fan doesn't work so we have to. Again I let him take it off then once he walked away I turned that sucker back up. Unless you're Korean don't go to this location, they will treat you horrible. To be honest the food wasn't even that great as well. It was overly dry because of the grill it was was more like a stone skillet. We also ordered some fried rice, it was the oddest combination, it had kimchi, seaweed strips and other odd things inside that I couldn't put my finger on. And we weren't sure if it was done or not, just over all a really bad experience.55 of 100- Yelp challenge 2016"
2/16/2019,5 star rating,"This place is my favorite! Good quality customer service and everyone is welcomed! I always appreciate the hospitality and respect every time I go. Yes, it is well worth the wait. The food is clean and the stone is always hot, ready to grill! This place is very exceptional and I love it! I'd highly recommend this place for anybody's first time trying kbbq. -Aaron Osiel"
6/2/2017,4 star rating,Great choices of meats!Their galbi is pretty good for not being cooked on charcoal fire. Samgyubsal is good and their nakji is good too.
3/20/2017,5 star rating,"One of the spot you have to visit if you go to k-town! Came in and got a seat pretty quick. Customer service was amazing, they told us how to order and everything. Came back pretty quickly when you needed something and food came quickly too. The meat quality was great"
2/20/2017,4 star rating,"So first things first. This place is REALLY POPULAR which means unless you arrived right when they open you will wait FOR A LONG TIME. So be prepared. The first time I went there with a party of 5 people we waited for close to two hours. We expected this to happen so we didn't mind. There are two benches outside for the people waiting. The other times, I went on a week end for lunch and got there right at opening time and was seated within 5 minutes. I believe you can make reservations for parties of 6 or more but you will not be seated until the entire party gets there. Despite all these logistic details let's talk about the FOOD. This bbq place uses a hot stone plate which at first made me skeptical because there is nothing like a grill to caramelize your brisket. But I have to admit the stone plate does do its trick and you still get deliciously cooked meat. Quality of meat is pretty good and the menu has different all you can eat combos. Banchan is always good. Don't forget to get the kimchi fried rice that is served at the end and mixed right on your hot plate! The place seats a lot of people so it can get noisy in there. If you love korean bbq, you just have to try this place. It's a must."
10/22/2014,3 star rating,"2k reviews and 4 stars must be good right?Sorry, Only half my reviews are KBBQ places. The only quality meat here was the Black Angus Brisket (they were honest about it on the menu)The short rib, was not tender at all very chewy and Â rough. You have to get the marinated one for it to be tender (No Duh because its been marinated in soy and sugar)I think Gen (specifically only the Tustin Location) beats out any competition with their quality in meat. Needless to say , im no longer curious about KBBQ out there since I know the best is Gen in Tustin. Useful NotesCame here monday for lunch, couldnt find parking, went around the block, parked in plazaNo difference between dinner or lunch menu, just price difference, lunch was 18.99 and dinner was like 22.99"
2/19/2015,4 star rating,"The Yelp reviews made me hype this place up to myself way too much.I came here for lunch on a Saturday and there was absolutely no wait.Pros:- The hot stone grill is pretty cool. When it gets too ""burnt"" the servers come and clean it with a mixture of radish. That way, they don't have to change the grills so often.- The galbi here is really good! I think if I were to come back here, I'd just order galbi all day.- I love how they use the stone grill to cook kimchi fried rice towards the end of the meal. Overall, though, it lacked a little bit of flavor. A pinch of salt might have helped.- The pancake is really good.Cons:- The rest of the meats were literally just okay.- The bean paste soup was just okay, too.- It's not so much that this place is bad, but that I've had better lolI rounded the 3.5 stars to 4 just because of the galbi :)"
2/29/2016,4 star rating,"One of the best KBBQ places I have ever tried!!I believe it's $22 for AYCE KBBQ, which is more expensive compared to other places in K-town (like Bud namu, which is $12 AYCE). But regardless of price, it is well worth it! You can select any meat on the AYCE menu, and my favorite is brisket and pork belly. And what's really nice is the waiters/waitresses cooking the meat for you. You get checked on quite frequently so they can help cook and rotate the kinds of you meat you ordered. The workers also come by with radish to help clean the stone plate! So you don't have to worry about getting burnt flakes on the meat!!! You have the choice of getting a bowl of white rice for your meal or you can choose waiting till the end of your meal to have freshly cooked kimchi fried rice on your own stone plate. My opinion? GET THE KIMCHI FRIED RICE. Hands down one of the best kimchi fried rice I have ever eaten in my life. You won't regret it. What I really enjoy the most about this place is that it is open till 2 AM. Great for people like me who get huge cravings late at night. But because it's open till really late, the wait for this place is reallllllly long. That is the only reason why I am rating 4 stars. I arrived at the restaurant at 10PM and didn't get seated until 11:20, although I was with a party of 8 (This place is best suited for parties of 6 and below). So you might have to be patient, but I promise it's worth it."
1/30/2018,5 star rating,I was overwhelmed with how many awesome things I got with the beef bulgogi. It was not expensive and yet it came with 10 bowls and plates of various side dishes. Most everything tasted really good.
1/30/2011,5 star rating,"Yeah, this place is totally legit. My first choice for AYCE Korean BBQ in LA and by the freaking long wait times during dinner, everyone else's too.Kimchi pancakes = awesome.Sauces = yum.Side dishes = love the potato salad with apple slices.Meats I usually get: Brisket, beef tongue, squid, marinated short rib, pork shoulder is awesome but make sure you know when it's fully cooked (friends of ours found this out the hard way)Service is consistently good but parking can be tricky. Valet is $2 so just fork it over because you're unlikely to find street parking. The best part about this place is how large their grills are and how fast the food cooks on it."
5/11/2011,4 star rating,"It's my first time having KBBQ in K-town. Â It's AYCE for $16.99 and you get to choose 19 different items to grill on a stone grill. Â I like the ambiance in the restaurant. Â BF and I came here with his friends for his belated birthday celebration. Â Thank goodness we came before the crowd around 6:30pm because by the time it was 7pm, there were a lot of people. Â There was a group of people who were at Price Is Right earlier the day and came here to celebrate a huge winning! Â They took up two big tables and were probably still there even after we left!We ordered Beef Brisket, Bulgogi, boness Kalbi, Pork Belly (Thick), Beef Tongue, Spicy Pork and Squid. Â We didn't like the Squid but pretty much everything else was very good. Â We were gonna try the hot dogs but it was just regular wieners and even the staff said he won't recommend it. Â The deal also comes with steamed egg/miso soup, kimchee pancake and Kimchi Fried Rice (We were too full and all ""meat"" out to have it, maybe next time!)One of my BF friends loves raw meat and couldn't help by taking a few piece off the grill as the staff were putting them on to grill. It was funny seeing the puzzled look on the staff! Â Another staff kept taking the tongs away from BF to cook the meat. It was cool to see how they clean the grill between serving of meat. Â They would put radish and just cook off all those charred residues. Â It's pretty cool!Service might be a little slow when it's crowded and the staff doesn't necessary remember what you asked for so you might have to keep reminding them. Â Overall, it's a cool place and I highly recommend this place!Parking isn't too great and it's valet parking just outside of the restaurant. Â I think it might be $2 to $3 so you might want to try to parking on the street for free parking then walk to the restaurant."
9/16/2016,3 star rating,"Table of 2, 5pm on a Saturday evening. Thought we would come early to avoid the long lines - we were WRONG! Even at 5pm there was about 5 tables ahead of us...and it took about 45 minutes before we were seated. Since all the tables are the same size, it doesnt matter if you come with 2 people, or a larger group. Â The table was already pre-set with the side dishes and sauces when we sat down (bonus points!) We made sure to ask for the kimchee pancake! Of course we ordered the AYCE, who doesnt?! We ordered bulgogi, marinated short rib (x2,) brisket (x2.) The servers constantly come around and ""help"" you cook aka cook faster so you can eat faster and GTFO. Like every KBBQ restaurant, they want to turn as many tables as they can. It's extremely annoying, because I want to freaking enjoy my meat sweats without someone standing over my shoulder! At the end, they come by and cook kimchee fried rice - and its delicious. So TRY to save room... or just overly stuff yourself and regret it later as you pop a pepcid AC. Will I come back? Probably... or I may just continue trying the millions of kbbq places within a 2 mile radius of this place."
12/29/2019,4 star rating,Definitely one of my favorite KBBQ spots in Ktown. They had great a variety of meat selections and they all tasted really good. This place can be very crowded and loud as well. I had to wait in line for about 30 minutes during the afternoon but the line got worse later on. Definitely worth waiting for really good kbbq. I would definitely come back again!
3/17/2014,1 star rating,"Two words: tummy trouble. After eating dinner here, I spent quite some time in the restroom. The one day I didn't have pepto with me womp womp..... ended up calling the night early for a birthday celebration, drowned myself in pepto for the night and loaded up in peppermint tea to sooth my tummy. Not a great way to end any night.As for the food: very average tasting (in the meat department). Nothing worth coming back for unfortunately. The brisket is WAYYYY too fatty. All the meats I tried didn't really have much flavor. From their chicken to their pork belly. One thing I did like that I hadn't had anywhere else was their kimchi pancake. That was tasty. At the end of the meal they will also make you some kimchi fried rice which is a must try if you have some room left after stuffing yourself all you can eat style.Service: Very friendly. They keep their cool well even when they are running around busy. I do wish they were a bit better at picking up the empty plates and empty bottles though. I was sitting against the wall and had a large collection of dirty, bloody plates and enough bottles of beer and soju to take to a recycling bin right after. *Do make reservations if you are planning on eating here. There seems to be a long wait no matter what time you come. If you make reservations, ensure that your whole party is there on time to be seated on time. Everyone must be there or you won't be seated.Parking: Good luck with that. We ended up having to valet. Once they brought our car around, which was during the dinner rush, they didn't even bother to let us know that our car was there. They practically left our car on and the door open for a good 5 min before I noticed that the car causing the traffic jam was mine. Valet should have mentioned or said something or I guess I should have been more alert. Over all, any place that gets me sick to my stomach unfortunately is not able to get a higher rating than a star. Won't be going back.#53/2014"
3/9/2016,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon uses large stone grills, which I'm a fan of. There's a little hole on it to let all the juices and fatty oils slide off the grill, so make sure you don't have any meat blocking it!AYCE for roughly $17, and their dwaenjang jjigae (soybean stew) is just too good. Everyone working here is friendly and efficient. I'll ask for everything and more but they're still patient with me.I also like that HJC has buttons their table so if you're really in dire need of say.. garlic... and you haven't seen anyone come by in a while (which is really rare for this place), you can buzz them over.Four stars because valet monopolized the parking lot. Apparently you can't park there even if you see an open space. How ridiculous! Even after you've parked, they'll chase you down for those two dollars.A big bonus is that this place is right next door to CottonHi and in the same plaza as Okrumong (bingsoo/shaved ice). IF you still have room for dessert after AYCE, that is :)"
6/15/2016,4 star rating,Came here for a friend's birthday yesterday. We had a party of 6 and made reservations but still waited 30 minutes for our table. This place is very popular. I would recommend calling ahead. I'm assuming the people without reservations waited a good 1-1.5 hours We are KKBQ regulars but the traditional stone grill was a new experience. The bulgogi and beef tong were excellent. But the service feel a little short when providing the sides. We had to ask for kimchi multiple times before we got it and never got salad. The prices are comparable to the other KBBQ joints in the area.
5/4/2017,4 star rating,"Let me preface my review by saying this is my first time having Korean BBQ, so Im in no way a Korean BBQ expertI must say, for my first experience, what a great one! We came here knowing there was going to be a wait. We came on Sunday at about 9pm, and STILL waited an hour. Service is fast. You sit down and they want you to know what you want already. Order bit by bit- they charge for leftover meat. We ordered about 6 meats, and finished everything and we are two people. Its decently portioned so you can easily try a few. Theres a bunch of small plates with kimchi, sauces, rice, etc at the table to use to have with your BBQ.For those that dont know, Korean BBQ is like hibachi minus the person. Theres a grill in front of you that they place the meat on and come over to flip every few minutes- or you can flip yourself. than you just scoop it off the grill nice and hot onto your plate. Theres $2 valet parking which was AWESOME! totally worth it.We actually tried o come friday night without knowing there was a valet, and we tried to find parking for about 40 minutes before giving up on koreatown all together. My advice- uber or valet."
10/3/2017,5 star rating,"I came here with my sister at a little past midnight and my first impression was how lively and clean this place is! It was unlike any other AYCE KBBQ place where they had a regular grill, instead they had a flat stone top which made cooking the bbq much easier. The price point for the AYCE is $25.99 which is a bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. You have an option of 27 different types of meat and the quality is up to par. The service that we received was amazing as well. Even though it was super late, the workers had a smile on their face and always kept checking up on us to make sure everything was going well. Overall, this is the best AYCE KBBQ that i've had. Also, its a perk that its open until 2am."
9/21/2014,5 star rating,"Parking is a pain unless you get here at 11 when they open. Just pay the valet. We had a group of six for AYCE $20 per person for lunch. Service was so attentive and they did most the cooking on the stone grill. After a few rounds of meat, they would come clean it. It was very different kbbq experience for us. Food was particularly good. The quality of meat overall was higher than most places. Our favorites: brisket, marinated short rib ( they came by and cut it into strips with scissors for us), thin pork belly. Only meats that didn't impress me was their bulgogi. It just cooked as a blob and the veggies as fillers didn't do it for me. It wasn't bad, it just didn't wow me like everything else. I had to try their bbq squid, really tasty but huge portion when I just wanted to try a little. Sides were the best I've had. Potato salad, kimchi, fish cake, veggies, and steamed egg. (Loved their barley iced tea as well. )Tip: You can have a bowl of rice or save it to have fried rice at the end. Kimchi fried was def unique and tasty but not everyone in our group could hang on the spiciness. Also by the end we were too full to enjoy it."
1/20/2017,4 star rating,One of the best AYCE KBBQ places I've been to. Â There were 4 of us and we had to wait around an hour for a table. Def worth the wait. The meat is fresh and marinated well. There are also a lot of options to choose from in terms of meats and for only $23.99 dinner. Parking can be a pain.
1/21/2015,5 star rating,Don't know what service is like when it's busier but my friend and I came in when it wasn't too busy.. so our service was really good!Food is bomb. Hands down best brisket I've ever tried. I will say that the pork belly was ok though. And they ask you if you want kimchi fried rice at the end. Hell yes.My friend and I stopped talking for 10 minutes and just ate. And ate. And ate.I would come back here in a heart beat if bikini season wasn't around the corner right now!
2/7/2020,5 star rating,"Amazing meat quality, but getting used to the commercial Korean barbecue the meat options is compact. Although the meat quality does not disappoint at all, probably the best I have tested ever. Environment is great and the cooking pan is amazing, they use a rock based pan similar to a cast iron skillet. For people that have never experienced Korean barbecue before Hae Jang Chon is a great start, because they help you cook the meat..... Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Cactus Jack FAM"
2/26/2014,5 star rating,"So far this is the best Korean BBQ I've tried in town. Unlike other Korean BBQs, this one can actually be called a restaurant. Very clean, with a nice modern design and valet outside. At first we didn't even realize how lucky we were to get here before the ""rush hour"" and be seated right away. By 6pm the place got absolutely packed and by the time we were leaving, we've witnessed probably the longest line of our lives.Couple of words about the food: fresh, delicious marinades, not overpowering the taste of meat, the squid is a must. Leave some space for the fried rice, it's amazing but they bring it last when you usually have no more room left."
7/19/2016,3 star rating,"I give this place a solid 3 stars. The meat is average and sometimes the service is a hit or miss. Usually only have to wait about 5-10 minutes. There's this lady who looks like she literally hates my boyfriend and always dogs him. He always points it out its so funny. Sometimes I can tell they get mad a little when we cook the meat ourselves... Are we doing it wrong? The last time we came we were put in the corner and took forever for our meats to come out. The table next to us ordered after us but their plates kept coming out so fast... We were dying over here. Overall this place is our go to when our other place closes. Meat here is okay, nothing bad. Favorite is brisket and beef tongue! Oh and the intestines as well. The ribs are okay to me, but my boyfriends a fan."
9/25/2016,5 star rating,"Hands down the BEST kbbq restaurant. Thinking about coming here literally makes me wanna drool. Most recently, I came on a Friday night at 7:00pm. I was quoted an hour and a half wait but only had to wait an hour! I was honestly surprised because I know the wait can be up to 2+ hours. Parking here is pretty frustrating, but valet is only $2!All the meats here are soooo delicious. Everything is high quality and fresh. I've had the brisket, marinated short rib, beef tongue, bulgogi, and thinly sliced pork belly. Not a fan of thick sliced pork belly and I'm so so happy they have thinly sliced pork belly, which is amazing. Also pretty pleased about the unlimited yummy steamed egg, my favorite! Thought it was cool how they have the stone grills which they clean with daikon.Service here is on point. Never had to lay my hands on the tongs, as our server was always coming around to check on our meats and cooked our entire meal for us. Every staff member was very friendly and accommodating. I was amazed at how quick every request was fulfilled, never had to ask twice for anything.Lunch is $21.99 before 3pm on weekdays, and dinner is $23.99 after 3pm on weekdays and all day weekends. Well worth the wait and price."
12/28/2014,4 star rating,"Lots of variety in meats and such! The service was awesome, they'd come and help us cook and cut the meat so we don't over cook or burn the thing. And the flavor was on point! But the price was a little expensive.. But I mean with all the variety and service, I guess it was worth it!"
7/10/2014,4 star rating,"Pretty excited about this place. Not the best, but the service definitely made up for areas they lacked. Price was great 18.99 AYCE! Deal!We tried most of the meats including tongue and stomach, but my favorites are squid, kalbi and pork belly thick cuts! Omg the squid was so good! I couldn't stop eating it!! The flavor on the meats were amazing too. Reasons for my negative star...1. Wish Kalbi was the bones slices. They only use the meat parts.2. Kim Chi Fried Rice at the end was a pleasant ending but It wasn't as good as I expected it to be. We barely touched it actually. 3. They need better banchans. I'm used to having 10-15. They only provide 7 and one was potato apple salad (like picnic mayo style ??), and another was like a Chinese broccoli thing. I wanted my anchovies and cubed radishes!4. Parking sucks! (Not they're fault tho so doesn't affect rating). We sat there for 2.5 hours eating and eating. I enjoyed my time very much and was completely satisfied when I left."
7/12/2017,5 star rating,"They've got the AYCE trifecta: Quality food, good prices, great service. The latter being quite uncommon in my experiences in K-Town. It's also next door to some decent soft serve (Cottonhi), and boba (Mr. Boba) options. Service made all the difference tonight. Water refilled constantly, assistance with the cooking, and friendly demeanors all around. Never felt rushed, even took some great recommendations from the server. The stone grills added to the nice aesthetic in the restaurant. You don't have to worry about having an ugly metal grill removed. Wait times are long but it's not hard to see why. This place is among the best K-Town has to offer!"
9/22/2014,5 star rating,"I don't have much experience eating KBBQ, but OMG...this place was amazing. The servers were incredibly nice and check up on you quite often. They were so attentive and cleaned our stone plate very often. They helped cut and prepared a lot of the meat, so we didn't have to do much but flip the goodies. They also made sure we didn't burn the meat. And they went over a few times because my friends and I were not that alert. The beef were all suuuuper fresh. My personal favorite was the brisket. They also served seafood, and the squid was quite delicious and packed a great amount of flavor. The selection of meats was ENORMOUS!! About 21 items! I ate with four other people and it got quite expensive, but it was worth every penny. Also, the kimchi is quite a must have! It is fresh but marinated enough to give punch!! Definitely one of the best kimchi I've had!The line is quite long. We personally waited for 30 or more minutes. But it is awesome for opening until 2 AM. Hae Jang Chon do not do reservations, and has a first come first serve basis. They do not have a beeper, so if you miss your spot be prepared for it to be taken.  As for parking, you would have the pay the valet. If I ever visit LA again, I would definitely visit this place again."
8/14/2011,4 star rating,"4 for the food but 3.5 mark down for the service.Friend picked the location wanting to try AYCE KBBQ for the first time.. Â so I walked in here with little to no expectations. Â We were in the areas and hey~ it's ktown.. how bad can it be? Â Ktown is supposed to be the mother of all that is korean in socal~ I come from the suburban / OC side of korean folks~ AYCE KBBQ isn't foreign to my neighborhood.. in fact, there's plenty to go around from Cerritos to Garden Grove. Â Walking in~ I couldn't help but notice that .. there were little to no koreans in the joint. Â *red flag* Â I don't mean to be racist, but when it's ethnic food and your peoples aren't present in any form of representation.. something must be amiss.After dining there, I'm guessing it's one of two things. Â 1) the price is definitely higher than most places i've been to. Â $17 per person is a bit steep but on average for dinner ayce places in ktown. Â definitely believe there are others and better. Â 2) the service. Â if you're not korean, the joint will be a godsend since everyone seemed to speak english. Â but the service was bleh. Â they seemed super annoyed with anything that we asked for and almost as if we were the submissive parties intruding into their land of food. Â (they were snobby like basically)i will give them the four stars as far as the food .. food was definitely not bad. Â the meat was pretty decent. Â chadobegi (the brisket) was cut thick and everything tasted really yummy. Â the bbq squid was really yum too. Â had the galbi, chicken, squid, octopus, brisket, etc. and couldn't complain about any of the meats. Â the dduk (rice cake wrapper) was cut small so we had to keep asking for more. Â for a korean person, the banchan (side dishes) were not only small in number but not impressive at all. Â that's what would send me to another ayce kbbq place. Â you can probably find the same quality of meat but with much more for banchan and better service.they do use a stone plate (which I actually like better) and have kimchi and beansprouts to eat the meat with. but GAH. the service!they forgot to give us our dwenjanjigae. Â not that i would have eaten it (not a fan of the soup normally and i was so full already) but at least mark our bill down or have something compensate. Â they have no to-go anything so we couldn't even get it to go. Â when i mentioned it to them (this like after we get the bill) they just ask ""well do you want to eat it now?""... grumbles.Anyways.. I would say come for the meat and come hungry. Â It's definitely one of the better places for meat that I've been to. Â Don't expect to much from the side dishes and the service.I don't come around these parts often enough but i'm sure if you do your research, you can find better joints that this place. Â if you have to come here -- it's not bad and acceptable if anything."
11/30/2018,5 star rating,"The best kbbq place in LA. Hands down. Every bit worth the price and the wait time (for dinner on weekends can be up to a 2 hr wait). The stone grill makes for even cooking, the meat cooks so much faster too. You can get a reservation but only if you're a party of 6 or more. My favorite here is the thin pork belly and brisket. The quality is unreal. You honestly can't go wrong with this place, even their kimchi and their playlists are amazing. Do yourself a favor and treat your tastebuds. Â Pro tip: They make you fresh kimchi fried rice after your last meat order. I suggest ordering thin pork belly and saving the meat to eat with your rice, you can thank me later!"
5/15/2016,1 star rating,"Terrible customer service. Go somewhere else, not worth your money.We made a reservation for 6 and ended up with only 4. They told us to put our names on the waitlist to wait an hour ...."
3/9/2019,5 star rating,"Tacos? Pizza? Chinese? Not again! Looking for something a little different, then this is THE PLACE! Delicious, fresh, quality meats cooked right in front you. Located in the heart of K-town, the staff is friendly and very accommodating. If you don't mind the long wait(usually between 1-2 hours) then come on down. You will not be disappointed!"
2/6/2018,5 star rating,"the best kbbq place ive ever been to! everything was SO delicious; to try everything, ask for a half or quarter order so that you don't get charged for leaving extra food. even the panchan (side dishes) are incredible. i would normally say which meats to order, but honestly, everything was incredible. the spicy meat orders are actually quite spicy so if you're not good at handling spice like me, be careful! save room for the kimchi fried rice at the end! also, definitely go on a random weekday night around 6-7 to avoid crazy waiting times. ive gone before and left because of a 3 hour waiting time. valet is $2 so not too bad for ktown!"
12/23/2014,3 star rating,"$22 for AYCE on a Friday Night.Brisket has one of the best marble colors I've ever seen. Â Definite must. Â Short ribs are tender. Â Bulgolgi lacks flavor.Service is quick and responsive. Â They ask if you need more meat often, refill waters, and even cut the meat up if necessary for you on the grill.Great place to go to since it opens til 2 AM."
7/11/2014,3 star rating,"This place just took 5 years off my life: The meat is flavorful and fatty.You wont find expensive cuts here, but what they do offer- you can consume in excess.Expect an hour plus wait if coming during dinner time f-S. There is a nice Korean bar with big beers and large TVs playing Korean pop two doors down-that might help with the wait.My heart hurts."
10/5/2017,4 star rating,"First time here with my sister, also first stop we made landing in LA. Busy atmosphere, the wait was 30 mins so not too bad considering from most reviews there's a long wait. The guy didn't explain the menu to us nor really slowed down to repeat himself. Which I didn't realize you don't get rice, apparently it's an extra charge for rice. Thankfully the lady who cooked our meat for us was super nice and went over everything for us. I got my rice no worries Lol. Meat is good, we had the beef tip my fav, brisket, pork belly, squid, and beef tongue. The beef tongue is a must try! They have it thinly sliced, super good esp from someone who don't eat tongue on the regular."
8/25/2018,2 star rating,"Okay yelp reviews are drawing people to a place that is not worth it! Â Got to the place a little before 8pm didn't get a table till after 9:30. Â Was so hungry that I couldn't even enjoy it! Â So not worth it, there are Korean BBQ spots all over this area don't waste you time for the same stuff if not worse. Â It isn't all you can eat they give you a few sides (4) and then meat 3 choices at a time. Â Look around first plenty of places that can handle crowds this place has about 10-13 tables it has an occupancy of around 120 people with the staff.. :/"
1/13/2020,5 star rating,I came here with my wife and I last Thursday and waited over an hour but this place is WORTH it. This is hands down the best BBQ I've ever had. I usually go to KBBQ restaurants where you cook it on your own but I love how this place does it for you!! They had very fresh meat and the cook/waiters were very attentive. Just to bad how to you have to pay $5 for lettuce wraps. But other than that it's 10/10!
11/30/2014,4 star rating,"$ to the first person who can figure out how to spend 1+ hour in here, and leave without smelling like delicious meat.On a really busy day, you will get EXCELLENT service; they will quickly bring out the meat and get you what you want.... because they are trying to get you full quickly so that they can cycle in more people :)"
7/29/2016,5 star rating,"Great KBBQ! Service was awesome and fast. The best part of this place is their version of the ""grill"" was like a skillet that didn't smoke! Very well ventilated and you don't stink like bbq when you come out. All the sides are yummy and the meat is delicious too! Highly recommend making a reservation in advance. They have Valet too!"
10/7/2018,2 star rating,We were craving AYCE KBBQ and ventured off to K-town and decided to come here based on yelp reviews. It was super packed when we got there and waited a very long time to be seated (close to 2hrs!). But we waited since we really wanted to try this place. We were finally called in just a few minutes after the lunch price was over so we had to pay dinner price. We were pretty disappointed with the quality of meats and the high priced food. Definitely not worth coming back to.
12/14/2018,5 star rating,Good quality meat that were sliced well and amazing side dishes! I went in a party of two and the waiter allowed us to order just half or quarter or meat so we were able to try a variety. Worth the wait (20 mins around 7:15pm on Saturday) and good price.
8/9/2017,4 star rating,"Awesome for an All You Can Eat place! Make sure to read the rules before you come. Don't like the rules, don't come!! We feasted a LOT - make sure you order with your brain and not with your heart or you'll regret it hahahah!! Come hungry :) It was quick, clean & delicious. You can't go wrong!"
11/27/2012,5 star rating,"My new favorite korean BBQ place in LA! Why don't you exist in San Francisco (northern California). Why doesn't good korean BBQ exist outside of Koreatown. So depressing! Â Not only do I love that it's AYCE for $17 (closer to $20 plus tax and tip) but I love the variety and the quality of food it provides. Oh yea the decor rocks too, this is a clean restaurant with great ventilation. For AYCE you get like 8-10 different options from pork belly, tripe (honeycomb), hot dog, short ribs, bulgolgi, pork shoulder, brisket, etc. Wow!!! Oh yea did I mention that you get great ban chan, rice noodles (which Nor Cal korean BBQ definitely does not have), egg drop soup, miso soup, kimchi pancake and your choice of white rice or kimchi fried rice. In case you were wondering, GET THE KIMCHI FRIED RICE! They cook it right in front of you on the stone slab. DELISH!Oh yea while the meats and stuff BBQ, the stone slab is slightly tilted to one side, as there is a hole and all the fat and oils is dripped right off. Â It's like the foreman grill before it was invented/patented. I love it here!"
11/26/2016,5 star rating,"The line is long and seems like forever, but you are strong and you will make it to your table. It also helps that there are boba places and snacks around this joint. Very delicious food for AYCE. Get the kimchi fried rice in the end."
8/20/2018,5 star rating,"Definitely the best Korean bbq spot in town. Despite the long wait times, the service is as good as it gets. The employees are working fast but efficient. The meat quality is great. The sides are all delicious. The atmosphere is pretty cool with the hip hop music in the background. This is the only Korean bbq place I ever go to! Must try!"
1/12/2020,5 star rating,This is a great AYCE place. Price is super reasonable. Half the price of other places but not as many straight out meat choices. The best meaty choice was thin Canadian pork belly and I'm not that into fatty meats. You can get 3 meats at once but if you don't finish you will get fined. Just get 1 at a time when you are near full. Wear clothes that you can wash in a washing machine because your clothes will smell like delicious BBQ.
3/12/2019,3 star rating,The food is absolutely amazing this review is absolutely nothing to do with the food it's amazing quality very tasty and all the servers are pretty nice.My problem is with the guy the grease you at the door where you need to sign up your name he's usually in the worst mood possible he yells at you and he's just absolutely rude it's like he's making you a favor honestly my overall experience in this place is pretty good but it really turns me off when the staff is rude and I'm just talking about one person in particular it's this guy he's usually at cashier or he is writing the names on the list and yelling at people outside he's always in a bad mood being completely rude to everyone.
3/2/2014,5 star rating,"For a while, I wasn't ready to write this review because I couldn't put into words how delicious the food was here.My friend invited me to a party with supposed very attractive men there, but when I sat down for dinner, nothing mattered anymore except the food in front of me. Everything was so freaking amazing. We started with the short rib, which you just fall in love with at first bite.The service was also fantastic and attentive, something I am always surprised by at Asian restaurants. Not that it matters as much as how great the meat (all you can eat) is, they also had a lot of bon chons and their kimchi pancakes were also good.At $20, it's a bit pricey compared to other all you can eat korean bbq places in the area, but the quality more than makes up for it."
4/1/2018,5 star rating,First time trying this place and loved it. They have all you can eat lunch and dinner options. Meat is cooked for you at your table. Valet parking is only $2. Great atmosphere with loud music but still able to talk at your table and hear conversation without a problem. Customer service was great. Be prepared for long wait times on weekends as this is a popular spot. Can't wait to come back.
2/6/2020,3 star rating,Hannah the hostess was pretty rude but the food and our server Andy was great. I went last night (Wednesday) at 7pm and waited an hour to be seated but it went by fast. Also had the pineapple soju which was good.

Of course ppl r going to take their sweet ass time!FINALLY, we were seated! We did 4 rounds of buloggi, brisket, paper pork belly and marinated short ribs! The buloggi was super tasty and marinated to perfection!I heart the chili sauce here!Service was good."
1/24/2018,5 star rating,"This is probably the best KBBQ in Ktown. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes. The few times we've been here, we've waited more than an hour because there are so many people wanting to get in! It's cheap for good quality of meat."
10/20/2016,4 star rating,Tried out this restaurant for the first time with my best friend. It was very smokey and seating was very tight and close to one another but food was amazing! My friend literally had to tell me to stop eating. lol We had a bit of a language barrier with the server throughout our meal because her accent was extremely thick and didn't understand me when I tried to explain my allergies but that was really our only complaint. I'd definitely come back for the all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ!
2/24/2016,4 star rating,"This is a great AYCE kbbq spot! Def does the job in terms of price and flavor!!! Always expect to wait, always a huge waitlist for this place!Service is great, not super attentive because they're obviously rushing to turn around customers which I can understand, but I felt kind of rushed and no room to breathe. They come around like ninja's and start cooking your food, putting in on your plate, sticking more meat on the stone grill when sometimes you just want to take your time and enjoy it all. Anyways the meat here is always marinated really well. Already had the sides on the table waiting, always great after a long wait so you can start digging in! The kimchi pancakes are amazing.Overall if you're looking for a good AYCE, def try this spot out!"
10/19/2014,4 star rating,"Came here twice already. First time with bunch of girlfriends and second time, I came with a date here who barely knew how to do Korean BBQ so I had to teach him the ways lol. We ordered everything on the menu except weird intestinal stuff, seafood, and we were so stuffed at the end (this happened on both occasions funny enough) we didn't get the kimchi rice, which I hear is bomb. All the meat is the good, except I am not a huge fan of the thin sliced pork belly. And I can't remember which meat (either the bulgogi or the brisket) were dry.I would only suggest improving on the language barrier of the waiters. But I do like the fact that they help you cook the meat! This is like a more ""upscale"" version of AYCE KBBQ in my opinion. Music in the background, open pretty late 2am, and always a wait.I would come here again but definitely check out other KBBQ places."
7/1/2015,5 star rating,"JUST AMAZING.1. Â Service - top notch - normally, I've been to Korean restaurants where the employees spoke very little English (and that's o.k., I get that it's a Korean place, BUT, being the fact that the place caters to a lot of NON-Koreans, it would make sense to have English speaking employees) but not here!! Â Not only did they speak English, they took the time to explain all the items on my table that I was not familiar with, and constantly checked back on us to make sure we were ok.2. Â Parking - there's only valet, and it's a small lot, but if you look, you can find parking on the sidestreets.3. Â Seating - We went on Father's Day, and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be...we were seated in about 10 minutes4. Â Food - $21.99 for all you can eat meat--you get to choose 4 types to start (from a list they provide you); tried the kimchi pancakes for the first time--awesome(!); the steamed egg was interesting, and the dipping sauces and little plates of food starters were terrific!I loved it--definitely wanna come back here!"

She said she had already gone once that weekend but loved it so much that she wanted to go again before her BF drove down to SD again. I already had plans but was glad I cancelled them to go.The ban chan was really good. I really liked the pickled daikon. The predressed lettuce was great too. They have these cute little directions on what you can do with the mean including all these combos for ""korean tacos"" that you can make with radish or rice paper. They had this spicy sauce that i put over everything. I had never tried beef tongue before so I'm glad I got to try that. I really liked the pork belly too. Filled up with short ribs, they didn't have bones which I really liked. We decided against the soup but had the kimchi pancakes. We read on the directions that additional charges will be added to the bill if we had meat left over so we only ordered a little at a time. The waiters were super attentive so it wasn't a problem. When we were done with the meat a girl came over to make kimchi fried rice. Not as good as my fav place in SD but it was still good. I can't afford to eat here as much as i want but i think i'll bring my family when they come down to visit."
8/28/2014,3 star rating,"This place is really good for do it yourself Korean BBQ. Â It's fun to cook for yourself at a restaurant, I love the concept, but I have found at Korean places the cooking tends to be better when left to the chef. Â The meat here was good, kimchi a little lacking. Â I liked the salad, never had a salad at a Korean place before, so that was cool. Â They didn't give us lettuce to wrap the meat, and instead gave us this rice noodle wrap. Â That was different than what I was used to. Â I really enjoyed the squid. Â  Â The parking situation was weird to me. Â It was valet only, but the weird part was it was in a strip mall, and we had found parking and was about to park when we were told it valet. Â So had to get out the car and watch them literally drive the car into the spot we were in front of. Â To me that was odd."
5/28/2018,5 star rating,Came here on a Saturday night with a group of friends. Waited about an hour and half before we were seated and I have to say that Korean food is very authentic and the service is great! Definitely coming back here for another dinner.
8/26/2016,4 star rating,"Great Korean BBQ. I really liked the bulgogi, and the octopus. The pork belly was only okay. Nice place, very quick service though it was hard to get water. Went as a group of 4 and everyone left satiated and in a slight food stupor."

1/2/2020,5 star rating,"I highly recommend this place! It's amazing, the food and the service. My first time trying Korean BBQ and I'm for sure coming back here!! They are friendly and respectful!!!"
7/12/2018,5 star rating,"Hands down the best Korean barbecue around! I've tried a variety of ayce (all you can eat) barbecue places and this is easily my favorite for a variety of reasons. First, the menu is pretty expansive with a variety of prime cut meats. Second, the price is very reasonable and isn't on the high end of kbbq. Third, the place is very well ventilated and temperature controlled. It isn't overwhelmingly hot, nor does it reek of meat. You can walk away from this place and no one will know you just ate kbbq (which is rare considering you always walk away smelling like meat). Fourth, the meats are cooked on a granite grill which means that the food doesn't stick. The grill is also slightly at an angle with a small opening at the bottom to let the juices drip down and away from the food. The servers are very friendly, so don't be surprised when they come up to your table and help cut the meat or turn it for you when they notice you might be overcooking your meal. Overall great experience and worth the wait time!"
11/22/2015,4 star rating,"When in LA- Korean! Lunch is $19.99 and dinner is $21.99- 22 items for AYCE. The wait wasn't too bad when my friends and I came in. We were seated at a table with enough space for all of our food. There weren't a lot of side dishes, but of course we came here for the MEATS. Beef tongue was recommended by yelpers, so I gave that a try. I liked it, but my friends didn't care to try it. I think we were trying to out eat each other, but we were not able to finish everything. We did end our meal with kimchi fried rice though. They make it in front of you on the stone grill. Nom! Service was prompt- ring the bell at your table if you need anything."
4/1/2011,4 star rating,"Brisket and pork belly. Literally that's all I eat here. I need at least 2 hours. I eat about 6 servings in one sitting!The all you can eat menu item here is great. Lots of choices for such a good price. You also get lots of little side dishes, an egg custard bowl, and soup. The fried rice they make right in front of you is also really good.Come early on weekends because it gets packed and you'll have to wait 30 minutes or more outside where there is no seating. Service isn't that good, but the food makes up for it."
12/28/2015,4 star rating,"This place is BOMB. We didn't have to wait TOO long (thank goodness) because we got there at 4:30pm. Once we were seated, we ordered right away. Brisket, thing pork belly, short rib, and bulgogi were our main orders. The short rib is DELICIOUS and BONE FREE!! GET IT. I also love the brisket.The rice at the end is the best treat.They're super friendly, always coming by to clean the grill, help you cook the meat, and check on you. I can see why people wait hours...I wouldn't just because that's ridiculous. Come at an off time!SO SO GOOD."
10/18/2017,5 star rating,"I'm a big fan of KBBQ and I literally come to LA just to eat just that! Comparing KBBQ in the Bay and LA, LA's meat quality is A1. Any who, I love this place because (1) all you can eat (2) great sides, love the mashed potatoes (3) there's a bar next door that's awesome that you can drink while you're on the wait list Â (4) great ambiance and great customer service. They cook the meat for you. (5) opens late"
12/11/2019,5 star rating,"Is this place worth waiting 2 hours for on a busy night? I hate waiting but this KBBQ AYCE menu now is at the top of my fav places. Yes the wait was worth it. The service was great, prices reasonable for the quality of meats. The vibe is loud and fun. No reservations for smaller parties so you have to get in line for a table. But once you're in it's an experience to enjoy."
11/14/2018,5 star rating,I found this place and me and my family love to come here and eat the side dishes are so good the potato salad is to die for I recommend this place and they closed at 2:00am.
12/11/2019,2 star rating,"So this place is apparently a L.A. AYCE joint , with SUPER LONG wait times and people hanging outside and since it was night time it was reminiscent of a night club. However once inside you enter a jam packed bustling Korean bbq spot!! The smells are wonderfully pleasing and as you sit down in this sardine can of a restaurant,salivating to eat some bbq....you soon realize that the side order of spicy fish cake is all you will consume. 3 orders of brisket between 7 adults and not much more. The server was overwhelmed and the other help turned a blind eye to raised hands searching for meat in the night, the night was cold and now I have a greater respect for hoes cause man we was waiting and waiting for no meat sadly just fish cake."
11/13/2019,5 star rating,"One of my favorite Korean BBQ all you can eat restaurant in K-town. The quality of their meat and service has been consistent every single time I went, even their long wait line has been consistent! lol. I recommend their brisket, pork belly, and the kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal...it's so delicious. I'm actually going to go again tonight so hopefully the lines not too long! Cheers!"
10/18/2015,2 star rating,"Meat quality:The brisket cut on the meats are pretty good. Not too much fat but just enough to show you it's actually the brisket cut. Didn't care for the short ribs. Too chewy for my taste. Also had the thin slices pork belly. Service:Felt extremely rushed. We came here because they advertised they closed at 2am. We got sat at 12:55am and the host automatically told us that we have to order all the meat we want by 1:20am. Too bad the rest of my party wanted to stay just because it was convenient. I would never pay $22 to be rushed. Basically we got sat. They took our order. Then within a few mins the servers came by to remind us that last call on food was 1:20am even though they state they closed at 2am. Â  To make matters worse each time they came by they started clearing out cooking utensils and even asked to pay our bill. Extremely poor service considering our bill for 4 came out to $100. Â  If your gonna advertise 2am closing time at least let us enjoy the food we have on the table. No coming back to this Korean BBQEven the owners profile says last call is at 1:30am, so why were we told last call is 1:20am and then asked to pay the bill at 1:30am?"
1/13/2018,3 star rating,"Overall their food was delicious and sides were great. Staff were very nice and helpful. At some point they over did it, we felt we were RUSHED during the whole time. Why??? We ordered our meat and they just kept pouring the raw meat onto the marble grill. They did not leave the raw meat on the table for us to grab at our own pace. Also they keep on going onto our grill moving our meat around all the dang time. We get it..... that it seems that we don't know how to cook our meat? but we like it at a certain way. I felt we had no privacy in our table. We wanted to eat at a slow pace and not put all the meat on the grill at once. It makes us full quick and we wanted to enjoy our food and not just eat it all at once. I had to put all the cook meat onto my plate and it got cold...... Don't know if we want to come back again during our trip there after feeling of being rushed."
12/28/2018,4 star rating,"Very good quality meat. Relatively small place for amount of people they attract. We waited TWO and HaLF hours to get on a Saturday evening. Totally worth it though. People who work here are fast, so food just keep coming in, so I suggest you come here hungry."
10/9/2015,4 star rating,"Lunch for 2 = $43 We ordered the marinated short ribs, bulgogi, brisket only and they were pretty good. The steamed egg was really good. Kimchi pancake was meh but it's free so why not. & of course the kimchi fried rice (which would be nice if we got earlier). Their customer service was impressive. Different servers coming to fill our waters, replacing our side dishes, flipping and cutting our meat. It was nice."
5/20/2018,5 star rating,By far one of the best places to eat Korean bbq when you're in LA!! Our server Sean was absolutely awesome and very attentive from the beginning to end. The whole vibe of the place was great! Definitely coming back!
2/8/2018,5 star rating,"With the plethora of KBBQ restaurants in koreatown, now I just look for a place with great service, decent quality meat, short lines, and doesn't run out of rice paper and radish in the middle of my meal (who else gets sad when that happens?? lol). Â I think this place fulfills all those things except ""short lines"". Â If you're coming on a weekend, expect to wait at least 1.5hrs. Â If your willing to wait for the food, you will not be disappointed. Â Meat quality is good and service is ON POINT. Â I love going to kbbq places where there are enough waiters to constantly refill whatever you need (because we all know most of these places have terrible waiter-to-table ratio). Â I have brought a couple friends here from out of town and it never fails to make them happy."
12/14/2016,5 star rating,"Great place for ayce kbbq!The meat is fresh and the service is good. There's always a line for dinner and late night so be prepared. I waited almost two hours for just a party of three on a Saturday night once. Besides that, the price is very good for an ayce place, especially for their quality meat ($21.99 lunch and $23.99 dinner)."

12/13/2016,4 star rating,"Great place for Korean BBQ, everything is tasty, good quality meat and large selection on the AYCE menu. The kimchi fried rice at the end was really tasty. Great service, 5 stars for our waiter, he was always around and got everything we asked very quickly. They do charge $11.99 for kids 4-7 years old, my son is 4 and did not eat much just some rice and steamed eggs. I have never been charged for my son at other AYCE places."
1/9/2016,3 star rating,"Came here around 10pm on a wednesday. The wait was extremley long. Happy with the price. Taste wise--not worth the 1.5 hour wait but I could come again on a slower day. The quality of the panchans and meat were decent. Servers we're okay-they cook your meat for you occasionally which is nice, but our waitress did not greet our party, nor smile once. Â Free kimchi pancake(very good) came with the side dishes."
2/2/2018,5 star rating,"Awesome place for KBBQ! Service here is very friendly and they're more then happy to do the BBQ'ing for you (mainly so that you don't burn the grill) if you're not very familiar with it. Quality was very good and you are more then able to order ""half-orders"" so you don't waste and get charged. They also don't try to be cheap and enthusiastically ask you if you want to order anymore."
8/17/2014,4 star rating,"I don't think I can ever eat Korean food without Korean friends. We ordered everything in Korean and they took extra time to explain what to get and how to eat. Service was good and speedy except when they misplaced our 2nd round of meat order so we had to wait EXTRA long. We of course turned to all the small dishes and of course devoured rounds of them wait we waited what seems like FOREVER!!!!!.I'll keep this short, just some hit and miss:kimchi- you'll either love it or hate it. Fish cake- it was alrightBean paste soup- yummyKimchi pancake- mehFried rice- soooo goodSpicy pork- goodBeef tongue- goodBrisket- very goodIntestine, thick pork belly, all the other beef items- meh.

9/24/2009,5 star rating,"This is by far the best Korean BBQ I've been to. Â And I've been to quite a few. It was my first Korean Venture and has been my comfort restaurant every time I've tried a questionable or poor service KBBQ Restaurant. Â I particularly keep coming back for the Kimchi Pancake.Never have I seen another one like it. Â So good, one is never enough. Â short ribs and brisquet are one of the best I've tried. Â And the kuddle fish is awesomely huge and tasty. Â I recomend this place for any new comers to KBBQ. Â Finally the staff is always friendly and very helpful for begginers"
12/16/2009,4 star rating,"My friends and I came here after a David Choi concert... we were feeling hella Korean so we figured some KBBQ could spice up our lives. Â This was the closest one to our concert venue, and it had some good reviews, so we decided to check it out.Parking is difficult because it gets packed, but valet is available. Â We instantly recognized the restaurant cause of that damn pig on the sign... very fitting for all the meat we were about to consume. Â We put our name down (party of 5) and ended up having to wait over an hour and a half for a table... ugh, but I guess this place DID get really busy, and we did come on a Friday night. Â Still, for $16.99 AYCE with much more seafood options than other places, I was willing to wait... plus I was starving, so why leave when the smell of meat surrounded you?Once seated, the servers were absolutely great to us. Â They were very nice, always poured our waters (and cold tea at that) without having to have us really ask. Â My friends and I wanted to try out different kinds of meats so we got the BBQ Pork, Squid, and Brisket to start. Â The BBQ Pork isn't bad, and the squid is really tasty! Â The Brisket here was HELLA good... tender and crisp, just as it should be. Â After we cleared out one plate, we ordered some chicken, bulgogi, and galbi... unfortunately the galbi here isn't banging. Â It's great, but compared to other locations (such as Tahoe) it doesn't compare.We didn't get to try out the kimchi fried rice because we were all so full from the meat. Â The server that cleaned our cooking area with the radish was awesome! Â She was fighting that grease for over ten minutes... mad respect to her for acting like it was no big deal. Â I would have been so tired after that.I would probably come back again on a different day to avoid the heavy line waiting. Â It is definitely worth a try, and to many people, a great Korean BBQ joint to enjoy.(Dinner: After tax and tip about $22 per person)"
9/20/2011,3 star rating,"Came here around 8:30 pm on a friday and it was jammed packed! My friends and i was suppose to wait for 2 hours, but fortunately the waiter hooked us up and found us a table before other parties. I was kind of disapointed with the sides because i thought they would have more, but they didnt. I didnt really like how they served kim chi fried rice last, because i wanted it with my korean bbq meat. The bbq was good, you cant go wrong with bbq. Service was okay. Parking lot is very small so we had to get vallet. I would come back here, but it's not my first choice."
10/25/2017,5 star rating,"This is probably my new favorite Korean BBQ spot! They only take reservations for parties of 6+ and they will hold the reservation slot for up to 15 minutes only. They're pretty strict with it, so definitely be on time if you have a reservation. They use this stone material to cook and the meat is marinated really well. Service is great as well. We didn't have to keep trying to get the waiter's attention like other Korean BBQ restaurants are like. They were very attentive and nice!"
11/18/2018,5 star rating,"It's always such a crazy line. But worth it (one most nights). The meat selection is better than most. The sides are great. When we're too hungry and can't wait in line, we go to Meatlove which is close by and a good option. Sides are a little better in Hae Jang Chon though"

8/5/2018,2 star rating,All you can eat mediocre beef. Would not go back unless I had no choice. Oh yeah my waiter was pretty rude Â I have you on video talking shit about me... No Bueno. Shit list!!
10/25/2016,4 star rating,"Awesome meat!!! My favorite combo was the beef tongue with spinach. That's why I love Korean BBQ, when you cook it yourself it come out exactly how you want!!!The best part was all you can eat!!!!! The only downfall is that they don't have a big selection of kimchi and sides, but the classic kimchi makes up for it! Thank you!"
9/30/2015,4 star rating,"Basically my favorite all you can eat Korean BBQ place in LA but the wait is always so long. An hour wait is if you are lucky. That is the only reason why it's a 4 star and not a five. No matter what time of the day you go, there is going to be a line. I wish they could expand, take over the stores next to them. Even with the wait, the best KBBQ in LA. The services is always great and fast. The food is excellent. Remember to save food for the FRIED RICE at the end! Yum!"
4/2/2017,4 star rating,"Definitely one of the better Kbbq places in Korea town. The appetizers and meet were prepared very well. It's also all you can eat! So that's definitely a plus for me. Be wary of the wait, it's usually about 30 mins to and hour long. But it's definitely worth it. Also, parking is $2."
11/8/2018,5 star rating,"AMAZING Korean food. Truly an exceptional experience. Be prepared for a long wait, but the wait will totally be worth it."
3/4/2016,5 star rating,This place has GREAT korean BBQ. They have a good selection of meats and seafood. The meats are flavorful. This place has an awesome all you can eat. Only thing that is bad is the wait time on busy nights. Other than that the staff is always attentive and helps you throughout the dinning. IF YOU WANT KOREAN BBQ THIS IS THE PLACE!!
11/15/2017,2 star rating,"The wait is long but we came early so not that long. The meat option is limited comparing with other restaurant i have been to, but the meat quality is good. The waiter is pretty rude when he doesnt allow us to touch the grilling tools (its our first time here, we just thought we had to bbq the meat by ourselves). And when we put enough meat to just spread on the grill, he complained that we put too much meat. I looked around and i believed mine is way too fine. the agitation in his tone is so clear. Overall, im not excited to go back. And the stars r for the meat quality."
8/18/2018,5 star rating,By far the best best Kbbq I've had. The beef tongue was probably my favorite meat that we ordered but everything was great. Quick and efficient service they get you in and out in a jiffy. I appreciate how attentive the servers were too! :)
1/18/2016,5 star rating,"Oh how I love Hae Jae Chon!!Just moved from Korea town, which means I've tried any and all Korean BBQ places in LA and Hae Jang Chon, is BY FAR THE BEST! When you walk in, the ambiance is great, everyones having a good time, the vibe is great. Â Right when your seated, the sides are waiting for you on the table and man are they good. Â The kimchi and fish cake are phenomenal.The service is impeccable. Â Right after you're seated, you're greeted by a very friendly and informing server ready to get you your meat choices and whatever else it is you need. Â Instead of a basic metal grill in the middle of the table, there is a stone grill which can fit more meat at one time, cooks more evenly, faster and all around better taste. Â Again, Â I've been to a lot of kbbq places and this one is by far my favorite, I highly recommend.Two chopsticks up."
1/11/2016,4 star rating,"Great place to eat at! My favorite Korean place. The meats are all high grade meat. The food is prepared anyway you want and you have someone to help you prepare if you choose to. The price is very very fair for the quality and the amount of food you can pack into your belly.The only complaint I have is the wait. It can be around 1-2 hours on any given day. Still if you are hungry and want great food, I advise you try this place out. You can always go next door to the bar and have a drink or two before dinner."
6/29/2015,4 star rating,"Really delicious AYCE KBBQ! Â All of the LA seems to think so as well, since the wait here is over one hour long at times. Â The service is great since they will cool the meats for you. Â The korean pancake was ok...not as crispy as I usually like them...I wouldn't get too full off these. Â My favorite meats were the brisket, pork belly, squid, and marinated short ribs. Â The stone grill is different from other KBBQ places and I think it gives a better flavor to the meat. Â It is also fascinating to watch when they clean the grill with radish. Â The pork shoulder came highly recommended by our server but I thought it was a little too fatty. Â The kimchi fried rice at the end is good...but a little bit too much seaweed.Also, be aware that the valet will turn you away if it gets full...which is highly likely on a busy weekend night. Â So the parking situation is not ideal, since if you can't valet your car, you may have to park your car on the street blocks away."
6/27/2017,5 star rating,This place is so goooood . We didnt have to wait so long since we came around 2ish. But they do require you to have everyone there before you get seated.

11/11/2013,2 star rating,"One word: OVERRATED!My bf and I decided to check this place out after a friend ""highly recommended"" it. We went on a saturday night only to be greeted with am enormous line. So, we thought why not come on sunday when it'll be less people. Boy were we wrong. The line on sunday evening @6pm wasn't as long as the night before, but the wait was 1hr long! (- 1star) AND We had to valet our car. Waiting in the cold on an empty, ferociously growling stomach with no benches to sit on was miserable. Plus, the hostess continually called out people's names only to check if they were still there...big teaser that only made me hungrier.Once we finally got seated, our banchan and plates were already set. The place was cramped, loud, and busy. It took some time before a waiter came by to ask our drinks and meats. However, once the meats arrived we got cooking! Unfortunately, we couldnt really cook our meats because the servers kept coming by to flip the meats we had just flipped or turn down the flame that another server just raised. Let us cook in peace! (-1 star) Now moving on to the food:- kimchi was too sour (like another reviewer mentioned)- 4 different sauces were offered for dipping (chili sauce, bean paste, oil & salt, and soy sauce)- green veggies were bland- bean sprouts were mediocre- salad was good, well balanced flavors- steamed egg was alright (can't really go wrong with this one)- bean paste soup was delicious- kimchi pancake (1st time trying) was very gooey and a lil sour (did not like it)- bulgogi was decent- brisket was fatty and chewy- marinated short rib was chewy and had mild flavoring - thin pork belly had hard cartilage (or was it bone?) still attached to it...did not enjoy crunching down on that - BBQ pork could have been seasoned better(Food overall: -1star)The food was NOT all it was hyped up to be. The meats were sub par. I have had way better meats at cheaper places. The cool thing they offered was freshly made kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal but I thought it strange that you can only choose between steamed rice or kimchi fried rice. Couldn't I just have steamed rice and whatever I had left over make it into kimchi fried rice? Also, the grill was a traditional round stone plate which was interesting to cook on. Overall, the wait to get into this place is ridiculous and so not worth it. Even if I made a reservation and waited less time, I would NOT come back here. The servers are too involved with the cooking, which ruins the fun part about kbbq--cooking your food! And the meats and side dishes were not memorable or special in any way. One nice thing is that valet only costs $2! That's unheard of! However, I would not recommend this place. don't waste your money and especially YOUR TIME here. There are way better places like Bulgogi House in Rowland Heights and Woori Kalbi in Northridge."
9/8/2015,4 star rating,"QUALITY all you can eat Korean bbq. This place has a super long wait. The workers come around and cook the meat for you, which is nice but it's really just to speed up the process because of the large amount of people waiting in line for his place. When you're finished, they really rush you to leave so they can serve the next customers because of the long lines they have to deals with. This place doesn't have as much banchan as other korean restaurants. The quality of the meat is amazing though. My favorite was the marinated short ribs and the thick cut pork belly!"
7/19/2018,4 star rating,"Delicious and affordable food! My boyfriend and I ordered the marinated prime rib, bbq chicken, beef tongue, thin pork fat, shrimp, and hot dog. It was weird that he ordered hot dog but it actually tasted really good. It tasted like a smokey hot dog. We really like the prime rib and bbq chicken the most. The sides were great as well. Overall great place for lunch or dinner."
4/20/2015,5 star rating,"Ok this is it. This is the AYCE KBBQ that all the other KKBQs wish they could be. I've been here a couple times and wonder why it isn't many more times than that.But anyway, some things to note because this page doesn't have enough reviews and no one ever goes in details about the food............................................ sigh LOL I'm number 248928492 on the review but here's to hoping someone reads my shiet.Stone grill. Not sure if this is that big of a deal but it is cool. They don't have to change their grills constantly, but they do clean it with radish and.. stuff. They also make KIMCHI FRIED RICE at the end on this very stone grill.... and you must get it. You just must.They have your usual stuff - banchan, rice, salad, rice papers, steamed egg, etc. GET IT ALL! I mean, most of them is already sitting on your table so you have no choice, but GET IT ALL!They also have this BOMB kimchi pancake.......... yea you also MUST get this.Meat recs:Pork belly thick slicedPork belly thin slicedPork neck (a little fatty if you like that)Brisket (always bomb)Beef TongueMarinated short ribUHHHHHHH ANYTHING!We tried a bunch of different meats, but the table's top 3 were the thick pork belly, brisket, and beef tongue. But honestly...... they're all good. Just go with it!Dinner came out to about $28-30 (including a couple of beers) per person including tax and tip. Sounds about right."
12/6/2015,5 star rating,"Korean BBQ, is one of my favorite styles of food because because of the variety, interactiveness, and he feeling and taste of hot sizzling meat right off the grill. That being said, this place does deserve my 5 stars. In K-Town, there is a plethora of KBBQ joints. I always find myself arguing with friends over where to go because everyone has their own place they think is best. Most of the time, if you are going for quality, you don't go to an all you can eat restaurant. However, I only like Korean BBQ in all you can eat fashion because with Korean BBQ, you just want to focus on the cooking and have a lot of people around you and just keep eating and not have to worry about what to get for who and how much to order and who's meat is who's etc. it's just too much of a headache. With this place, you get the best of both, AYCE ($21.99 p/p) and quality. Service is fantastic. Really, in KTOWN, good service is not so common, but over here, you feel so welcome and attended to. It feels good. The kimchi fried rice they make you at the end of your meal, that's only an option if you don't eat rice during your meal. My tip is to have one person get rice and share that during the meal and the other rice have them make kimchi fried rice with at the end. They don't like that so you kind of have to play dumb. Trust me, you won't really have room to eat it in the end anyway. Lastly, the thing that makes here much different than the rest is the fact you are cooking on a hot stone vs an open flame. I initially had concerns about this because I like how with open flame grills they have a place for all the fatty liquids to escape. I also worried about the meat becoming a little chewy if the liquid stayed on the stone surface. Truthfully, even though there is a hole for the liquid to leave, you kind of have to push the liquids towards that hole yourself and it's super important to do so if you want a good sear on your meat."
1/9/2014,5 star rating,"Came here on a Thursday night at 8pm. Was seated about 20-30 minutes after we placed our name on the waitlist. After we were seated, the service was pretty quick. I recommend the followings:+ Black Angus Beef Brisket - really good+ Beef Short Rib (Marinated) - marinade was pretty bomb+ Thin Pork Belly - tastes surprisingly like brisket The Beef Bulgogi was a bit dry and the Beef Tongue lacked flavor compared to the brisket. Pretty good side dishes. The Kimchi Fried Rice at the end (you have to skip on getting the steamed rice to get this) was the cherry on top. Overall, definitely WORTH THE WAIT :)"
10/7/2018,5 star rating,"This place is a gem in a sea of ""all-the-same"" Korean BBQ's. The combination options are your beat bet and de sure to ask for some sticky rice with your meal!"
10/7/2018,5 star rating,Best place in Koreatown for Korean BBQ ever! service was outstanding! Wait line was a little long (about an hour) but honestly so worth it
1/16/2017,4 star rating,"$23.99, 27 item all you can eat!Lunch price is $21.99 but not on weekends or holidays.This is my first time trying this place and the inside is spacious, airy, and not too smelly.Service was on point and the food was very very good - especially at this price point.Not the #1 best KBBQ ever, but for the price, it could easily become your regular spot.Valet is $2."
1/15/2017,5 star rating,One of the best tasting Kbbq meats I've had. The service was reasonably good and our table was always attended to by at least one of the staff. At $21/person for lunch it's not a bad deal but make sure you have at least 1 or 2 big eaters in the group to really make it worth it.
1/14/2017,3 star rating,"I haven't tried the food yet, but if the food is amazing the highest I would give is 3 stars because of the false ""reservations"" they offer. 30 min after our reservation we are still waiting.. after we were told our party would be delegated because there were not enough tables #disappointed"
1/14/2017,4 star rating,"I came here around 3pm today and the wait wasn't too long. Parking is valet and it costs $2, but I didn't mind it too much. My favorite meats were the beef tongue, brisket, bugolgi, and marinated short ribs. The service was very fast paced and we didn't really have to cook our own meat so that is definitely a plus for me. The only downside is the meat took a bit longer to come out at times. Either than that I have no complaints and I'll definitely come back."
1/14/2017,4 star rating,"The meat was ok but JACK JACK made the experience so great. He was so happy and kind the whole time even tho I was hangry. Like DAMMMMMNNN YOU GO JACK JACK!!! YOU GO!! If you're reading this, sorry I was hangry"
1/13/2017,5 star rating,"We've been here maybe 3 times. It's always so good. However, it was weird the third time because I ordered 2 sides of rice twice and when he brought it out he said if you eat this rice you can't have the kimchi fried rice at the end. I was really confused because I always eat lots of rice when we come here and we've always had kimchi fried rice at the end."
1/13/2017,5 star rating,"Passed by it three times and always saw a lot of people there and have been wanting to try! When I finally went there, my friends have arrived first and were already seated, and I was a bit late. Just when I thought they were going to say no +1s, they kindly seated me and gave me utensils! We ordered a lot of beef tongue and shrimp as it is our favorite and ate for 2+ hours. Throughout the whole time, the waitresses were patient and didn't kick us out even when we sat longer than 1.5 hours, and constantly asked if we wanted more food! Finally, they serve a kimchi fried rice after the meal to which we asked to have the kimchi removed because we do not eat spicy. Although the request was weird they were nice and added other vegetables to make the fried rice taste good instead of telling us no can't do. Really great service, nice attitudes and great food. Would definitely come back for the amazing shrimp and beef tongue."
1/13/2017,3 star rating,Only the short ribs were really good. The sides aren't that great. The spicy chicken and bulgogi beef were not good quality meat at all.
1/12/2017,5 star rating,Delicious! I always come here when I'm in LA. Totally worth it and very attentive; delicious food. Get the beef tongue; don't be put off!
1/12/2017,4 star rating,"Second time to this establishment, and if the lines weren't so long, I'd probably be here more! Came for dinner both times and it's $23.99 per person with unlimited everything! They will come and fill your sauces, refill rice and side dishes as long as you let them know you want more! The staff is great and they honestly seat you according to when you get there. I went once with a party of 3 and once with a party of 2, and they seated us at tables that could seat 5 or 6. Lucky for us, super spacious and more room for all the food! I've tried almost every meat on the menu, and my favorites are the beef tongue, beef brisket, bulgogi, short ribs and teriyaki chicken! (Yes, there's a LOT more to choose from!) The staff is awesome, and I think they know even if it is 'cook your own', they come and cook for you! This is great, being that I am a terrible cook... Make sure you sign in as soon as you get there, valet parking only ($2) and they do take reservations but I've never tried. I'll be back for a third shot and hopefully there'll be less of a wait!"
3/15/2017,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by here whilst apartment hunting. And we were incredibly content with our decision!The food is amazing (ordered the Brisket twice before filling up), and the pricing is great for what you pay for. Also, the food came out quickly and the workers (our server Gina, especially) were attentive and fast. Also, the music playing was great (mostly because I like Blackpink and they played two songs back to back)!Would I come back? Definitely."
9/30/2019,3 star rating,"Meh. No longer worth the wait. Prices have gone up, quality has not gone up. It you order too many times, even though all you can eat, they ignore the last order and begin to clean the grill to get you outta there. After waiting over an hour and paying nearly $30 a person, you want your money's worth. Not to mention that the neglect to tell you the only sake on the menu is $20 bucks until you get the bill."
9/3/2018,2 star rating,My boyfriend and I decided to check this place after driving by and seeing the long wait. We eat out everyday and been to almost all the korean bbq joints in town and we definitely will not be coming here again. Their meat qualities are no bueno and their marinate meat is just too sweet. Do yourself a favor and pay $20 more dollars and go to Brothers BBQ couple streets down.
3/10/2016,5 star rating,So great! The service was speedy and the accommodations were stellar! Definitely will recommend it to others!
5/8/2018,5 star rating,"Everything is so good here! And the service is great! But be prepared to wait 30 minutes plus. I went on a Monday night at 10 and it was packed! It's one of the few places around that's open late so I can understand why they are busy. Top items to get: kimchi pancake, bulgogi, and kimchi fried rice. You won't go wrong with that!"
10/19/2019,5 star rating,"Great korean BBQ! 2nd time coming here and it's still good! The waiting line was the same - had to wait amost an hour, but the food is the wait worth."
9/2/2018,5 star rating,"We enjoyed this place! Worth the wait. Service was on point. They made sure that we were taken care of. However, if you have a big group, suggest making reservations. There were tons of groups waiting outside while we were seated within 15 mins of our reservation time."
6/19/2016,3 star rating,"I heard this place from my BF so he wanted to take me to try it out. It's 23.99 per person for all you can eat. Pretty good pricing and it's the average AYCE pricing anyway. They use a stone instead of a grill which is cool. To clean it they just rub what looks like radish and they use that to help scrap the excess char. You can only choose 3 meats per round and you do get charge for left overs for 15.00. So don't over order! The bonchon is good here. RICE PAPER AND FISH CAKE ARE MY FAVORITES AT ANY KOREAN RESTAURANT. The salad it's good too with the meat. We ordered the brisket, thin pork belly, intestines, and the marinated short ribs.I love how they cook here for you but I wish that I wasn't feel so rushed to eat because once the food was on the stone, it doesn't stop cooking so you have to eat it quick so it doesn't over cook. The brisket was okay. The intestines weren't that great, Gens daechang is better and more flavorful and not as chewy. The short rib is good but I wish it had the bone in, the best flavor is around the bone. My favorite would probably be the thin pork belly.Each meal come with the kimchi pancake which was good. You can also get some kimchi fried rice cooked for you after which we forgot to order. Overall, it's okay here."
4/2/2016,5 star rating,"Love it. Pretty much my favorite KBBQ spot so far. Service is good, food is great and ambiance is not as loud as other spots. Cheap valet or just park on the streets. Kinda rough to find a spot sometimes but it's doable.The lines get OUT OF CONTROL but like I always say, it's LA so deal with it or get mcdonalds.Make sure to try the Kimchi fried rice at the end. Delicious.Favorite thing to order: canadia thick pork...get in there kids!!!!!Wish they had a better beer selection but oh well I can deal with that and bring my hidden whiskey bottle"
5/13/2013,3 star rating,"Great service, great presentation, great selection of meats and late hours usually means a great score from this Yelper. Â However, the one drawback of HJC really changes the whole dynamic of your KBBQ dining experience dropping my score to 3.5 stars. Â The cooking stone.The cooking stone is supposed to give you a slightly different dining experience than the usual gas/charcoal grill but it isn't executed well enough for dinners to really enjoy the benefits. Â The stone doesn't get hot enough so when you pile on cold cuts of meat instead of sizzling on the stone the juices build up and you are almost steaming the meat. Â Cooking time is a bit longer and you lose a little bit of the char that you would normally get with a gas and/or charcoal grill. Â You might say, hey just don't put so much meat on the stone but #1 the table is hungry and #2 the staff often comes over to cook for you and piles the meat on before you can say anything. Â As great as the side dishes of the pajeon, steamed egg and kim chi fried rice are, when I go to KBBQ the star of the show is the meat. Â If the meat isn't give the proper vessel to cook, it will come out sub par and with so many other options in the area I will not be back."
12/20/2017,1 star rating,Their definition of a reservation is a placeholder in line and does not guarantee you a table... Also horrible service. Better staff recommended.
6/30/2018,3 star rating,"I like their beef tongue and kimchi fried rice, and that's about it. I wasn't too impressive with the quality of the other meats which they advertised for. Intestines are cut into smaller pieces at this place. I still prefer intestines with the traditional cut."
9/19/2018,5 star rating,Amazing service and food. The meat was good quality and all the other side dishes were great as well. The servers are quick and polite and all of them know how to speak both Korean and English.
1/19/2018,5 star rating,The quality of food is great and I like the side dishes a lot (shout out to the potato salad with apples in it) - the price is reasonable but the wait kills us every time - almost always an hour wait- you can only make a reservation for parties larger than 6 and even when you do you still have to wait 30 min to an hour - the food is great but there are other really great KBBQ places with shorter wait times (we've eaten here a dozen times though)
9/1/2016,5 star rating,"There are hundreds of Korean BBQ places around LA, especially in Ktown. Despite that, this place is consistently packed with an hour long wait, even on a Tuesday night... This should tell you how good this place really is. I can start off with their most unique feature: The stone grill. The stone makes the grill uniformly hot and makes meat incredibly fast to cook. Coupled that with staff constantly coming by and flip the meat for you, the only thing you really have to worry about is to eat fast enough when the meat is done just right. All of the meat choices are fantastic, but what stands out to me is the pork. Pork belly and pork shoulder are both great cuts of meat that you definitely should try. You also can't go wrong with their beef and chicken choices. The only downside is of course the wait. You'll definitely need to plan ahead for this restaurant. There are valet parking available so you don't have to worry about that, but it's very close to the purple line station at Western and Wilshire."
9/24/2013,2 star rating,"Wasn't impressed with it. I have had better meat. It actually tasted a bit old in my opinion. I did not like that the service was rushed. I felt like we were hurried to eat. Never do that to a customer. The decor is pretty cool, the side dishes are plenty and filling, and they do keep the meat coming in a timely manner. The buzzer on the wall is a neat concept but becomes futile if ignored. The fish cakes left the flavor in my mouth for more time than I would have liked it to. The potato salad was alright. The egg soup lacked texture tho.Not likely to return. Not when K bbq is like one per block in that area."
3/9/2013,2 star rating,"This used to be one of my favorite places in to get kbbq but the last time I went here was just ugh. The quality of the meat and banchan is great. I highly recommend it for the food alone if you don't mind random outbursts from the waiter staff. The waiter was super stingy on the rice. He didn't notify our party that if we got the white rice that he wouldn't make the kimchi fried rice for us. Since I had gotten the steamed white rice, he told me I wasn't allowed to even TOUCH my friend's kimchi fried rice. REALLY!? We're fighting over rice here. We all paid an equal amount and yet we're arguing over rice, not even meat. If you want your customers to be loyal to your restaurant, pick your fights. I usually am a fairly easy customer to please, but this was just unacceptable. Since the food is good, I'm gracious with a 2 stars."
7/3/2013,5 star rating,"I love this place! One of the best kbbq in my opinion maybe because +they cook/cut it for you+they have kimchi pancake, rice cake+save room for kimchi fried rice & soup in the end!!+their marinated short rib is so goodYou can definitely taste the quality in their meats. Not as many options as Gens but they have the most popular meats: brisket, bulgogi, short rib (marinated & unmarinated) Tips*Valet parking is $2*Opens till 2am daily! *Make reservations for parties of greater than 6 on weekdays but Fr-Sun has to be 8 or more"
7/14/2015,5 star rating,"Apparently, when you go to LA you need to get KBBQ. I live in Westminster, right next to where Korean District is so I am surrounded by various KBBQ places. I've had my fair share of KBBQ as well and I have to say, this place does live up to its reputation.For side dishes, you have your basic needs- rice paper, radish, kimchi, fish cake (IT WAS REALLY GOOD), and bean sprouts. They also offer kimchi pancake which was my first time trying it, deeelicious! I feel like their big winner is obviously the meat. The taste is in the meat, their beef Â tongue was very fresh and cooked very well, nothing frozen.Regarding location, I truly feel like they need to expand the place. They're overhwelming popular and with that said, you know you're going to be waiting at least +45 minutes to get seated. I was a table of two and for 1.5 hours to be seated on a Saturday night. We got there around 7, so about dinner time. Luckily, we got there before the big rush/big parties came in. Oh, and it's valet parking to park in the plaza. You can park on the streets or on the side but you would have to walk in. By the time I was leaving, the valet was full so guests had to start driving elsewhere to park.I would definitely come back, but I don't think I'd be back for dinner time! Most likely for early lunch just to avoid the long wait."
1/31/2016,1 star rating,"I put my name down on the list and I asked how long it was going to take, they told me 30-60 minutes and I ended up waiting an hour with my completed party. They tell me after waiting an hour that it was going to take another hour, if you're going to tell me an hour, than make it an hour and don't give me that bullshit. I know how it is for a all you can eat kbbq since I worked at one which had a 2 hour wait usually. Ended up leaving without eating here, hope next time I come they don't give me this bs again!Learn how to be honest with your customers instead of telling them what they want to hear"
2/10/2016,4 star rating,"This is our local all you can eat spot when we meet friends for Korean BBQ! For ~ $22/ person the meat selection is great and the banchan is delicious as well. We've gone at least 15 times and every time our service has been great! We always get several rounds of brisket, move onto the non marinated galbi, to marinated galbi and end with the 2 kinds of pork belly. Make sure to ask them to save some pork belly to mix into our fried rice at the very end! The only negatives are the crowd and also the meat quality isn't great just good but other then that it's a solid spot for lunch or dinner for a group !! If you don't get here before the rush it's a 1-1.5 hour wait! I love Korean bbq but not that much! So try and get here before 6!!"
11/27/2017,5 star rating,"Had dinner with my family and it was the best Korean bbq I had in LA. The servers were very attentive and helped us cook the meat which I thought was great. They made sure the side dishes and water were refilled. We didn't need to flag them down unlike any other places. The meats were great, I really like the brisket and kalbi. Order the steam egg for sure because it was soft and tasty. When everything was done, we order the kimchi fried rice which was cooked on the stone grill and it was delicious! Definitely will come back again :)"
9/15/2019,5 star rating,The wait was long but it was all worth it. The servers were really nice too and they cook your meat for you. Â The best k-bbq place I have been so far.
6/18/2017,4 star rating,"AYCE KBBQ, got our banchans before we were seated. Got to order 3 plates at a time. The meat was fresh and abundant. The only thing I wish was included in the AYCE was the lettuce Wrap! But otherwise I enjoyed the experience and would come back for lunch as their menu is the same regardless of lunch or dinner. Went for lunch and there was no line, but I've seen the lines packed outside during dinner time and it can be hectic. Parking is valet for $2."
1/15/2015,5 star rating,"This place makes my stomach beam of happiness. First, don't get this place mixed up with the restaurant next door. Don't sign into the wrong sheet, Yelp friends! So when you find parking and got your name down, expect to stand a while and suffer through the smell of KBBQ as your stomach growls of hunger.For our party of 2, we got seated fairly quickly and boy was I happy about that. Immediately as we sat, the banchan was available and the grill was started and we got our first order in. Brisket, thin pork belly, my beef tongue to start. The thin pork belly was just... WOW. The fat on the pork belly melted like butter and never have I experience that type of quality at a KBBQ place. My boyfriend and I was very impressed. We also ordered throughout our meal the thick pork belly, BBQ squid, and shrimps and all were very good. I have to note the shrimps do not have heads though which I was a little disappointed by. In addition, the service was top notch. I hardly did any of the cooking. The moment I even reach fort the tongs, a server will be at the table taking over and cooking for us. Dinner was fantastic and I will gladly pay the $21.99 all over again!"
7/14/2017,5 star rating,This is my favorite all you can eat KBBQ whenever I visit LA. The price is right and the quality is on point. The wait times are long so try to plan around prime time hours so you don't wait as long.
7/20/2018,2 star rating,"Good was great (reason I'm giving 2 starts) but service was awful, they had a lot of people waiting so without asking us they cooked all our meat and served it trying to get rid of us as soon as possible. Don't recommend."
6/21/2018,5 star rating,"Whenever I'm in LA, I make sure and visit this place. Â It's pretty cool how they are open super late. Â They've got a large selections of cuts and I highly recommend trying the beef tongue."
8/26/2017,5 star rating,Came on a Tuesday night and boy was it packed! This is my usual go to place when I'm trying to impress all my friends and show them quality meat and a unique experience. This place uses a stone grill which cuts down on the burning of the meat. It also adds a unique flavor that I can't quite pin point. This place is a bit pricey but its worth it. It's 25.99 for dinner but it's worth it! They also offer korean pancakes and at the end they use the stone grill and make korean fried rice. They sometimes cook for you as well depending on how busy they get so don't get offended when they grab the tongs from you haha.
7/19/2015,4 star rating,"This place was the best KBBQ place I've ever tried in SoCal! AYCE is $21.99 per person. The wait isn't too bad either! One downside is that they don't give you the Kim Chi Fried Rice until the VERY END of the meal! That was a huge bummer..""/ but aside from that, I really liked this place!! They cook your meat for you here!! A con is that they have a very limited Ban Chan selection ):"
9/2/2016,5 star rating,"WOW, amazing korean BBQ....if i could go everyday and just eat at this place i would. The service is amazing they always take care of you when you order meat. One thing you should consider is the time/day you go. If you plan to go on fri or sat after 6pm be prepared to wait about 2hrs to get a seat. If you go during the weekdays you may even still wait 30mins or so...there is a reason why this place is packed and you have to wait a while to get your food. I've been going to Â korean bbq places for the past 15yrs and i usually go to 1 or 2 places till they change owners or the food/quality changes but this place has so far been great and now is my new korean bbq spot."

Especially on the weekends, you will see packs of people waiting outside. If you have a party of 6 or more, highly recommend to make a reservation a head of the time. Try the Beef Tongue if you can overcome the word ""Tongue"" ;) It is surprisingly good and the texture is more chewy than the brisket. Just give it a try. Must gets: Beef Brisket, Beef Short Rib, Thin and Thick Pork Belly. Personally, I love the thin pork belly. So thin so good!Service is great here, very attentive.The waiters will help to cook the meat and let you know if the meat is ready to consume (especially with the intestines). You'll never have to worry with ordering more food, because they alway check and ask if we need to order more food. I will be back for sure. Love this place!"
8/31/2016,4 star rating,"I've tried a few places for Korean BBQ and so far this place takes the cake. The quality of the meat here is superb, and it is all you can eat, not to mention the sides are as good as the meat they serve, parking sucks and the wait is a little long but you find out why once you start to chow down. WORTH IT ;)"
8/30/2016,2 star rating,"Going to echo the concerns about reservations. The meat is of average quality. Took umbrage with the service, which was a bit lacking and rude. There are plenty better AYCE to spend your money at in K-Town. I'd advise looking around. Kogi King on Western Avenue is superior in my opinion."
8/30/2016,3 star rating,"As you walk in, you see lots of round tables that can seat up to 6 people. Â Now, with 6 people, they allow you to make reservations... but wait. They have so may rules I can't list them all. I guess I should have take a picture of the guidelines. Anyway, your whole party must all be present, you have a 15 min grace period and if someone doesn't show, your reservation automatically gets cancelled. Â That's few of the 10,000 rules they have. As for the food, it was good quality, but you are paying a higher price at $23.99/pp compared to the other ayce places and your server comes around often to cook the meat for you. Maybe I just haven't been in Ktown that often lately, but man I was so happy to get out of there. It was so noisy with all the food cooking, the TV, music blaring, and people talking, I couldn't even hear my husband across the table. Even our server sounded as if she lost her voice. The meat quality was good, but nothing to write home about.Food 4 starsService 4 starsatmosphere 3only 1 stall bathroom for a restaurant full of ppl 1noise level 1"

1/19/2015,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon gets five stars for being friggin' amazing for having impeccable service and delicious food.We were seated within ten minutes during a Sunday afternoon lunch rush. We quickly chose the meat we wanted to order and they were brought out to us almost immediately--despite the restaurant being packed to the edges! Huge plus for customer service.Waitresses were all very attentive and nice--they filled our water glasses without us asking, came over when they saw we were low on meat and other side dishes, and gave us huge smiles. We felt super duper welcomed.The prices for their AYCE on a weekend were around $20, give or take. Meats were delicious. Seriously, I don't think you can beat this service anywhere else. They willingly stuck the birthday cake we brought with us in their refrigerator, which was nice, too.I'll be coming back very, very soon. My new favorite KBBQ place!"
10/20/2017,3 star rating,"I've been here many times and I haven't been here long since I don't live in this part of town and may I say things have notably changed and management has become a bit frugal? I would have to say that their customer service is top notch and they do cook for you and often coming back to check on you as well. Okay, so the menu pricing/food was A-OK for me! If I remember correctly, they use to have couple menu pricing for you to choose from and I always choose the option with more meat options but this time you only get one menu pricing and not only that they took away the tofu soup on the menu and also steak options. I didn't see any steak on the menu. I took my brother and his girlfriend here and being from out of town they were already WOWed at the place but I've been here before and I wasn't 100% satisfy. I wish I was WOWed with a good experience but I just can't. Â Not only that, I keep on telling my brother and my friends how great this restaurant was. I will have to take my words back now. The wait is very long on the weekend so make sure everyone in your party is here and are expected to wait. Also, I wouldn't even ATTEMPT to find parking spaces and just give the poor valet attendant $2 to park your car. My favorite these days is Mr. BBQ in Fullerton. That place's been hitting the spot for quality meat, food, and services!"
8/25/2014,5 star rating,"My favorite AYCE kbbq spot this far. Thankfully, my schedule sends me here during slower hours of business so waits are never more than 10 min.Great selection of meats, great sides, and pretty consistent service. For the price, best I've found in the city."
9/12/2015,3 star rating,"It's 3:43 a.m., and I'm still burping meats and passing kimchi gas. Â The meat sweats have been coming out of my pores for hours now, and I can't sleep. Â These are the consequences of AYCE KBBQ, and this is my aha moment.We've been eating here for years... ever since undergrad... except now I'm turning 30, and eating hordes and hordes of cheap meat has lost its thrill. Â I observed two things earlier tonight at Hae Jang Chon: (1) The meat does not taste good. Â There's a distinct not-so-fresh scent if the meat hasn't been dipped in the condiments before eating. It's almost gamey, but I know we aren't having lamb.(2) Where did all the Koreans go? Something is up when you don't hear any Korean from the customers at a Korean restaurant. Â The Koreans must know where the high quality stuff is at... yeoooohhh.I want the meat that hasn't been ""marinating"" in the fridge for weeks. Â If you can afford to pay more than $20, get yourself something nice elsewhere. Â It's time to mooove on to fresher beef.My #gainzbro and #brotein days are over. Â Soowon, anyone?"
7/4/2015,5 star rating,"I'm from the Bay Area and I have to say that there isn't a Korean BBQ place that comes close to it in the Bay.A 5 hour drive down the 5 plus the 1-2 hour wait isn't so bad for this AYCE BBQ. Besides the service which is adequate yet reluctant, I will say that the quality of meat is phenomenal.There are a few must try's:-marinated bulgogi (wonderfully marinated)-both types of pork belly (thick and thin slices)-brisket was delicious as wellTips:-Valet is ONLY A 2 dollars!-When they say an 1.5 hour wait, it's more like 45 minutes-If you're ""too slow"" the people help you cook it.-Cut the larger Slabs of meat in multiple pieces so it can cook faster and more evenly.Happy Eating!"
7/22/2017,5 star rating,"Food has always been amazing here, especially for the price you pay. The service was also very good. Meat is fresh and they do have a large variety. The only problem is that, unless you have a party or 5 or more, the wait is almost 2 hours long every time you go for dinner."
8/7/2018,5 star rating,"Very delighted with the experience here, our server Jayden, was very attentive. We had told him it was our first time in and told us how we should eat the meat and even cooked it for us. I really enjoyed the BBQ chicken, Spicy beef and the Short rib. To my surprise the kimchi pancakes were delicious, by itself I didn't enjoy it but as a pancake that's a whole different story. I will definitely be coming back and recommending this to anyone that wants to go to a great Korean BBQ place. I forgot to add that this place gets a bit warm keep your glass of water full at all times."
7/22/2013,5 star rating,"This is my favorite AYCE Korean Barbecue place. The meat is top-quality for AYCE, the price is reasonable, and the selection for both meats and banchan is awesome. On top of that, they use stone grills here, which makes the experience and taste all the better. I appreciate the included pancake and kimchi-fried rice. It's well worth the trip and the price tag.I don't know what people are complaining about with reservations -- you CAN make reservations before 6pm, and as with most KBBQ, I don't see why you would go during 6pm to 10pm anyway. Those are peak hours! Come for early dinner. I like to come here for lunch, where the service is top-notch and the staff are more attentive to your needs.With that said, the fifth star is awarded to Hae Jang Chon because of their excellent service and staff. Sure, there may be a wait, especially when crowded. But their friendliness and efficiency, along with their thoughtfulness in the number of meats you need for your group, when to ask for more orders, etc. makes it the best it can be."
3/9/2018,5 star rating,best korean bbq hands down and all you can eat. You cant come to LA for k bbq and not think of this restaurant. Be prepared to wait but its definitely worth it
3/9/2018,3 star rating,"I was starving coming off my flight, but I was still underwhelmed by their flavor development for my liking. banchan: kimchi was ok, fermented well enough just kind of not memorable; fish cakes, potato apple salad, lettuce salad was good-balanced vinegar and umami, I had an extra bowl of that!, spinach, julienned radish. My biggest upset really though is that their brisket had that meaty, gamey, almost rancid flavor. It came out par-frozen, cutely rolled whatever, bright red, but just something about that taste... they offer enough variety of meats to suit all tastes!!! Not the best kbbq not the worst I've had in LA even though was AYCE. Great service however!"

11/25/2012,3 star rating,"I was really looking forward to this place so maybe my expectations were too high. Â The wait was pretty long as there were quite a few people ahead of us but we somehow got in early than anticipated because I think some people left or weren't around when they were called. Â The meat choices were plentiful. Â I liked the short ribs, bulgogi, bbq chicken, brisket, calamari, and pork belly. Â There weren't as many sides as other places but it's all about grilling your meat. Â The biggest downside was the use of the same tongs for the raw meat and the cooked meat - that's a one star deduction minimum and more if anyone gets sick."
4/25/2018,5 star rating,"Great spot for Korean bbq. For the price of the all-you-can-eat, I am surprised with the quality of the meat. The marinated short ribs is a must! The only the disappointment is, we can't order the kimchi fried rice at the beginning. By the time we are done with the meat, we are too full for the fried rice."
1/20/2018,5 star rating,"Come here and come early. Best advice is to beat the crowd, sit down, and enjoy your all you can eat experience. They give great service here for an all you can eat. The selection and quality of meat is one of the best I've found, especially in a place where korean bbq is plentiful. Will be back for more."

1/18/2016,5 star rating,"This is the go to for KBBQ in K-Town! AYCE for $25 with plenty of options. It's always a crowd whenever I go, if you want to go during non-peak hours it's probably best to go around 2-5 otherwise there will most likely be a line upon arrival.I've been here numerous times and always bring out of town friends here and everyone loves it! All the sides are delicious and the meats are tender and juicy.Love getting the bulgogi, pork belly, kimchi pancake, marinated short rib, the least goes on but those are definitely the must haves every time there.They cook and cut the meat for you so everything is done relatively quick and are pretty attentive for the most part. When it gets hectic it's a little more difficult to flag someone down if you need something. Going there to eat again tonight so thought I'd leave a positive review after so many times out to this place. If you're ever craving kbbq, don't pass on this spot!"
2/28/2018,4 star rating,i was in the area on vacation & m group loves kbbq. we found this place by searching online. well we had to pay to park but that's city life i guess (we're small town folk haha). but it was only $2 so not a huge deal. the food was great! they had all our kbbq favorites. i liked all the side sauces. this place is all you can eat & the grill on the table was made of stone...genius! the meats cooked nicely & tasted great. the staff is very hands on so they'll take over the cooking for you to speed things up. if i had the chance i'd love to come back!
6/25/2013,5 star rating,"I loveeee me some korean BBQ and if I have to get AYCE (usually I don't) I prefer going here. They open late and cater to large parties. Â Quality and selection of meat is great and the servers are helpful. Â I don't like to get full off of food I dislike, so I'm usually pretty conservative and I'll stick with basics: galbi, brisket, and pork shoulder. Someone in my party did order intestine once... we asked the waiter if it was done.. he looked skeptically at it and said.. ""longer."" Â  I was amused.. but decided to skip the intestine.Sides are tasty and the staff keeps 'em coming. My favorite is their kimchi pancake which a lot of places don't offer."
11/5/2018,1 star rating,"FOR COLLEGE KIDS ON A BUDGET ONLY...!!! IF you Enjoy waiting One Hour 15 minutes Minimum for a Table, RUDE Service, Loud Screeching music piped in on a Sub-par Sound System, being Bumped in the back of your chair every 3 minutes by a Bus Cart, and a Disorganized Receptionist at the Front who walks around with a Legal Pad shouting your name!...then this is the place for you. To say my Family and I were Highly Disappointed by this ""AYCE"" BBQ place is an Understatement. After waiting one hour and 30 minutes outside (no seating) our Family of Five were rudely shuttled to our table for (4) by a Front staff that acted as if we were ""Lucky"" to be in their presence. Then, we were greeted by a Server who looked Haggard & Hating Life (more than we at this point) who muttered something under his breath. When I politely asked him to repeat his question, this young man Server, raised his voice to a very un-Friendly decibel and stated rather than asked ""You're all here for the All you can eat, Right?!!"" His tone was beyond rude! To add further insult, when my Husband later inquired why only he (and not my mom and me) had received our Tofu soup which he had ordered, this SAME Server Loudly Back-Talked (sorry there's no other way to describe this!) ""It Takes Time To Cook Sir!"" Excuse us, my husband only inquired Once after waiting 45 minutes. BTW, my mom and I NEVER Received our Tofu Soup...! This Level of Service, Even from a Sub-par Dirty Restaurant, Is Unacceptable. We will stick to Our FAVORITE Korean BBQ Restaurant: Â CHOSUN GALBEE, where the Service and Food is Infinitely Superior. AND, if it's AYCE BBQ you're in the mood for. I Strongly Suggest GEN KOREAN BBQ HOUSE, with Two Locations: Â Alhambra & Glendale. You'll wait 1/4 the time bc they have much Larger, Cleaner, Comfortable & Nice Looking Venues, Great Friendly Service, The Food is Amazing, Ample Parking, and to boot!...LACK that Draconian Rule: Â ""You don't Finish the meat, we charge Extra $$$!"""
6/23/2015,3 star rating,"I don't see what all the fuss is about this place besides the fact that it takes forever to get passed the line and actually be seated. My AYCE go-to is Ok-kook, but that's another story.Anyways, I didn't really find many items here to be that memorable. In fact, I don't think I remember any one particular type of meat standing out from the others, because all of them were forgettable to say the least. The burner had to have gone out a couple of times I was dining here, so that was really annoying, because that meant I had to wait even longer for my meats to be ready to eat-- I wonder if that's what contributes to the long lines... I'll come back here one of these days and give it another try, but for now I'll go to Ok-kook for my fill of AYCE KBBQ."
6/23/2015,3 star rating,"Came in for dinner with a coworker. Neither of us have ever been here before despite working right across it lolI've heard awesome things about this place and I always see a huge line for it. Since we came right after ending work, there was no line and we were seated right away. The service was quick and friendly. We were served our sides right away and after a glance at the menu, we got to ordering. The beef brisket was pretty decent. Nothing to write home about. I really liked the tongue though! The marinated kalbi was okay...probably wouldn't order it again. LolI will admit I was a little disappointed. I read all the great reviews and was expecting some bomb ass kbbq. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I didn't enjoy my experience here! It's just that it fell way below my expectations. I probably would never wait to eat here. I honestly think there are other AYCE kbbq places that are just as decent (if not better) as here."
5/12/2015,5 star rating,"Wow this place is amazing!They have a great selection of meat, and the quality is really good. The stone grill that you cook on was new to me, but it did a wonderful job cooking the meats. The service here is incredible! The workers here are very attentive and generous with helping their customers. they really earn their tips here. What was surprising was that they cooked for us! And our food never got burnt! thats how much attention you get from Â these waiters/waitresses. They do little rounds at each table so you dont ever need to call for them (They don't even have the table ringer on the side because its not even necessary here). We had a party of 10 and was late by almost an hour and they were kind enough to still let us in. The separated us into 2 tables but its ok cause it was our fault. But there was no hostility and they treated us wonderfully making our experience here amazing.Parking here is kind of a pain. If you dont want to drive around looking for a spot to parallel in they offer valet in the little plaza that they are in. Overall, this is one of the top kbbq places that i've been to and i would highly recommend everyone to check it out!"
5/12/2015,5 star rating,"This is my all time favorite korean bbq place ever and I will continue coming here for as long as I have korean bbq cravings. Note that it does get busy because they are so popular, so if you come during the weekend or maybe even a weeknight, there will be a wait. One time I came on a Saturday night and the wait was over an hour, I was sad that the wait was so long but I was hungry and opted to eat somewhere else instead even though I was still dreaming about Hae Jang Chon.Anyway, I've been here enough times to have tried a lot of things on their menu and get a feel for the place. What stands out to me here is definitely their service. They are quick, efficient, kind, and get me all the meat my heart desires. One of my favorite servers is Sarah, she's such a sweetheart! All the servers so far have been great, but I remember Sarah because she was just so sweet and always quick with anything we needed.My favorite things here are the beef tongue(drool) thinly sliced pork belly (extra drool) and thick pork belly (I just died in pork Â belly heaven) and the brisket! I've tried several other things as well like the abomasum, baby octopus, shrimp, rib meat and others these are the staples that I always get. The meat quality here is excellent, the stone grill cooks everything well without anything sticking to it and the fat spills out on the side of the grill so you don't get it with your food. The sides here are also great and plentiful. I have nothing but love for this place because every time I come I'm reminded of why this is my favorite korean bbq place. So do yourself a favor and come here at least once and you'll see why this place is so popular and has great reviews. For excellent service and great food $21.99 per person is a steal!"
7/12/2018,5 star rating,Service plus the food was great. They help you cook your food and always check up on you. I just wish they had booths available. Â I think theres only one long one. The only downside is you have to wait to be seated for long time because its so busy and they only have one type of beer.
4/18/2018,4 star rating,The food here was really good for the price. To make it short it is worth to eat here if u can eat a lot. In the end it would of cost the same as kang ha do. I still prefer that place over here. The wait is always over 1 hr.
6/14/2016,4 star rating,"I love the taste of the meat compared to other KBBQ places I've eaten at. It's not overly seasoned to me, just right. Their Kimchi Pancake was delicious. Good portions. Decent prices. Easy, valet parking. Always a good eating experience at this place."
7/12/2019,5 star rating,"My husband and I waited to be called in for about 1.5 hour, but it was definitely worth the wait. The food was excellent, the service was great and the vibe was good. The music could have be turned down a notch but other than that it was an overall great experience."
2/24/2018,2 star rating,"The un-marinated meat is seriously lacking in quality and the marinated meat is salty and overly sweet, almost teriyaki-like which is a big no no in my book. Â Service is good but was very disappointed with the meat. Â Years ago used to be one of the best AYCE but wouldn't return."
5/26/2017,5 star rating,"I'm from Houston so we don't have as many Korean BBQ places as LA does but I have been to many places that I thought was great. However, this place tops any place in Houston by far. Everyone there was extremely nice and attentive. Everything was so delicious but the pork shoulder had to be my favorite. If you're ever in the area and looking for a place to eat, this place is a must!"
5/21/2017,5 star rating,"Well worth the wait. The quality of the meats as great, would recommend the BBQ squid and thin pork belly. The great food is matched with the great customer service they have here. Everyone is so attentive and able to help you. About 4 different people came to ask how we were doing and to help cool our meal. Definitely will recommend this to friends."
12/16/2016,5 star rating,"Excellent quality meat for AYCE kbbq! I thoroughly enjoyed my food and so did my boyfriend. We got here on a Friday night around 6PM, expecting a LOOOONG wait, but the only wait involved was me waiting for my boyfriend to park the car. Turns out if you come around 6, there isn't much of a wait. My bf dropped me off first, and when I put my name down, the worker said he would able to seat me right away if I had my whole party there. Welp, I didn't, so he told me just let him know when they were. I waited about 10 minutes or so until my bf came in, and after letting them know, we were sat down in less than 5 minutes. Once we sat down, our orders came out SO fast - exactly how kbbq should be! We would do 3 meats each order, and as our meat cooked, they would ask what we wanted for the next round. Then BAM, our next order is already on our table when our last order round of meat is about ready to eat. It was just so efficient! Also, another huge plus is that they do cook the meat for you! Sure you can move the meat around yourself, but if you don't touch it enough, they'll pretty much take over to ensure your meat cooks right. Oh, at the end of your meal, they offer kimchi fried rice, which is cooked right in front of you on the grill. Pretty awesome if you ask me :)BTW, their spicy meat choices are really spicy, like holy-moly-spicy-as-hell-mouth-burning-spicy. I love spicy foods, but that was some crazy stuff. I tried their spicy beef, and I had to eat it so fast cause if I didn't, I wouldn't have been able to finish it. I also downed like 2 cups of water as I ate it D: Tasty, but spicy! Also, the short rib is amazing. Get it! Anywho, this place has great service and great food. Parking is paid valet if you're into that, but free street parking is available - just got to go look for it, which could take a while. Come early too! When we left at 7:30, there were SO many people waiting outside. You can call & make reservations, but only for large parties. Price is a kind of expensive for AYCE kbbq, but you can't beat the quality and service. Overall, super duper recommend!"
4/1/2015,4 star rating,"I came here a few weeks ago, and it was pretty fantastic.This place is located in K. Town in a small little plaza-- like super small. But hey, at least there's valet parking so you don't need to find a parallel parking spot like a crazy person. However, it does cost a few dollars here and there.Upon arrival, we had to wait for like 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad. But maybe because we came at a good time? Not sure, but it wasn't too bad!The service was decent, nothing to complain about here. On a cooler side, the workers here do work a lot by cleaning the grill with radish-- so that's pretty cool and fancy.As for the food, it was pretty good. I really enjoyed the basic goods, like brisket (and that's about it). With that being said, this place probably has the best beef brisket. In fact, I loved their brisket so much, I didn't even get anything else. Okay I lied, maybe beef tongue and the ribs-- but they weren't too crazy to brag about. ACTUALLY, the rib was pretty good here as well. The sides here are not too shabby either. Also, you get fried kim chi fried rice which is pretty nifty because they cook it in front of you. Talk about a bennihanna experience!Overall, I really enjoyed my time here. I really loved their brisket and the kim chi fried rice. Would I come back? Probably if I'm in the area-- but probably not cause I live a little far from this place. On another note, I wish there was more of a variety like finger short rib, etc. Other than that, this place is pretty awesome!Turn Ons:- Great brisket!"
6/8/2018,2 star rating,The meat was so chewy my jaw started hurting 5 minutes into the meal. Everything is pretty mediocre and can't compare to other places around ktown. The service was okay but really only 1 girl was nice. The fumes blow right into your face so it was a very unpleasant experience. I would not recommend going here.
8/24/2015,4 star rating,I usually don't eat that much meat. That is probably more a product of the people that I went with than the restaurant. The few vegetables I saw were good. In spite of that I would go back. This place always has a line outside so that is a good sign. Mostly people in their 20s. Valet parking was pretty efficient.
7/31/2017,1 star rating,I visited 07/30/2017 Sunday for lunch. As I arrived we were quickly seated to a table that had banchan (side dishes) and salad and other items already served at the table before we were seated. I was a little shocked and told the server is this table ready cause there is still food on the table. The server told me that they put the salads and banchan on all tables.. I looked around and all the tables had side dishes and salad already served..If this is a new trend for restaurants to serve food before guest are seated i hope they stop this is disgusting. Im sure there are flies/gnats going around! This is ridiculous. I honestly just walked out and went to another korean bbq place a few blocks down.
10/24/2016,5 star rating,"LOVED this place! on our recent trip to LA, we stayed in koreatown. upon arrival, we turned to yelp for top AYCE kbbq places, where we stumbled upon this restaurant. we were a little lost at first, since we werent sure if we were suppose to cook ourselves (as we typically do at other ayce kbbq joints), since our waiter appeared to have taken on that role.all of our selections came out in HUGE portions each time, so we never really had to order items twice. we pretty much received enough to satisfy our hunger on almost everything we ordered the first time. i think the only item we ordered over and over again was the short ribs since it came out as 2-3 long slabs each time, which wasnt enough for our party of 5. and maybe also because it was THE BEST short ribs ive ever tasted! surprisingly, it came without the usual bones im used to, but holy moly...the texture and flavoring was so on point! another surprisingly pleasant thing was the squid- it came out and cooked as a whole gigantic piece, only to be cut into bite size once its ready to be served. soo flavorful! miso soup was also great. i dont think i was unhappy with any of the items ordered, except the honeycomb tripe. that was kind of nasty.wait staff around here appears to work as a team- making stops at tables that were not theirs to help flip the meat or mix the food around so its evenly cooked. they were all pretty efficient at getting us what we ordered in a timely manner. the only complaint i had was our actual waiter who was in charge of our table. hes quick on his feet and definitely impressive with speed, but i literally had to cram requests in to catch him before he whizzes off to the next. it all felt too rushed, to the point where my table and i felt uncomfortable to even ask for anything because he appeared to busy and had no time for us. as a matter of fact, the other wait staff helping out did most of his job for him- refilling our waters, getting us refills on items we need, etc. i didnt like that at all. if you are primarily responsible for our table, then give us a few minutes of your time at the very least! he even mixed up one of our orders because his head appeared to be thinking about his next move the entire time. and no, we couldnt even catch him to fix it since it was the end of our meal and we were too full to even try."
1/4/2018,5 star rating,"I really do love this place. I've been here twice now, once for lunch and once late-night, after a show at the Wiltern. Both experiences were great, I've been lucky to not have to wait long at all either time, and the servers have been very helpful with meat suggestions and explaining about everything that's going on and how it's all supposed to work. $23 for lunchtime AYCE is a great deal! Ice cold Hite goes great with the meal and the side dishes are good and flavorful. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good Korean BBQ while in Los Angeles. I (we) will definitely be back!"

1/7/2015,5 star rating,"It was a quiet end of December evening before NYE and before most of LA returned home from their vacations and trips back to see the family. My 2 friends and I decided that we really wanted to try some authentic Korean BBQ as we'd grown tired of the SFV's offerings. After going through yelp reviews and soliciting advice on FB, Hae Jang Chon clearly was the place to try. We arrived at 8pm and found the spot packed! The valet even told me that they were not accepting any more cars at this point! This is on a quiet Tuesday mind you. Most the groups waiting were Korean and our anticipation grew as we knew we found the right spot. We were told 30 minutes for the wait and apparently this seems to be what they tell everyone. We actually ended up waiting about 75 minutes total but soon enough we found ourselves seated around the stone grill, peering with jealous anticipation at the neighboring tables and their piles of short rib, brisket, galbi, and more. The server was at our table promptly and we started with some delicious potato pancake that the waitresses suggested. Soon after that, it began. Over the next 45 minutes, we enjoyed hearty helpings of Short Rib, Bugolgi, pork belly, squid, & galbi. The server team was very helpful and would frequently come by to flip our meat (not sure if this is common practice or just because we looked like we didn't know what we were doing) or see if we wanted any more servings. The food was all excellent, but the short rib and bugolgi were the stand outs for me. If you want an out of this world dining experience, Hae Jang Chon is the place to go!"
2/17/2016,5 star rating,"Five stars for cooking the meat for us cause we suck at it.My friend had been hyping this spot up for me, and it definitely was worth the wait! We went on a Saturday night and waited about an hour or so. The parking in the area sucks, so be warned. We actually left and went to the H-mart plaza nearby, but they check in once in awhile to make sure you haven't left so I suggest you stay. I like the salad that they provide! As for the meat, make sure you get the short rib, beef tongue, brisket and thin slice pork belly. The first three are my go-to, but it was the first time I've seen thin slice pork belly on a kbbq menu. I wish it was at every kbbq place. We got the steamed egg and kimchi pancake for the sides, and they were a good addition to the meal. For the last serving, we decided to order the hotdogs to see if they were special Korean hotdogs - but they were not - so be warned, they are just regular franks."
2/28/2015,4 star rating,"this is my second time here, and the service seemed pretty good. it came in clutch being the only place open at 1am, and the service was alright until they started cleaning up.sometimes the meat was slow, sometimes they'd bring it quickly.i would like to give props to the workers and security guard for putting up with (probably) drunkies not wanting to pay the bill. and not going balistic on them when i know they really wanted to. way to stay professional guys!avoid coming in late if you don't want to see drama lol. as for the price.... i'm not really loving that part. its really expensive for what you get. it wont be my first option, but i'll come bck again"

8/12/2018,5 star rating,"We were on vacation in SoCal and decided to visit Korea Town and eat at one of its All you can eat BBQs. Â It was a Â 1 hour + wait , but it SO worth it! When they finally called our name, our table was already set up. Â There were various side dishes, salad, and multiple dipping sauces, and all we had to do was pick out our meats. Â They had 25 choices and we cooked it all on a natural stone. Meat selection was awesome, Service is great, again, well worth the wait!"
11/17/2014,3 star rating,"-- This review is coming from a veggie --Came with a group of meat eaters. If your group is 8+ you can make a reservation, which I highly recommend as the wait is at least an hour. Our group was smaller so we placed our name on the list and walked next door to a bar in the same shopping center and had some beer while we waited. There is only one vegetarian option, Bibimbap, which is basically a hot dish with white rice and quiet a few of the fixings/sides (that are already on the table for everyone) with an egg on top and it comes with a bean soup. It is $12 and you can also eat the unlimited sides that are placed on the table for everyone. Overall as a vegetarian I still managed to eat a lot and leave full although I'm sure my fullness was nothing compared to my meat eater friends. I would not go back by choice but it is nice to know that there is an option if you go with a group of friends."
2/8/2015,5 star rating,"This place is amazing. Hands down. I've been to a couple of other KBBQ places in the LA area, and the quality of meat, sides, service, and all-around experience at Hae Jang Chon compares to none. I went with a couple of girlfriends very early on a Saturday evening, and because we arrived before 5:00pm, we only had to wait about 30-40 mins, which is really good for a Saturday dinner at this place. I've tried to go in the past but couldn't wait for the 2+ hours to be seated. That being said, I'm really sad I never went before during my 4 years in college in LA. It's just that good.We ordered brisket, tongue, thin sliced pork belly, and bulgogi. All were superb, I especially liked how the pork belly came in a thin sliced option, because it cooked much faster. Whatever it takes to minimize cooking time is a win in my book. All of the meat here is really high quality, and even though we got full relatively quickly, I wanted to keep eating because it was just so yummy. The kimchi pancake and steamed egg are especially good here too. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat the kimchi fried rice, it was too spicy! My friends who had been before said that it was spicier than usual that day too. I really liked how clean everything in the restaurant was. The grills were great, and it was nice to not completely reek of meat afterwards, because the place had great ventilation. Our server was fantastic, too, he was super attentive and never let our water glasses get empty. I can't wait to be back next time I visit LA!"
11/16/2012,4 star rating,"Bottom line (at the top): my first time having Korean BBQ so I'm not sure how accurate this review will be but I really enjoyed it! --You can pick four meats at a time and we had BBQ chicken, bulgogi, marinated beef, and beef brisket and actually were too full to get anymore. They give you a bunch of kimchi, a small bowl of mashed potatoes and apple, and your choice of kimchi fried rice or steamed rice comes out at the end. I'm not really sure why you can't get it in the beginning or middle but they give it to you after you finish your meat so.. Just a heads up. The kimchi pancake they give you is sooo good. Love love loved it. I'll have to ask some of my Korean friends at USC for more kbbq recommendations! This was a good start I think :)"
5/27/2018,5 star rating,Best KBBQ. Affordable if you have an appetite large enough to eat a cow. Long waits on the weekends so get there early and find parking. Service is great and it's a fun and casual place to hang or celebrate.
5/27/2018,5 star rating,This Korean bbq is excellent. The meat and vegetables are fresh. I love their salad. I started eating kimchi when I tasted their kimchi rice
11/13/2017,5 star rating,This place is a little expensive but it's really great! Love coming here on date night and the staff is always so kind!! Love the beef brisket it's a must try!!
2/7/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing place, Â went late night hours and had a great time with no wait at all. Â Best Korean BBQ restaurant I've been too in a long time. Â Appreciate the hospitality by the waiters all around, Â will be back soon."
9/14/2013,5 star rating,"I've always been really hesitant to try AYCE kbbq places that are more than $9.99 because I know my expectations will increase and going to cheap places will just be terrible in comparison. I hope that doesn't happen the next time I go to cheap kbbq because HJC was definitely worth the $18.99 price tag. Out of all the meats I liked the beef tongue, thin pork belly, and shrimp. The tongue is so tender and just melts in your mouth. Banchan is just your standard. I like that the workers clean the grill with radish. Kimchijeon, kimchi bokkeumbap, and doenjang jjigae at the end are all amazing. Will definitely come here whenever I want to splurge on kbbq."
7/18/2016,5 star rating,"We enjoyed the barbecue! The place was packed but the host was able to give us a table for 3 in 15 minutes. A lovely place for family and friends to celebrate Birthdays and special occasions. Â I would recommend the bolgogi, it's the best!"
10/26/2018,4 star rating,"Came here on a Friday night and ended up waiting almost 2 hours to be seated. Can't really be mad about that considering it was a Friday night and apparently this place is pretty popular. Despite the wait I really enjoyed everything. The ban chan was very good. I especially liked the kimchi and the greens. Their sauces on the side were nice as well. They have two spicy sauces, sesame oil, and a brisket sauce. I liked the spicy sauces and the sesame oil wasn't too salty. I thought the brisket sauce was some of the best I've had. They have a stone grill set up which was so nice to cook on. In my opinion it's much better than other standard kbbq grills. After we cooked some marinated short rib they cleaned the grill with some radish(?) and it worked really well. I've never seen that before but I loved it. I come to kbbq for the meat obviously and I do think the meat here is a higher quality than most ayce kbbq places I've been to. We had brisket, (a staple and my favorite, very good with brisket sauce) unmarinated and marinated short rib ( I personally prefer unmarinated), thinly sliced pork belly, (not as heavy as I'm used to which I like) , and beef tongue. All were very good quality as long as you do not over cook them. Service was awesome. Everything came out very fast, always had water, and the waiter was very responsive. Overall, I think this place was extremely solid I just wish I hadn't waited so long. I would say the max amount of time I would wait to eat here would be an hr. If you're hungry not a bad idea to go somewhere else. Would definitely come back on a weekday. The price is right for the quality of the meat."

9/27/2015,5 star rating,"Couldn't wait to try Korean BBQ in Los Angeles' Ktown during our honeymoon. We chose Hae Jang Chon and were so pleased with our dinner!We stopped by on a Sunday night. While the place was packed we were able to get a table for 2 very quickly. This is an all-you-can-eat restaurant, so when we sat our side dishes were already set and we just had to ask for the meats we wanted. We started with our favorites - bulgogi and kalbi - and got to try several other meats before totally filling up. We also got the kimchi pancakes which are not big in the Midwest so I had never had them, but they were amazing! Our service was great. We had two people stop by and help us out every few minutes, even helping us cook and cut our meats. One of the best Korean BBQ experiences I've had!FYI - we couldn't find much self-parking in Ktown, so bring cash for valet unless you plan to walk. It was also very hot in the restaurant, but it was 100* outside that day so it might not always be so uncomfortable inside."
8/17/2015,5 star rating,"Went here for my late birthday dinner & it is by far the best KBBQ I've ever had. Their side dishes were really flavorful. Their meats and seafood were really good and I really want to go back! Next time I'm in SoCal I'm definitely taking another trip to this restaurant.They have valet parking for only $2, not sure if that fluctuates during the day. We went there at around 11pm.This place is also great because they're open really late! So if you have a craving for KBBQ, this is the place to go."
6/25/2017,5 star rating,Worth the wait. Food & sides are fantastic! Great service considering that were busy.
8/12/2015,4 star rating,"Went today (8/12/15) and was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the meat was delish and I managed to walk away without feeling like I would go into hibernation. Finally tried the kimchi fried rice--I totally recommend you try it on your visit, it was soooo good!"
8/1/2015,3 star rating,"YUMMY. I live two blocks away, so this will be my go-to KBBQ place. I love the flat skillet, which drains out of this opening; they come and clean it when it becomes dirty. I really, really like the amount and quality of meat here. They come often to ask for more meat orders (you can order up to 4 options if you are in a party of 2-3)--so you do not have to harass the server/waiter for more meat. My favorites are the brisket, bulgogi, spicy pork, beef short ribs, thin pork belly, kimchi pancake, salad, and radish wraps. I wish they had more dipping sauces, the one they provide is gross and not the sweet soy sauce one that I am used to at other KBBQ joints. I want to try the kimchi fried rice, but both times I have been I was too full at the end. Additionally, the service is questionable. The first time I went, our server was helpful and polite--he helped us tend to the meat. The second time, the server was clearly more focused on flirting with girls at an adjacent table, right in front of us! Really dude? You ain't getting no numbers. FOH. Despite his failings, he offered the kimchi pancake, steamed rice, and egg souflee, which the first guy never did.Although I like this place, I do think it would be better if it were a tad bit cheaper."
6/30/2019,5 star rating,The food is great! I love the bulgogi and short rib. Our waiter Rion is really nice and warm! Thank you Rion! :) we will come back again !
5/20/2018,5 star rating,"What a fun dining experience! Can't beat the value of AYCE KBBQ + quality of meat + service. I much prefer KBBQ on a stone grill over the metal. The marinated meats were my favorite- if you fill up quickly, ask for half orders. Save room for the kimchi fried rice which is prepared at the end of the meal. Although the wait can easily be 1-1.5 hours during prime dining times, there's $2 valet parking and a chill bar a few doors down. Make sure to check in with the host or stick near the front as they will call your name earlier to check if you are there."
8/4/2015,3 star rating,"After having some fun at KCON, the group decided on eating Korean food. Upon arriving at the location, we couldn't find any parking since the plaza had little parking so we parked somewhere along the neighborhood streets. Â There was valet too, but we choosed not to use it. Â Entering the restaurant it was packed with people and cramped with many tables and due to the weather it was somewhat humid inside. The wait for my party of 4 wasn't too long, about 15 minutes.They had a selection of for 4 assorted ban Chan on each side of the table and 4 different sauces for each person. Â We started out with brisket, short rib, and bulgogi. Â The meat arrived frozen compared to many other Korea bbq place. Â The meat was fresh and cooked fast, Â which I enjoyed. Â We had squid, shrimp, intestine, and mushrooms which were good too. Â We finished it off with kimchi fried rice, I thought I could have used a bit of more flavor. Â I wish they had tofu soup though that would have been a plus. The food quality over all was very good which trumps most ayce bbq. Something of the things I didn't enjoy that happened. We had an unfortunate grease spill due to the plate or whatever wasn't placed near the grill, but no problem it did not get far. Â We got kimchi pancakes, which we didn't ask for and they didn't take it back... It was difficult talking to our Â server due to her Â thick accent and that she didn't follow up with what we asked for at multiple occasions."
3/22/2018,5 star rating,"Always a long line and wait, many times on weekends over an hour, with pictures of celebrities eating here. Â Many young beautiful people here and a definite hot spot. Â Great all you can Korean BBQ on a stone grill where the juices are not dripped out. Â Lots of all you can eat buncheon side dishes too."
5/18/2016,5 star rating,"First things first, they have stone grills which are much more convenient for cooking as well as space for the table. No charcoal= no smoke! The servers are always on the job making sure your party has its refills on drinks and sides as well providing you with any additional requests. You are allowed to cook the meats yourself but they do it too so there's really no need for you to do it. When you are seated the the sides are already there for your appetizing! The place is quite small and your whole party has to be there to be seated but the service is great I would really recommend this place for any KBBQ lovers!"
6/12/2017,5 star rating,"Quality of meat is on point! SO MANY OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM PLUS ITS ALL YOU CAN EAT. Love their soft boiled egg pot! Service was superb, my waiter was very patient and informative. Worth the one hour wait. Need to double check if they take reservation (perhaps for a certain party size)."
8/3/2015,5 star rating,"Is it just me or are all KBBQ a little pricey LolAnywho, LOVE this place! Â  Â  I was first brought here by a co worker.The wait time is CRAZY I do not want to mislead anyone and say it is worth it but there's obviously a long wait for a reason right?They have decent service for such a busy place. The're always checking up on you making sure your salad and other side ingredients are filled Â (but not to the point where you are annoyed or feel like they're rushing you out).Of course do be considerate of others, in my opinion, if you're done, pay up leave your tip and run across to HAUS and chit chat there!NOTE:* There's NEVER any parking there so do have your $2 (CASH ONLY) handy for valet.* You want coke? It's served in a can -_- feel free to bring your own can of coke (it's over Â  Â priced)"
5/17/2018,5 star rating,Have I not left a review for this place!?? I've been there at least 15 times and everytime it was the best experience of food in my life. The best kbbq ever. I'm in love with this place. 10 stars. Would not go anywhere else for kbbq.
11/1/2014,5 star rating,"Seriously, one of the best places I've eaten in Los Angeles. So glad I went here. Very very delicious, especially that black Angus beef brisket!! Please, take me back here!! Lol. Their little side dishes were scrumptious as well. Oh, and that pancake!! Mmmmm! We were even impressed with the tripe! Super good. Go here to satisfy your kbbq cravings!"
1/24/2013,4 star rating,"Food is good. Â  Â Party larger than 5 will be a pain because there's only 1-2 corners that can handle large parties.RESERVATIONS DON''T MEAN ANYTHING HERE. Â  Â Reserved a table for 8 people for 7:30 on Wednesday. Â  The entire party was here on time. Â  Â We had to wait another 50 minutes to be seated in 2 separate tables. Â  Â Advice: come here before 6:30, or after 8:30. Â Parties of 5 or smaller get in a lot faster.What's good:Beef tongue--yummyPork belly, thick slices--amazing when you cook it on a grille that needs to be deglazed Â (collected juices from other meats)Squid--it's good. Â Most of the time they don't serve you the tentacles though. Â  Wonder where they went. Kimchi pancake--soft inside, crispy outside after grillingThe condiments are good. Â  What's NOT good:Bulgogi--too sweet, too lean, not enough fat to make it tastyBeef abomasum: Â I think it's intestines--really chewy and tastes weirdBeef honeycomb (tripe): I'm more used to the Chinese kind in dim sum. Â This one tastes a lot stronger as an organ meat. Â  I think some people may like it though.Service is great once you sit down. Â  However, the girl lied to me when we were waiting, telling me that she would give me the 2 tables close to the entrance--but ended up giving them away to smaller parties."
6/27/2018,4 star rating,"This is my third time here in the span of 3 years. I chose it over Ã  la carte restaurant merely because the price would have ended up being the same, and I thought why not get bang for my buck? We came at 830pm on Monday night. For 3 people, the wait was 1 hour. Pretty much the same wait time as when I last went 2 years ago. Staff was very friendly. Once seated we were serviced right away, and food was prompt. I did not feel rushed, we took our time ordering food and they were patient when we said we would wait on ordering more meat while finishing our current meal.They were busy, per their usual I'm assuming, so our water, salad, sides and sauces went unfilled until we asked for them. But once asked they were very prompt and helped us right away. Meat quality it descent. Of course you're going to get better quality somewhere else, but for an AYCE I was pretty satisfied with their selection."
12/12/2017,5 star rating,"Omg I cannot believe I have not posted a review on my most favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in town. First of all, valet is $2. Second, yes the wait is long 1-2 hours. Third, the price ranges $27-$28 per person not including beverages. Last but not least, you will not be disappointed. The meats are delicious. All the meats and sides are included. The service for the most part is awesome. They can only split two credit cards FYI. Some people dress hella causual. Some people celebrate birthdays here and dress nicer. It is your choice. Common sense, if your party is not all together, you will not be seated. This place is on demand so make room for the ones who have been patiently waiting and are hungry."
1/5/2015,5 star rating,Best lunch special ever. $9.99 for their spicy bbq pork. Comes with lettuce wraps and bean paste soup.
5/12/2018,5 star rating,"I went on a trip to LA with my friends and of course, we had to try KBBQ in a new location. I saw that this was highly rated and it was for obvious reasons: the food, service, and interior. The food was good as other high-end AYCE restaurants, but for some reason this one had the best taste. Service was fast and friendly. The interior was so cute!!! Lighting was so bright and everything was nicely decorated with wooden furniture!!!!! I'm going to come here the next time I visit!!!!"
5/11/2018,5 star rating,Great bbq. Friendly staff. Even options for vegetarians - green kimchi salad was great
7/25/2018,5 star rating,"This was my first experience eating Korean BBQ, and it more than lived up to the hype. For those unfamiliar with the experience, you order meat from a varied menu and watch the food cook right on your table. My personal favorites were the brisket and the thin sliced pork belly (crispier than the thick cuts). Â I'd stick with the beef and pork selections over the chicken, which was decent but not the same level of quality. Be sure to bring an appetite, and try the dipping sauces!"
1/6/2015,4 star rating,"An original KBBQ experience. Â The meats are good quality and the veggies are fresh. Â The egg steam is on point and the ban chan (side dishes) and service are good. Â This place fills up quickly and most of the clientele are non-Korean. Â Mostly white folks and guys and girls who are on friend-dates. Â The thick stone grill is a nice touch, reminds me of cast iron and it heats up nice and hot. Â The brisket, tongue and galbi are all good eats. Â Ask for the garlic on the side :)Upon request they do the kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal...Here's a tip: Â What we do is cook up a couple slices of pork belly and kimchi. Â Cut them up and pull them to the side. Â Ask your server to bring on the rice and while he is mixing up your fried rice add the cooked pork belly and kimchi...let it sit and get all crispy on the bottom, enjoy some of the best kimchi fried rice with pork belly on the planet! Â You're welcome :)"

9/5/2015,5 star rating,"We came at 5:15ish and waited until 6:30ish to be seated. But we expected it when we called at 11 in the morning and they said they were reserved all the way from 5:30 until 9pm. The service here is AMAZING. Although there are so many people and so many customers, they really make an attempt to come serve you the best they can. Each time we wanted to cut our meat or squid, they came swiftly to cut it for us. Throughout the course of our meal, they came to clean our grill 3 times. The meat quality was really great and the beef tongue and squid are really tasty and delicious. This place also gives you 4 types of sauces as well as radish and rice paper wraps. The portions are great and it's unlimited. We asked for water and it was brought to us promptly each time. The price is great for the number of choices and service. $22 per person for dinner? That's amazing! The quality and the attention just can't be beat. I love this kbbq spot and I'll definitely be revisiting it soon!"

3/1/2015,4 star rating,"The service here is impeccable. I've never been treated so well at an AYCE kbbq restaurant. The waitress would come every few minutes to make sure the meat was cooking evenly and to see if we wanted to order any more. She would also clean our grill before we even had to ask, which is a first for me. Hae Jang Chon sets the bar in the service category. This is how it should be done at every kbbq joint.The variety of meat here is somewhat underwhelming, but the meat they did have was generally speaking very good. It was also portioned out nicely, such that we wouldn't have too much or too little of any meat at one time.The brisket was the best I've ever had. It was suuuper fatty and, with the help of the beautiful stone grill, didn't stick (first time ever). There wasn't any other meat that really stood out to me. Pork belly will always be pork belly. Good or bad quality, it's still freaking pork belly.Kimchi fried rice was a good way to end the meal. Cooking it on the stone grill created some nice crusties, just like what you would get in a dolsot bibimbap.Overall it was a top-notch kbbq experience, but I would probably choose other places over this due to the limited selection of meat."
4/29/2014,5 star rating,"Alright.. Where do I start?!?This is the KBBQ place I have been looking for. Not only is the meat the freshest I have had, but the service is amazing. Our server came to our table ASKING if we wanted more meat once our current plate of meat was placed on the stone grill. AND YES, they use a stone grill! Our server cleaned our grill with radish and soju after every two plates. What better service can u ask for? Amazing meat selection, amazhing side dishes, and kimchi fried rice. BOOM. 5 stars.. Worth the wait."
2/22/2015,4 star rating,"The restaurant is located in K-town where parking is a huge pain. Try to valet for $2-3 and save yourself a long walk. You will probably wait at least an hour for a table if you go during peak times or weekends - longer if you have a bigger party. You should at least stop by to drop your name, then go run an errand. Is the wait worth it? Hell yes! You cannot beat the price and quality of food.All of the meats are different in their own way. My favorites are pork belly, brisket, squid, and galbi. I am not a fan of beef tongue as they flavor is pretty unique to say the least. I would pass on the octopus, it lacked flavor and was kind of chewy. The kim chi fried rice towards the end is either a hit or miss. I had to add some salt and sauce because it was missing some flavor.Service is great here! I have been twice and both times, the service has been great. Also, if you need anything, there is a button to press for service. Don't abuse it though because then they won't come to you unless you press the button."
1/11/2015,5 star rating,"Absolutely love this Korean BBQ place. My favorite out of all the ones in KTown. I used to frequent the one on Wilshire and Wilton but they unfortunately keep changing up the menu. I come here quite often and the service and quality is extremely consistent. When the wait for a table is too long people have been known to order chicken from the place next door just to hold them over. 45 mins to an hour and a half. Not gonna lie, I've done this myself. This is a great place for large groups. Lively crowd during peak hours. Just be prepared for the wait."
11/25/2014,1 star rating,"Honestly, this place isn't horrible, and for the price - rock bottom - it's really not that bad, but I'm giving 1 star because the servers either don't know anything about meat or they are all in on a scheme to trick people into thinking that sirloin steak = galbi.Galbi literally translates to ""rib"" in Korean, and the meat is taken from the flesh surrounding the ribs. Sirloin is cut in slabs from the rear of the cow, and it feels/tastes completely different. What we were served - marinated just like traditional galbi and cut to mimic the look - was definitely sirloin. It looked like sirloin, felt like sirloin, and tasted like sirloin. Our server insisted - in Korean - that it was galbi. If I didn't buy ribs from the butcher and cut my own wang galbi from scratch, maybe I would have believed him. But I do... so I don't.Maybe I just came late (~midnight), and they had run out of the real galbi, but either way, I felt a little betrayed. This place literally left a bad taste in my mouth. But if you don't care if it's galbi or not, this place is fine. Just get a LOT of chadolbaegi and samgyupsal, and you'll - with some effort - eat your money's worth.EDIT: The owner responded with a zoomed in picture of a label or receipt that says ""short rib"". First, off, I didn't say this place NEVER serves short rib. As I wrote in the paragraph above, maybe they had run out of the real galbi by the time I got there at midnight. But what I had was definitely NOT short rib. Word to the owner: if you run out of short rib, just tell the patrons that instead of serving them marinated sirloin! And definitely don't call your patrons liars for knowing the difference..."
6/16/2018,4 star rating,"Short and sweet it's pretty solid Korean BBQ. Nice bunchon selection and attentive service. Beware they can't seat your party till everyone has arrived, but this place is worth a reasonable wait."
6/15/2016,4 star rating,"Went for lunch today. THE FOOD: Â Great meats. Great side dishes. The salad bowl should be bigger. Salad is a vital component at a Korean BBQ. I kept asking for a refill as the portions were too small and later got tired of asking although I wanted more. THE SERVICE: Â Great. The best attentive service I've ever had at a Korean restaurant. ATMOSPHERE: Â Clean, spacious, comfortable. SPECIAL NOTES: Â Love the stone pan used for cooking so the meats don't burn and leave a bitter taste. And they use the same pan to cook fried kimchi rice at the end. Most Korean BBQ's use some sort of grill. I did miss the charcoal flavor. I would have given 5 stars if they would have had some kind of light dessert such as shikae or green tea ice cream. We ended up walking a few blocks to coffee bean to get an ice americano. Overall. Great meal for $21.99 per person."

2/23/2016,5 star rating,Love this place. Service is at par and usually Korean spots have the worst service. You literally never have to cook yourselves if you don't want to. Servers are attentive and have a good attitude about it. The wait is long but you can go to a bar nearby to wait. Just check in and the host will accommodate. Food is awesome. Definitely an A-. Best place for an Ayce in ktown. This is a must go.

6/12/2016,4 star rating,"Parking is a pain so make some time for parking when you do go unless you don't mind paying for valet.I went with a group of four and we were quickly seated which was a good thing. Â The place got packed right after we went in. Â Waiting was probably over an hour for the people outside. Â Waiter wasn't talkative but he got straight to the point. Â All business and no personality. Â Got the all you can eat Korean bbq. Â The side dishes were really good. Â The variety of meats were plenty. Â I only ordered the safe choices. Â The typical brisket, ribs and bugolgi. Â All which were very good. Â My friends ordered the intestine which they said was alright and the octopus which they also said was alright. Â Overall I enjoyed it. Â I would recommend this place to anyone who has the belly for it. You're going to want to try everything."
9/5/2012,1 star rating,"If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all.... not! I cannot begin to wrap my brains around how this restaurant has 4 stars with over 1,000 reviews. I simply cannot.So we arrived on a Saturday night at 9:30pm, totally okay with having to wait for a table if necessary. But waiting for 2 freaking hours for a table in a half empty restaurant?? Are you kidding me?Apparently, they have a very strict 49 maximum occupancy limit. So strict I actually see the workers counting how many people are in the restaurant every now and then. 49 maximum in a space that can easily fit 100+ if the patio was open (The patio is ""under construction"" which with my theory, will be under construction indefinitely.)Theories to why there is a 49 max cap...??? Did they get in trouble with the fire marshal? Is insurance cheaper if you keep it less than 50 max? Why why why? The wait is RIDICULOUS when you clearly see empty freakin' tables throughout the restaurant. Service is just okay- they aren't very enthusiastic about serving you but I get it, it's late, you're tired. If anything, our server was extremely AWKWARD! He dropped our squid on the floor as he was bringing it to our table... so he picked it up with his hands and took it away and basically avoided our table from there on out. Is it because my friend laughed at him??? I mean, It was pretty funny seeing a squid fall onto the floor, then the look on the server's face... then him totally unacknowledging the fact that it fell.... hard not to laugh! Food? UGH. This is actually my second time eating here and even though my first experience was alright.. I give everything a second chance! I really don't like the stone grill whatsoever. Meat doesn't come out all that ""bbq-y"" because it kinda just boils on the grill.. you have to give the meat a lot of room to cook to avoid that. Marinated meats were not tasty, quality was crap.. short rib (and all the meat actually) was tough as hell!!! SO DISAPPOINTED! Â ALL in ALL- I DONT GET IT! If I had to wait 2 hours and had the best meal of my life, then no complaints here. BUT WE had to wait 2 hours for a table in a half empty restaurant for crappy food with barely passable service. I probably complained about everything that night including the tiny rice paper that kept ripping to the mushy octopus to the salty soup to the oily kimchee pancake... so on and so on.There are a billion other AYCE KBBQ in the vicinity! Save your time, money, and belly space and go elsewhere. That's my opinion! (GRR!)"
2/22/2016,4 star rating,"This place is an awesome KBBQ place to try if you are around the area because the waiters there will cook your meat for you! They were all very nice and attentive to our needs, making sure to check up on us that we had enough meat and to cook our meat. They made sure that we never really had to touch the tongs to cook it, we only cooked our meat one time because they were all preoccupied with incoming customers for the rush hour. Service here is excellent!They also had a variety of sides and meats to chose from and also other things like soups. I really like their bulgogi and their pork belly, but i wasn't fond of their seafood or pork intestine, it wasn't cleaned well which was nasty and the octopus was normal and bland. They also cook kimchi fried on the grill after you are all done with all your meats, but i wish we could have had it any times, instead of at the end of the meal and it was lacking in flavor. The meats were well marinade and everyone who worked there was korean and everything was pretty authentic. They also 4 different dipping sauce, but only one of them was to my taste."
2/22/2016,5 star rating,"I waited 5 long years. My trip to LA wouldn't have been complete without stoping here. This place started my love affair with Korean BBQ. We first tried to stop by Friday evening but we soon realized LA doesn't like to provide drivers with parking spaces and we didn't have cash for valet. However, we returned on Sunday. It was GLORIOUS. An out of body experience. A spiritual awakening. Slightly sexual sensations. My tongue had tears of joy. I WAS BORN AGAIN (a few pounds heavier)."
1/4/2017,5 star rating,"This place has dank meat and quality sides, but that only made up for 1 of these stars. The rest is made up by our server today, Jack Jack. He's literally the best server I've ever encountered he deserves a raise for his service and help today. If you go make sure you get Jack Jack to be your server. Came here wanting meat, left with a new best friend. Jack Jack, never quit. Keep doing you."
8/27/2015,5 star rating,"Now THIS is what I call all you can eat KBBQ! My friend took me here and I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing the meats/seafood was. The service was impeccable and I love that everyone came by to help cut up and watch over the meat on the grill. When I go to a KBBQ spot, I enjoy the sides more than the protein. This place was no different. ALL of the sides were bomb. Their pancake though?? It took the cake (no pun intended hehe). It was SOOO GOOD. So was their kimchi.Overall, a great place that I'll certainly be returning back to."
12/30/2017,2 star rating,"Food is good. The two star review is for their girl in the front and her attitude. Why have reservations if they don't hold a table for you? I'm sure this review won't make a difference on their business, but be advised that if you have Â a reservation, you'll still have to wait until a table becomes available."
4/25/2015,5 star rating,"I LUH DIS PLACE. Granted I'm not a KBBQ master, but from all the places I have tried, Hae Jang Chon is high up on my list of favorites.Price is VERY reasonable in my opinion - $17.99 for lunch and $21.99 for dinner - considering the variety, quality, and service you get. They'll even help you cook...like, what?!Don't order white rice and save some room for the kimchi fried rice they make on your grill at the end of your meal. SO GOOD.There's always a wait, so come when you're not super hungry yet so the wait won't be too agonizing (I speak from experience), and you'll be ready to go once you actually get seated."
10/8/2012,4 star rating,"After a couple hours being a ""tourist"" around Hollywood... I was a little hungry and I was definitely parched. My friend asked me what I wanted to eat.. and so I decided on something Asian... so when he mentioned Korean BBQ, I was in! I've really been wanting to try it since I love Gyu (Japanese BBQ) but since it was a Sunday night and after 10 a lot of places in the area weren't open...and they're in the heart of K-Town... so you know it's going to be authentic...and it is! Most of the patrons are Asian... although you won't feel out of place if you're not.I did find this place though (over 1200 reviews and a solid 4 stars... can't be bad... and this place is actually in my bookmarks as well)... so we headed straight here since they're open until 2 am! Perfect!There is a small parking lot in front but it's only valet parking... you can try to find some street parking... but it looks pretty hard to find. I decided to just let the valet park my car then try to find some place to park in the dark. It was worth the $2 bucks! Actually, maybe like 10 minutes into our meal, the valets came in and were giving us back our keys. I guess they were leaving for the night? I'm not sure... but that's fine by me. The tables are round with a big iron skillet in the middle of the table. You pay about $18 per person for an AYCE dinner. You can choose from a wide variety of meats and the tables are set up with a Korean spread. Tons of side dishes, sauces, kimchi, salad and just everything you could think of. I found that I am in love with the perhaps pickled? radish leaves! They're soooo good! and were perfect for wrapping the meat and goodies! Yum!For someone who had never been here... I didn't really know what to do. I wasn't sure if you were supposed to cook your own food... or if they were supposed to cook it for you. I am actually not even sure now...it was a bit of both I think. Various servers came over to tend to our meat...but we also turned it over ourselves.We had all the different beefs. My favorite were probably the Korean short ribs! So tasty! I love their marinades! Yum Yum Yum! Although, my friend did get me to be super adventurous and try the bbq squid. It's so hard to believe I actually did! But I did. It was okay. We probably overcooked it... and it was a bit off putting the way they served it... but I was so stunned that I actually tried it! Wow! I'm growing in a food way! :)The one negative for me are the sodas are canned! I would have liked more soda to drink... but that's okay.And of course, they played the gangnam style song...and the whole restaurant burst into dance... well at least this all transpired in my head.The food was awesome and I would definitely be back and recommend this place!"
1/8/2015,5 star rating,"$2 valet! just pull up in front of Hae Jang and the attendants will take care of you. definitely beats trying to find street parking around the complex.the location isn't as large as other AYCE kbbq joints i've been to, so be prepared to wait a little bit, but of course the food is worth it: exceptionally tasty, service is quick and easy (amen for the 'Call Button'), and all for a price which is standard with all the other good AYCE joints. enjoy!-civilities."

3/13/2015,4 star rating,"This place closes at 2am, which is awesome if you're craving good Korean bbq late at night. Â I love their variety of meat and sides, super tasty. Â Just try everything, you'll be happy you did.Hae Jang Chon is in a plaza next to other businesses so it can get really packed and it can be hard to find parking.The second time I ever went to Hae Jang Chon, the service was horrible. Â The servers were taking for ever to place our order. Â At the end we didn't tip as well because the service was pretty bad and we weren't happy about it, THEN the cashier told us that we had to tip more! Â We were forced to tip more...it was really weird. Â After that visit, it never happened to us again. Â Fortunately the food overrides the service haha... I'm a patient person that loves food."
6/8/2018,5 star rating,"Legit best BBQ experience I've ever had. Â They service is amazing and the food is awesome. I love how they cook it on stone it just Â cooks so much more evenly.

If you don't want to wait I recommend going before 6pm on a weekday"

10/1/2015,3 star rating,"Came here around 8:30 on a Saturday night with a friend and waited about an hour before being seated. Food arrives really quickly and you're given a pretty good variety of meats and sides. Service is really quick and great, although it did take them the whole meal (about 50 minutes) to get me a steamed egg. My server did apologize profusely for that but it was still annoying regardless. Meat quality is all right, but decent for an AYCE place. I was disappointed by the kimchi fried rice and the kimchi pancake. Both were too greasy and the fried rice was soggy. Not very pleasant at all. Doubtful I would come back, with so many other options nearby but it's a solid place."

2/24/2013,2 star rating,"I'm not sure why this place has such great reviews. I've been to dozens of other AYCE KBBQ places in LA/OC and this place doesn't even compare to even the average KBBQ joint in OC.In short:- Poor service- Poor quality and taste of meats- Lack of parking- Long waits- Too expensive for such poor quality- Music was way to loud for any conversationOkay, so first impressions:Parking: As with all of LA, parking situation is horrible, especially if you're the type that doesn't trust valets. I hear that the valet service is $2.Walking in: It's a fairly small restaurant that is noticeably dim, but perhaps that's how they want to set the ambiance.We ended up in the corner booth hidden behind their fridge - poor service, poor lighting. The waitress we ended up with was terrible. She stopped over every now and then, cooked meats for us, and left without seeing to our refills. The other waiters that stopped by seemed excellent though. We ordered the the brisket, pork belly, bulgogi and marinated short rib first. The brisket was literally all fat, which was disappointing considering the table next to us had great lean-looking brisket. We didn't even get the pork belly either! The bulgogi was cut thinner than I'm used to but was delicious and had a hint of ginger. My favorite meat was the marinated short rib; probably the best marinated short rib I've had at an AYCE. Also surprisingly good was the kimchi pancake - it reminded me of deep-fried onion rings with the subtle kimchi aftertaste.Last note - Upon reading other reviews, it seems that the restaurant was much better in terms of quality/service, but has gone downhill since then. ***Please keep this in mind when researching other AYCE KBBQ options!!!!*** Not sure if this place has a lot of regulars, but seemed like 80% of the other parties here were new to the restaurant and were therefore just exploring. I'm 100% sure that seasoned AYCE KBBQ fanatics would definitely not give this place anything more than 3 stars.Overall, food was meh, service was terrible - I won't be coming back!"
9/27/2015,5 star rating,"Love this place. I've come here for my last two birthdays. Meat and service are A+, and i love the stone grills (they use sliced radish to scrape the charcoal off the grills in between - really awesome)! Decent banchan too; I think like 5 kinds, not too shabby, but all tasted great. I like that they have a good selection of pork, because I have a slight allergy to red meat (true story). The only minus is the long wait - I think last time I waited about an hour to get dinner on a weeknight."

5/5/2015,5 star rating,"Came here for the first time last night with a group of 13 co-workers for a birthday. We arrived around 10:45pm and we waited 25 minutes, as they don't take reservations, but the host was so friendly and attentive that we didn't mind waiting at all.We were seated at 2 adjacent tables and they were already set with all the fixings. The servers were there within seconds and before we knew it, we were eating. EVERYTHING was delicious! The brisket and the bulgogi were my favorite. The entire staff, especially our servers were so kind and incredibly quick.We brought our own cake and they offered to put in in the refrigerator for us. When they brought it out, they had put a candle in it (we forgot ours), and they even helped us cut and serve it!Great food. Even better service. Will definitely be back!"

4/25/2015,5 star rating,"Went on April 21st with my bestie after looking around for another KBBQ place after we visited 1/4 Quarters KBBQ and left when we found out it was not AYCE. This place was a godsend! We absolutely loved the food. I could not believe the amount of options we could choose from for the AYCE. We were very happy with the food: we got brisket, marinated beef, bbq chicken, and pork belly. Everything was absolutely delicious. Also got the egg and pancake and loved that too. Everything was fresh and the wait time was very short. We were just 2 people and he said it was about a 20 minute wait, we waited only about 10 minutes and they seated us. Waiters are very friendly! We wanted to to tip more and more because of his attentiveness and kindness. I recommend."
1/10/2015,1 star rating,"My reason for this review is quite simple: the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. We reserved a table for my boyfriend's birthday. We called a week in advance and were told by the girl working there that ""We'll put you down for 7pm, but there's no way you'll be seated before 7:30, possibly even 8pm"". We discussed this with the management on the phone and decided we would have our party show up at 7:30, so that they wouldn't be standing outside waiting in the cold, and we ourselves would show up at 7pm to hold our reservation. We were told this would be acceptable.We called back a few times throughout the week - to increase the amount of seats from 8, to 12, and again the day of to confirm our reservation. At all points we were assured our reservation was solid. When the day rolls around can you imagine how excited we were to roll up to Hae Jang Chon, starving and in the mood for some of the ""best Korean BBQ of [our] lives"", as a friend said when he recommended we go there... And then imagine how frustrated and upset we were to be told that even though we were there at 7pm, and although our reservation was supposed to be held, that since the last person showed up at 7:35PM our reservation was CANCELLED and FORFEITED and we would have to wait 2+ hours, for a party of 12 to be seated.While my boyfriend was trying to come to a resolution with the management, and satisfy 12 hungry people, he was called a LIAR, and told there was ""nothing that could be done"" and that the person who confirmed our reservation ""must have been mistaken"". Apparently whomever assured us THREE SEPERATE TIMES over the phone, that having everyone show up by 7:30 as long as we showed up at 7 to claim the reservation was VERY WRONG.I'm well aware of their policy that they refuse to seat patrons until all parties are present, but when you tell someone they can't be seated until thirty minutes after their reservation time, and the last person is there FIVE MINUTES after that, how can they simply cancel someone's reservation and say ""Sorry, we didn't say that was ok, you must be lying, and we can't seat you"". Not only did they cancel our reservation and call my boyfriend a liar directly, every member of our party parked in their valet lot, and had to pay the valet fee to get their cars back, because the restaurant wouldn't pay for the inconvenience and claimed it wasn't their problem or responsibility. On the way out the door a server who witnessed our frustration at our reservation being cancelled for no reason called my boyfriend an ""entitled asshole"" in front of everyone - for just trying to reason with management that our reservation should be held! How rude and unnecessary! Thankfully there were other Korean BBQ restaurants in the area who were more than willing to accommodate our large group at a moments notice, and his birthday dinner ended on a high note despite this hiccup. We'll never be back, and I hope others don't suffer from their insulting lack of tact in the customer service department."
5/28/2018,5 star rating,"Worth the long wait. Good quality meats considering that it is an all you can eat restaurant accompanied by good marinades. Meats were marinated well, not overly fat, not tough. Banchan had a small selection but all were good. Defintely hits the quality over quantity goal. Service was absolutely amazing. The servers were all very attentive and efficient. Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and will definitely be back when Im in town craving some kbbq."

3/2/2015,5 star rating,"First off, the service at this place is amazing! You'll never run out of anything (drinks, side dishes, etc). Everytime we come here, the owner is there and she comes over to our table and help with cutting/cooking the meat and she's super friendly. Price per person isn't bad either and you definitely get your money's worth. I love seafood and this is the only place (that I know of) that has seafood on their menu. Try to come here early especially on Fridays & Saturdays because it gets packed and parking lot is limited and street parking sucks. This place closes at 2 am which is perfect for late night dinner. One of my favorite KBBQ places in LA."
4/4/2018,4 star rating,Amazing everything to include the environment. Some places are brown and Smokey ceilings. This place is clean. Sucks we had to wait 1 1/2 to sit and eat. The long wait was what caused the 4 star but it was worth the wait

4/3/2016,5 star rating,"This. Place. Is. SO. Good.While spring breaking in LA, a couple friends highly recommended this place. The wait was EXTREMELY long (near 3 hours) but that still won't knock down my review. The food was way too good for the price. The service was friendly and actually kind of adorable in a way. Our waiter would always come back to our table and say, ""Shall we get more meat?"" His accent was really accentuated and it was quite pleasant. Apart from that, endless amount of brisket, spicy chicken, and my favorite, the short ribs! Being from the Bay Area, I haven't experienced a KBBQ place that actually did most of the work for you. Really took the pressure off since I'm usually the only doing the grilling to actually enjoy the meal. The sides provided really complimented the foods. My favorite was the potato salad that had apple bits and the salad to cleanse. Â I really appreciated the fact that even though the place is kind of small and the line is crazy long, the staff doesn't rush you in any way. During our visit there was actually a black out but I was too quick not to care, turned on the flashlight on my phone and continued eating. I've been having withdrawals since. Please come to the Bay Area."
11/2/2015,4 star rating,Came here after a Halloween party.The food is pretty good. I didn't like the starters though. Lack of taste.However the atmosphere was great and we didn't have to wait long (people after us had to though).The waiters are overly attentive - I like it when I can cook my barbecue myself.Other than that - great price!Try it!
7/22/2013,4 star rating,"Definitely a LOVE / HATE relationship with this restaurant. I love it for the most obvious reason: High quality delicious food at a sort of reasonable price for all you can eat.What I hate about it: no reservations allowed, over an hour and a half wait on Friday and Saturday nights, and they try to nickel and dime you for everything such as rice (really? all you can eat.. I don't think an extra bowl of rice really costs 1.25). Also the staff is nice, but they're kind of spacey and slow, you really have to flag them down.My advice: come here for lunch, or on a week night. If you decide to come here on a Friday or Saturday night, either snack before getting there or don't be in a starving mood..."
11/8/2012,4 star rating,"I love and hate this place.I love the food. Â I hate the wait. Â Been here many many times. Â There's a valet parking lot in which you'll be standing for at least an hour.Great selection of meat for 17.99. Â I always get brisket, tongue, bulgogi, and short rib, at least. Â Rarely chicken because it takes forever. Last time we also got squid and thin sliced pork belly. The pork belly had cartilage. Â My friends were like eww there's bones. And I said it's cartilage, you can eat it! Â Then I tried it myself and no, I couldn't eat it. The thick sliced pork belly cooked crispy tastes better in my opinion.The selection of sides includes kimchi, pickled shredded veggies, fishcake, potato salad, bean sprouts, some green veggies, forgot what else. Â The salad! I love it with the meat. Â rice paper, sliced radish. They bring kimchi pancake. The steamed egg is kinda too salty though :(The service is good. Â Our server was constantly refilling our food as needed, asking what meats we wanted next.I like the stone grill. They clean it often, so your meat doesn't get burned, and you don't have to wait for a new grill to heat up again! Â Plus we usually don't have to ask for them to do it... they clean it when they see it's needed.At the end of your meal, they clean the grill again and make kimchi fried rice at your table! And bring you some soup! By that point I'm so full already."

5/27/2016,5 star rating,great place for the price- don't need to say more.... sheesh they got enough reviews!
5/26/2016,4 star rating,"On a Friday evening, it was about a 2 hour wait. There are options for AYCE and regular ordering of portions, but the better deal for more variety is obviously the AYCE. It is on the pricier side (about $24 per person on weekends I believe). The set up was very nice once we were seated with sides already out for us and a huge stone grill. There was a large selection of different types of beef, pork, chicken, and even seafood. My personal favorites were the beef bulgolgi, marinated choice beef short rib, and marinated squid. The shrimp seemed fresh and octopus were unmarinated so plain but a great option. The thinly cut black angus was unmarinated and a bit dry after awhile. I enjoyed the spicy beef but I do want to warn that it was very strongly spiced. There are some other options such as fresh mushrooms which is also nice. Portion sizes of meat were great since it allowed us to try several different things. Other notable sides include kim chi pancake, steamed egg, and kim chi fried rice at the end. The kimchi pancake was very starchy but went well with the quantities of meat in front of us (kind of like a rice). Steamed egg is always one of my favorites. At the end of the meal, a very simple kim chi fried rice (consisting of exactly what it sounds like with some seaweed) is grilled in front of you to end the meal. It was alright but a nice touch (maybe we should've added some meat into it for a more interesting end). Service was fantastic for such a busy place. To be honest, none of the meats were to die for but they were decently good and I was very satisfied. The spectacular service makes it worth going back for. Perhaps not worth a 2 hour wait again, but worth checking out as a one time thing."
5/25/2016,5 star rating,"THEY HAVE THE BEST OCTOPUS AND if you like octopus like I do, you'll greatly appreciate this place. I've been here twice since I don't really live in LA and I've also been to quit a few Korean BBQ restaurants here and this place can't be beat! I love the different kinds of meat they have especially their octopus and pork belly! The fried rice they make in the end is really good too. The waiters and waitresses who cooks our food are really nice and overall their service is really good(: the atmosphere is loud and perfect for drinking haha. Their marinated short ribs and bulgogi is also to die for. Will come back again!"
5/24/2016,2 star rating,"I went for korean bbq. Had never had it before so I can't compare. But I didn't think it was particularly good, it was fine. What made the experience less enjoyable though was the fact that the place was pretty dirty. On top of that, we'd made a reservation for 8 people, but that didn't mean that a table would actually be held for us. It meant that, only after all of us arrived, we were put on a waiting list. We ended up waiting for 45 min outside. For a party of 8, I think that's bad management really. No apology, not a complimentary coffee or drink to make it up to us, nothing..."
5/23/2016,3 star rating,"TLDR: short rib and brisket had decent quality and taste, but not worth more than 1 hr waitWaited almost 2 hrs on a busy saturday night so I was expected the best meal ever.... expectations failed.We ordered marinated short rib (4), un-marinated short rib(2), thinly sliced brisket(4), bulgogi(1), spicy bulgogi(1), spicy pork(1) and sliced pork(1). I only like marinated short rib and thinly sliced brisket was good; the rest was horrible. I guess that's because those are the two that the servers doesn't ""chop up so I feel like I'm eating pieces of meat. The spicy marinade was horrible and made the meat all mushy. Â Service was good. The servers were fast and helpful but they have a habit of ""chopping"" the meat up with the tongs so the meat, especially the marinated ones ended up being mushy like ground meat. Also, the servers were cooking the meat way faster than I could eat so I really felt rushed. Â Banchan are pretty good. Tea is tasteless. Â Not for me."
5/22/2016,5 star rating,"Came here at around 10pm weekday and had a 1 hour waiting time. Let me discuss the pros and cons.PROS-they cook your food for you. Had about 6 different servers cooking my food. Although a few meat got burned, it was still commendable-top quality meat. You can tell its really high quality-stone grill!!! Servers also constantly clean it before cooking the meatCONS-no japchae :(. Also their banchan was not that good.All in all, out of all the ayce bbqs I've been too. I did not really feel anything super special about their meat. However, their servers cooking the meat for you is a huge plus for me and that is what I think makes this place super awesome! For the price of $23, I would definitely come back again!"
5/22/2016,4 star rating,"Lines are long regardless of when you go. Even if it's 10 PM, you're going to have to wait for 30 minutes to an hour. Do Not Wait by the entrance inside. It's Freezing and people never shut the door. Every 2 minutes someone is going to come in to check when they can get seated so the door flings open and wind gushes in. Anyway there's a ton of seating area outside but good luck getting a seat there... it's usually filled up by the people who are ahead of you.This is a place where waiting gets you so hungry that you think everything tastes good. Haha. But seriously. Awesome service here when you actually get seated! They cook the meat for you and they're really good at making sure things are not over or undercooked. Plus everything is cooked on some type of stone. Good quality for the amount you're paying. Kimchi fried rice at the end is delish. Oh they also give pancakes and soft tofu soups!!Definitely a favorite KBBQ on my list!"

5/22/2016,4 star rating,"One of the best kbbq places I've ever gone to! Every time I come, there is at least an hour wait but definitely worth it. It is all you can eat and there are lots of varieties to choose from. My favorite dish here is the spicy pork belly! It's soft enough, has nice smoky flavor and is really saucy! Just the way I like it. The other meats are good as well but uncomfortable to the spicy pork. I love coming here also because of all the sides, the kimchi fried rice and pancake that is also part of the all you can eat menu. The food is fantastic but there were times where I feel like we were rushed to finish our meal. The woman at the restaurant would come around and cook tons of meat for us but we actually wanted to do it ourselves. Felt like she just wanted us to finish and leave so that the next party could come in. Overall, this place is still great and is a must-go everytime I come to LA!"
1/8/2013,5 star rating,"I've never seen a kbbq place like this one. Â The restaurant has small round tables and clay pots to cook the meat on. Â $18 for all-you-can-eat and it's damn good. Â Aside from the traditional meats, they also offer scallion pancakes, kimchi fried rice, baby octopus and squid. Â When they said baby octopus, I imagined those tiny bite-sized ones. Â The thing that came to our table was pretty massive...but tasted just fine."
1/24/2018,5 star rating,"Can't say enough great things about this place. We had a party of 15 they over-accommodated for. We had a reservation for 6:30 but showed up late, because well LA traffic. They were understanding and found space for us all. We all got the all you can eat option for 25.99. Best idea in a place like this if you ask me. You set the pace of the meat coming out. You can repeat meats or try all new ones. My favorite was the bbq beef and brisket. We got the seafood too, which I didn't love, but it was probably more because we don't know how to cook our own octopus. The place is bustling! Constantly busy on a Saturday with a line out the door that only grew as the night went on. So get here before 5 or make a reservation. Otherwise be prepared to wait. Highly recommend! Come hungry. Get comfy. Enjoy the show!"
4/24/2017,5 star rating,"My favorite Korean BBQ spot but be prepared to wait, the bulgoogi and short rib are hands down the best on the menu. The thing that separates this spot from a lot of other spots are the sides. Literally everything the lay out is delicious, I always make sure I get a steamed egg."
4/28/2017,5 star rating,"We got here at around 12:30AM Friday night after going to a club. My friend recommended it and I had no clue that this was a well-known KBBQ place with a high rated yelp review so for me it was a big surprise and the food was delicious. The only problem was that we were still kind of drunk and so we were treated differently by some of the workers and they weren't giving us the best customer service possible. But after awhile, a waitress named Gina came in to rescue the day. She was able to accommodate all of our needs in our drunken state! Thank you again Gina, I appreciate it."
3/17/2018,5 star rating,"Ate here late on a Monday night, and it was packed! We had about a 30 minute wait for a table of three. This is an AYCE Korean bbq place. Dinner is $25.99pp. There is a good selection of meats and sides. You can get three types of meat at a time. The waiters/waitresses start the meat on the grill for you and return from time to time to turn it (if you haven't already done so yourself) and refill anything you need. Table favorite was the marinated beef short rib. Bulgogi and thin pork belly was also yummy. Let the pork belly slightly burn and crisp, it is so good! After we had anything spicy, they would come and clean our grill for the next meat so the spice wouldn't contaminate non spicy meats, A+ for that! We didn't eat as much as we thought we would. There is a $15 fee for wasting food. At the end of your meal, they make regular or kim chi fried rice on your grill at your table, all included in the price. We were stuffed, so we skipped this part, but watched them make it for other tables, pretty cool. We had one main waitress, but other servers stopped at our table to flip meat, clear plates, refill food and water as they saw needed. I noticed that everyone here helps everyone, kind of like a family. Great service from everyone, but Suzie and Hyun were extra great! Will eat here again when in town."
11/20/2018,5 star rating,"LITERALLY THE BEST AYCE KBBQ HANDS DOWN NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. Just go here, you won't regret it. My fav is definitely the thin sliced pork belly. It does get super busy, but it's worth the wait I promise. Side dishes are bomb, service is bomb, whole experience is great. I love coming here with a big group of friends."
8/10/2012,4 star rating,"There's something wrong with waking up and having this be the first meal of the day, but I f*cking love KBBQ and I was in LA so I just had to do it. Plus they open at 11AM and that's basically breakfast time on weekends anyway.I believe AYCE lunch was $17.99 and the four of us got that. It's nice that they completely set your table up before you even sit down. The grill, plates, and side dishes are all laid out perfectly around the table. All you have to do is sit down and order mmmmmeeeaaaattt. The grill is kinda unique since it looks like a stone circle with a hole for fat drippings. There came a point during our meal where I thought our fat drippings was going to overflow at one point which would've been horrible since I was sitting right next to it. Overall, not the best place for KBBQ but certainly not the worst. It's pretty good and I'm sure the restaurant gets crowded since it's not very big at all. Like always, the servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off and you'll have to wave your arms around like a crazy person to get their attention. Parking can be a pain but what do you expect? It's LA."
5/28/2019,1 star rating,Don't come over if you don't want to wait. I put my name on it and they said it would be 15 mins wait. It was actually 1hr15 mins. Some people before us did not show up when their names got called. Later they came back and the waiter told them to come before since those people were not waiting outside. That's not fair. No explanations No one cares whatever I said. BAD BAD CUSTOMER SERVICES. NO BRAIN TO LEAD THE BUSINESS
1/19/2016,5 star rating,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! The stone grill definitely brought out the flavor in the meat and their service here is wonderful. We didnt have to ring the bell during our stay because their servers were constantly around us asking us if we needed any more meat or needed anything else for the table. The only bad thing about this place, if you can call it that, is the amount of people that come during dinner time. We arrived here just before the dinner rush and before we left, we heard someone say that their wait time was about 2 hours. That really says alot about this place. People wont be waiting 2 hours if the food is not worth it. What really brought me out here on yelp is to give a special mention to one of our servers, Steve! He suggested different types of meat that we should try and we did! We also liked it! He was on top it! If we needed water refills or anything else, he was there asking and providing."
12/25/2014,1 star rating,One star for the good okay food ...Worst service of all the restaurants I'd ever been to. Every single server is not happy working there. I don't get it if u are not happy just quit. They don't want to serve u at all. I'm very disappointed that they are so mean to the customers. Poor service ! One of the old lady server was super mean. You make me not wanted to come back at all. Don't come here cuz their service would ruin ur mood
5/16/2013,4 star rating,"Great go to place when you work graveyard shift and you just want to pig out after work. Keep in mind though that last call for their meats is 1:00 am. Appetizers are great! Love the mashed potatoes, and is a personal favorite of mine.Salad! I know you come here for meat but their salad's awesome too!Servers are niceReasonably priced for AYCETook a star off because of the ""grill"" sometimes it becomes too hot and sometimes it takes a while for the meat to get readyBut all in all this is a pretty good place for meat!"

10/13/2017,4 star rating,"I have had better Korean BBQ, but this place is definitely up there. There were many many kBBQ places in downtown LA so my friend and I had some difficulty choosing, but we are glad we came here! The wait time was a bit long (it was a Saturday night at 6pm), we waited about 50 mins to one hour. The service was great, staff were friendly. I have to say that the bulgogi beef was one of the best I've had so far!! The other meats did not particularly stand out to me. The sides were delicious as well."
7/3/2015,5 star rating,After living here for 7 years this is hands down the best Korean bbq place I've ever been to in LA. I have never eaten so much I threw up but I have here. That's pretty much the highest praise I can give

2/13/2015,4 star rating,"I normally don't like AYCE kbbq very much. I would much prefer Kang Hodong over any AYCE place. WITH THAT SAID, the meat quality here is very high for AYCE. Gotta love the flavor from the grill that they cook the meat on. The price is reasonable, and the employees were very attentive. We tried all the normal meats, and I think my favorite was the beef short ribs. At the end of your meal, they serve a seaweed kimchi fried rice cooked right on the grill. I was way too full to fully enjoy it but it was really good.Highly recommend if you're looking for AYCE kbbq!"
6/13/2018,5 star rating,"This place is my go to restaurant anytime I'm in LA. Â I've been here 6 different times and each time the food is great, the wait staff is friendly and I always have a good experience here. Â I've taken my entire family there and they raved about the experience.if you want great KBBQ in LA, this is the place to go. Â There is also valet parking so no worries about finding parking."
11/22/2018,2 star rating,"Or server was rude. He was solely focused on hurrying us out despite the restaurant being open for another hour & being full of other customers. He did not know how to communicate. Made is feel uncomfortable the entire time and scared to even ask for anything bc of his rude and terse demeanor. Also, they told us last call you get 5 orders and he did not respect that. He did not bring everything we ordered. The service was so terrible I will not be returning"
12/7/2014,5 star rating,"The best deal for quality K-BBQ in Los Angeles!!Even though they have grown to attract lots of non-korean people to this establishment, they keep it rooted in Korean Tradition. They give a few banchan (side dishes) but my favorite thing here is the kimchi pancakes!!! They definitely make me nostalgic of when my mom used to make them for me :) Their selection used to be a little but better than now, but the price is still such a great deal. My boyfriend introduced this place to me and has been coming back to this place for more than a decade!"
11/24/2014,5 star rating,"Out of all the KBBQ places in Los Angeles, this is my # 1 KBBQ choice. I love this place with its service and drool worthy food. Food: My friends and I order AYCE every time we come here. The AYCE menu offers like 20 items to choose from with a variety of meats. There are two different prices for lunch and dinner, with lunch being slightly cheaper by 2-3 dollars. Lunch is 19.99 and dinner is 21.99. They offer banchan, which is a variety of smaller dishes around the table like kimchi, veggies, potato salad, and salad for you to munch on. When it comes to ordering meats, my favorites are the beef tongue, brisket, thin pork belly, and the short rib. THE MEAT IS SO FRESH AND YUMMY. Like you can tell the difference from other KBBQ places with its frozen meat when you try Hae Jang Chon. They offer several sauces to dip your meat in. Another couple of items to try are the kimchi pancake and the kimchi fried rice. I've only had the fried rice once since they only make it after you are done eating the meat at the end of the meal and most of the time, my friends and I are too full. Service: The reason why Hae Jang Chon stands out the most to me is the quality of the meat, but also the quality of service. I've tried other places like Castle, Sanya, Road to Seoul, Cham Sut Gol and the service for these restaurants can be so slow or nonexistent or rude. Hae Jang Chon have a stone grill for the cooking and most of the time, servers will stop and cook the meats for you or clean the grill off with radishes. They are fast with their service too. Location: The parking is hard to find at times since Hae Jang Chon is in a plaza that has multiple other stores or restaurants next to it. However, the parking lot is valet parking for $2 and there are some meters on the street. During busy dinner or lunch hours, this place can get crowded and there can be a long wait. If you can come a couple of hours before dinner hours, you'll beat the rush. The restaurant is slight small-medium sized. There isn't really a lot of tables meant for big parties. If you have a party of 8 or more, call in a reservation. However, they are strict about having your whole party there before seating you."
4/4/2015,2 star rating,"Me and my friends are from Orange county and wanted to go try a korean bbq place we havent been too yet. So we decided to drive to LA to this restaurant because of the great reviews. Parking is hard to find there so we parked on the streets a block away. This place is super popular and was packed!!! My friend put our names down and told us the wait would be about 1 hr. We ended up waiting close to 2 hours to be seated. When we got our food we were kind of disappointed. Dont get me wrong the food is not bad, but I have had better korean bbq it wasnt worth the 2 hour wait. But the service was really good."
11/18/2017,5 star rating,Can't complaint. This place was one of the nicest Korean bbq joint I have ever been into. Lots of food and they kept bringing more. Thank you guys.
1/10/2017,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ places in ktown! I got there around 5-6 and thankfully there was no line! The menu is pretty simple. My favorite was the brisket and the beef tongue. They were so good!! I liked how the servers would cook your meat for you so I just sat there and ate. You can order max of 3 kinds of meat at a time, which I was ok with so we don't order too much at a time."
4/30/2014,4 star rating,"We've been here several times at lunch time and we've received good service.Last night we visited again and first we ordered beer and soju as usual. The waiter brought this aluminum cup instead of shot glass...I believe it's used for cooking or ketchup container, am I wrong??? Or is it gangnam style???? We asked for regular glasses, and she said that they don't give glasses because drunk people break them... Later she changed the excuse to ""because of our dish washer..."" but refused to bring the regular glasses. Awww I could see the regular shot glasses sitting in that refrigerator right in front of us...and ""Why the beer glass are ok then???"" So, we asked another waiter for glasses, and he said ok and brought crystal glasses for us!! Â Yeah!!!Odd service...However, everything else was good so I give 4stars!! Â Foods are cheap and waiters are always around to make sure we have enough meat."
4/28/2018,5 star rating,"Yelp just suggested I review this place and now I'm upset that I'm not there eating Â honestly the best Korean BBQ ever. I have ordered every type they offer, including hot dogs out of curiosity. I love all the beef cuts and the kimchi pancake is TO DIE FOR. Wait is always long so come early and sit at the bar next door. It's worth the wait, trust me."
8/10/2014,5 star rating,"If you're in Los Angeles, Korean BBQ is a must--and this place is tops for Korean BBQ. Hands down. No question. If Korean BBQ places were Game of Throne characters, this place would be beheading everyone.It has major street cred because it's in the heart of Koreatown but it avoids some of the pitfalls of other Korean BBQ establishments.1) it keeps it's menu simple. It doesn't have pages and pages of various items and various variations of pretty much the same type of meat. You know, the kind of menu with alpha-numerics to make it easier for the wait staff (""Can I have the 3A? Or how's the 4C?""), which always makes things a bit more impersonal.2) It doesn't overextend itself by making the restaurant gargantuan with as many tables and seats as possible to make as much money as possible. Even with a call button at your disposal, this gets hard3) It has easy cheap parking, which is amazing because it's Koreatown. You pull up right in front, hand your car to the valet, come right out after the meal, pay the valet two dollars (awesome) and you're off. Why couldn't Pasadena be this easy, quick and affordable?MENU:It's just a few pages long and it gets right to the point. At 18 bucks per person, you can get all you can eat of a choice of 20 items which include Canadian Pork Belly (thin sliced is the best, brisket, pork shoulder, beef tongue, tripe, spicy squid, chicken, bulgogi, steamed egg, rice, kimchi fried rice, kimchi pancakes, Lettuce wraps, radish wraps and other stuff. Â The sides are also numerous, free and promptly stocked when you ask to reload on kimchi, fish cake strips, sliced garlic cloves, spicy red bean sauce, etc. You can only order four meats at a time which is fine because that's a lot and it's good to pace yourself. They also bring a ton of meat per order (we had to tell them to cut the meat servings in half). HIGHLIGHTS: 1) The Pork Shoulder sizzles and pops. It's incredibly high quality and savory (and it's Canadian). Canadian Pigs simply rock. 2) Try the beef tongue. Thin, incredibly soft and a muted taste that goes well with the radish wraps and grilled kimchi and garlic. 3) kimchi pancake. We kept ordering these. Soft and spongy, sweet and mildly spicy, this was great in between waves of ordering more meat.SERVICE: Fantastic. The waiters work by team service so any waiter nearby will stop and check on you and get you more of what you need and replenish more of what you want. They're fast and they don't hover. And there's always a waiter nearby. As I said before, this place isn't GI-normous which is great because it employs a wait staff that can handle all the customers. I never had to use my service call button once. AMBIENCE: Great energy all around, which is characteristic of any good BBQ place. The sounds and smells of all the BBQ happening all at once, the hustle and bustle of the wait staff, the growing line of people outside, the cheesy Korean pop music playing in the background, a medley of various meaty smoky smells wafting overhead. As I said before, the place gets props for not making this place huge for the sake of more money. Yet it's still great for groups. Every table fits around 7 or 8. NOTE FOR AMEX HOLDERS: only Visa and MasterCard gets love ALCOHOL: They only serve one brand of beer (Hite).SHOUT-OUT: My favorite waitress was Sarah.RECAP*High quality meat*stone grills that seals the juices and flavor in the meat*Great price*Outstanding service*Parking is cheap and convenient*Sarah The Waitress"
10/3/2015,5 star rating,"4.5 stars. All you can eat stone grill Korean bbq! You can only order four meats at a time, and this place will definitely make you leave stuffed with food coma. It's so cheap and they have Korean fried rice for the end of the meal!The service is so spot on, the guy who works here kept coming back to make sure we got everything, or wanted more, or just chit chatting. Super friendly. The only thing I wish wasn't true was that lettuce for wrapping was ordered as a side dish? Weird."
1/3/2018,5 star rating,"Very good KBBQ! I went here for the first time yesterday with a friend and walked out absolutely satisfied. The marinated short ribs were amazing and unlike most restaurants where they have the bone left in, there was no bone in this one at all. Servers are constantly walking around and you don't need to change your grill at all. They helped clean my grills very often. The kimchi pancake was very delicious with a slight crisp to its edge. Overall, I was very satisfied with my first meal here and I would definitely come back again!"

So couple days ago me and my GF was cruising down K town on a raining day passing by this place i recognized the Pig on Sign. Surprise surprise there is no line only couple people are waiting so we decided our 2nd attempt. I like how they grill our meats on I believed a cast iron pan , the meats was very flavorful on point!! must try the marinate squid so good.

Dude had a problem when we told him that we had a smaller party than previously reserved. Calm down bro, its not hard to take one table and some chairs away. The rudeness didn't stop there. The server was sweating his butt off and we all understood that it was hella busy. I totally get it, but you signed up for this job so we expect you to give good service even when it gets busy. A friend asked for napkins very nicely and he shoo'd his hand as if she was a fly and said he will get to her later... The heck?! I rather go to another all you can eat KBBQ because this place is just not worth it"

12/31/2017,5 star rating,It was DEFINITELY worth the wait! My cousin took us there and at first I balked at the idea of waiting almost 2 hours for a table. But it was definitely worth it!

The meat is very fresh and they give you a lot with each portion. If you want to try more options without getting too full, ask for half portions. I love that their spicy sauce is actually spicy. And that it's not just siracha. The servers were nice and attentive especially considering how packed this place gets. Oh and you get some really good music while you eat"

Â There's a call button at the table, but my boyfriend and I never even thought about having to use it because the waitress was so attentive and helpful.At first the $21 weekend price made me hesitant to try this place because I've always gone to another place for half the price, but all of the reviews and different food options available convinced me to give this place a try. Â Eating here today made me fall in love with it. Â I almost felt as if I was cheating on my regular Korean bbq place with Hae Jang Chon. The meats are so good and omg the kimchi fried rice that they make for you at the end on the stone...I die. Â It was delicious. Â I love seaweed, so the fact that it had shredded seaweed in it made it unbelievably good.I will definitely come back, but not as often because it is a little pricey."
5/18/2019,1 star rating,Decided to visit this place with a few friends we were put on a waiting list for a half hour and that was completely fine. But before we knew it that half hour made it to two hole hours and we told the hoast multiple times our party was all present and ready to be seated. There was a HUGE misunderstanding because for some bizarre reason they believed we didnt have our full party with us... so were told multiple times that we would be seated with in 15 minutes. Â Once it start getting closer to the 3 hour mark we did have to complain and that is when two of the hoast decided to become very rude and loud also calling not only myself but my boyfriend a liar saying that we never checked back in they had no idea that we were there. When he went into the place multiple times to check in and see where we stood on the list. Once we were finally seated the hoast werent done with the harrassment they then followed us all to our table and continued to argue with me about the situation. The fact that one of them continued to constantly raise his voice calling me a liar and that the whole thing was our fault he refused to leave us alone to even order water. Then by the grace of the kbbq gods he decided to go and do his job horribly and leave us alone. NO apology was given and no one seemed to care about this unprofessional behavior. There is a extremely super big chance that we will NOT be going back and we will NOT reccomend ANYONE not even the mailman to this place. Good luck everyone else because someone needs to check a few of the employees.

We got two checking in tonight to try their ALL YOU CAN EAT at the price of 21.99/person (weekday lunch would be 19.99/person). The meat is fresh and is REALLY FRESH. I personally recommend unmarinated Angus brisket and marinated short rib; try these great dishes with your bean past sauce, kimchi, rice wrap and salad. Also the marinated short rib fits perfectly with kimchi pancake. Usually the unmarinated meat is more greasy than the marinated ones, and pork is more greasy than beef. The waitresses will kindly help you with the grill. They are always around and ask ""do you want more meat"" frequently. They will also help you clean up the grill with fresh radish (amazing trick!) every time when your grill decays. So, it seems this restaurant is as good as others have rated. Why am I deducting two stars from the rate? Here's the reason why I don't feel good after dining in this cute restaurant. 1. I accidentally sit on the direction where the smoke goes to. Breathing too much smoke made me seriously headache. This is a common problem to all BBQ restaurant so I don't actually blame this on them. 2. The eating tempo is way too rush. I used to eat food thoroughly and chew carefully to prevent getting indigestion. However, the waitresses of the restaurant will throw all of the ordered meat onto the grill when they serve it, and you will then be forced to eat quickly since it would be awful once the meat gets cold. (No one would ever want to face a bunch of cold, greasy, bad-taste bbq in front of him.) The most ridiculous thing is that when I tried to stop the waitress from throwing the meat onto the grill all at once and took care of my own food, a waiter came and all in a sudden all of our meat are thrown onto the grill! ... I don't even have enough time to stop him! ... This really makes me stressed out during dining... I don't want to waste food, yet I don't want to rush on eating! 3. The grill is not well-designed. It works fine, but some burnt waste will inevitably stick on the grill and then stick on your later food. This is unhealthy to human body. Concluding above, I will keep looking for my beloved KBBQ since this restaurant can't stop me from moving on. But it's good enough anyway."
8/11/2015,5 star rating,"Came yesterday around 1pm and made it for their Monday-Thursday 11am-3pm $19.99 lunch special!!! I was so hungry from the drive from Santa Ana and was happy that we didn't have to wait for a table. They prepared little Korean dishes ready for us to eat before we sat down! The mash potato was sooooooo good btw. The AYCE deal came with 22 different items like: squid, octopus, shrimp, kim chi pancake, bean curd soup, kobe beef, bulgogi, beef short ribs, and many more! It was also my first time experiencing KBBQ on a stone grill. Oh yeah, you can only order 4 items at a time.Tips:1) Save some tummy for their kimchi fried rice at the very end! They'll cook it in front of you2) Don't order more meat than you can eat, they'll charge you a $15 fee"
4/20/2017,5 star rating,ugh all you can eat korean bbq is so good in LA. i recommend coming before 4:30 for no wait since it gets busy dinner esp the weekends. the waiters were all so friendly and everything was exceptionally delicious at a reasonable price
2/18/2018,5 star rating,Delish! Reasonable price and they help us newbs cook the food? Heck yes. Â I wish I had a bigger stomach to eat more stuff. Â Parking does suck but just be patient and use the $2 valet.
3/16/2015,5 star rating,"Not bad at all. I came here without much expectations.Dinner was $20 if i remember correctly. So not as cheap but not that expensive.Sat down and the table was already set up.good quality meat, steamed egg, rice flours, and of course, the fried rice.We didn't need to call the servers; they came often.really satisfied."
5/21/2018,5 star rating,"Went here before a show at the Wiltern- great food, amazing service (I'm industry so believe me- it's great if I'm saying that), high quality. I wish there were one on the other side of the Orange Curtain! Highly recommend. I can see how parking would be an issue but we were already parked for the event so we just walked over. Yes, some people walk in LA ;)"
12/27/2014,1 star rating,"TL;DR food is okay. Service is trash. Agree with Vivian C - their service will ruin your mood.----------------------I went here with my family the day after Christmas and the service was abysmal. I think the wait staff was stressed with the huge crowds -- there were hordes of people waiting outside to be seated -- but if they can't handle running a restaurant when it's busy, I can help by not patronizing their business.I put my name on the wait list and was told the wait would be about an hour. After about an hour and a half, I was wondering what was going on so I go back in to check the status. To my surprise, my name was skipped over and three other parties were let in before mine. * I was standing right outside the door this entire time *. Looking at the list, the party right after me had a smaller group of 2 people instead of 4 so they might have let them in first and then completely forgot about my group because they let a party of 3 and then 4 in before me as well.Basically, if you want to make sure your spot is maintained you need to be inside the restaurant.Then, when my family and I were waiting for another table to open up, another party was let in before us! The audacity! The servers didn't seem to speak English well and that might have been part of the problem.Anyway, when we get seated we don't have the full array of side dishes that other tables have. It might be because we were complaining earlier but they could have easily turned our moods around with a better dining experience. We weren't yelling, being rowdy, or causing a scene. We just made it clear that we were ahead of many parties and didn't like being pushed aside.Meats would take ~5 min to come out. How hard is it to bring out raw meat? Additionally, the waiters try to remember the order rather than writing it down. This resulted in them bringing another table's order to our table and not bringing the correct meats we ordered twice.We had to ask for water.An hour into the service was when we started to get a lot of service. There were two waiters servicing us now and every time they brought meat out, asked if we wanted more meat. It's as if they wanted to kick us out of the restaurant because we were there too long. If they hardly brought any food out for us, of course we'd be there longer. Everything was brought very quickly. While our food was still cooking, they would bring out more meat and mix the raw food with the cooked foods to make sure as much meat was cooking as possible. They actually keep a timer of how long everybody has been at the restaurant -- it's at the cash register/point of service machine.Overall, the food was okay. I could see that some of the meats were of higher quality. However, service was so bad I would *never* want to go back. When they started cooking food for us , food was awful because they mixed the raw meats with cooked meats so the cooked meats had to be overcooked to make it safe for eating. Maybe they have better service when they aren't this busy but my experience was not a good one."
3/3/2009,5 star rating,"So most of you know about my utter love of the consumption of the side of a cow or an entire pig.So when my friend told me he wanted to treat me to korean bbq for a favor I did for him a couple of weeks ago, the puddle of drool at my feet started to overflow.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE korean bbq because I'm such a huge meatatarian, but I HATE going to and through Ktown. Â But luckily my friend drove, so I had no complaints.We got there a little after 6:30 and the place was less than half full. Â We had a party of 8 and it was just a couple of quick minutes while they pulled a table together. Â The place itself is in a small strip mall and is a couple of doors down from Kyochon. Â Parking is only valet or if you're REALLY lucky, you can find grab one of the spots on the street out front and park for free, like we did. Â Well, it's a meter, so we gave up some coin, boo frickity hoo.So we sit down and the first thing I notice is the grill. Â It wasn't the typical metal grate type grill, it seemed to be made of some sort of stone or something. Â Also, it was set at an angle and on one end, a hole. Â It's so the grease can drain into a drip pan while the meat is cooking, cool deal.We all went for the AYCE and within a couple of minutes, all of the panchan and other stuff was brought out. Â The panchan was kind of lacking but we got more than just the usual oil with salt and chili dipping sauce. Â We got another dish that had fermented soybean paste and on the other side was some jalepeno sauce thingy. Â I don't know. Â We also got a stack of rice paper and sliced pickled radishes. Â Yes!!!The meat came out and even the way the meat was laid out looks really nice and all organized. Â Our server had set up a 2nd grill on the other side of the table and split the meat between the 2 grills. Â There was quite a bit and we all dug in. Â Oh, before she brought out the meat, she brought out kimchi, put that on the grill, as well as spicy beansprouts and logs of that rice paper stuff.The meat was really good. Â Really fresh and of good quality. Â The thin sliced meat was what came out first and we polished that off pretty fast. Â We got a 2nd plate of that and finished that off with no problem. Â Then we moved on to a plate of the pork belly. Â It came out looking like massive pieces of bacon and after cooking for a little bit, she came back and cut them up into smaller, edible pieces.From there we worked our way to some galbi. Â That was really good.So overall, the quality of the meat was a solid 4.5, but what got that extra 1/2 star? Â The service. Â I have to tell you, I don't know the name of our server, but she was awesome. Â She got us everything with a smile nor did she exude any attitude or a ""I'm doing it because it's my job, bleh"" vibe. Â She also hooked us up on the rice paper refills, giving us huge stacks of the stuff, instead of rationing it out like we were in the army.The deal maker was when my friend was reaching for more salad that was in a metal bowl, that was parked RIGHT next to the grill, so as he reached across the grill, he grabbed the hot side of the bowl and ended up burning his finger. Â He dropped the bowl in the process which ricochetted (sp?) off my leg and dropped on the floor, spilling a small amount of salad. Â Almost right away, the girl came over to ask if my friend was ok and blurted something in Korean to some other guy, who came back a couple minutes later to clean up the spill. Â Then they ASKED if my friend wanted ice. Â Yes, THEY ASKED, not WE HAD TO ASK, for ice. Â And it was double bagged so it wouldn't leak. Â Dude, how awesome is that, that's unheardof at a korean bbq place let alone ANY Asian place (RACIST!!!!)So the meal was finished off with kimchi fried rice (which our other friend said is a sign that we're done? Â Which I wasn't really, but whatever, haha. Â The fried rice had strips of seaweed and I don't remember what else but was a nice finish. Â Oh, she also brought a small caldron (yes, a caldron) of soup. Â I took some fried rice and added it to the soup. Â That was good.Oh, what was cool too was how they cleaned the grill. Â She came out with a bowl of shredded daikon radish with a little bit of its juice, poured it out onto the grill, and after some swirling and scraping with 2 griddle spatulas, the grill was clean. Â Kinda cool and isn't something you normally see. Â She did that every time we moved on to a different type of meat and before she made the fried rice.We left very satisfied and full. Â I wasn't stuffed like I could've been, but I was VERY VERY satisfied, especially with such wonderful service from a place that I didn't expect it.While we were there and by the time we left, the place was PACKED."
7/9/2011,4 star rating,"I went to Hae Jang Chon again and this time I could actually eat here. Â The wait wasn't as bad as the first time I went there even though I waited for 30 minutes. Â Do not come here if you're starving because it is a popular place. Â I liked how they gave us 4 dipping sauces: korean pickle soy sauce, sesame oil, soybean paste and chili sauce. Â They also had instruction how to make Korean taco, rice cake wrap, radish wrap and veggie wrap.yelp.com/biz_photos/JYGPâ¦They are generous with banchans: spicy beansprouts, kimchi, sweet potato, radish, spicy fishcake and spicy greens. Â They also give you radish wrapper and rice cake sheet. Â You get kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal. Â That's not all....you also get steamed egg, spicy sour soup and kimchi pancake. Â Service was amazing. Â I only used the bell once, to ask for the check. Â There were always friendly faces asking if we needed more meat, checking if we needed anything or just cooking our stuff. Â 5 stars service!! I liked the meat selections except for pork belly and intestine. Â The pork belly had tiny white bone and my intestine tasted like rubber.$16.99 is a steal for this place. Â I walked out full and satisfied. Â I really liked its kimchi fried rice. Â My fried rice had generous nori...that's why it was so good. Â 4 stars!!Hae Jang Chon's kimchi fried rice is yummylicious!!"
4/21/2016,5 star rating,"I came here on a weekday for their lunch special. Â I ordered the beef short rib soup. Â It is a clear soup with glass noodles and very tender beef short ribs. Â This place is known for ayce, but I suggest you try the lunch menu which is not all you can eat. Â I will definitely be back for the lunch menu."

4/20/2016,2 star rating,"This place has been changed from excellent to below average now in terms of food quality and service. Food quality is lacking of good spirit and not fresh as before. Dined with my wife and son, comment from my wife was actually worse."
4/20/2016,5 star rating,"My favorite ayce Korean BBQ! There is so many choices and I like how everything is set up before you sit down. I love their chadol and galbi! They also give you radish and ricecake wraps for your meat. You can pay extra for the lettuce and sesame leaves, but they give you a salad. Make sure to grill the bean sprouts and kimchi while you eat the meat. Don't forget to get the fried rice with the kimchi.The lines can get ridiculous so make sure get there early before 5pm or after 12am."
4/19/2016,5 star rating,"We came here around 10:45PM on a Saturday night and it was really busy. Typically the wait would be an hour to an hour and a half but thankfully when we got there we beat the rush and for two people we only waited for 20 minutes. I definitely recommend for larger groups to come early or reserve!The food was good. Before you sit at the table, it's already set up with some small plates of different things. The assortment of meat was good from what we saw at nearby tables. We ordered mostly the bulgogi, and the shrimp though for our preference. Definitely try the bulgogi! It's really really good.So we looked at the menu and saw ""soju"" and immediately thought it was like yogurt soju but we were wrong. It came in a little green bottle and tasted straight up like vodka. Boy were we wrong haha. Definitely didn't expect that but the waiter helped us by giving us a small bottle of lemon juice to pour in the shots so that helped a little!"
4/18/2016,3 star rating,"We came around 6:30PM on a week day and didn't have to wait for a table. The staff are super friendly and nice! We got the brisket, short rib with marinade, thick pork belly, and the spicy beef. I feel like it's hard to go wrong with any of these things. Nothing was bad, but nothing was fabulous either. I think I was just a little disappointed by the short rib with marinade. Perhaps I am use to a sweeter marinade and didn't like this one. I think it is a good price for what you get!"
4/18/2016,5 star rating,The best Korean BBQ in LA! Best things are the beef tongue and the thick pork belly. Make sure you get all your meat orders in before the kimchi fried rice! Had a friend in from out of town and he didn't know this - they were nice enough to let us get a couple orders in afterwards anyway. The best!
4/18/2016,2 star rating,I really don't know why this place is overrated? When I first discovered this place it was so good but now that there are other good restaurants are opening I don't seem to come here anymore but one day after work on a Saturday evening we decided to go here because we knew that we would have to wait everywhere else. A whole hour and forty minutes passes and we are finally seated!! By this time we are so hungry that we can eat almost anything but that wasn't the case..We ordered our food and we had to wait another thirty to forty minutes because the had back orders?! OMG.. By the time our meats came out and it wasn't even fresh so we just ate few buyer and left I planning to return!! There are so much other better restaurants in Ktown

4/16/2016,5 star rating,"Favorite all you can eat kbbq place in ktown. The meat, service and atmosphere is not like the other places around the area. To start, the meat is super fresh and never frozen. Everything from the brisket to the pork belly is super fresh. They also cook the meat for you so you don't accidentally overcook it. And it's cooked on a stone grill so it cooks more quickly and makes the meat taste so much better. They have excellent service, never rude and meat comes out quickly. It's more expensive than some of the other ayce places but it's so worth it. It can get crowded, especially on weekends, so be prepared to wait. I came on a Friday night once and it took me almost 1.5 hours to get seated. Thankfully they're open until 2am so you have plenty of time to eat. Parking is valet ($2)."
4/22/2017,5 star rating,"OMG, this place is fantastic! The service, the menus, the food...it was all perfect! The meat they cooked for us was the best quality meat I have ever had! Their side dishes were amazing and the waiter we had was so helpful and fantastic! This place is definitely my new favorite Korean BBQ and I live just around the corner! I highly recommend this place and I'll come back for more, that's for sure."
6/28/2011,4 star rating,"AYCE KBBQ...here I come!!!My bud Tony G. and I were starving and I had the bright idea of gorging on some bomb AYCE KBBQ. I didn't have to twist his arm, oh no! He was down right after I finished asking him! Sooooo many options for KBBQ in Ktown, but I knew we had to try Hae Jang Chon!Driving through Ktown is just as bad as driving through any heavily asian populated area in the SGV. Yes, my cousins are horrible drivers! Sigh...so drive aggressively!As we pulled into the driveway, we notice the parking was valet only...well at least it was at night! Oh well, it beats trying to find street parking. Wait, what's this crazy gathering of multi-ethnic peeps waiting for? OMG!!! They're all waiting to be seated at Hae Jang Chon! I don't have a good feeling about this!Tony is a big boy, so naturally, I used him as my battering ram to clear the path leading to Hae Jang Chon's entryway. Wouldn't you know? As we entered, there were tons of people waiting to be seated all huddled by the cashier counter! We finally made our way to the lady taking names. We put our name on the list and were told there was going to be a 30-45 minute wait. It was at that moment I became severely discouraged. All we could do was grin and bear it, so we stood around inside for a minute but body heat dictated that we go wait outside. We made our way outside and stood around for literally another minute and the next thing we know, the lady called us back inside telling us they had a table ready! OH, THANK YOU, JESUS for that 2 minute wait!!! I think I would have passed out from lethargy!There is one thing that I really have to say that is a turn off: Poor ventilation! The whole dining area becomes rather smoky. Although I loooove the aroma of bbq, I don't care for the aroma becoming a sort of cologne on my clothes and hair!We both opted for the $16.99 AYCE and I must say, this was a successful AYCE experience!BBQ Beef Bulgogi: 4/5Marinade was ideal having the right amount of sweetness. All in all, I'd have to say their beef was more tender than I anticipated.Black Angus Beef Brisket (Chadolbaegi): 3.5/5These thinly sliced cuts of brisket were too fatty for my taste. Please don't misunderstand me. Beef fat is much like pork fat in my opinion...IT RULES, but I tend to feel nauseous and ultimately like a beached whale after eating so much of it. If I'm gonna consume high fat levels, it's gonna be with pork belly!Canadian Fresh Pork Belly (Samgyupsal) - Thin Sliced: 2.5/5I love me some pork belly, but we made the mistake of ordering this thin slice in the first round of meat. Don't do thin slice!Canadian Fresh Pork Belly (Samgyupsal) - Thick Sliced: 5/5Oh my word! We were determined to order thick sliced the second time around and boy was that an epic win! There is a much better taste and texture combination with thick slice. Sure it takes forever to cook, but your patience will be rewarded with crispy fatty goodness! Sigh! I want some right now!BBQ Pork (Daeji Bulgogi): 3.5/5The severing of bbq pork is cooked with in a makeshift aluminum foil container that took a while to cook through completely. Although the marinate was equally delicious as on the beef, I preferred the taste of the beef bulgogi over the pork.Marinated Choice Beef Short Ribs (Galbi): 3/5Not what I expected. Not great, but also not bad. I was anticipating a thicker slice of short rib, so you can imagine my disappointment. It would have been nice if the fat was marbleized, but it was not.Banchans were just okay, but I seriously loved the Kimchi Pancake! I regret not having the Kimchi Fried Rice! Did I mention that I loved the Kimchi Pancake?Service was super attentive, often making rounds to help cook our meat, asking if we'd like more of anything and constantly filing our water carafe.Overall, Hae Jang Chon KBBQ earns a respectable 4 stars. I'll definitely be back... but after I've tried a few more places in the area! ;o)"
2/10/2016,4 star rating,"Was in the mood for ayce Korean Bbq.. and after searching a bit came across Hae Jang Chong. Amazing! Â All-You-Can-Eat dinner for $21.99. Hubby and I found parking on the street pretty quickly so we didn't have to do valet. However, we could tell street parking can be an issue, therefore if you don't want to look use their valet service. We put our name on the list and waited on the lil bench by the door for no more than 5-10min.Sides and dips are already at your table when you are seated. We ordered waters and indulged in several different meats... Brisket, Pork Belly, Shrimp, Short Rib, Chicken, beef bulgolgi, and beef tongue!! Everything was Delicioso!! Our server was Steve and he was Awesome. He came by our table frequentky to ask if we were ok and/or needed anything, and also helped cook n cut our meats... always with a Smile! The ambience was Great. .. everyone around us seemed to be having a great time and enjoying their meals. It was all around Great!!"
3/21/2015,5 star rating,"For $22 AYCE dinner, the service was attentive (phenomenal, in fact) and far beyond what I would have ever expected. Service would compare to a place that charges $50 per entree.Anyway, the food is what you want to know about. Meat quality is really solid -I don't know how they make money - specifically, the marinated beef short rib. There was no rib, just meat. Who cares! Excellent.You can't go wrong here.Do know that there is valet parking (as it is a small parking lot with many people coming and going) and you may end up waiting a long time to get seated. This place is popular for a reason."
7/29/2015,5 star rating,"Hands down the best Korean BBQ place I have eaten at so far.Service here is awesome! They not only cook for you but actually come back every 10 mins to come check on you.The table is already set up with kimchi, potato salad, fish cake and salad. Pretty good but the fish cake is super spicy. I love how there are 22 items I can chose from! I order the brisket and beef tongue to start out and it's fantastic! Just melts in mouth.I absolutely love how I can choose the kimchi pancake or the kimchi rice! That is a plus!The only con about this place is that the wait here is crazy! At least an hour wait! And the parking just as crazy... Don't bother parking in street parking just go for valet which is only $2. Overall a great experience! Would definitely come again!"
4/11/2013,4 star rating,"The customer service and hours of operation is what I really like about this place. They're happy to help and the fact that they're open to 2am every day is great. They often take reservations with no quarrel.The food is good too, and they have beef tongue; apparently my friend says HJC is one of the few places that offer it? Personally I like beef belly which I believe HJC does not have, but their overall menu selection is good for the price. The stone grill cooks the meat evenly but can get pretty greasy towards the end of the meal. Be sure to ask for the fried rice at the end of your meal.The wait can be pretty long so be sure to come early... or extra late."
5/7/2017,5 star rating,"Can't beat the quality/price. My friend and me came early to beat the line. Failed. At 4:30pm there was a line already. Fortunately not too lone so we got inside in about 20mins.Parking: valet only. Find a free parking spot in k town is ridiculously hard.Service: our server is pretty neat, easy going, and kinda shy. Did pretty good job on food cutting, bbq pan cleaning, bring all the food fast. Miss one or two like I want lettuce but after couple rounds of meat he came back and apologized he forgot to bring the lettuce. Food! I love their beef! Beef short rib and octopus are the queen tonight! Beef brisket-good, beef tongue-mediocre, beef intestine- I ordered 2 times one is good the other not, and shrimp-regular. I came here with a single purpose which is the meat. Their marinated beef short ribs does not have too strong flavor so you can still taste the Origin of beef mixing with a typical Korean flavor. The texture of the rib is always good, tender and juicy. All in all, fresh. Credit to the chef as well coz the meat need to be cut and cured in a proper way.Octopus is a plus. My friend gave it a try coz typically octopus on the grill pan will become chewy or whatsoever. Those little glee does not play that hard with your teeth. They are crispy with a little over grill and very easy to slide into your stomach.Definitely come back with proper party and proper time."
3/31/2017,5 star rating,My first trip to La was made by this AYCE Kbbq place the service was great our server ended up cooking for us and talking to us the whole time while getting our refills on point. He told us about all the local things around the area that we should check out. The meat was delicious and it wasn't just like some avg kbbq meat it was actually high quality meat! I highly recommend this place!
4/13/2019,5 star rating,We came here on a Thursday night and we had to wait about one and a half hours or so to be seated. Right as we were seated the service felt extremely rushed(assuming they wanted to get us in and out for other customers). The idea to cook on the stones was very interesting. The waiters came back and forth very frequently which is the reason we felt rushed. The food tasted amazing! We also ordered the kimchi fried rice at the end and it was worth the wait. They cook it right in front of us and the seaweed had a prominent taste in the dish. Definitely going to come here again!
12/9/2017,5 star rating,"Best Korean food I have tasted! $25 all u can eat!!! And the service is the best in Korean restaurant I have had. We left a big tip, because they were very attentive. It's no wonder they have a waiting line. Only thing I would have changed is ordering regular soju. The flavored soju is too sweet to pair with the food, and taste like Robitussin. -that was my mistake, because I already knew I didn't like flavored sake, - why would I like flavored Soju."
5/8/2018,3 star rating,The food is great. The sides should be more though like an authentic banchan. i felt that the server hate his job (Sean is the name) very low customer service value it just let's feel very akward because he's not accommodating at all.
5/19/2010,5 star rating,"After hearing the reviews about the kimchee fried rice at the end of the meal I couldn't resist and made a trek out here. Suddenly, as I valeted my car, I realized I had been here before...Before my Yelping days. Who could forget the cartoon-esque pig mascot on their front sign?? For $16.99, with 19 items to choose from and AYCE....It's pretty much the same as others, but better quality meat. The banchan (side dishes) are plentiful including my faves... mashed potato, steamed eggs, and kimchee pancakes. What really sets this place apart from other KBBQ places and it receiving a 5 star, is the kimchee fried rice in the end. They dump kimchee and marinated bean sprouts with your meat towards the end and mix it all up. FYI: Let your rice cook for a long time to get a nice crust at the bottom. It tastes so much yummier. They also put some miso soup to heat up on your grill. Adding several beers and soju...the last hour was a blur in my mind, but the tummy remembered just how great the meal was."
11/19/2011,3 star rating,"Look, I LOVE this AYCE KBBQ concept. I can honestly say that Korea boasts a culture of serious foodies. I think that this whole meat, rice, side dishes, salad... It satisfies EVERY hunger that you can bring to the table. They also like to mix up their flavors... sweet, salty, sour, bitter, SPICY... All there.Here's the thing... It's the slab. I know I'm gonna get torn apart for saying this, but cooking on a hot, stone slab bothers me. I'm a ""grill man."" I love flame-kissed meats. Watching the fat drip through a grill and into flames ensures me that, indeed, the excess fat is leaving the meat. Many say the flavor goes with it, but I say NAY!... That all depends on the cut. Plus, that's why there's sauce.That said, Hae Jang Chon does it right--and they do it until 2 am!!! They have a VERY generous selection of meats to choose from on their AYCE KBBQ menu. The only reason I've yet to give them a fourth star is that I'm basically won-over by neither the service nor the heated stone slab. Does that make me bad? I don't know.... But it does keep me up at night. I toss and turn at night wondering, ""Why can't HJC just switch over to grills, man? WHY?!?""LOOK OUT FOR:- The Korean pancake... this alone will lead to heart disease, but it's soOo good.- Bulgogi. I don't need to explain why thinly-sliced marinated beef rocks.- The kimchi has a LOT of flavor here... I liked it a lot.- The salad here has some kickin' dressing that works well as a marinade (scoop it onto the meat with a spoon).- The mythical bean paste soup - I ordered this THREE times and it has NEVER arrived... Hmmmm.A great place for large parties, especially after a night of drinking... It can get loud and it stays busy until closing, I've found. Meat variety is staggering... over a dozen things to choose from, and the meat is certainly on the higher end of the AYCE KBBQ scale. Does anything accompany a good drunk better than AYCE grilled meats? Answer: no.Parking, especially during peak hours (late night, Th - Sun), is a nightmare. Waits can be long, so it's best to come in during off-hours. Lunch is best... especially when you can arrive at noon and eat for 14 hours straight; Good luck with that, fatty. :D"
12/6/2017,5 star rating,"Some of the best kbbq I've had!! I came here with a group of 9, and there's only one huge table in the restaurant, so be aware of that. We ended up splitting the group into two tables that were side-by-side. Quality of meat was excellent, and the sauces that are prepared for each person were also great. Pretty much all of them went really well with the different meats. The attendants came back and forth so often and just replaced anything that was low in supply, it's like they read our minds. They also cooked everything for us, which was super efficient. There are also tons of choices to pick from, so there's a little something for everyone. Overall, fantastic place for kbbq!"
1/27/2015,2 star rating,"I did not enjoy my visit here. I came in with two other people around 45 minutes before they were closing. We were rushed to order so when we ordered, they didn't let us get more food than their maximum limit. You are only allowed 3 dishes per order and since they were going to close earlier than they had planned, they only let us order once.We asked since they were only going to let us order once, can we order more than just 3 items since we're paying $25 a person. They denied our request and we were forced to only order 3 items, pay, and leave.Starving and disgruntled, we just went with it. We ordered the pork belly, brisket, and pork shoulder.I didn't know everything here came out frozen. That was a huge disappointment. I guess that's how they do it here but that broke my heart. I was paying top dollar, I was limited to 1 order and only 3 items, and I was eating frozen meats. Maaaaaaan. We left hungry and disappointed. The workers didn't let us buy any more meat. We left before everyone else who were already in the restaurant. 2 Stars."
5/8/2017,4 star rating,"Really good Korean BBQ, but beware of the wait. You should definitely call in a reservation. Way better food than Road to Sole, but you will have to wait for a table. Mid week, you will still be waiting. If you're pressed for time, go somewhere else. But the wait will definitely be worth it. Plus it costs less than other competitors for the same amount of food."
8/17/2014,2 star rating,"I've always been wanting to try this place and I have been told that the best in ktown. Honestly, I disagree. I thought that this place was definitely not worth the wait. Other than the Kim chi fried rice, everything else was mediocre. I did not like the grill at all. The grill made the meat too moist with almost no char. In addition the quality of the meat is not on par with many other places I've tried. In addition, my whole family also got food poisoning from this. This might have been because the waiter kept on telling us to eat the meat that was on the grill. And this meat may not have fully been cooked. Overall I would not really want to come back and it is definitely not as good as what everyone says."
3/19/2017,5 star rating,One of my favorite Korean BBQ joint of all time!! Their meat is always fresh and sides are amazing!! Make sure you get extra brisket sauce on the side because it makes everything taste so much better!!
8/31/2013,4 star rating,"my cousin recommended this AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant, Â I don't regularly eat at Â Korean BBQ AYCE, this is the 2nd time I've eaten at this restaurant, i wasn't feeling well the first time i ate there 8 months ago, Â we kept ordering more meat, since they only give you 1 bowl of rice per person, i don't like the taste and smell of their Kimchi condiments Â (which is unlimited)Service was fast and friendly, there's a call Button by each table that you press to call a waiter my cousin did the cooking, since he is more experience in eating at Korean BBQ AYCE restaurants. of all the ones he and his wife have eaten at. this place is their favorite. this is a VERY Popular place, if you come at around 6pm, Â there would be a LONG wait, Â we got there at 8pm last time and we had to wait an hour to get a table.the food was good, The place was noisy, you have to talk loud to be heard by someone sitting across the table from you.Overall i would recommend this place"
2/16/2015,4 star rating,"PROS:- The stone grill makes everything a lot easier (meat doesn't stick onto the grill like at other restaurants). No need to change the grill every ten minutes!- Staff is super friendly and attentive. The system is well-organized, and no one seems to be too busy serving one too many tables. - Meat is good quality, especially for an AYCE KBBQ joint. Quality AND quantity!- You can get kimchi fried rice cooked right in front of you after your meal.CONS:- Long wait, especially at night on the weekend -- but this is pretty common anywhere you go in K-town.- They don't have daechang (large intestine)."
5/20/2013,5 star rating,"I absolutely love this place. Parking: there is valet for only $2! What a deal! It usually ends at 12am but no worries cause you just tell the valet person where you are going and he will look for you when its 12am to hand back your keys. Food: the food was delicious! The brisket and beef tongue are my favorites! Cut into very thin slices and always very flavorful/umami. The best beef taste! I have been to my fair share of kbbqs and i'd have to say that this is my favorite. Service : the servers seem like they are always in a rush... This guy kept on coming back to our table and cooking the meat for us. Everytime i picked up the tongs he would come by, take the tongs from my hand and cook for me. It was a nice gesture but seriously EVERYTIME i picked up the tongs. The servers hardly smiles or says anything either except for ""more meat?"" Decor: small place. I wouldnt come to this place with a big group. The wait would take foreverrrrr."
12/4/2015,5 star rating,"The best service ever... Servers were checking ever few minutes to see if we were okay, to see if we needed more meat or anything, and also cleaned our grill well. The place is also was not as crowded and the quality of the meat was very good. I will definitely be coming back here! Shout out to our amazing servers!!"
5/1/2018,5 star rating,"Some friends brought me here and I was really impressed. Not only are the servers, particular ours, Jun, super attentive, but they were polite and courteous. I was not used to having someone else help cook meat but it was a welcome luxury. And I appreciate that they clean the stone top with radishes. I think that just adds to the experience here."
9/23/2010,4 star rating,"4.5 starsSo I was actually saving to review this place! This place is my favorite KBBQ place to go to on average. Â For 16.99, you definitely get your money worth. Â I've definitely gotten bad experiences before tho... Â  But let's talk about the better ones first in this review.So there are 23 different option of food, I think it's 23. Â It's not all meat tho. I'll see if I can list most of the meat. There's galbi (marinated and non-marinated), brisket, bulgogi, bbq pork, squid, chicken, beef tongue, pork shoulder, pork belly (thin and thick), beef abomasum (don't get this, it's unedible haha, you'll chew all day and you still won't be able to eat it), hot dogs (that's right, hot dogs), and beef honeycomb. Â I think that's it.So when you first get here, you'll sit down, and they'll serve you your banchon, and the water, etc etc, same ol'. Â For the sidedishes, there's honestly nothing extraordinary, all the typical ones, the steamed egg here is good tho. Â They will first ask you if you want the kim chi and pickled bean sprouts on your grill (the grills are ceramic too, not the typical steel ones). Â Then they would give you the kim chi pancakes. Then you'll order the meat. How they do the meat here is they'll take your order, and take it to the counter in the back and order it, then they'll prep the meat and when it's done being prepped they'll bring it back out. Â So at the end of the bill, you'll see how much you ordered! Good or bad thing?Now you eat, nom nom nom, then you'll be asked if you wanted kim chi fried rice and the soup or not, and how many orders. Â After you get that, you're done!SUGGESTIONS!!!- Â First thing, if you order rice, that takes place of an order of kim chi fried rice, which is really lame. Â So if you want kim chi fried rice at the end of the meal, make sure not everyone at your table orders rice, cuz if you guys do, you'll have to pay an extra 5 dollar per order of kim chi fried rice, sneaky sneaky.- The Kalbi are really goood here! so are the brisket. Â I wouldn't recommend the abomasum, SOOO hard to eat, but do try everything. Â The hot dogs are typical 99c packaged hot dogs you'll find at a grocery store.. so not worth it to take up space in your tummy. Â I prefer the thick pork belly over the thin pork belly, there's usually small bones in the thin pork belly and it's harder to them out after you cook them.- The beef tongue is really good here too! Â  But definitely try everything.- For parking, it's $2 for valet, I would recommend take a stroll around the street parking around the area before going to valet, just take one spin around and you'll most likely find parking on any day, other than Friday primetime hour. Â I've rarely had to go to the valet parking.- If it's prime hours, order your meat when you have all the meat on your grill, cuz if you don't, you'll have to wait like 10 minutes in between eating instead of constantly eating!- So I tend to be the cook in my groups, like always, so this place is a bit different because there's a drainage system in the ceramic grill. Â There's a hole on one side that drips down to a pan that holds all the oil/marinated sauce. Â So what I usually do is cook all the really juice/oily meat (kalbi, marinated beef, pork belly), near that hole, and all the dryer meat (brisket, beef tongue, etc) on the other side so not everything will taste like marinated beef or something.Overall, my favorite place. Â I've had bad experiences (Waiting for A LONGGG time to be seated), having rude services (I haven't seen those guys back tho), and taking forever to get our food. Â But all that gets trumped by the quality of the food for the price you're paying for."

Â MMMMMMMMMMMMThe hot dog and kimchi fried rice was actually pretty good too.I am disappointed that they took their $.25 coffee machine away, that stuff was awesome!! Â I wonder if I can just buy the machine off them... hmmm...Come early, cuz when we left the other day, there was a LONGGGGGGGG wait! Oh, yea...

4/18/2010,3 star rating,"In trying to make a reservation at Hae Jang Chon on a different night, I was denied and practically told to not even bother coming. That definitely left a bad taste in my mouth, but I can't stay mad at Korean BBQ.So a friend, his sister, my sister and I decided to have a siblings night out and give this place another try.Their All You Can Eat menu definitely did not lack variety. For only $16.99 a person, our choices were brisket, short ribs (marinated or not), bbq beef (bulgogi), pork belly, pork shoulder, beef tongue, bbq pork, bbq chicken, squid, intestines, stomach lining (tripe), hot dogs, and small octopus. We also got free Kimchi pancakes, steamed egg, rice cake, bean paste soup and a choice between steamed rice or kimchi fried rice(the one you get at the end of your meal).The pork was definitely the main reason people come here. The bulgogi was also really tender and tasty. The rest, however, did not impress. Also, we decided to get the steamed rice instead of the kimchi rice. We wanted to enjoy the meat, and didn't want to leave room for rice after our main meal.Great service. They were definitely on top of everything!I would definitely come back and I recommend you make reservations way in advance on the weekends."
11/18/2009,4 star rating,"The kimchee fried rice is AMAZING!!!! Â I wanted to take the leftovers home, but since it's all you can eat, they didn't let me. Â :(((((( Â I wanted to subtract ten starts just for this, but I guess I'll just have to come back instead. Â But, seriously, they make it anyway, and they're just going to throw it away. Â Such a waste....Oh, and when the girl was cleaning the grill, she totally splashed me with dirty, greasy water. Â :((((((((( Â If the food wasn't so good, I would have taken away even more stars. Â Moral of the story: don't wear nice clothes, and make sure to save room for rice!"

3/19/2016,4 star rating,"Love the food here, the service was great and friendly. But the only reason for the four stars and not five is the waiting time. We waited 2 hr + before we got seated, so if you're starving and impatient not really the place for a quick bite. Other than that nothing else to complain about."
5/14/2015,4 star rating,I'm not a Korean BBQ connoisseur by any means but to someone that goes maybe twice a year it was pretty standard. I thought the meats were fine for it being AYCE but nothing to write home about. I honestly give it 3.5 stars but I'll round up to 4 since I went at lunch and didn't have to wait outside for hours.
12/16/2012,5 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised by Hae Jang Chon. Before, it had an air to it that seemed ""overrated"". This is because I've tried to eat here several times only to be told the wait was 1-2 hours... WITH a reservation! Okay. So, luckily, I had the opportunity to drop by for lunch early on Saturday. The wait wasn't too long... ~15 minutes.First off, you can't beat the price at $16.99! Second, I love any place that serves me some doenjang jjigae (spicy korean miso soup) as part of my meal. Third, they also give you free kimchi pancake and steamed egg. Trifecta! Overall, the offerings are great--from the side dishes to the meat quality. I'd say the winner here is the thin sliced pork, which was basically a thinner sliced version of the thick pork belly. Awesome! Maybe it was just us, but our brisket was particularly greasy. We were so full, we didn't have any room for the kimchi fried rice at the end. Regardless, what an amazing menu! Throw in some friendly service and the place has definitely become one of my favorites, if not my favorite for the more intimate outings. The place just doesn't seem too well suited for larger groups greater than six."
3/17/2018,5 star rating,"Hands down best meats, sides, and service. Worth the hour wait you can get stuck in. Just wear comfortable shoes and take great company."
7/12/2015,4 star rating,"I came here on a Saturday night and waited an hour to be seated. It was long, but expected. I was excited to try cooking on this stone plate! To me this is everything you can ask for from a KBBQ restaurant! We got the usual brisket, bulgolgi, and pork belly - everything was excellent. The banchans were all very delicious and fresh as well especially the bean sprouts and kimchi. The waiters here were a little slow bringing out the food, but they come by often to help you cook which is nice because you can sit back and just worry about eating. The best part was the kimchi fried rice at the end. The down side is that you won't get rice during your meal, which made my boyfriend sad because he loves rice. The Kimchi fried rice made on the stone plate creates the nice crisp."
5/23/2009,3 star rating,"Got here around 6pm for a party of 13. Valet = $2. The grills were circular shaped, and I don't know if it's the grill or the meat, but the galbi wasn't that juicy to me, and the bulgogi was meh. Also, the tables were small compared to other kbbq places. The only side dishes were the kimchi pancakes, which were yummy, the steamed egg, which is definitely the best I've eaten, rice paper, and salad. Service could've been better. I can tell she tried, but we definitely had to repeat everything we asked for 2 times or more. It wasn't that they were ignoring us on purpose, but I think she really just forgot. Towards the end she got better though, by refilling our rice papers and giving us those refreshing iced teas. Another thing that kinda annoyed me was that there were these outside solicitors that actually came into the restaurant trying to sell us wine for $16, and in return we get these ""free gifts"". That was kinda...odd.What's nice about this place is that they had TVs so our group was watching the Lakers! Also it was clean. However, other than that, it was nothing out of the ordinary."
11/26/2017,5 star rating,Their bulgogi was amazing and super authentic. Was a big fan of the service and will be back again.
8/25/2014,4 star rating,"The wait was long but well worth it. We came on a Sat & waited 30-40 min for a table. Great selection of meat. The only thing that was annoying was how rushed the workers made us feel as every 10 minutes (literally) they stopped by to ask us if we wanted more meat. Also, they cook your food for you - even if they see you doing it yourself, they will take the tongs for you in an attempt to make the meat cook faster. At first, I thought ""cool, how nice,"" until 4 different workers came to stir our bulgogi for us within 10 minutes. -_____-"
7/11/2015,5 star rating,"Came here yesterday for dinner around 630pm and had our party of 6 ready to go. Waiter asked us if we were all here and said he'll get the table ready. We didn't bother putting our names down & I started to get worried when more people started coming and writing their names down thinking we'll be forgotten. After around 10 mins we were seated! I was surprised bc it was our first time here and I've read the reviews about the wait.Now on to the food - everything we had was good! Our first order of spicy bbq pork did disappoint us though bc it lacked flavor. Good thing we ordered another one before tasting the first one bc the second one was amazing! Meats we tried: Spicy bbq porkBbq chickenSquidBeef brisket Marinated short ribBulgogiShrimpThin sliced pork belly What stood out for me was the service. Someone was constantly checking up on us and helping us cook out meats. We never had to wait for more meat bc they already asked what we wanted next while the last batch was cooking. They even gave us the water pitcher bc they saw how much water we drank. Our grill was constantly cleaned too. If I wasn't from the eastbay, I would be coming here all the time!"
8/23/2015,5 star rating,"TLDR;-Meat quality is good (recommend brisket & pork belly)-Service is better, very attentive (they cook the meat for you!!)-Kimchi fried rice with seaweed served at the end of the meal (delicious)-Reservations for parties of 6 or more-Valet parking $2This is well worth the price for AYCE kbbq. I usually avoid Ktown for Korean BBQ because it's crowded, the parking is either valet or nonexistent, and the meat quality is not great.However, this establishment surprised me with their food quality and impeccable service. My favorite meat was the brisket, short rib, and thick pork belly. The quality was good. What really impressed me was the service. It might be that the dining area is not too big, but everywhere you look there is a waiter or waitress ready to serve you! I personally love that they cook the meat for you. I didn't touch the tongs once!! At the end of the meal, they serve a kimchi fried rice with seaweed. Its cooked right on the grill, and it was very flavorful. The seaweed offers a unique texture. I came early around 6:30 and we only waited about 25 minutes. However, I expect the wait to have been much longer if we arrived around 7, so be careful! Reservations are available for parties of 6 or more. Valet parking is $2."
7/28/2014,1 star rating,"Charged full price (18.99) for my 8 and 1/2 year old cousin. Really????Service was slow. We had to wait a long time and kept asking to get our water, sides, refilled.Pressure to hurry up and finish ordering. Server kept asking if our order was our very last order. Not a pleasant experience. No options for vegetarians other than a bibimbap (in which case I would not get any banchan, soup, fried rice, pancake that comes with the AYCE option). If they have even mushrooms or some kind of veggie choices in addition to the 19 varieties of animal products, it would have been better. Loud restaurant with people gorging themselves on unhealthy fatty meat. No thanks."
1/28/2015,5 star rating,"This is my go-to AYCE KBBQ restaurant, and I always bring my friends here whenever they want good AYCE. Wonderful variety of meats, and pretty good quality. There's a few good side dishes (but come on, you want to save room for the meat). Really good service (few exceptions when it's busy, but in general great). This place also seems to be great for groups, although I've never had a bigger group than 8 people.The menu is really something. It offers pretty much all the meat you can think of for a very reasonable price, plus a bunch of extra kimchi pancakes, steamed egg, and bean stew (plus kimchi fried rice if you decide to get it over regular white rice). Holy cannoli, it makes my mouth water when I think of it. Save yourself the wait and money by coming here during lunch! I've been here during very busy hours and the wait was one and a half hours maximum. Also, dinner is around $30-35/person for the exact same service and menu during lunch (~$25).We were seated within 10 minutes on a Sunday lunch rush. The waitresses were so attentive and immediately got us everything we needed, grilled us our meat, and asked us what we wanted whenever we were done with the batch of meat. They also refilled our water constantly! Automatic 3 stars :3 Parking can be a disaster when coming here or anywhere in K-Town, but there is valet so... :)"
1/20/2018,1 star rating,Got here at 6pm it is now 9:14. And I'm still waiting every time I ask they say it's 1 more hour Â horrible the food is good but there service sucks
5/19/2018,1 star rating,"Long wait. 1 and a half hours. Seating process where they appear to expedite the seating of larger parties (3 or more), probably with the goal of maximizing their revenue. Meanwhile, parties of 2 suffer the longest seating times. This process quite unfair. Food good. Server very good. Cost - acceptable. Host at door - unacceptable.I doubt I will return for the reasons stated above."

5/9/2013,4 star rating,"Hubby and I had an awesome double date here last week. For $18 this all you can eat korean bbq joint has quality meats, and tasty marinades. The stone grills are awesome, as are the staff that comes by to clean them between meats. The reason why I'm knocking off one star is four-fold.1. No A/C. I don't know if they have it but just didn't turn it on, but the place was HOT.2. They charge you $5 for lettuce leaves. Not cool, man. That's like 30% of what we're already paying. Why are you gouging me on lettuce leaves??3. They also charge you for rice. Although they make you some delicious, crispy fried rice at the end of the meal with all your kimchee and meat scraps. 4. No gochujang (red pepper paste) sauce. Although they DO include chinese hot sauce instead. Kind of weird.All together, though, this is a solid AYCE bbq joint. :) I especially liked the rice paper wraps that were included. My korean hubby is slowly koreanizing me. Yikes."
6/27/2011,4 star rating,"All you can eat Korean BBQ on a stone grill. Â The stone grill is angled so that the fat and grease from the meat empties out into a tray through the hole. Every so often when the hole gets dirty and clogged the server comes by with a bowl of shredded daikon to clean out the grill. Â A few moments later your grill is ready to start cooking again. For $16.99 you get unlimited choices of your various meats ( I recommend that you try the pork belly) + your wraps (lettuce, radish, tortilla, rice cake) + your side dishes including steamed egg, doenjang (bean paste soup) and kimchee fried rice! Â The kimchee fried rice is served at the end of your meal and should not be passed up so try and save some room. Be prepared because HaeJangChon gets crowded and there are often long waits. Â But in my opinion, it's worth it. Â The meats are good, the service is usually competent, and I love the way they slap on some bean sprouts and kimchee to cook on your grill. Valet parking is $2."
10/20/2011,5 star rating,"""How are you guys doing over here?""What did you just ask, KBBQ waiter? Did you just ask how our dining experience is coming along? AND in a honestly nice tone and not a grunt?? Are we still in ktown?My friends and I love this place. It's only a few more dollars than other KBBQ places but the food and service is soooooo much better. Instead of the usual metal grills, they use stone grills (which probably makes the meat taste better). Because of this, they don't change the grill pan but instead come and clean/scrub the stone grill with radish. It's pretty interesting to watch. They automatically come and do this without you having to ask! The meat here is delicious - my favorite is the thick korean bacon (the thick layer of Â fat just melts in your mouth), brisket, short rib, and bbq chicken. The meat was great quality (not an expert but I can taste the difference) and they aren't stingy with the portions.The All You Can Eat price includes eggs, pancakes, and fried rice/white rice. They bring these things out without being asked, which is really nice. They bring out the kimchi fried rice after you finish eating meat and cook it on the stone grill. The fried rice is just alright but that's probably because I'm always stuffed by the end. Lastly, the service here is GREAT. Usually I have to jam the bell button at other korean BBQ places, but not here! The place is pretty small and they always have enough servers to help us promptly. They automatically bring us things (side dishes, water, sauce) when they see that we've run out and they ask how we are doing!They close at 2am so we always come late and manage to find parking on the streets. It's ad for my diet and bad for my health, but it makes me so, so happy."
3/12/2018,5 star rating,"Long wait but well worth it! I loved everything about this experience. The foods delicious, all you can eat. Each time you order 3 different meats at a time.

7/22/2010,4 star rating,"When you're wandering around late at night on a weeknight and all of your other favorite AYCE KBBQ places are closed, Hae Jang Chon will come to the rescue. Â Because it fills a late night void, it deserves 4 stars.The banchan was bad and the service was horrible. Â Even the meat was just above average. Â But when you're hungry in the middle of the night and you want to pretend like you're in a scene in a k-drama, this place is awesome!Note that the benches are not comfortable. Â At least they were smart enough to drop the price back down to $16.99. Hey, that $1 was the reason I hadn't been there in 2 years."

2/19/2017,1 star rating,"This place is ridiculous and overrated. I made reservations 2 weeks before my birthday dinner with a party of 10 and I called the day of to confirm. They claimed they lost or never had my reservation and refused to do anything to fix the situation. After showing up at 6:30 for a group of 10 to try to make up for the lack of a ""lost"" reservation and waiting 2 hours the hostess and manager were rude, unfriendly and said it would still be another hour or 2 before we could be seated. And then a group of 8 gets seats who had shown up after us. This place is not worth it at all. Go to any other BBQ place down 6th (like Brother BBQ) you'll get the same if not better food for no wait and same price. Will not be going back to this inhospitable, rude Resturant."
2/25/2015,5 star rating,"First review ever...This place is great! One of my 2 favorite korean bbq places in ktown. Yes, its gotten expensive to eat here (roughly $25 a head for ayce not including tip... I remember when it used to be aprox. $25 including tip) but the service is great! And that means a lot in ktown, which is notorious for ""bad service"". Not naming any places in specific...but Ive had my share of this at other korean bbq places. I will always pay more to enjoy my meal! The waiters are on point and urgently up beat! The food is top quality! This place is distinct from others because it uses stone pan grills which lock in flavors of the meat. The decor is so cute and quaint. Sets a young yet comfortable feel. Note of caution: its a small place. Dont bring a big (more than 4) group without calling for a reservation. This is especially true Friday through Sunday. During the week its calm. Accommodation isn't a problem. Make a reservation! Trust me! Anddd make sure everyone in your party is there or you will not be seated! Parking is $2 vallet or self park street which can get complicated during the weekend or any day actually. #ktownproblems. I love Hae Jang Chon and have been coming here for years & I always will! Â Sorry for my poor grammar!"
2/2/2015,2 star rating,"For 24/person plus tip about 28/person for ACYC bbq, would not recommend it compared to the other ones out there for the same price or less (such as bud namu only 11.99 or 17.99)The staff was nice and english speaking but they were kinda rushing us to finish, ""are you all done?"" they would keep coming to ask. And not like we stayed too long, definitely under 2 hours. Plus they don't give lettuce. It would be an extra $5 a plate. The raw garlic slices were Â but already went bad. We tried to order less squid, just for a taste, they said ok but ended up giving us whole squid so we felt obligated to finish it since they post that they charge for extra food that was ordered but not finished."
3/27/2017,2 star rating,"This place was a waste of money and time, (and we didn't even have to wait for a table). Mediocre is the only word for it. Their banchan are so salty they're almost inedible, the meat orders are tiny and low quality, and the meat comes to the table frozen. It releases a lot of water on the stone grill. There's none of the smoky, delicious, char flavor to the meat here. With the stone grill and low quality meat, it basically just slowly dries out until it's ""cooked"" but also totally tough and flavorless. The service also left a lot to be desired. We ordered a steamed egg, and it literally arrived at the table at the same time as the check."
4/18/2017,4 star rating,One of the BEST kbbqs in LA. VERY affordable price for AYCE of this quality. Service was great too because there was always someone attending to our table and helping us cook our meat. Will definitely come back again to thrash the stone grill with the marinated meats.
1/16/2016,3 star rating,"I drove 30 minutes to have them tell me they're closed. Yelp said 2:30 & I got here at 1:30. I can't leave less than 3 stars though because I didn't have the chance to try any of the food, even though there were many seated tables beginning to eat their delicious looking food. PS: the table were round which was different than what I had expected, but interestingPSS: I did call them 30 min prior to ask if they served brisket and the answer was, yes, but no mention of the soon closing time."
3/31/2019,1 star rating,I've been coming here for 10 years. Everything is great except they changed the salad. It use to be just lettuce and dressing which was a great combination with the meat. Now it has sesame seeds onions and chili flakes. They should at least have two options. Original and this new horrible salad. Please change it back to original or provide two

12/2/2011,5 star rating,"$16.99 AYCE BBQ You can't go wrong wit dat! Go in a big group if you want to have some drunken night of stuffing yourselves 'til 2am and make reservations so you don't have to wait...as. long. I don't think they do reservations for parties of less than 6 I believe... But no matter what, during dinner time, there will ALWAYS be a wait. They have valet parking for $2 so parking is definitely not an issue unless the $2 is...For $16.99 you can get AYCE: bulgogi, black angus beef brisket, marinated beef short ribs, pork belly, pork shoulder, beef tongue, bbq pork, bbq chicken, bbq squid, beef abomasums, beef honeycomb, hot dogs. Not only do you get AYCE of all THAT but you also get kimchi pancake, rice cake wrapping thing and you can get kimchi fried rice or steamed rice.My favorites are bulgogi, black angus beef brisket, marinated beef short ribs, beef tongue, bbq squid, and pork belly. I've never tried the abomasums and honeycomb. Sounds...exotic O_OI also love the ayce sides they give you... my favorites are kimchi, potato salad, and fresh salad to eat with your beef and wrap with that rice paper thing!I've came here in a big group, with 3 other people and with 1 other person. The wait time were all very long. But it is well worth it! :o) I personally enjoy coming in smaller groups because you don't have to deal with other people's pickyness. C'mon it's ayce kbbq. Don't be picky with that ish! If you don't eat meat or pork or kimchi then get outtaaa hurrr.The servers are really attentive and quick. They know w'sup so you and your tummy leave satisfied :)"

7/5/2016,5 star rating,"This is one of the top all you can eat korean BBQ spots I've been too in LA. Great selections and great quality of meats. The only con is the wait, but they accept reservations!"
1/17/2015,4 star rating,"Came in on a rainy Saturday evening around 615 for dinner. For the first time in my life, valet parking told me that there were no more spaces left in the lot and that I would need to find parking out on the street. After circling around for about 15 minutes I finally managed to find a parking spot proximately three blocks away from the establishment.We were a party of five and were told by the front desk that the wait would be approximately an hour long. Normally I would have given up by this news, but my friend was persistent on trying that's all you can eat BBQ.After about an hour or so we were finally seated inside the restaurant. One thing that stood out was that the grils were actually a stone grill rather than the metal grill at other kbbq resutarnts. Now personally, I hate eating salads at an all you can eat Korean barbecue restaurant because I feel like it is a waste of money. I also hate ordering the low quality meat such as a thinly sliced pork bellies and the beef briskets because they're Â not really the best thing to order if you want the most bang for your buck. However, my friends insisted on ordering the beef briskets and the pork bellies, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. More importantly, the marinated short ribs (the most important meat of any Korean BBQ establishment), were great quality and very delicious.Service was impeccable. This is a great plus for me personally because from my previous experience most Korean restaurants tend to have pretty poor service. Multiple waitresses and waiters stop by our table and helped cook our meat and we're always refilling our ban chans.After our meal, they made us fresh kimchi fried rice, and it was bomb. Pushed us over the edge on fullness level, but totally worth it!! Â If it weren't for the wait, easily a 5/5."
3/3/2018,5 star rating,"It was my first time trying Korean bbq and I loved it! I am plant based now but let me just tell you guys, try BULGOGI!! Yuuumm it was really tasty and the employees were also nice and helpful! They would come to my table and ask if we needed anything! Very helpful and friendly!"
6/28/2017,5 star rating,We enjoyed the AYCE KBBQ here. Its diff compared to other places bc of their stone griddle. I dunno if its clay or stone... unsure but either way it cooks differently. Service was good and the table was good size for our party of 3. The wait though is LONG. We waited nearly an hour. Either way its worth it. Enjoy!
4/14/2017,5 star rating,"This is probably my favorite kbbq in ktown in LA. Although the wait is usually a minimum of half an hour, it is worth it. The meat is always fresh and the service is awesome. They bring the food out to you quickly and you're never left waiting. The bulgogi is very juicy and the thin pork belly is to die for. Also, the soju is good here. I'm from the East coast, and there's nothing quite like LA kbbq."
4/3/2011,4 star rating,"A great place to get some late night All-You-Can-Eat KBBQ (I like it better than Road to Seoul, better than Mu Dung San). Â The wait on weeknights around 10 p.m. can be anywhere from 0-15 minutes, while on a Friday or Saturday night, the wait is 60 minutes at 10 p.m. Meat is cooked on a stone plate grill, not a metal grill with drip holes. Â We usually get either the brisket, marinated short rib, spicy pork, pork belly, or bulgolgi. Â The marinated short rib pieces are tender and juicy, flavorful, pre-cut and deboned. Â All the meats are good, my fave is always the brisket.Kimchi is served/kept warm on your stone grill. Â You get the steamed egg, the bean paste soup, along with spinach, potato salad, fish cake. Â  If you like garlic and jalepenos, be sure to ask for a side of that to put on your grill. Â  Â  What makes this place different and awesome? Â That they scrub your grill clean by cooking shredded radish to moisten absorb all the oil and burnt meat bits? Â Definitely rad. Â But you want to know about food. Â How about Kimchi Fried Rice? Â  Kimchi Fried Rice is the bomb and I haven't seen it served at any other all-you-can-eat places. Â A lot of people either don't know about it or are too full to ask for it. Â When you are done with your little meat party, you can ask your server for the kimchi fried rice, no extra charge. Â Soooo good. Â Just the right amount of chopped kimchi, rice, hot sauce, and a lot of shredded seaweed mixed together and pan fried on your bbq grill. Â Let it sit a little longer and it becomes crispy, like dolsot bibimbap rice. Â If you don't find parking, then don't be cheap, just valet it for $2. Â Last night there was a hold up at the valet pickup. Â We couldn't get out because the valets wouldn't give some non-Asian guys the keys to their car because they tried to run out on their bill at Hae Jang Chon. Â The server ended up hunting them down collecting the money from them. Â Don't be ghetto, pay the bill. Â $16.99, all you can eat. Â If you can't afford it, go get some $2 fries or some $1 pickled radishes next door at Kyo Chon."
6/28/2015,5 star rating,Loved this place! Always a great experience when having this kind of Korean BBQ. The staff is very attentive and the price was amazing for lunch at $20 each. It's also an all you can eat! Would definitely recommend eating here.
1/5/2018,5 star rating,This place the meat quality is great the service wow was my reaction they are on point. The service they are always around and ready to assist. The only pain is the initial wait to get a table but once you're in you'll be glad you waited. I liked everything I tried. I love KBBQ this is definitely one of the top spots I've tried so far you can make reservations if your group is bigger then 6 so take a big group and go
2/27/2012,5 star rating,"YESSSS I'M THE 1000th REVIEWER!!!! Do I get a special prize or something?!?! EEEeeeeeeeeeek. Haha, sorry, I had to get that out of my system. So ""screeching like a little school girl"" aside, I was totally impressed by the excellent service and overall experience I had at this place. Sure, waiting for 1 1/2 hours was a little annoying, especially after being told that we'd be next every 20 minutes, but the place is hopping! People, it cannot be helped!And rightfully so. They have your classic meats, brisket, bulgogi, short rib, pork belly. Whatever. And your classic price, I think it was $17.99? Anyway, the difference? STONE GRILL. Which means less burned meat, more evenly cooked meat, and pretty frequent cleanings, where they scrub the stone down with some shredded radish....raaaad. And they got your banchan, egg souffle, yadiyadi. OK, so things are looking good so far.Well, they end the meal with kimchi fried rice, cooked on your hot stone grill. Mm mmmm love me some kimchi fried rice. So save some space! Just FYI, if you like getting white rice with your meat, it's either that or the kimchi fried rice finale. I'd just go Atkins and devour the meat with greens and enjoy the kimchi fried rice at the end :P"
9/12/2014,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time now and finally had to chance on Labor Day weekend. It's AYCE place. Â We just got their before the lunch time rush. Â The food and service was great. Â I liked that they used a stone grill instead of the usually grill plates that other KBBQ places use which needs to be changed out often. Â The selection of side dishes that they provide are all tasty. Â Especially the kim chi. Â It's in a busy plaza in Ktown, but they have valet parking available for only $2. Â The squid, marinated short ribs, and kim chi fried rice was our top items, but all other items we ordered were tasty as well. Â They open late too so that you can get your KBBQ fix before heading home for the night."
4/24/2015,3 star rating,"I drive by Hae Jang Chon on a daily and there is always a wait outside. I was with a party of 15, and we were put in the corner because of the size of our group. The services are pretty cool, because they do a lot of the cooking for you, and are pretty attentive when needed. The BBQ was alright, but I have had better spots. Check it out! ENJOY!"
5/18/2011,4 star rating,"I came here super late last night. At around 12:30 am. It wasn't packed at all with one waiter doing all the work. This place is located in the heart of K-town. The AYCE here is awesome. The service is pretty good. Would've been better if they had another person on staff. I tried the awesome brisket, bbq beef , beef tongue, thin sliced pork belly, and marinated short rib. All the meats were delicious. The bbq beef was the most flavorful and the brisket is the easiest to eat. All the meats were pretty tender. The sides here was really good as well. The radish went great with the meat and rice paper. The fish cake was a hit with my friends. The kim chi fried rice at the end was just okay though. You've got to leave it on for awhile to make sure it's crispy. I would definitely come back and eat here with my friends again. Recommendation: Everything"
12/23/2012,5 star rating,"Came in on a weekday and the wait was about 15 minutes for a party of 2. The table we were seated at was so spacious, unlike many others. 5 for ambiance! It waitress was this nice lady who was wonderful, but there was a miscommunication with another waiter about the kimchi fried rice and he had to take the rice off the grill because w had more meat coming. Awkwardddd. Meats were delicious, but there were a limited selection of sides. there were radish wraps though. The salad was a lot sweeter than many other places, which I ended up liking. They also provided 4 dipping sauces per person (party of 2?) which was really convieniant. Overall a great place for ayce bqq."
2/24/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing food!!! My family and I waited about an hour and a half so be willing to wait for a bit. However, it was definitely worth it as the Galbi and bulgolgi were amazing! And it also helped that it was all you can eat. It was 26 dollars per person for the dinner AYCE. Definitely would go again!"
2/24/2018,5 star rating,My favorite AYCE KBBQ spot. Fair price and the meats are exquisite. I recommend the Tongue rather than Brisket to start off and the marinated beef short rib. Great service and they do their best to accommodate larger groups.
10/8/2014,5 star rating,"So many reviews already so I debated whether to keep beating a dead horse here...but here i am...only because this place is freaking awesome. Â Absolutely the best Korean BBQ all you can eat restaurant in KTown Los Angeles. Â Yes its not the cheapest KBBQ out there (definitely been to ones at the more questionable $10 AYCE places...can it really be real meat at that price??) and the wait here can be mind numbing, nevertheless the amazing food quality (pork belly nommm...*drool*...) and super friendly and inviting service really help Hae Jang Chon stand out in the truly crowded and competitive AYCE KBBQ LA food niche. Â So if you are looking for the best KBBQ...hands down...don't think twice...head over to Hae Jang Chon.Quick Tips- Arrive early if you don't want to wait...before 6 pm ideally- Hot Dogs = Vienna Sausages (a curiosity order from my dad)- Parking is tough around the area...use the valet...its worth the few bucks"
5/19/2011,4 star rating,"In the cutthroat world of AYCE KBBQ, every restaurant has its day in the sun. Â There were the old school kicks like Manna, Mudungsan, and Tahoe. Â They passed the torch to upstarts like Road to Seoul and now Hae Jang Chon. Â  My friends and I are gonna ride this hot horse until it inevitably falls back to the rest of the pack. Â  Maybe the service is slipping, as others reviews have noted, but then again we're never bashful to pound the service button and ask for more panchan, rice wraps, and Robitussin flavored soju. Â  Just par for the course for KBBQ.As your resident Korean tourguide, this place isn't perfect. Â  But for $17, no place is. Â  The daenjang and egg soups are forgettable, the salad mix is decent (RTS is much better in this category), and sometimes the quality of the cuts of meat can vary a bit. Â This being said, there's a few nice touches which stand out. Â Most notibly the kimchi pancake (best anywhere), the kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal (overkill lol), moosahm (radish wraps), 4 different meat dips and marinades, the flat stone grill, and a nice varied selection of meats (hot dog... really?).I've found the wait times and service to be really hit of miss. Â  But a long wait is to be expected for a place which only seats about 50. Â  Â My tip for better service would be to act friendly, make a little side convo with your waiter/waitress, ask for exactly what you want, and oh yeah bring a Korean so they can harrass in their native language. Â In addition, Â as with many restaurants, you'll get slightly better treatment if you're drinking soju or Hite since margins are better on drinks and its inevitably more $$$ in their pockets."
3/14/2010,5 star rating,"Haejongchon is the real deal. You'll find other competing all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ joints in the area, but Hae Jong Chon stands a bit above the rest with their choice selections of meat, delicious side dishes and their attention to service. If San-Ya is the Toyota of Korean BBQ places, then Haejongchon is the Lexus.Definitely go for the pork belly, cube steak and thin sliced beef. They're all tasty, generous and the most filling. I wasn't inclined to try any of the seafood, but they have offerings in this department as well. Side dishes include delicious marinated bean sprouts and kimchi, both of which come in gigantic bowls (not the dinky ones elsewhere).They serve kimchi fried rice (in true Korean style) at the end of the meal, and it's the ultimate topping to a delicious experience.All of this, for around $17 a person. Oh, and if you want to avoid the crowd, come on a Sunday afternoon and avoid the evenings. Lord knows how long one can resist the aromas while waiting to be seated Â on a busy night."
9/12/2017,4 star rating,"Well it's an all you can eat kbbq. We ate until we were bloated. The food was pretty decent. They do charge $5 more for lettuce though. The only negative I really have is that they don't come around to flip the meat as often. I would also have preferred if they put the meat that was finished cooking onto a plate because some did get burnt. Besides that, the place if pretty good for some kbbq if you're ever around the area."
11/4/2015,5 star rating,"I went here on a Saturday night looking to get my kbbq fix. Valet parking was only $2 which was good. For kbbq you can always expect to wait for a table. This place was no exception. However, it was only 30 minutes for us which was awesome.When we got a table, we ordered a bunch of different meats which came out pretty fast. That was pretty much the story the whole night. At a lot of kbbq places, you can expect to wait a bit between each order. Here, we were getting our orders back to back basically. It came out very fast and they even cook it for you. The quality of the meat is definitely superior to any other ayce kbbq I've been to.Overall an amazing experience. Food was great. Service was exceptional. Will be coming back here for sure."
2/8/2015,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon never fails to disappoint me. If you're lucky, you won't wait more than twenty to thirty minutes when you come down here for AYCE KBBQ. Although, the wait time can be longer than an hour, it is definitely worth the weight. My little fanboyism over this place would give this a five star rating, but I think I'll settle myself down. The banchan is pretty delicious, you're basically given everything you could ask for in a AYCE and the quality of their side dishes are top notch. As I mentioned in my previous KBBQ ratings, I tend to judge their banchan solely based off their kimchi; their kimchi is probably the best I've eaten. The selection of meats when you come here isn't cumbersome and I think it's enough for a group of friends to come down and enjoy some food together. My favorite choices of meat has to be the beef tongue, marinated short ribs and their brisket. That basically makes up the majority of the order whenever my group of friends go down to a KBBQ. I love how they include steamed egg, kimchi pancakes and friend rice into your meal, which is probably why it ends up being $21.99 per person. I would highly recommend anyone who goes here to try their beef tongue and marinated short ribs; it's delicious. Only thing that was kind of disappointing was their spicy pork, I did not enjoy it at all and it kind of throws you off as soon as you put it into your mouth. My favorite aspect of Hae Jang Chon is the quality of service. They completely dominate good service and I love the fact they are so keen on trying to keep everyone happy. The workers are kind and they are legitimately doing their best to give you the best service to go along with your meal. I can't put my finger on it, but the only thing that kind of falters my experience is when I sit down critically to think about how I really feel about the place. TL;DR - This place is great, service is awesome, food is good for it's price, definitely check it out if you're dying to try some new KBBQ restaurants."

They play loud mixes of k-pop + r&b.$16.99 for AYCE. 19 kinds, Â 4 different kinds of sauce (salt&pepper w/ oil, chili siracha, bean paste, and this raddish sweet dipping sauce) - It's a bit different from what I'm used too (soy sauce + chili sauce). For $16.99 AYCE, it includes: BBQ Beef (bulgogi), black angus beef brisket, marinated choice beef short ribs, canadian fresh pork belly (thin or thick slices), pork shoulder, beef tounge, bbq: chicken, pork, squid, beef abdomasums, beef honeycomb, hot dogs + kimchi pancakes!, cone tortillas, rice cakes+bean paste soup. & either kimchi fried rice or steam rice.The side dishes + salad is so so good. I love the fishcakes!"

Â the waiters there are attentive, but they don't smile much. Â but overall the quality of the meat was pretty good and the soju of course is great. Â the only thing is that the parking sucks (only valet or on the street) and the place is pretty small. Â I recommend going to Road to Seoul..it is the best i have ever been to.

3/18/2012,3 star rating,"OK, so apparently this is the joint where all the ~hip~ kids go.We went one cold and windy February night. Good thing we got to spend the most part of our one-hour wait seated inside the restaurant. However, each time the door opened, we were hit by a blast of cold air! Aaargh! Torture!The place has the right atmosphere for a kbbq place. It's warm and inviting, perfect for groups, love the (fake) trees inside and the little tiny lights. Our group signed in at around 9:30pm and didn't get to be seated until 10:40pm. Once we got to our table though, banchans were already waiting for us. A few moments later, one of the servers, Jacob, approached us and asked what kind of meat we wanted. I wasn't quite sure how the ordering process goes, but it helps to get the group to first decide on what meats you want to order, as they could only bring out 4 kinds at a time.Once we got cooking, I asked a server for rice, and they said they don't bring it out until the last part of the meal. WHAT IS THIS IDIOSYNCRASY?! I NEED MY RICE!!! I cannot accept the reason that ""you'll get full quickly"" if you eat the meat with rice. Well, the way it goes, they cook the kimchi fried rice right in front of you once you're all done with the meat. Yeah, they shaped it into a heart, it's cute, it's pretty yummy, but we ended up wasting most of it cos our hankering for rice was already killed a long time ago.We ended up getting two orders of their pajeon (Korean pancake) cos it is, admittedly, delicious. The beef tongue was killer, too. Although I wasn't quite sure which was what, I kinda knew that different-tasting one was the tongue. And of course the samgyeopsal (pork belly): whether it be thick or thin cut, it's the bomb.One thing that's fun at this place though is when somebody has a birthday. They play this really loud techno birthday song and the staff come out with a free dessert, dance along, and/or do shots at your table. It's especially amusing when this Â heavily-muscled male server does it.But one thing that gave us the YUCK FACTOR was how they served drinking water. They had this bin filled with water next to the beverage cooler. They would scoop water out of it with a pitcher and pour that into your plastic glass. But the worse is yet to come: We saw one server (won't name him) RINSE THE SIDE OF THE PITCHER with the water he poured into the glass INTO THE SAME BIN OF WATER THAT THEY SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS. WTF (see photo for proof: yelp.com/biz_photos/JYGPâ¦) Â Is this even a tradition of theirs, cos I refuse to believe so. That was so third-worldly, and I can't believe nobody has brought this up, unless that was the only night they decided to do that. Where is LA's sanitation department when you need them? Good thing we all got barley tea. But who knows where that came from..."
12/27/2010,4 star rating,"Best service at a Korean bbq place, hands down.Mr. Ikeda recommended me of this place.Again service is the deal-breaker or deal-maker for me. What I am used to is old Korean ladies not willing to give you refills or arguing with you on whether they made a correct order or not. HERE they were willing to do anything for us and with a good attitude.Or course we got the AYCE. The good thing about this place is that we could choose what sorts of meat to get. My favs were the beef tongue, pork belly, and the brisket. The portions were huge and the meat quality was excellent. Perfect cuts with the right amount of fat to meat ratio, marbled. The rice papers never ran out and their was a good variety of ban chan. Hot tea goes well with a meal like this. The barley tea. The decor was also pleasant to look at since it was artsy and had a sort of autumn theme. Very romantic lol.What made this place different was the stone grills they used unlike the metal grills that always needed switching. Here they cleaned it using water and radishes. Very unique. The stone grill allowed for more even cooking and faster time to heat. Also the juices from the meat do not leave by dripping down but instead stays with the meat as it cooks. O YEA DONT FORGET YOU CAN ASK FOR COMPLIMENTARY KIMCHI FRIED RICE AND SOUP. BOMBASS!!!Good food, good times."

12/24/2017,5 star rating,Best korean bbq ! I love their thin sliced pork belly and beef tongue! It is best to arrive to this place at lunch time than dinner time. The wait at dinner time is usually crazy from 2-3 hours. But it is worth the way.
6/25/2012,3 star rating,"I was so excited to come here after seeing 4 stars with over a thousand reviews on Yelp. I brought my dad and sister for their combined birthdays since it's only 4 days apart. The experience was pretty disappointing.I tried to make a reservation for Sunday at 6:30 and was told they don't accept reservations for less than 8 people. We ended up having to wait 45 minutes for a table.The restaurant doesn't has a metal grill like most places. It's this round stone with a small hole for the drippings to run off. They don't wash it but clean it with shredded radish and water in between. The stone does give some added flavor especially to the pork belly.The meat quality is average. The marinade doesn't taste much like anything. Their kalbi are in tiny uneven little cubes. Overall the meat dishes left a lot to be desired.The service was great. Our waiter was really nice. I also like that they give you kimchi pancake, steamed eggs and then kimchi fried rice at the end. I also love their fish cake and kimchi. The kimchi is nice and sour. I grilled my kimchi on the grill and it was delicious. Other side dishes are just average. I didn't care for the potato salad.Ventilation was really poor. We smelled of Korean BBQ more than with other restaurants. I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon."

9/13/2010,4 star rating,"Try saying the name of this place 4 times?!?! My friend (Vernice V.) did and I got spit flying in my eye.This past weekend, my drunk and obnoxious group of friends (along with Janice H.) and I dragged our butts to this place. We were starving and lured in by the cartoon piggy on the sign. Thank God for the AYCE b/c I don't know if it was the alcohol or the yumminess of the food, but I could not stop eating, EVEN AFTER they announced last call on the food, I kept ordering more! Â I feel kinda bad for the new waiter (who's only been there for a month. I'm not sure how I know this) that had to put up with our obnoxious antics. I really don't know what's the big deal with the kimchi fried rice that all the Yelpers are raving about on here. But, I HAD to try it and see for myself, annoying my tired friends (Janice H.) while it cooked. I give it 4 stars b/c the waiter was so nice! As for the food, it was good, but it's really all the same to me. Oh ya, the pan thingy they cook the meat on is pretty cool too. I think I need to get myself one of those things."
7/18/2011,4 star rating,"My 100th REVIEW GOES TO NONE OTHER THAN A KBBQ PLACE... my last meal before going to Europe for a month! Hae Jang Chon is in a close second to Road to Seoul. The quality of the meat isn't as high but it's still decent and the service is pretty good. It's also like $16.99, $2 cheaper than Road to Seoul... lol. I also like their ban chan, especially the potato salad, pancake and bok choi thing. I would recommend the brisket, tongue and kalbi of course... if you're feeling adventurous, get the beef honeycomb......doesn't it sound intriguing? Well........ let's just say I'm not a fan. It's basically like smelly tripe. WOOPS not to deter you or anything, feel free to go all bizarre foodie on me and try it. Was anyone else amazed at how the clean the grill? Unlike most other places that just change your grill, Hae Jang Chon just leaves it and cleans it with daikon since it absorbs all the oil and burnt pieces... ingenious! Best part of Hae Jang Chon??? Fried rice and tofu soup at the end!! Yup, they take all your left over grillings and make it into fried rice. Good way to end the meal! Ventillation is kinda bad though, but who wears nice clothes to KBBQ??? Don't you like my new Eau de Meat???"
2/23/2012,5 star rating,"Quality meat you can taste! Everything is sliced very thinly. Luckily, my group consisted of 1 expert in ordering so we let him order, while the group ate. He told us not to get the marinated items since ""older"" meats are used to disguise its freshness, or lack there of.The side dishes were generous and flavorful. My favorite was the bean sprouts, but I may be biased b/c I really like them. Make sure to have room for the kimchi fried rice at the end!Service was fantastic for our group of 8 considering we went on a Friday night and it was a full house. They came enough where it didn't get annoying. The wait to get seated definitely required patience. My suggestion would be come with people you wouldn't mind chatting it up with because that's what we did. We laughed, we cried b/c we were so hungry, and we bonded, which made our 80 minute wait tolerable.I'd definitely come back again in the future!"
3/18/2012,3 star rating,"GAHH! This place takes reservations?!One Friday a large group of friends and I came here for dinner at the prompting of one the friends. KBBQ? Sure! Awesome! KBBQ is delicious! But we did not expect it to be so freakin popular. We waited outside for 2.5 hours in the semi cold and slowly starved. Smaller groups went in and out much faster than us while we were basically ignored. When we were finally sat down at two smaller round tables pushed together, I scarfed down the food so fast I don't think I tasted anything. I'm assuming it tasted alright.Honestly though, no food is worth that wait."
9/5/2017,4 star rating,"We did not know that this was an ""all you can eat"" Korean BBQ, so a snow bowl from a neighboring store right before was not helpful. I guess, now I also understand the long lines outside the place. We were a group of five but a friend of ours was running late, so the host asked us to put our name on the list, but warned us to remain outside where he can see us or else he won't be able to keep our position in the line (huh.. confused look ). Any way our friend arrived and we were seated in ten mins. Now about the service and the food- they give you a lot of meat... A lot. And that's why you can only order three meats at a time. We shared several rounds between the five of us. Things that I liked- pork belly(thin cut), spicy bbq pork, beef , and ribs. The service was prompt and attentive. The quality of food was good. The only thing which was interesting to all of us was that the exhaust fans about the grill were turned off- wonder if it was on purpose. Coz it gets really really hot and people lose their appetite ( we surely did and we could see other tables where people were sweating their asses off). Shady . If you can handle the heat from the grill and love to eat bbq, you must try this place."

Â The Banchan dishes just excellent. Â The meat is so fresh, the steak is so tender, steam egg... with only about $20 all you can eat I can't complain, everything is just so good. Â I love the very last, they make a kimchi fried rice, you can imagine after you eat so much you basically don't want to eat anymore but the rice still taste so heavenly. Â I took my friends there too they all agree the kimchi fried rice is the very best. Â I am not sure how many times will I come back, I highly recommend this place but if you don't want the long wait you need to come in some odd hours, avoid the peak hours, but it's worth it!"
5/6/2019,5 star rating,"Great K-BBQ joint, open late, delicious food and wide variety. Seemed pretty affordable compared to other K-BBQ restaurants in the area. The bbq beef was especially delicious. All the meats were satisfactory, and service as timely and accurate."
3/24/2018,1 star rating,"My experience at this restaurant was a nightmare. First off, the parking situation is a complete mess. For whatever reason, they have a Valet service that attempts to pack more than double the capacity of cars into the parking lot of this tiny little strip-mall. So there's no easy out. The Valet charged us up front, which became a bit of an issue later on... My girlfriend and I signed in at the restaurant and were told that it would be a 40 minute wait. There's no waiting area inside the restaurant, so we sat outside smothered by a crowd of people all crammed into this little space. Our wait time ended up lasting about an hour and a half before we finally got a table. My girlfriend is vegetarian, so she only intended on ordering a little dish instead of the full BBQ meal on the menu. The waiter then pointed to a small line of text on the menu that stated that there was a 2 purchase minimum of the $20 BBQ item. Apparently any lesser purchase isn't worth their time because they're not profiting as much from it. Unwilling to make any accommodations for us, we had no choice but to leave after having waited all that time. At this point we're incredibly hungry, and now we have to wait for the Valet to dig out our car from the sea of vehicles packed into this parking lot. We drove away from the place hungry and dissatisfied. Not to mention I had just paid for Valet parking to essentially sit there for an hour without eating. When a restaurant chooses to be that stringent on their menu, it's something that should be boldly advertised on the door. How can any vegetarian even eat here without being required to order their $20 BBQ prerequisite? Absolutely ridiculous."

That's fine. But even the valet was full. The wait.... expected to wait at least 40 minutes. We waited for an hour and a half. We got there at around 8pm for a party of four. And they only except reservations for parties over 8. The food. The food was good. Their banchan tasted more traditional style. The meats although a semi limited selection were good. I had the brisket, pork bely both thin and thick, bulgogi, short rib, octopus, chicken and spicy pork. They were all pretty good. Steamed egg, kimchi pancake and the house salad were also quite tasty. The wait kills it here. Otherwise it would be a 4 star. Pretty decent and the quality is good."

6/14/2009,5 star rating,"5-Stars...and I don't even like Korean BBQ. Hae Jang probably has the widest selection of meats and side items for an all-you-can-eat BBQ place in K-town Add to that a fairly decent quality of meats, good service (esp. by K-town standards) and an extremely reasonable price at $16.99.As other reviewers already noted, you'll likely encounter at least a 20 minute wait on weekends. The restaurant isn't tiny, but the turn around is pretty slow, with everyone grilling away and stuffing their faces to the max.They start you off with a large stone grill (slightly tilted for the oil to leak out of a small hole on one side of the grill). Then comes the the piling of a heaping mound of kimchi, marinated bean sprouts, and slices of kimchi pancake on the grill. A pot of steamed egg, large bowl of green salad and 4 different types of dipping sauce (per person) is then hurriedly placed all over the table as you wait for the meats. Since I'm not a big meat eater I ordered the BBQ squid. It's a whole squid (unlike some places that have the less desirable baby octopus) that is later cut up into small pieces by one of the servers. We also tried the BBQ chicken and the marinated short-ribs. Everything was delicious with the dipping sauces. I liked that after every round of meat someone cleaned the entire grill with shredded radish - which was surprisingly effective. There was no icky re-grilling over burnt pieces and pools of oil. We ate until we were full but not stuffed so that we could still enjoy the kimchi fried rice they make on the grill. Usually nothing tastes as great when you're full, but the fried rice is really one of the highlights of the meal. I'm always a fan of freshly made kimchi fried rice, but this one was particularly good with the shredded dried seaweed mixed into whatever else was in there (the ingredients are pre-loaded into a large bowl before they bring it to the table and then mixed on the grill).At the very end they also bring a pot of spicy fermented soy soup with tofu and veggies. By then, I was too full to partake - but it looked pretty good. Parking is valet ($2)."
5/28/2012,4 star rating,"I'll admit, I don't know too much about ""real"" Korean bbq. Actually the only kind I've had has been from a truck. One of my co-workers was raving about Hae Jang Chon so we all decided to head over one night after work.We showed up around 7pm and had about an hour wait. Finally, we were given a large table in the center of the room. The place was extremely crowded and loud. There was Korean pop music playing loud and everyone was talking over the music. Also the servers and other staff members were running around frantically from table to table and shouting the orders back to the kitchen.After a long day at work we were looking forward to their all-you-can-eat menu. A couple of my co-workers had been here before so they ordered for us and we just ate what came to the table.If you're not accustomed to Korean bbq, it's as much of an experience as it is a meal. The meat comes raw and placed on a giant stove in the center of the table. Then, it's up to us to make sure it's cooked. The spices and sauces are on individual plates that can be passed around the table.Tons of meat, delicious seasonings, and several tall beers all added up to a delicious meal and a great night. The best part was that the entire meal was all-you-can-eat! Anytime our stove was getting low on meat one of the servers would bring over an entirely new plate. Amazing!I'm told Hae Jang Chon is incredibly crowded almost every night. The valet only parking lot gets full quick also. By some divine miracle I found a meter on the corner to avoid the valet headache. We had to wait about an hour because our party was so large; however, they do take reservations so be sure to call ahead to avoid super long waits!"

1/16/2012,4 star rating,"Ahhh yeeahhhh!Another great korean bbq restaurant. And like others, it's AYCE. In my opinion though, in terms of value and quality of the meat/flavor of the dishes, this place is in my top 3 or 4 korean bbq places in K-town! Here's the thing: Timing is everything. Obviously it's gonna get crazy if you show up at 6 or even 8 pm on a weekend night and you can expect an hour or longer wait to get a table even for a party of 2. I mean, it's popular for a reason, and the place isn't THAT big.There's several options to choose from, with different combinations of meats and side dishes, and even drink specials in the combos as well. Most people go for the standard $16.99/person route, with plenty of choices from beef brisket, to marinated ribs, to pork tenderloin, to bulgogi. You also get plenty of side dishes, a bowl of ""jiggae"" (spicy tofu soup), and kimchi pancake. Personally, I love the pancake and the steamed egg as sides. Everything is pretty good quality, and at the end, as most people mention, you get kimchi fried rice that's made right on the grill you made the meat on, so you suck all that juicy flavor and let's face it....grease, into your rice. But hey, it's all about the flavor!Typical korean-style service, which is basically a cluster crap shoot. It gets crazy busy as previously mentioned, so you gotta try hard to get someone's attention at times. The few times I went though, they were pretty good at least in refilling water and meats.Try going for a late lunch around 2 pm if you want to get a good first time/hassle free experience. Otherwise, prepare to face the crowds later!"
6/18/2014,1 star rating,"The HYPE here is REAL. Been here twice and this place is no better if not worse, than your 10 dollar AYCE KBBQ joint. There are so many options for KBBQ in KTown people, this place is basic with a pretentious attitude. The bulgogi here was the WORST I have ever had in my life. The meat itself fell apart like dirt on your chopsticks. With this type of grill all of the juices kind of sat there and pretty much boiled the meat, so there was no char, just a big wet slop. The flavor itself was so cheap tasting, Im not even Korean and I bet I could make better Bulgogi.The egg here was garbage. There was no flavor and there was so much water. So ironic this place has everything so wet.... except me. I'm probably the furthest from being wet here. Â The brisket was the only thing worth it here. I mean, how do you ruin brisket? Everything else was forgettable, It pretty much sucked.____________________Of course the service was below average. My party came near closing time, and I understand the workers were eager to pack up and go but its still unacceptable. They had the audacity to come back with our check and tell us that we didn't tip enough. I myself work in a restaurant environment and understand how it works. We will give you what you deserve, PERIOD. Probably the rudest thing a server could do. Please take my GIFT with gratitude, You Are Very Welcome.Other than that, This is a big Pretentious HYPE bomb in the middle of K-Town."
2/8/2018,3 star rating,"Went here for one of my birthdays with a friend. Not sure if it was an AYCE KBBQ, but they have good meat nonetheless. They use stone grill rather than your typical metal screen grill (cooks more evenly but takes a little longer to cook). It's a joint you want to take someone to a fancier KBBQ Restaurant."
1/12/2015,3 star rating,"Came here for a friend's birthday. We had a large party so we thought we were wise in showing up at 5pm. Little did we know 15+ people would also be outside waiting for their tables! I find that a little bit insane for kbbq. After a friend haggled with the host a bit we finally got seated around 6pm.Service was great. They were super attentive in taking our orders for meat, drinks, refills of banchan, etc. One guy kept doing everything on super fast mode which raised my blood pressure to watch, but he was getting it done! Meats were good but I can't say it's the best kbbq I've had. Really liked the kimchi pancake, hot dogs (no joke), bean paste soup. Everything else was decent. They clean the grill using sliced onions which I've never seen but it did the job and servers didn't have to walk with a scalding hot grill to the kitchen.All in all, husband and I agreed that we still like the meats at Oo-kook the best even though it's more expensive. Couldn't understand why so many people were waiting hours for this place but I guess to each their own! Still had a great time celebrating our friend's bday and stuffing our faces a little too much :p$2 valet - use it. You'll be here for 3-4 hours so it's worth it."

1/17/2010,4 star rating,"in our quest to find the the best ayce korean bbq restaurant, a bunch of my friends and I visited Hae Jang Chon. Â This restaurant is not as big as Manna, Tahoe, and Road to Seoul, so make sure you make reservations and don't bring more than 8-10. Â Unfortunately, we didn't make reservations for our group of 9, but were greeted by the very nice hostess and she quickly put a table together.There were a small selection of banchan -- radish, fish cake tasting thing, spinach, and potato salad. Â Later we were given the kimchee, bean sprouts, and kimchee pancake. Â All were very tasty. Â They also have the rice paper which i looooove.Now, onto the good stuff... the meat. Â I really enjoyed the non-marinated meats that we ordered -- brisket, short rib, and thin cut pork belly. Â One of the best pork bellies that i've had was here. Â The brisket and short rib pieces were not too fatty and when cooked on the stone grill tasted awesome.Lastly, the service at Hae Jang Chon is pretty good. Â It was easy to flag down a waiter/waitress and they quickly brought whatever we needed. Â It would have been nice if they refilled our water and salad without us having to call them over, but overall nothing that i can really complain about.So.. is this the best? Â I don't know. Â I didn't really enjoy the marinated rib meat as much as other AYCE, but it was cool that they cut it off the bone for you. Â I still enjoy the 'road to seoul' meat at Road to Seoul better than the brisket at Hae Jang Chon, but the pork belly cut thinly is far superiour at Hae Jang Chon than Road to Seoul.Next time we'll have to save space to try out the kimchee fried rice."
8/15/2014,1 star rating,"This place sucks. I find it funny how most non-Koreans think this is such an awesome place. This is where all the hipsters, recent graduates, or poor college students go who think this place is ""good"" and really ""authentic"" Korean food. Â I've been to real places that serve real Korean dishes with real koreans friends. First off, the meats are not quality prime. Â There are tons of places where you can get real quality meats for the same price; ie, right next door, you know the one place that serves yummy intestine and real Korean dishes. it's funny to see the uninitiated go to the place next door only to find out they walked into the wrong restaurant for serving up some fine intestine.Secondly, the service is hideous. Â They don't take reservations? Really? So you are telling me that their staff does not have the capability to do reservations? Perhaps a lesson hotel and restaurant management is what they need. Â Additionally, the waiters/servers, for some odd reason, always cater first to Koreans (maybe i'm looking to far into it, but that's the sense I get). Â Then the waiters/servers are always hurrying me to place an order, place an order, place an order? Â Hey waiters, here's a clue, I DON""T HAVE TO TIP YOU (and there are times when i DIDN""T tip you!)lastly, your prices are just too much for your ""quality"" meats."
3/17/2018,1 star rating,"This is probably the worst KBBQ place to come at night to. We waited about 25 min. They said they were closing at 2am but we had to stop ordering at 130am. The waiter took a very long time and we were only able to get 2 rounds of meat. Then they charged us before we even finished eating because they had to close the register. They can only split the payment between two cards. Waiter also forgot my water. When he was moving the meat around, he burned my hand and did not apologize. WORST PLACE EVER."
4/3/2015,4 star rating,"Man. This is the kbbq spot to go to! I've been adventurous with trying out plenty of kbbq spots and hands down this tops them all. We came before rush hour and waited maybe 10 minutes top. I couldn't find anything I didn't like about this place. I really liked that they use a stone plate to grill instead your normal burner grill(whatever it's called). Our server Steve was the man! If you get him you're left in good hands. Friendly service and very informative with any questions we had. The marinated meats tasted great. Â I would say the only downside of this location would be parking. Â The plaza has a valet parking system which if you don't wanna pay, you have to find parking elsewhere. This is a place I would recommend and will likely be coming back."

So yesterday, at 11am for lunch, I finally tried this place and boy, it did not disappoint!! The quality of the meat is perfect. We tried the brisket, bulgogi, pork belly and short rib and we all had a happy tummy. The service was a little slow, maybe because it was still early. Then, we were served by ""Go"" and he is amazing! He was fast and very attentive to our needs. You may want to order the kimchi pancakes too!!! We loved it. The price for $23.99 is affordable considering the quality of meat that they serve. This place is now on my favorite Korean BBQ places in LA!"

My boyfriend and I came here for our first meal of the day and ended up tapping out after only like 4 orders and a side of rice each. We got 2 orders of the thin sliced pork belly, 1 thick sliced pork belly and 1 marinated beef short rib. The thin sliced pork belly was definitely our favorite. The fat to meat ratio was perf! Not too fatty at all, tasty and not to chewy like others we've tried. We really appreciated the quality of all the meats in general. I heard so many good things about their beef tongue but we were so hesitant to try it for the first time and didn't want to waste the entire order, so we kindly asked our server if we could literally just have 1 piece each, lol. He was super cool about it even though he probably never had a customer request that. It was thinly sliced and reminded us of the pork belly. Once you get past the fact that it's beef tongue, it doesn't taste bad at all, lol. The service was pretty good, except for the fact that we had to ask for water refills but whatevs. We're definitely coming back here. You really can't beat this AYCE spot for the price! Highly recommended!"

Â For $16.99 a person for AYCE, this place is pretty kick ass!1. The meat is cooked on a stone grill. Â Confused? You got to experience to know what I am talking about.2. Great choices of non and marinated meats.3. They give you 4 dipping sauces.4. The salad and the ban chan are tasty.5. Service is prompt. Â Don't be scared of ringing the bell. Â It is okay. It is loud but it is only way to get their attention.6. I love how they clean the stone grills in between meats with shredded radishes. Â Don't worry, they don't feed you the radishes they clean your grill with.7. Don't forget to request for the kimchi fried rice. 8. Perfect for smaller group dinners such as 6-8 friends. If it is beyond that, it would be better if you went to places such as Tahoe or Manna."
8/24/2015,4 star rating,"Geez. This place is great. The service was great. And holy cow, there was so muuuuch food.We ordered shrimp, honeycomb intestines, tongue, pork shoulder, brisket and marinated short rib. The last two were easily my favorite. The intestine and tongue were ordered because WHY NOT!? The tongue was pretty good but I could've skipped the intestines and still died happy. Only my family ate the shrimp due to my shellfish allergy, but I should note that the staff was very aware of how they served and cooked the shrimp to accommodate my allergy.Four stars only because the meat - other than the short rib - could have used a bit of seasoning and I wasn't really a fan of how they cleaned the grill mid meal. It wasn't really pleasant to see and they got some grill water on my clothes, but mainly that's just me being a brat.Great place to try!"
10/21/2016,5 star rating,"$24 AYCE dinner included rice, egg, miso soup, etc if requested. Arrived for a late night dinner and still had to wait about 20 minutes; which sounds like was shorter compared to what many others have waited. 3 meats can be ordered at a time. The brisket was good, but I liked the bulgogi and kalbi far more. 5 unpeeled shrimps were provided. I would have preferred the shrimp to have already been peeled. Even though the restaurant was packed the server came by frequently to turn the meat, add more meat to the grill, and ask if we wanted to order more meat. I was impressed by how quickly the staff moved to get things on the table and were equally fast to clear tables."
5/3/2012,4 star rating,"It seems like every time I get KBBQ in L.A., I experience a place that's better than the last one, and my expectations automatically go up even higher. Hae Jong is a perfect example of that.My first time here was on a Saturday night around 9 p.m. I had to park 4 blocks away and the wait for a group of 4 was more than an hour. Needless to say, we decided to go to a different place nearby. This time around, I came on a Friday at 7 p.m. and waited no more than 10 min. Therefore, COME EARLY! I suggest you save yourself the hassle of finding parking on the street and just go with valet for only $2.Pros:- The #1 thing that made a difference here is the stone cooking slab. Instead of the typical metal grill that meat easily sticks to and gets burnt on, they use a stone slab here. This results in a less charred and more natural taste of the meat. The slab is tilted so that the grease goes into a container and not into your arteries. - They have a perfect banchan (side dishes) selection. I've rarely seen fish cake as a side dish at KKBQ places lately, and I was bursting with joy when I found out they have it here. - High quality, good tasting and well marinated meat. When you request meat and they bring you huge plates and you can smell the marinade before even cooking it, you know it's good. The selection is great too, with some unique items like Beef abomasum.- A few extra dishes on the side that I haven't seen anywhere else. The kimchi pancake, rice cake, and steam egg are all fairly customary and were a great addition to our meal. However, they serve bean paste soup and kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal, so make some room for it! Both dishes clean your pallet really well after gobbling down all that meat. - The service is some of the best I've seen, especially considering how large and packed the place is. When we asked for more rice paper, they quickly brought out huge slabs of it so we wouldn't have to keep asking. Saves both of us some hassle. Waiters were all attentive and we never once had to ring the button.Cons:- It's fairly packed here, so if you come with a large group, you may have to end up squishing together. Due to how much room the stone slab takes, there's limited table room to store everything, which may require you to pull up another chair just to put the meat plates on. - The long wait can be a pain in the ass, but can be easily avoided if you come early enough.Overall, I would definitely come back again. There's nothing like indulging yourself with high quality meat and downing it with plenty of bottles of Hite and Charmsoon."

4/15/2009,4 star rating,"Umm AYCE Korean BBQ, the stuff of a man's deep dreams and everyone's guilty pleasure! Â The tables were round and when we sat down, they brought out this big round stone platter Â that was burning hot and set it on the grill. Â We noticed it was tilted for some reason so we stupidly tried to push it straight. Â Then the waiter came and set a drip pan under the hole on the side of the platter. Â We were like ""Ooohhhhhhh"" Â and foolishly grinned and rolled our eyes at each other. Â Then it was your typical Korean BBQ fare, rice paper, salad, all the sides and dipping sauces. Â I only use the sesame oil/salt dip. Â They threw the kimchi on the grill at first. Â I like my kimchi cold thank you.We had the brisket, which was way more flavorful than other places. Â The short ribs were pretty good also. Â We ordered the pork belly thinking they were thin slices but they brought out 4 GIGANTIC slabs of fatty belly! Â Boy, was it fatty! Cooking it caused this slob of fat to drip down into the drip pan. Â I guess that's what the scissors were for. Â All in all, the meat here is above average compared to other AYCE places. Â Although I won't be ordering the pork belly again. Â We came here on a Thursday night, so we didn't have any trouble with parking or crowds."
9/2/2011,4 star rating,"Really good All you can eat for $18.99Came here for a birthday and the food was great. You get the small plates in the beginning like all Korean places and they are refillable - Yummy. Â The food is very good. I don't eat beef, so we got lots of pork and chicken for myself. So good. I love the dipping sauces. It's a standard Korean BBQ but a good price.It gets BUSY. Parking is hard to find. The lot is always full at night esp on weekends. I like this place. You WILL smell like BBQ after you leave tho."
2/17/2015,4 star rating,"I made the serious mistake of going to Hae Jang Chon hungry.No, no...hear me out. If you want to experience Hae Jang Chon to it's fullest, you have to prepare...like a competitive eater. In the morning, you have to prepare your stomach by eating a BIG meal.Then...you head over to Hae Jang Chon. RIght around 2:30-3:30pm. And you'll slip right in (Our wait? 5 mins, tops). Because right around 4:30-5:00pm, the wait is 1 hour. And trust me, the hungrier you are, the less you'll enjoy.The thing is, you have to have stretched out your stomach for the fine marinated short rib, the brisket and the Bul-Go-gi. And you'll want a lot of it. And soju. Because what self-respecting Korean BBQ AYCE patron doesn't imbibe soju?If you get out doing about 4 rounds, then your money is worth it. And by all means, eat everything. They will charge you $15 if you leave meat on the awesome stone grill that they clean off during your dining experience so it doesn't burn.But that shouldn't be a problem, right? You're no amateur AYCE goer to be going to Hae Jang Chon...right? ; )"
3/9/2018,4 star rating,Thia place was so cute. The place was busy and I can see why. The food was great and services was amazing. I love a good Korean bbq and ive found it here!! Whenever I'm in town ill go here to get my fix. The walk to get there isn't bad either since I love to sightsee. :)
2/11/2017,4 star rating,"The meat, poultry and seafood offered here is certainly beyond the typical all you can eat quality. The service is hit or miss, especially from the girls at the front who are usually rude. The food and company is what you come here for though. Korean BBQ is always a fun group experience no matter how many times you've done it. Parking is a nightmare and is either valet or circling around the block for a spot and praying your car isn't hit by some other jerk. If you're able to handle a potentially long wait for a table, you won't be disappointed."

3/27/2015,5 star rating,So far this is my favorite AYCE kbbq. I usually go to places that are understaffed and definitely not as clean. Â I love the stone grill and the kimchi fried rice at the end. The quality of their meat is better than most other places. I will have to try out Ok Kook and see which one is better. The one thing this place sucks in is the parking.
3/12/2019,5 star rating,"Tuesday night, seemingly picked this spot for my friends out of state that has had never had any experience with Korean BBQ. I did not eat. But all my friends were ecstatic by the food and the above and beyond service by our wonderful server Gon. I know the manager or owner is reading this so, give the man a break and maybe a raise! Thank you Gon for the extraordinary cooking service. Will return. With more people. Everyone ask for Gon. Great person."
3/4/2012,5 star rating,"Korean bbq is something special to me. I've loved it since I first went to Manna's in '07. My life literally changed after I tried it. Since then, I've been trying to find the best, affordable kbbq spot that I can enjoy regularly. I've been to Road to Seoul, Odaesan, Sanya's, Castle, Chosun Galbi, Soot Bull Jeep, Gui Rim, Genwa, Yi Sii Hwa Ro, Ma Dang Sae. From the cheap joints to the high end restaurants, but this place blows every other restaurant out of the water.The meat here is always consistent and great! The sauces compliment the meat. The kimchi here is always fresh and fizzy. The stone grill is perfect for grilling the meats. The banchan here is some of the best I've ever had. To top the cherry off, they make kimchi fried rice at the end!! That's the perfect dessert for me since I'm not partial to sweets. Oh and they serve lemon juice with soju. That is just awesome since I despise the taste of alcohol. How I enjoy the kbbq is I take the rice paper aka duk bo sam, put some salad, put the meat dipped in the soy vinegar sauce,top it with kimchi, marinated radishes, and lastly a little dap of the fermented paste! Take a look at the picture I uploaded. It takes time to build them one by one, but the taste altogether is the best thing I've put in my mouth! I can't believe someone actually told me to give up KBBQ for lent. That is ludicrous. Missing out on Hae Jang Chon for forty days would be a sin."

My boyfriend and I just came and waited for over an hour, our name finally got called and we got seated and in the middle of ordering the waitress said it was another client with the same name and took our table and escorted us out. How hard is it to be a waitress it's not rocket science, you're not curing cancer. If you see your list and you see a client with the same name you ask for an initial of their last name. This place should hire people with brains to avoid embarrassing misunderstandings like this. Going to Gen in Alhambra where amazing customer service and food is guaranteed"

8/19/2010,5 star rating,"If people ask me where to go for AYCE KBBQ, I would point them here.So why this place? Â First, I love the selection here. Â All the different cuts of beef, chicken, pork, and seafood makes it possible for people to find something they like. Â I love the beef brisket here and they'll even bring you a whole platter full of brisket if you want. Â Some places are too stingy but they know what's up!I also love the banchan here and the salad. Â They put kimchi and beansprouts onto the round stone grill pans that they have and if you never tried grilled kimchi, it adds a whole dimension to it. Â We also ask for refills. Â Salad's one of the best I've tried around and kimchi pancake is just plain addicting.They end your meal with this awesome kimchi fried rice done right in front of you with their stone grill. Â It's just nice to have something different!As for the stone grill, it's actually really cool since it is tilted to one side so all the fat flows and drains out. Â It's not charcoal so none of that smokiness but it creates this sear different from other places.Service is typical, but half the guys in there seriously looks like they are pissed off all the time. Â I've been lucky for the past few times and have gotten the same guy that helps grill and cleans the stone grill and he's pretty friendly.Don't be scared off by the crowds waiting outside. Â If you don't want to wait 1-2 hours, then go early! Â It really is worth it. Â It's also open really late so it is the perfect place for a late night AYCE KBBQ fix haha."
9/6/2010,4 star rating,"$17 AYCE with 19 choices of meat, and a number of sides. The meats we tried were all pretty good, and the dipping sauces were great! They have delicious steamed egg and veggie side dishes, and some other not-so-yummy sides (bleh kimchi pancake & bean paste stew), but you're bound to like/dislike some. Kimchi fried rice at the end was great, especially when you let it crisp up at the bottom, but it didn't have enough kimchi in it for me. They serve iced tea instead of water!Service was the highlight of the meal, for sure. The waiters helped us cook our meat, taught us how to wrap our meat, etc. because we were a little incompetent, and were always stopping by to check on us even though it was super busy. SO nice!The hot stone grill was really cool and let the oil drip without smoking the place up (and they clean it for you between courses)! The heat was unevenly distributed though so you have to try it out and find the hot spots.I called that morning to make a reservation and was seated minutes after arriving, pissing people off who'd been waiting :P so be sure to make a reservation!"
9/12/2010,5 star rating,"BEST KOREAN BBQ PLACE EVER!I wish I had a bigger stomach because they have 15 types of meat + kimchi pancakes + bomb side dishes AND kimchi fried rice at the end. All this for only $17?! WHAT!The service is awesome. Most Korean places treat non-Koreans differently than Koreans but not here. Everything was set up before you sit down, they clean the grill every time before you cook new meat, and they come back often asking if you need anything. The wait can be a bit long but it's open until 2am! They don't take reservations over the weekend so it's probably a good idea to go later, after the dinner rush. We went around 10pm and were told we had to wait more than an hour but it ended up being only about 20 minutes. Only cons are that the parking sucks and the music inside is LOUD, so loud that you can barely hear yourself think. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place!"
10/5/2017,5 star rating,"Everything is perfectly seasoned! If you are looking for a decently priced all you can eat Korean buffet this is definitely the place. However, you do not sacrifice quality for the lower price. Everything is well seasoned and marinated. Great for groups of friends. Lunch is definitely abetted deal than dinner and it is less crowded. Come early and look for parking in the neighborhood which is very difficult in Koreatown, but it's worth it to save money to buy a beer or two."
3/4/2018,5 star rating,This place is lit!!! I would definitely recommend this place. We got LA galbi which was NOT in the menu but it was secret menu behind the kitchen. The meat was soft and chewy. The strong grill gives the most sear and add favour to the meats.

When u get there u will see a parking lot full of cars and a valet moving the people along. A line of people waiting for a table and a restaurant full of groups enjoying the great ambiance. It's an all you can style with plenty of choices. We had the Bbq pork, the pork belly and some brisket. All were amazing! The sides they serve were all Just as good. Will definitely be back !"

Â Love the services and the kimchi fried rice! Â It is best to make reservation unless you would like to wait inline for 2 + hours. Â You will loose your reservation if you are not on time and all parties must be there to be seated. Â Valets parking is $2.

So me and my friends went to the Lakers game and NO that's not my team but if I'm getting court side tickets then why not.. LOL..

PROS: Customer Service (they come to your table and actually turn your meat over and cut your meat up for you) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Price-$19.99 for Lunch and $21.99 for Dinner (that's cheaper then most places here in Vegas) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Quality- They have quality cuts of meats (their brisket is delish!)CONS: For me it was ordering the kimchi fried rice and not knowing it comes when you're done ordering your meats.

1/24/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing quality and wide selection of meats for AYCE KBBQ. The beef tongue texture was perfect along with the pork belly and every other type of beef offered (short ribs, angus, etc.) They also offer some seafood items (shrimp, squid) and mushrooms. Everything was really good and this was my first time trying Korean BBQ; I'm glad to say there are no regrets! The staff was also super friendly and helpful; they always checked on the table and helped cook the food (maybe because they didn't want the amateurs, like me, burning their grill.) The restaurant itself was small-mid sized. We came in at 2pm and we waited for 5 minutes; but after we sat down, there was a long line waiting to be seated so we got lucky. I was with a party of 4 and our bill totaled $115 after tips & tax - not bad for amazing AYCE KBBQ. Definitely will be returning the next time I visit LA. P.S. if you cannot find street parking, there is valet parking within the little lot for $3 (gives you time to check out Cottonhi next door.)"
1/23/2016,3 star rating,This place has some really good Korean barbecue it is not at the top of the chain but it's pretty alright. The prices are average and the service is not that good like most other Korean barbecue places.

Parking can be tough, but there is $2 valet! The servers were accommodating and often came to our table to turn the meat. I'm pretty sure it was because we would get caught up conversing, all the while the meat was burning on the grill, lol.I would definitely come back!"
1/21/2016,4 star rating,"This place is very good. Â Sauces are delicious, ideal stone grills, decent quality meats. Â We got the thin sliced pork belly, bulgogi, and marinated short ribs (galbi). Â I could have done without the pork belly, it was like eating a whole plate of bacon...quite heavy and greasy, not a pro move when you're playing the ayce game in my opinion. Â The rest was delicious.Use the thin rice wraps they give you to make little sandwiches. Drizzle some sweet and sour, chili sauce, some meat of your choosing and a piece of lettuce on it"
1/20/2016,4 star rating,"I had a decent sized party of 8-9 people and the wait was fairly long. I think I waited for about an hour and a half to two hours to get seated at two separate tables which were at least close together. Wasn't sure how popular this place was when I first decided to come early for my party and wait for them, but it certainly makes you hungry enough to take advantage of the all-you-can-eat BBQ.Anyway, the important thing was that the food was awesome and was cooked on a cast iron grill which is actually the first time I've ever seen that in a KBBQ place, which I thought was pretty cool. As far as I know cast iron, helps cook foods a little more evenly because it retains heat longer but doesn't get as hot as certain metals, don't quote me on that but the way they clean it is pretty neat too. They pretty much throw a cut radish on it and it releases the char Â  off the grill and absorbs it. Maybe I'm just easily impressed but I thought it was cool.The food itself was quite good, marinated well and didn't look like they were in the refrigerator all day. The waiters helped whenever they had time to cook the meats and were very attentive to us. The kim chi fried rice in the end was the bomb diggity as well. All in all, this was one of the better KBBQ places I've been to in LA. Not sure about waiting that long again, so I'll probably try to stick to a party of less than 6 since most of the tables looked like it held at least that many."

We tried calling in around 4PM to make a reservation for later in the night but they told us they weren't accepting reservations at the moment. So i'm guessing after a certain time of the day, reservations aren't accepted. Our wait was about 1hr and 45mins..aside from that, their customer service was amazing! They made sure to take care of you and your table. Keeping themselves busy and providing great service, they allowed customers to eat comfortably by going back and forth to different tables to help cook the meat and provide other needs without customers using the ""call button"". +1 for serving kimchi fried rice at a all you can eat kbbq restaurant!!

Â Yelp, can you get on that? Â She sat one female guest in her mid-20s near us. Â The guest told the hostess that the rest of the party was outside and if she could go get them.

1/20/2016,5 star rating,"Yes yes yes! All type of yes! The best Korean bbq I've been to in my life! The wait was long as ever but it was so good that I couldn't complain about it. There's a reason for this ridiculously long line is because it's just that good. If I would want in this line again, I would because it's just that worth it. First dinner of the night for my stay in LA and this was the best one yet. You get to choose any 22 items on the menu and there's a lot of variety for the all you can eat portion. The pricing is pretty far too because compared to Chicago, it's a lot more for not a lot of options so I'm glad we came here for our first night. But this is THE BEST AYCE I've ever been to in my life!"
1/19/2016,5 star rating,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! The stone grill definitely brought out the flavor in the meat and their service here is wonderful. We didnt have to ring the bell during our stay because their servers were constantly around us asking us if we needed any more meat or needed anything else for the table. The only bad thing about this place, if you can call it that, is the amount of people that come during dinner time. We arrived here just before the dinner rush and before we left, we heard someone say that their wait time was about 2 hours. That really says alot about this place. People wont be waiting 2 hours if the food is not worth it. What really brought me out here on yelp is to give a special mention to one of our servers, Steve! He suggested different types of meat that we should try and we did! We also liked it! He was on top it! If we needed water refills or anything else, he was there asking and providing."

1/18/2016,5 star rating,"This is the go to for KBBQ in K-Town! AYCE for $25 with plenty of options. It's always a crowd whenever I go, if you want to go during non-peak hours it's probably best to go around 2-5 otherwise there will most likely be a line upon arrival.I've been here numerous times and always bring out of town friends here and everyone loves it! All the sides are delicious and the meats are tender and juicy.Love getting the bulgogi, pork belly, kimchi pancake, marinated short rib, the least goes on but those are definitely the must haves every time there.They cook and cut the meat for you so everything is done relatively quick and are pretty attentive for the most part. When it gets hectic it's a little more difficult to flag someone down if you need something.

My husband and I always come here when guests or clients are in town and everyone who has experienced their food leave super happy. We always get the ayce. The BBQ is always tender and deliciously marinated (not too sweet and not too salty, really well balanced) and they have seafood on the menu!

3/12/2012,3 star rating,"Came here last night for dinner with the family. Valet Parking was $2. We thought we could beat the dinner rush by getting there at 5:30. WRONG! still a wait but not more than 20 minutes which helped us build up an appetite. We started with brisket, bulgogi and short ribs. The brisket was not marinated but cooks up really quickly and tastes great when you dip it in the vinegar soy sauce, wrap it with the rice paper and some salad. Yum! I love making these little wraps! You can get creative and throw the sides in there. Do what works for you. The short rib was just ok, it's thicker takes longer to cook and chew so my small salad wrap doesn't work out that well with that cut of meat. Â I recommend dipping it in the sauce that has salt and oil. The bulgogi was marinated nicely and cooked easily. We also got the spicy pork which we couldn't tell if it was cooked or not since it was red but the waiter came over a few times and told us it was ready.The pork shoulder came in small pieces and didn't have much flavor but I liked it better than the pork belly just because I don't want a thick layer of fat on my meat. I know, everyone loves the fat but I'm not a huge fan... it's fat! We also got a small order of the chicken which I actually liked! Normally I never bother with chicken, bring on the red meat! But my sister wanted an order so she specified enough for 1 person since we had a table of 4 and there was no way we were going to finish a standard order. The waiter happily obliged. The pancake was ok, I thought it was a little too oily and the egg that comes in the pot was just alright also. Usually I love the egg in the pot, I will gobble the whole thing down but it felt like something was lacking. We didn't get too crazy and order squid or tongue or any of the other meats we were stuffed. Service was quick and on point and I like that they come and clean your grill halfway through the meal not to mention the grill has a hole it it so the fat and excess juices can drip off. Meats were just standard. Â For some reason I thought Road to Seoul was better I can't specify why because it's been a while and I didn't write a review. I guess this gives me an excuse to go back and get more."
4/30/2012,4 star rating,"Came here around 3:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and saw how it immediately got crowded around 4:30pm. The banchan were good, although I've had better-tasting ones at other places. The customer service here is definitely better than other AYCE KBBQ areas nearby. For one, they will bring you more banchan, without glaring at you, when requested. Sanya will actually tell you that only their meats are AYCE, not the banchan.Secondly, they check up on you quite often. At other places you had to ring that little buzzer near your table. I only had to ring it once during my visit here but only because things got really busy when people started flooding in.The restaurant was fairly clean and there is only one toilet for women and one for men. Moreover, I saw how difficult it would be to have large groups at this restaurant. It's not that big and should be avoided by large parties altogether. There are larger restaurants out there that accommodate and have equally high-quality food (ahem-Road to Seoul). I really do like the stone grill because the meat didn't burn as fast. In addition, I totally applaud Hae Jang Chon for using radishes to clean the grill. It was effective and I was impressed! This takes away that charred, burnt flavor that usually taints the flavor of my meats! Hae Jang Chon also had a plasma TV with the NBA playoffs on. Props to them for that!As for the food, I ordered the bulgogi, marinated short ribs, pork shoulder, beef brisket, and hot dogs. (I ordered hot dogs out of curiosity as to how it would taste with the salad, rice paper, sauces and Korean fixings. It was not worth getting.) My favorite was the marinated short ribs because of its sweet flavor and tender texture! By the time I have consumed all of these orders, I was already full and ready to throw in the towel. I tried to toughen up in order to try that fried kimchi fried rice at the end that everyone's raving about. But alas, I have failed but that only gives me more reason to come back!"

2/1/2017,4 star rating,"My new favorite AYCE KBBQ!! Customer service was spot on, meat was great, too! Only thing is that you gotta pay for parking even if not valet'ing...which is only $2, but still. My daughter lived the dream egg and the rice paper. I totally digged the kimchi pancakes and kimchi fried rice. I really like kimchi anything!"

If I ever come back either make a reservation for 8 or come for lunch or a dinner on like a MTWR or something cuz I went on a friday. Horrible wait. I have to admit their service is good though. The food came out fast, which is expected for such a packed restaurant! And I was pretty annoyed and bitchy to the hostess but she kept a smile on her face. Go her!"

10/12/2009,4 star rating,"So I ate here last Friday for my best friend's 25th birthday and I'm happy to say that this place was one of the better AYCE KBBQ places I've been to. I may not be an expert on the genre, but the briscket and bugogi were jucy and delicious. The sides that came with the meal were also top notch. It was the first time a restaurant cooked/heated the kimchi and bean sprouts on the stone grill which made the dish more delish! The service wasn't bad like I would expect at most Korean places but I think that had something to do with the surplus if Korean speakers in our large party.The place itself isn't small or large by any means, but the table configuration is spacious enough to fit a decent amount of people in there. I expect you'll have to wait a little while though during the busier dining hours. The price is fair for the quantity and quality if food you receive too. The only inconvenience is the parking situation. Like most places in Ktown, you'll either have to pay for valet parking or fight for a spot in the crowded residential area and trek to the place (like we did).Now if only my best friend's other friends weren't so fobby.. Haha jkRecommendations: AYCE FTW!Warnings: parking in Ktown has and always will blow.. Oh well"
2/8/2011,5 star rating,"As soon as I found out that we were planning to eat out at Hae Jang Chon in Koreatown, I thought of a strategy by leaving an 1 hour 1/2 early and looking at Google maps where to park because it's gets really crowded in that area... Seriously.. It was my first time in Hae Jang Chon and I didn't want to take the risk of looking for parking for hours.. Our friend lives close by and headed there early.. Our reservation was for 730p.. I was taking my time driving there, we got there 30 minutes before our reservation time and I guessed wrong because the traffic was such a pain, no more valet parking because the lot was full, and I had to park 2 blocks away... After walking to the restaurant, we got there in time and it was packed.. We had to wait more because there was nobody leaving their seats yet... Okay forget about my parking frustrations, LOL.. On to the food review part... We finally got our seats for a group of 9 and had to combine another small table together.. The first thing I saw was that stone plate that was used for grilling bbq.. It was a huge, flat, stoned plate like cooking Teppanyaki.. We ordered bulgogi, calbi, beef tongue, beef brisket, pork belly, kimchi fried rice and some sides.. The meat sizzled once it was placed in the hot stoned plate.. The service was excellent here considering I've been around Korean bbq restaurants and they are mostly average in customer service... We got some rice paper, bean spouts, kimchi, green veggies, and the other essentials.. Â The first thing I consumed was the Soju (like Sake but better chilled)... Oh ya, that hit the spot with a little bit of Soju and I was having a feeding frenzy.. The bulgogi took me only two chomps and swallowed it easily.. I can feel my drool with the beef juices dripping out of my mouth and I didn't care if the juices where blocking my view on my glasses ***hahaha***.. OOOOOOO SO YUMMMY.. Â My friends kept on ordering more meat because I ate most of it... I can't help it if it's that good... One of my female friends didn't care much about the Korean bbq.. I mean she says it was really good... She was checking out the waiter that served us.. ""He is so hot"" she says.. It was so funny because she would just freeze whenever he comes by our table.. **HAHAHAHA***With their stomachs full and waiting for me because I still kept on eating, the food was excellent.. I recommend coming there at lunch time or reserve for a 6p early dinner... Other than the sucky parking, we're coming back here again (at an earlier time)"
11/25/2011,5 star rating,"Per a local friend's recommendation, my friends and I went to Hae Jae Chon for dinner on a Friday evening. This was my first time at an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) style Korean barbecue restaurant. Do not get me wrong, I have had plenty of Korean barbecue before, just not AYCE style. We waited about 1.5 hours for a table. Luckily we had anticipated a long wait and we timed it so that we weren't completely ravenous by the time our table was ready.Hae Jang Chon was not structured like the typical AYCE style restaurants with bars of unlimited food. Each table (yelp.com/biz_photos/JYGPâ¦) is given a menu and is allowed to order as much food as it would like for only $17/person--and boy did we order! I think we ordered almost every meat on the menu: Canadian fresh pork belly (both thick and thin), short ribs, pork, chicken, black angus beef brisket and squid. There was a good variety of different meats for grilling and my favorites were the thick pork belly slices, short ribs (boneless), pork shoulder, and the squid. Everything was incredibly fresh and of good quality, especially the meats and sides. I really loved the dipping sauces too. The lightly drizzled salad was great, because it helped refresh our palates from all of the smoky barbecue.Servers were a little slow with attending to us, but I guess it helped us pace ourselves. I think our tab averaged to about $25/person, which included three or four rounds of beer. We all left smelling like we smothered ourselves in butter and pork belly fat, but it was so worth it.P.S.There is no way of finding parking in this tiny plaza, so just let the valet do the job for you. It's only a few bucks and you'll save yourself some time!"
9/24/2017,5 star rating,We were going to Quarter but they were closed and then stumbled upon this gem... this is an ayce kbbq... the price is good for everything you can get and the selection as well as good quality and taste... I really wish they offered haemul pajeon instead of the kimchi pajeon but meh... anyways... TOP service from our server and everything was very delicious... will definitely recommend and stop by again when in ktown... we only got to try 4 different meats and they were all top notch... definitely keep the spicy meats to the end or you'll fill up faster... they have the gas type of grill... I prefer the charcoal type but that's a personal preference... anyways... good job... ktown never gives me dissapointment
11/20/2017,5 star rating,All I have to say about this place is simply amazing. This is my go to Korean BBQ all you can eat and I haven't left hungry or upset. Lol real cool staff that makes sure your meats keeps coming and the side stay full.
10/19/2016,4 star rating,"One of my favorite AYCE kbbq places, but I find my palette is shifting away from AYCE. Â That or the sauces and meat quality has changed within the last five years.."
11/23/2013,5 star rating,"Living in Los Angeles there are many Korean BBQ places to choose from. Â However, whenever family or friends come to town I definitely recommend Hae Jang Chon Korean BBQ! Â Something about the atmosphere, the quality of meat and the side dishes they offer makes them stand out. Â I really liked the sauces they provide and have yet to find another Korean BBQ place that offers a similar set up. Â They have a wide variety of meat, but my favorite is by far the marinated short ribs and the bulgogi! Â It is all you can eat for $18.99, but I recommend getting there early as there will most likely some wait. Â I have gone with small and large parties, and the staff do their best to seat everyone quickly. Â Table service is also very good and constantly checks up on you to make sure you're doing well!"

10/13/2014,4 star rating,"I went here in a party of 8 for a friend's birthday. It took about 30-40 mins for a table on a Saturday night but I consider us lucky since it's usually super busy. We squeezed into a small table and ordered brisket, bulgogi, marinated short ribs, thin pork belly, some steamed eggs, and pancakes. We kind of alternated between those choices since they are our favorites. The ladies there are really nice and helpful. An added plus was that they allowed us to get more steamed eggs! Yay!! Make sure to save room for the Kimchee fried rice at the end (if you decide to get it which I highly recommend). It is cooked from the oils and burnt bits from your meat and has a hint of spiciness and tang from the Kimchee. The nori strips also complements the rice really well! Super flavorful and delicious. Let's just say I was super stuffed after this meal. The only complaint I had was that this place doesn't really accommodate larger parties so try to go in smaller groups!!"
5/6/2015,4 star rating,"Twice in one week and I noticed a difference in quality in somethings. Some stuff improved, others became worse. The wait is hell, but worth it. However, i like cooking for myself and the waitresses are very involved. Large selection and I would highly recommend when you can make a reservation (6+ people). Otherwise the wait is hell."
6/2/2014,4 star rating,"All the reviews don't lie, this is one of the best all you can eat kbbq places you could go to.They only take reservations for groups of 8 or more, so don't bother if you're a small party. We came here on a Saturday around 1pm and there was no wait and the place was half full. Their service is touch and go, sometimes it's really friendly and attentive, and other times they're rude and you have to literally call them down to order your next plate. It depends on which server you get really.I really love the marinated kalbi, it's so delicious! I love their banchan too, it's all really good. You can't really go wrong with any of their meats. It's about $20/person for all you can eat. Look for street parking if you can, but they have valet for $2."
4/26/2014,3 star rating,"OK, disclaimer: vegetarian speaking here, so I can't comment on the BBQ. I can, however, comment on the service. You remember the ""Soup Nazi"" episode of Seinfeld? Well, these people are the Korean BBQ Nazis for real. They have some strange, nonsensical rules that still leave me scratching my head.I went a few months ago for a friend's birthday and ordered the veggie bi bim bop, which is delicious. My boyfriend came, and although he's not a vegetarian, he didn't feel like eating meat that evening so ordered the veggie bowl as well. The waitress gave him the side eye and asked if he was a vegetarian. We weren't clear why that mattered, then she said you can only get the veggie bowl if you were a vegetarian, because the patio was for the BBQ only. WHAT??? No veggie bowl for you! Even though the five other members of the party WERE having the BBQ. Sheesh.OK. So I went again with three friends during the week. Our other friend was supposed to meet us but he got held up and was going to be like 30 minutes late. The host told us all the members of our party had to be there in order to get seated. Well, we were starving and said we'd just sit down without him. Again, the side eye. They said ""If he comes he will have to put his name on the waiting list and then sit by himself."" Then they sat the four of us at a table for six. WHAT??? No seat for you! Even though it would actually cost them more money to seat him alone, as there are no tables for one. I mean there were two extra seats at our table, so why couldn't he just sit there?These people don't mess around, and they also seem to have a weird concept of logic. Oh, one other tip: don't bother going there with freshly washed hair or your best dry-clean-only outfit, because by the time you leave they will reek so hard of charred meat and no amount of Febreeze will be able to help you."

4/9/2014,5 star rating,"There's actually a certain strategy to eating at these kinds of places or else you run the danger of not only not enjoying it as much, but not at all.Follow these steps exactly:1. Do not eat after 12PM. 2. Get blasted. Preferably at a friend's place nearby because the whole valet parking thing here makes it a bit tricky. 3. Wear comfortable and smell-resistant clothing. You'll want mobility when the flames start getting in your face and your gut starts expanding.*RULES 1-3 ARE PARAMOUNT TO YOUR SUCCESS*4. Start off with the beef. This is a point of personal preference since this way you'll get the most bang for your buck. But, if you're a beef hater than by all means do whatever you want. Your return on investment will just be capped.5. Follow with the pork belly. You never want to start off with this since it's so rich on its own. You run the risk of hitting a wall here.6. Make sure you maintain a 3:1 meat to lettuce ratio or you'll pay for it the next day. 3 pieces of meat to every 1 piece of large lettuce. Fiber is crucial to minimizing lavatory pain the next day.7. Meat before beer, beer before soju.8. Save room for the kimchi fried rice. It's delightful."
5/26/2012,3 star rating,"Hae Jang needs better service & bigger tables. Granted we came in a huge group for a friend's birthday, courtesy is always appreciated! But like Palsaik Samgyupsal, I like that they cook and cut it for you. Their side dishes and salad were tasty. They do have abnormally long operating hours and pretty good dinner prices. So, if the craving strikes, it's a win/win situation (almost).Parking is valet only - $2."
11/11/2017,5 star rating,"Hosting is a difficult job at a high volume restaurant like this one, but Michelle and Jenny show tremendous hospitality to my party every single time. The service, overall, is commendable! If you're going to dine here, keep in mind that you'll wait for AT LEAST 2-2.5 hours. If you're hangry or impatient, take yourself to a different KBBQ and risk missing out on great quality AYCE KBBQ. The meat is delicious and the side dishes are fresh. This is my new favorite spot; I'll always be back here. GON IS THE BEST SERVER EVER"
11/11/2017,4 star rating,"Really good service, really good price/quality. The only reason why I gave 4/5 stars is that I feel they want to rush you out of there. I mean they are not disrespectful directly but you feel the rush. I don't like the fact that the soda is not all you can drink."
10/30/2012,5 star rating,"This place has great service-- we were asked multiple times what we'd like to order. The best part was the cleaning of the bbq plate from the meat. Between each type of dish, there would be someone cleaning the charred surface with white radish. also, this is one of the only Korean BBQ places that doesn't reek your clothes after you go! The ventilation is much better!Bancha, pancake and meat were top notch. Hubby and I agreed that this place used fresh meat. Top types of meat were galbi, beef tongue, and squid, thick patty pork, and bulgogi. In a small plaza with $2.00 valet parking. Would definitely recommend this AYCE place!"

6/10/2015,5 star rating,"My favorite Korean BBQ in all of LA / OC.Parking is limited. There's valet, but I have never had a problem finding street parking nearby within 5-10 minutes max. Maybe I am extra patient from my days living in NYC, where you have to circle the block for 30 minutes and eventually broaden your search area until you end up parking 10-15 blocks away, walking for another 30 minutes just to get to wherever you were trying to go in the first place. /rant /deepbreathI like everything here. Meat quality is at the top as far as AYCE Korean BBQ is concerned. It's probably still not as good as A-LA-Carte places, but I wouldn't expect it to be. Order what you like, and don't be afraid to try new stuff.Tip: Â Expect a long wait. I've never waited less than an hour. And save room for kimchi fried rice at the end, it's totally worth it."

6/9/2010,4 star rating,"2nd time here...my new fave place. Â Brisket (chadolbaggi) is pretty good for AYCE...similar to Road to Seoul. Â I love that they have pork shoulder...YUM! Â Lots of free extras....steamed egg, kimchee pancake, kimchee fried rice & doenjang chigae. Â Coolest thing is the stonetop grill. Â It's tilted with a drain hole at the bottom. Â They don't change out the grill when you change meats...they clean it using moistened radish slivers...surprisingly gets it pretty-darn clean! Â I've never had a problem with the service. Â There's a call button on the tables/walls, or you could just call them over.One thing to note - ventilation is not so good...especially with all the meat-cooking. Â I come home smelling like full-on BBQ...so, wear things that are washable...even your purses, ladies.It tends to get pretty busy at night....but if you go mid-week around 7pm-ish...it's not too bad."
11/7/2015,5 star rating,"I always bring friends who are new to Korean BBQ to this restaurant-they always love it! It's a great way for them to try all different kinds of delicious, quality meat. I especially love the kimchi fried rice at the end. They mix it well and it's a must to let it sit for a bit so the rice gets crunchy on the bottom. It's a fun environment and always worth the wait (but it's easier to make a reservation or come at off-peak hours)."
11/7/2015,5 star rating,"Went with a group of three for a late lunch. We were seated in under ten minutes and proceeded to stuff our faces for two hours. Short rib, squid, beef brisket, intestine, and pork belly were all amazing. Our servers were super attentive and polite (and best of all, did not judge me when I got three orders of short rib). Place is a tad small so I wouldn't recommend for huge parties, but for our group it was perfect."
2/5/2017,5 star rating,A delectable medley of meats in a large room with ample air ventilation - went here on a date with hubby and holy wow! Experiential dining at its peppiest. The bulgogi is juicy but the tongue is juicier still ; ) Â - next time I'll bring an extra shirt or two!
2/22/2017,5 star rating,"My absolute favorite AYCE KBBQ place! The only down side that makes me not want to eat here at normal times is that no food is worth the 2 hours wait =(. Most of the meat here are pretty high quality, and they taste delicious. Interesting how they even have ""hot dog"" as an option on menu. I have to say that the only things that are just average are thick slice pork belly and the pork shoulder. But I absolutely loveeeeee their thin slice pork belly. It's the best fatty thing in the entire world! I love it so much I don't even care much about the bones awkwardly in between the meat. They use stone grills to cook meat, and the grill is slightly tilted so all the excessive oil will go down the tray instead of continuing bubbling with all the fresh meat. Everyone in there are very attentive, and I actually learned how to cook KBBQ meat from watching them cook my meat! At the end of the meal, they cook a perfectly spicy kimchi fried rice on the grill! Even though I wish I get to eat that with my meat since the beginning of the meal, I still eat them all!"

10/22/2012,5 star rating,"Came here on a Friday night with my gf and friend, we were all starving and wanted lots and lots of food. The parking here is valet only, but it's nice because you don't have to drive around and around looking for a spot let alone park on a sketch street in Ktown. Â The wait for us to get a table was roughly 2 hours, let me tell you the wait was well worth it. Â Once we were seated we ordered brisket, bulgogi, and short rib. Â My friend did all the ordering since she is Korean. Â The briskest was SO good, some of the best brisket I've ever had. Â It was juicy, tender, and flavorful as the rest of the meat. Â It all tasted quite fresh, unlike some other places. Â The customer service was amazing, they were at our table filling us up with rice paper, radish, and hot sauce every few minutes. Â At the end of the meal they get all of the leftover meat and make a rice dish out of it, that was tasty but we were all so full to enjoy it.if you don't mind a wait for good kbbq I reccomend this place."
7/17/2015,5 star rating,This place is my ultimate favorite Korean BBQ place. Food is alwayssssss delicious and scrumptious. Every meat is seasoned to perfection. Only thing I hate about this place is that there is always a wait and the place is too cramped :/ I think its safe to say you can expand guys!!
12/23/2012,3 star rating,"This place was ok, but they kind of left us fending for ourselves for awhile. They left the pile of meat next to us, so after waiting for some time for someone to get the BBQ going, we started moving the meat clumsily over to the grill, which worked out fine in the end. The sides were pretty good, but didn't matchup with the sides we got from Nearby KBBQ places. Oh yes, We did get chastised when we asked for Sake, waiter said its Japanese while rolling his eyes.. Well no sh*t guy, but other highly rated Korean BBQ places around here serve and suggest sake as it tastes great with the BBQ. But it was fine they didn't as we settled on the Korean imported, Hite Beer, which was delicious. The Hite was so delicious we went through nearby Korean liquor stores until we found packs of them to bring home."
8/1/2014,5 star rating,5 Reason's why I prefer Hae Jang Chon over other AYCE Korean BBQ places:#1 They cook on a stone grill. Â This prevents a lot of the annoying burning and overly smokey grill scenarios that occur at other KBBQ places. Â They also clean it halfway through the meal with radishes which I really like. Â #2 Their side dishes. Â I love everyone one of their side dishes and I think they give a lot more variety than some other places. Â The potatoes are delicious and so are the greens that they give you!!!#3 Their dipping sauces. Â They give you four kinds of sauces to dip your meat in and every one of them is tasty for different types of meats :) Â  (I also love the rice paper that I can wrap my meat in.)#4 Price/ Waiting/ Meat selection ratio is just right!! Â This place is the best compromise I've found between the amount I have to wait to the amount I have to pay to the amount of selection I have of meat. Â For $17 ayce they have a huge variety of meat to choose from and octopus as well!!! Â Usually the waiting isn't so bad if you come here earlier in the day. #5 Complimentary kimchi fried rice at the end. Â Even though I'm always too full at the end and feel ridiculously bloated the fried rice is still delicious and a nice touch at the end of a meal.
8/5/2009,4 star rating,"I'm not a big fan of all you can eat korean bbq places because I get full after only one round but when I came here with my family to celebrate my cousin on graduating from grad school I think I ate more than what I had expected....the galbi was not that good, it wasn't as tender as other places I've been to. Â the bulgogi was meh but the chadolbaegi(brisket) was AMAZING, I couldn't stop eating it, had to force myself to stop. Â I like this place because it also comes with duenjang jigae and the saam(rice paper wrap) in place of rice because at the end of eating all the beef they make you fried rice right in front of you....and there's so much variety of meats....oh I love how they clean the stone grill/iron cast skillet whatever you call it...who knew that radish/horseradish cleans off burnt residue on a stone grill...i didn't...this place is good eats!"
4/18/2013,5 star rating,"The wait here can be LONG - especially if you come during peak dinner hours, but it's worth it!That being said, the AYCE deal is so worth it! Â They have all my favorite banchan (fish cakes, bean sprouts, kimchi, daikon) and they also give you salad, a steamed egg and a kimchi pancake. Â Though the meat is AYCE, make sure to save room for bean paste stew and the kimchi fried rice they make right on the skillet in front of you. Â Pair that with bottles of soju and it's a recipe for a great night!"

7/21/2014,5 star rating,"After much internal struggle of how to rate this place, I went with a 5 star. Why you ask? Well, I was holding up an image of what I deemed to be the best Korean BBQ in Los Angeles/Orange County, which is Gen Korean BBQ. I will say that Hae Jang Chon is arguably the best Korean BBQ in Ktown and definitely the best all you can eat spot in Ktown. They have probably close to 15 different types of meat, including some of my favorites:Marinated Short RibBrisketBeef TongueTheir dinner special comes out to $19.99/per person + tax. You also can get kimchi fried rice after the fact where they use the grill you cooked your meat on to make the fried rice. Pretty awesome, right? The sides are pretty great here. Big fan of the bean sprouts and salad. And the service is awesome. Super attentive. Thankfully, I've never experienced a long wait here, which has definitely helped my experience."
12/12/2016,1 star rating,"This was the worst customer service I ever received at a Korean restaurant. I had a scheduled a dinner with clients and they blocked us at the door and stated that all members of the party had to be present in a very rude manner. We patiently waited and when the other member of our party came, they said that our reservation was cancelled because we were more than 15 minutes late. Meanwhile there were tables that were empty and available. I felt discriminated against. I definitely don't recommend this restaurant"
12/12/2016,1 star rating,"The food is good here, but other than that, not much else going on to accommodate customers. The front desk is very rude and seem to choose fighting words with dissatisfied customers after being refused service for being one party short. They have a lot to learn in the customer service department and I will never be coming back here again after being here a few times before. There are thousands of Korean bbq places in the area, if you are looking for warm and friendly staff, you won't find them at this one."
10/12/2010,5 star rating,My favorite Korean BBQ place hands down. It's also the only place I know that uses a stone grill to cook the meat. The meat just taste more flavorful on the stone grill.Good enough for me to plan my trips back to California around.
11/12/2010,5 star rating,"PROS: Good selection of meat, friendly staff, and decent prices.CON: ParkingI came here with a friend tonight after shooting. We found this place after searching ""late night kbbq"" and this was the first thing that popped up. We came here in 2 cars, which was Â mistake because the parking lot isn't big enough for all the venues in this plaza. My friend got valet parking here, and I parked across the street, barely. Since my friend got parking here, he got a table for us and it was about a 5 minute wait. When i walked it, I noticed it was lively. This was about 9:40pm and this place is pretty much packed, TV was on the LA Lakers and Denver Nuggets game. Most of the people were watching the game. It was awesome.We decided to get the all you can eat special, which was $16.99 and it included a lot of different types of meat, and you can order up to 4 types of meat for the first round. The meat we could get were: 1) Black Angus Beef Brisket2) Beef short rib (marinated or unmarinated)3) BBQ Beef (Bulgogi), 4) Canadian Fresh Cut Pork Belly (thin or thick slice)5) Pork shoulder 6) Beef tongue7) BBQ Pork8) BBQ Chicken9) BBQ Squid10) Beef Abomasum 11) Beef Honeycomb (Basically tripe)12) Hot DogsWe tried all of them except for the pork belly, Beef abomasum, and hot dogs.The brisket is the best I've tasted for AYCE KBBQs. The short meat was juicy and tender, pork shoulder was great, and I usually don't like pork meat. The beef tongue here is better than most places because I don't really enjoy eating it, but here I ate a lot of it. BBQ pork wasn't that great though. BBQ chicken was good and for the squid, you get a huge slab of it plus the legs. Beef honeycomb, ehhh, i prefer it in a soup than BBQ. The service is great. I never felt that they were trying to rush us out, and they always asked if we wanted more. We were there for over 2 hours, and after we said we didn't want more meat, they asked if we wanted to try some kimchi fried rice. Very few AYCE places I know actually does this. Of course, i had to try some and it was pretty good. It comes with a soup too.I will come here again. It will be my default AYCE KBBQ until I find a better place for its price. NOTE: If it's your birthday, come here and tell them, then just see what happens."
5/15/2016,1 star rating,"Went to the restaurant the first time and had delicious food. 2nd time I called in advance for a reservation for 6. The staff on the phone told me a bunch of rules and I received a text message of their rules. They also told me because we were 6, we may not sit together. Fast forward to getting seated- we only have 4 people. They tell us they only allow reservations for 6 or more. I ask them where in their policy I was texted says that. The guy points to a line that says ""parties of 6 or more people Â only taken depending on availability""I say that says large parties may not be accommodated. He keeps insisting and he reads the first 6 words as if I can't read English. Everyone talking to us was rude beyond belief like we spat on their face. For even more ridiculousness, when we called to make the 6 people reservation, they told us we wouldn't even be able to all sit together. The food was delicious, but there are so many kbbq places in ktown- I'll take my business elsewhere."
7/8/2015,5 star rating,BEST KOREAN BBQ AND STAFF SERVICE WE'VE EVER HAD!!! From the moment they asked us for how many people till we pay the bill... There were staff on rotation to check on all customers. Our drinks were always refilled and variety of meats were always on the grill. We either turned the meat or the staff cooked it for us. We caught on so we just let them do the cooking and we enjoyed the eating. We'll definitely come back and refer this place to friends!
3/25/2014,3 star rating,"Decided to stray outside my usual for Korean BBQ.This place was popping on a Thursday night! A table for 2 was well over an hour wait. Crazy! Good luck trying to find free street parking. I ended up valeting, which is only a nominal $2.Their AYCE menu is $18.99 which included tons of options: brisket, short rib (galbi), pork belly, Â bulgogi, beef tongue, chicken...even octopus and shrimp! Their meat quality was just ok in my book. The also end off with some kimchi fried rice.The unique factor about this place is that they have a stone grill which they come by periodically to clean off with radish. I haven't seen this at any other place. I prefer the other grills more because you can get your meat extra charred and crisp. Yes, I love those carcinogens.The service is pretty good and all the servers are friendly, which is rare for this type of restaurant. They will actually come by to see if you need refills, order more meat, or to cut up your meat for you. A good spot for a kBBQ newbie I'd suggest.They also open until 2am. Although this may not be a regular place for me, I know where to go when late night kBBQ cravings hit!"

The fact that the servers are ALWAYS there when you need them is awesome. They always come to check to see if you need anything. The worst feeling at AYCE-KBBQ is needing something and trying yoru darnest to get the server's attention.The meat was awesome and after tax and tip, we ended up paying just under $30 per person (if you don't drink beer).Parking is valeted for a few dollars."
12/6/2015,4 star rating,Despite the long line. This AYCE is very efficient.Valet Parking is Two DollarsGreat BanchanI love the size of the water cups.

12/6/2015,5 star rating,"Korean BBQ, is one of my favorite styles of food because because of the variety, interactiveness, and he feeling and taste of hot sizzling meat right off the grill. That being said, this place does deserve my 5 stars. In K-Town, there is a plethora of KBBQ joints. I always find myself arguing with friends over where to go because everyone has their own place they think is best. Most of the time, if you are going for quality, you don't go to an all you can eat restaurant. However, I only like Korean BBQ in all you can eat fashion because with Korean BBQ, you just want to focus on the cooking and have a lot of people around you and just keep eating and not have to worry about what to get for who and how much to order and who's meat is who's etc. it's just too much of a headache. With this place, you get the best of both, AYCE ($21.99 p/p) and quality. Service is fantastic. Really, in KTOWN, good service is not so common, but over here, you feel so welcome and attended to. It feels good. The kimchi fried rice they make you at the end of your meal, that's only an option if you don't eat rice during your meal. My tip is to have one person get rice and share that during the meal and the other rice have them make kimchi fried rice with at the end. They don't like that so you kind of have to play dumb. Trust me, you won't really have room to eat it in the end anyway. Lastly, the thing that makes here much different than the rest is the fact you are cooking on a hot stone vs an open flame. I initially had concerns about this because I like how with open flame grills they have a place for all the fatty liquids to escape. I also worried about the meat becoming a little chewy if the liquid stayed on the stone surface. Truthfully, even though there is a hole for the liquid to leave, you kind of have to push the liquids towards that hole yourself and it's super important to do so if you want a good sear on your meat."
12/6/2015,5 star rating,Love! The quality of their meats is excellent and their service is so quick and very attentive. Must stop every time we're down in LA.

12/4/2015,5 star rating,"The best service ever... Servers were checking ever few minutes to see if we were okay, to see if we needed more meat or anything, and also cleaned our grill well. The place is also was not as crowded and the quality of the meat was very good. I will definitely be coming back here! Shout out to our amazing servers!!"
12/3/2015,5 star rating,"The options might be a little more limited (not millions of flavors of pork belly, etc.) and it might get super busy, but this is my favorite place. They have really quick service and oftentimes they'll even cook the meat for you. Also, they keep your water refilled, which is always a must at these types of places. The meat is fairly high quality, and the grill helps keep things more flavorful. I love it because they don't have to constantly reach over you to change the grill; they just throw in some radish to clean it off."
12/2/2015,5 star rating,"Great $10 lunch special. Bulgogi (or spicy squid), rice, soup, rice paper, and lots of banchan all for only $10!!! It gets busy during lunch time, so either come on the earlier end or later end."

10/17/2017,5 star rating,I have been here twice and both times were great. Â The meat is good quality and the sides are all good. Â I do wish they had the reddish dish but all good anyways. Â My wife doesn't really eat meat so she got the bibimbap and thought it was good. Â The egg was cooked correctly and the vegetables and rice were good. Â I had the whole lineup of beef and liked them all with the ribs and the pork belly being my favorite. Â Looking forward to the next time.

10/22/2016,5 star rating,"One of my favorite ayce kbbq places in Ktown. Â I love how everything is cooked on stone. I feel like it's the best way to cook meat that tends to dry out over a standard grill such as beef tongue and brisket. Â I know they always give me weird looks when I do this, but whenever I eat here, my first order is always beef tongue and brisket, and I always mix them together; the flavors meld so well! Give it a try!"
4/2/2014,4 star rating,"AYCE KBBQ. Nuff said. In the whole spectrum of KBBQ's found everywhere in Ktown, this one is highly popular with 1 hour waits on a Monday night. At $18/pp though, this place is a pretty good spot to get some flavorful meat for cheap if you can queue for an hour or so.The uniqueness of this place is the grill. You cook on stone slabs heated by a flame underneath. For my group, this translated to faster cooking meat. Brisket would be ready within 2 minutes of putting it on the grill. To top it off, service was pretty spectacular and attentive. They would clean our grill often, which was a manual labor scrub, and we were never left without meat queued up for our group of 6.-=-banchan fishcake-=- While most liked the kimchee here, I thought the fishcake was the best. There was a slight spice behind every bite. It's a good starter that's on the table before any meat is cooked. Chomp chomp chomp.-=-brisket fatty-=- You might like your brisket lean, well I like mine fatty. These were my favorite meats of the night. Every cut tasted fresh. I enjoyed these best with the red barely browned off.-=-bulgogi-=- Some in my group called it a bit salty, but I thought it was fine. It's not as heavily marinated as other places, but eating this will make you crave the unflavored meat again.-=-beef tongue-=- Got a big dose of this. It's not a fatty meat, but it's a similar beefy taste as brisket. The beef flavor wasn't as prominent as my favorite brisket though.-=-pork belly-=- This cames in 2 types: thin or thick. We first got thin, and then craved thick. Neither tickled my fancy which surprised me since think cut pork belly is a KBBQ staple. I'm theorizing that the super hot grill had something to do with cooking most of the flavor away. Not so sure why it wasn't too enjoyable.-=-pork shoulder-=- This was surprisingly flavorful. While uncooked, it looked unseasoned, but it turned out to have a light sesame soy flavoring. Not bad at all.-=-beef abomasum-=- Super chewy. Good if you like it, but for me I wasn't a fan.-=-hot dogs-=- Just a regular ballpark hotdog. No frills here. I was highly curious though.-=-Kimchee Fried Rice-=- After all the meat is said and done, they will take all your remaining meat and fry it with rice. Leave the rice on the grill extra long to get some burn on it and it's super flavorful, especially from the seaweed. Don't stuff yourselves silly and save some appetite for this."
9/1/2011,5 star rating,"Peace out to the other KBBQ places I have eaten before because Hae Jang Chon has now become my all-time favorite KBBQ place to eat!My cousin was so hungry, so we went here late at night and was so stoked to see that it closes at 2 AM! Who does that, especially from a KBBQ place? It is so rare to see that happening, so I give it mucho props for closing so late. This place is very busy during the dinner time, so we had to wait for a little bit! But that's ok because $16.99 was worth it when there are 19 tasty bbq items to choose from - squid, brisket, pork, beef honeycomb, hot dog, etc. Upon entering the place, we see our table ready to go! Side dishes are already there, 4 dipping sauces, utensils present and accounted for. Best of all? Stone grill was in the center of the table, which is great to cook some awesome KBBQ meat. Salad was delicious! Furthermore, I love the taste of black angus beef brisket, pork shoulder, bulgolgi, squid, and even the short ribs. I wasn't a fan of the bland beef honeycomb, however.Service was great and quick. Once the stone grill got dirty, for instance, the waiter was there to clean up the grill with radish! It was so interesting Â to see that I thought it was food at first! I have yet to try the kimchi fried rice towards the end of the meal because Â we (all six of us) were all stuffed towards the end of the early morning hours, which means that I will definitely return to finish what I have started. You will NOT be disappointed! Valet parking at the lot is $2."
5/15/2012,4 star rating,"I recently went to eat here with a couple foodie friends, and I have to say, I was really impressed! This was actually only my third or fourth time eating Korean BBQ, and quite honestly, my previous experiences with it just bordered on mediocre. Like meh, okay, I'll eat some Korean BBQ. Oh but wait! It's so expensive!Hae Jang Chon is $18 AYCA (all-you-can-eat)!!!!!!! And trust me, baby, I ate!We arrived on a Monday night, and this place was packed! After being let off in the front so our friend could park the car (there's a valet service), we made our way into the restaurant. Surprisingly enough, the space here is actually quite large, so we only waited a few minutes with our name on a list before being seated. (Keep in mind, though - this place will require your entire party to be present before they will seat you.) When we arrived at our table, there was an amalgam of side dishes (kimchee, pickled radish/spinach/fish cake, kimchee sprouts), as well as sauces (salt/pepper/oil, chili, peanut, and soy). Immediately, I noticed that there was a huge, round stone grill in the center of the table, which was actually a nice detour from the standard issue metal grill. We had menus, but there was also a huge sign on a wall nearby that listed all of the meats. We started with a ginger salad and then ordered a couple rounds of brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, pancake, and even a hot dog (this was mostly for comic effect)! Let me tell you - this was really nice quality meat. I am not a huge red meat eater, but I was shoveling this stuff into my piehole (as soon as it was cooked) like there was no tomorrow! The pork belly was probably my favorite; it was like eating thick-sliced bacon. *mouthgasm* Mmmmmmm bacon. We finished the meal with some kimchee fried rice (my first time, and I am in LOVE). Iced water jugs sat behind us for refills. The wait staff was really attentive; they were always quick and friendly to respond to our several requests for additional side dishes. We never felt rushed, and we even joked that we should just stay and keep eating until they closed at 2 AM!We stuffed ourselves good. It was just that tasty. In all actuality, I should have felt sicker for how much I ate, but I left feeling fine. (Enough to go across the street to stuff myself with dessert and coffee.)I haven't actually ventured around much in K-Town, but I will definitely explore more (and be back here) after this experience. It's pretty awesome to have a button at your table to call for service instead of waiting to flag down the waiter(s). I've been told this is very common K-Town, and I have to say, it's pretty efficient! I left this place a very satisfied customer. I will definitely be back with friends!"
12/5/2017,5 star rating,"Expect to wait a while. I've been here plenty of times and it's always busy, regardless of what time it is. If you're a party of 6 or more however, you can make reservations! But if your party decreases to anything less than six you're gonna have to write your name down on the regular waitlist. I've always waited about an hour here whether I'm a party of 2 or 5. Well worth it though! The quality of the meat is amazing and the service is still good, despite how busy they are. They're pretty good at changing out your grill and the staff is pretty friendly despite all the pressure. This is one of the best kbbq spots I've been to."

3/31/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite Korean BBQ spot. Â The quality of the food is excellent. Â This place is so popular that 30 min and one hour wait times around dinner time are the norm. Â The service is great. Â The servers actually come by your table and cook the food on the grill for you, and constantly check to see if you have everything that you need. Â My favorites are the Kimchi pancake, Kimchi fried rice and steamed egg. Â The price is not that bad with the quality of food you get as ""all you can eat"". Â Definitely worth checking out."
6/13/2010,5 star rating,"This is hands down the best AYCE Korean BBQ place in K-town. Â I have yet to find a restaurant that has better service and better food than Hae Jang Chon. Â Yes it located in the heart of K-town on 6th street, and you have to deal with small lanes and crazy drivers all the way there--but in LA what do you expect.The best things about this place:1. Brisket!!! Whatever they use to marinade the brisket in is genius. Â It is so flavorful--you will not be disappointed. Â All their other meat choices are also very good but brisket is my favorite. Â They also serve hot dogs which is funny. Â I tried it once and it was like any other hot dog so don't get it unless you really crave it. Â I also suggest BBQ pork--it takes the longest to cook so order it early in the meal.2. Kimchi pancake--YUMMY! The first time I tried HJC's pancake I was hooked. Â It is fresh, moist, tasty, and comes with freshly grilled kimchi. Â 3. The grill--Usually when you go to an AYCE KBBQ the grill is like any other grill. Â The smoke is all in your face and the flame can engage in a sneak attack on your fingers. Â Well at HJC the grill a stone grill. Â It gets equally as hot as any other grill out there so don't be alarmed. Â What makes this grill so unique is that you don't have to worry about meat falling through the grill, you don't have to worry about smoke in your eyes and the flames burning your fingers. Â Plus, they never have to change the grill. Â They use daikon to clean it right in front of you which is pretty cool to watch as well. Â 4. All the sides. Â Best variety & high quality.5. Kimchi fried rice & soup. Â Not only do they give you kimchi pancake at the beginning of your meal, but they finish you off with fresh kimchi fried rice that they make in front of you on your stone grill. Â It is soo good. Usually I am already stuffed by the time they make it for me, but I've been trying very hard lately to pace myself so I can enough my fried rice & soup. Â 6. Service. Â The people here are very attentive. Â They fill up your water frequently and they are always checking up on you to see if you need anything else. They are very friendly and answer any questions you have about the food. Â Best service I've had at a KBBQ7. Very clean. Â Enough said. The downside:1. Parking. Â Not a big deal, but you have to valet your car in the lot. Â It's hard to find street parking around this place so you usually have to valet. Â Like I said, not a big deal but if you hate to valet & tip $2 then you have been warned.2. Wait. Â If you go on the weekends for dinner be prepared for a wait. Â The last time my boyfriend and I went on a Friday [possibly Sat] night, we waited about 45 minutes to get a seat. Â Totally worth the wait though in my opinion. Â Any other night is fine in terms of waiting for a table and if you go at lunch you will be seated right away. GO TO HAE JANG CHON!!! =]"
4/9/2012,3 star rating,"I'm not a fan of AYCE bbq, but this place is outstanding among its catalog. The place is small, be ready to wait for at least 30 min when you arrive on dinner time. Â All the meat is good considering it's AYCE, it is high quality. The service is fast. And the afterwards fried rice is winning point too. But it seems you will be too full to eat any more."
3/3/2015,4 star rating,"The sign is catchy and easy to notice, it was located in pretty decent plaza. The parking was not bad, it is valet so guaranteed you always get a spot, oh.. it's free parking!Got into the restaurant, super hungry, it took awhile to get the somebody guiding us to the table. There were only 4 servers for that big place, seemed like they were pretty short that day. I went there with my family, there were 3 of us. The must have is..of course, Bulgogi, spicy pork, squid is pretty good, short ribs!BBQ chicken was meh, shrimp is not bad. It's all you can eat, $19.99/per person. Leftover meat will be charged for $15. You can order for per round 4 kinds of meat maximum, get different kinds of meat for second round up to 4 kinds as well, and so on. We also had 3 hot tea. My uncle had beer, total was $72 for us. All the meat were so delicious and soft, very eatable, it was awesome. They cleaned the bbq stone cooker after 2nd round of meat order, we had 3 rounds. We had these food around 2 pm and yes, right now it's midnight I am still full. Angela is a nice server. There's a young guy that we were not happy with his work, he came back to me asking what I ordered, well.. can you just put it on your note ? He also lit the fire on the BBQ table was wayyyy too close leaning towards me and heck yes, I was not comfortable. I asked him hot tea, he came back with my 1/4 glass of tea that's been there with water. I seriously wanna tell him not to come back and serving us. DOWN side is.. all servers were serving us, if it was that young guy only, there wouldn't be any tip for him. But the rest of the ladies especially Angela was good. Beware for your jacket/clothes, it would smell like bbq afterwards."

8/15/2015,3 star rating,"The wait was less than an hour at dinner time on a Monday night, which was good as we expected couple hours of wait time.Staff was friendly, kinda rushed but still ok. Â Our first waiter was either rude or new, cause he either did not hear that it was our first time or that he ignored it and did not tell us how to order. Â We did not know we can only order 4 items at a time, so we gave him a list of items and he just left leaving us to think that he has this incredible memory. Â When another waiter brought our meat, he only put one meat on the stone to cook and the rest of the meat was placed on the table side then he left. Â We did not understand, so we placed more meat since it seemed like a self serviced dining. Â Then another waiter came over and told us to stop and that we messed it up. Â The stone can only cook so much at a time and that we are not allow to cook the meat, and they are the only people to place and remove anything from the stone. Â Well, if someone told us so we would've gladly sat there and just eat... Overall, the food is okay. Â For that price I may try another since nothing seems special."
10/5/2011,4 star rating,"I really want to give this place 5 stars, but the wait time is CRAZY LONG. Â To be honest, not worth the wait if it's late and you're starving and tired. Â My party's one hour wait turned into nearly two. Â NO BUENO.Quality meat and good service here. Â The waiter for our table was really nice and the waitresses were speedy with our requests, especially since our table went through rice paper like water. Â Not much banchan, but that's okay because with the quality here, you want to stuff yourself with loads and loads of meat and nothing else. Â Didn't care too much for the kimchi pancake, but the kimchi fried rice was good; I kept eating it even though I was already stuffed by the end of the meal.However, if you're hungry and wanna bypass wait time, I would NOT recommend coming here. Â Sure, the quality of meat is better than other places and service is impeccable, but if you don't care about that, do go somewhere else. Â The wait will be shorter and your meal will also probably be cheaper.Next time I come here, I'd come with a small party and either early in the evening or much later in the night before they close.Their wait time is NOT the business, but still, this place is solid."
5/24/2014,1 star rating,"This was the worst korean BBQ I've ever had. The price wasn't too bad but it was the quality of the food that was terrible. They didn't even bring kimchi fried rice to our table at the end! We ordered the beef bulgogi, chicken bbq, and beef short rib. The short rib tasted old and had no flavor...the same for the rest. Are you kidding me? I came all the way to korea town because I was hoping to have some delicious bulgogi! This was the most flavorless meat I've ever had in my life....The pot they put on top of the table is dirty and the smoke just continues to blow in your face. No matter where you move, you cannot catch a break. They also have a stupid policy of charging you $15 if you cannot finish your food...want to know the secret? Stash whatever you haven't eaten into the banchan and they won't find it! If you guys want quality korean bbq, try Genwa. Even though it's very pricey, the difference is like night and day. I will never come back here and I stink! Not the good korean bbq kind of way..."
3/29/2019,5 star rating,"This was a wonderful kbbq experience, and a worthy wait. I went in around 6 on a Friday as a table for 2 and waited 45 minutes. Banchan was already on the table when we sat down and our waiter Josh was very hard-working and attentive the whole time. Definitely better than all the AYCE KBBQ that I've had in NYC."
4/19/2010,5 star rating,"This place is my favorite AYCE K-BBQ!!!The price is a good deal considering all the fresh meat, side dishes, pancakes, & kimchi fried rice that you get.The brisket is just sooo yummy!!! Especially when you eat it with salad & the rice cakes/papers, with a tad of the doenjang (fermented soybean) paste. The kalbi & bulgogi are just ok. I never like sam gyup sal (pork belly), personally, because of all the fat. So I didn't try it here. I love their pancakes, espeically if you put them on the grill for a few minutes to make them crispier!!Oh, talking about the grill. This place uses stone grill!! Not the metal grill like all other places. Somehow, the stone grill gives extra flavor to the meat.They offer to make you kimchi fried rice at the end, but i'm always too full to eat it. Overall, it's always gonna be my choice whenever I want to stuff my self with some yummy K-BBQ!!!"
11/15/2010,5 star rating,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!It is such a bargain deal! The staff here is excellent! The food is good! Love the kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice. WARNING: Order the Kimchi fried rice at the end. Because if you order it earlier you cannot order anymore meat. My friends and I made that mistake, but luckily our waitress was kind enough to let us order more meat since it was our first time. The salad and banchan is delicious! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

11/9/2014,5 star rating,"So, in L.A. there are a plethora of AYCE Korean BBQ and I have been to many of them. This place is the standard upon which all the other places are measured by. Having tried several places in Koreatown- this place came upon the suggestion of a friend who lives in Downtown L.A. This is the only place she comes to and she is Korean, therefore having a very high expectations. if she comes here, that means it is something special.Be prepared to wait as it is pretty small. Usually, we come for early-bird dinner before heading out to Downtown L.A. We were a large group (10 people) and were seated on a long horizontal table with bench seating and 2 grills in the center. There was already banchan waiting for us. The place setting gave me an excellent 1st impression. The plateware used is not run-of-the-mill, cookie cutter. The service is obviously better when have someone who is Korean with you, which we always have anyway. Sure, this place is significantly pricey, in comparison to all the other establishments. However, this place was in highly reviewed in The Los Angeles Times and that alone gives credence. The quality of the meat is what makes this place stand above the rest. Typical choices (kalbi, bulgogi, etc) are offered. Pretty much everything minus the squid- we didn't really know how to cook it and the result was a rubbery mess- was top notch. Otherwise, with friends manning the grill (who know how long to cook each type of meat) we all had a stellar dining experience. This place is very loud, with a majority of the patrons Korean, therefore the Korean din. It just added to the authenticity to the experience. We all drank way too much soju and had a wonderful time. They don't pressure you to leave, even with such long waiting list. It's just known that you have to wait and it so worth it. After you are done with the meats, they cook kim chee fried rice. I am not a fan of kim chee but my friends love it and they love this. It is among the last items you receive and you are beyond full. Yet, they all made room for this. One of the great things is, by virtue of the way the grill is set up over huge blowers, you don't smell as strongly of the korean bbq perfume when you leave. Most of us bring a change of attire befitting the bars we will hang out afterwards but all my guy friends just go dressed as they are. If they are not concerned about the odor detracting the attraction of girls, then I'm not either. Again, parking is a hassle (it always is in LA). Street metered parking is what is best, which I believe is free after 6pm. Upon first glance of the exterior, it doesn't look like much, located in a small strip mall with a ridiculously small parking lot, where you know plenty cars have probably been hit as you back up (it is that tight). They do offer valet I believe and most people use it if no street parking is available. Â As the old adage says, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" When you have many different ethnicities of people waiting patiently (which is rare in L.A- patience)- you just know this place is special. This is the AYCE we take my brother to when he is in town- it is his required and requested 1st stop after he lands at LAX (after In-and-Out obviously) and before Roscoe's on Gower. As I have repeated ad nauseum, go to this place. Im my opinion, the ONLY place in Koreatown you should go to for AYCE Korean bbq."
12/1/2014,1 star rating,"I am so frustrated with their customer service!!! Â If I could give them 0 stars I would! Â I had been trying to make a reservation for the last four weeks and because it was so far in advance, they kept telling me that they couldn't take my reservation because they don't take them that far in advance. Â I told them I was planning for a party of 28 -30 people and I needed to make sure because I still had to send out the invites and that I would need some type of confirmation. Â Well, last week, I called again and I told them that the party is in 3 weeks and could they make sure to write my name down so when their calendar becomes available, I would have priority. Â They said, ""sure, no problem, but call back on the first of the month to confirm""...well guess what?I called like they said and now they are booked! Â WTF!!! SERIOUSLY!!! Â I understand that calling over a month in advance is too early, but if you are getting a call EVERY WEEK then telling me you can't take the reservation, even after you tell me when to call, and that it will be ""no problem"" is NOT good service. Â It sucks because now I have to resend my invite to another location. Â So a big 1 finger salute to this joint! Â There are plenty of other AYCE BBQ places that really care about their business and customers."
2/1/2018,3 star rating,"This was a straight up disappoinment. Came in here with friends from out of town and wanted them to experience Korean BBQ so I took them to the place with the best reviews only to be let down hardcore. The meats were so average and honestly not worth the price, especially when you have other kbbq for less than half the price in the same area."
5/4/2017,4 star rating,"This place has good service, good food and accommodated me with my birthday party even with the slackers of my party that showed up late. The only thing they didn't have was dessert."
12/16/2018,2 star rating,"Pricey but good, but oh. My. God. They have to do something about the wait times. We've been waiting for an hour. When we arrived, they told us the wait was 40 minutes so we put our name in. 20 minutes later we checked progress and they told us it'd be an hour. It's been an hour and we're still waiting. If a doctor ever says you have only a day to live, come here. They apparently have the ability to extend time."
3/21/2017,5 star rating,"Omg. BEST SERVICE OF MY FUCKING LIFE!!!!!!! Literally. My server was so good at her job, she never stopped coming back to us... haunting us.. for MORE MEAT. ""MORE MEAT?""... ""MORE MEAT?""... were the most powerful words I've ever heard. I was mortified. Scared and tried to avoid eye contact every time she came back. How in the hell. I'm from San Francisco & typically my go to spot is Yakini Q which is decent but gets the job done. Normally servers will wait till you ring the bell to assist you, but let me tell you.. our server would ALWAYS know when to come over. I could hardly even ring the bell.. even if I wanted to. LOL but seriously. The wait took at least 1 hour 1/2 but it was definitely worth it. Thank you baby kbbq Jesus. You did it right & I'll be back for more!"
7/28/2016,1 star rating,You're not allowed to eat there solo. I have never been to a business ANYWHERE that will not cater to a customer if he arrived to eat alone. I will be telling all of my friends never to patronize this business. Absolutely ridiculous policy!
2/1/2015,4 star rating,"Came on Saturday night and the parking lot reminded me a long club line... Put your name down and wait. Â We got a could pitchers at a cafe a couple doors down and waited. Â And waited. Â And waited. And waited some more. Â Finally after 2 hours we were called for our table. We knew our four meats to order when the waitress was taking our drink order. Â We went with brisket, tongue, Kalbi and squid. Â All were delicious! We tried variations of other beef and seafood - all were great! They don't offer too many different kinds of banchan but that's ok - because we were there for meat anyways. Â At the end of our meal they come and prepare a kimchi fried rice on our grill. Â We were all so stuffed but still continued to eat. Â So good!Overall good food and good service - wait can be long so come prepared!"
3/10/2010,5 star rating,"This is my FAVORITE Korean BBQ place EVER!!!!! I was first introduced to this place by my Asian friends and have since become greedy and gluttonous and need to come back here at least once a week.As is customary with the really AMAZING Asian food places, there's a long wait for dinner (not so for lunch.) We'll go in a group and have a great time.We get the all you can eat. It comes with tons of meat, a salad, some other fixings and sauces and veggies that just taste so damn good and some kim chi stuff and something that looks like a pancake sort of. It's good, I promise.The water has some sort of ginger stuff in it which is supposed to be healthy but I rarely drink that. I drink the Hite beer n the Soju. It's true, no hangovers when you drink a ton of Soju. ;)Overall, the food is AMAZING. You cook it yourself at your table (thank God my guy friends can bbq) and the service is typical lackluster service. But it's awesome. I'd eat here daily if I wouldn't get fat as hell from all the food. Seriously, it's that good. Definitely good for dates and groups of friends."
12/10/2010,5 star rating,"For a car of 5 people, 6 people were trapped inside a little Fit on a mission to get korean BBQ in while visiting UCLA. We did and came back safely. YAY!! What a wonderful place. $16.99 for 19 different types of meat. This is.. very very .. such a wonderful price when you compare to a popular kbbq place such as Cham Sut Gol down in Garden Grove. The possible only gripe about this place is that they don't offer as many sides as others. But the kimchi pancakes made up for that. This was our first experience with kimchi pancakes and it was just scrumdiddlyumpcious :) Also, the grill seems to be a little small. Our group of 6 eventually slowed down on their food intake, so it was okayish.Our waiter ..who apparently has a facebook.. o.o we know cause he told us lol.. was so cool! Unfortunately, I forgot his name, but he's an older guy and was just.. LOL he was giving people hugs and mocking them at our table (in a nice way) which was cool :) Service was wonderful. The wait to get food was .. not bad. I mean, we got to digest which is good. The marinade on certain meats was yummy and we always got what we needed. Yeah.. my brain is on hiatus but this place is wonderful. Come here. :) Parking is not that great thoughhhh"
5/18/2012,2 star rating,"I need to begin my review with SERVICE:Wow... The Front of the House (Hosts/Hostesses) is terrible when it comes to managing the waitlist. We called for a reservation for 13 people and they gave our table away to another party. Not only did they not honor our reservation, we waited almost an hour to get seated and we didn't even get to sit together!!! Our server looked like he was about to strangle someone.Food:The quality of meat for AYCE was pretty good. my favorites are the brisket and the marinated beef. The galbi was a bit bland, so I had to dunk it in sesame oil and hot sauce. Parking:Valet and street parkingOverall:Good meat quality, but HORRENDOUS SERVICE. I had to knock it down 2 stars for it. There are many places in Ktown where you can get as good or better quality meat with way better service."
9/27/2015,5 star rating,"This place lived up to its reputation on yelp! There was a bit of a wait but that was to be expected. We were seated after about 40 minutes - not bad for a Saturday evening. Before we sat down, all those small plates/appetizers were already there, and the server was just filling our glasses with water and ready to ask us which means we wanted to order. The service was great because they were timeley, not invasive, helped cook the meat if needed, and always made sure our glasses were filled. The ambience was lively and fun, but it's not the place to go if you want a very private table for a quiet meal.The food was amazing! We liked everything we tried. We enjoyed the Bulgogi (bbq beef) and bbq pork the most, but the beef tongue, thin sliced bacon, marinated short rib, pork shoulder, small octopus, and kimchi fried rice were also great. I'll definitely come back again at some point."
3/15/2015,5 star rating,"Once upon a time, I was visiting LA for the first time and craving some Korean food. Ideally, I wanted dak galbi. Oh, the delicious spiciness of dak galbi and the beautiful pain it inflicts on me! However, I was tired of screwing around trying to find a place. I hit dire straits: Korean all-you-can-eat BBQ.The line was out the door, literally, and it was a chilly night in LA, so we were kind of freezing as we didn't have proper clothes. After watching people eating for over a half hour, we were finally seated.The ban chan that they serve is delicious and you have several kinds, fish cake being my favorite. They also provide 4-5 sauces to accompany. The experience is really nice and the wait staff was surprisingly great. They would come over with the meat, throw it on the grill, and help you get started cooking. They focused on the Caucasians that didn't really know what was going on, which is to be expected. They also swing by when they see your food is getting ready to eat and cut it up for you.What I learned, if you want something and it's not in front of you: ask. The food is delicious, but you have to ask for rice and more ban chan. The staff is super busy and they're trying to keep costs low by only giving people what they want or will eat. The quality of the meat was middle of the road.If I go back to LA, I'm totally going back here."
3/15/2015,5 star rating,"This place is the best! Their meat is so amazingly delicious. My favorite are the brisket, short ribs and beef bulgogi. I went here today for the second time and, once again, I got much more than my money's worth. Both times I came at an off hour (2pm) so I guess we just missed the lunch rush and came ahead of the dinner rush. I was turned off Kbbq for a while after bad service at different places were waiters literally rolled their eyes everytime we asked for food (Dude..it's an AYCE restaurant). But friends kept telling me ""Well, you don't get Korean BBQ for the service."" Well, they were wrong! This place is not only generous with the meat--asking if we want another round right just before we finish up the current round--but they cut up the meat for us, flip our food, and tell us when the meat is ready to serve. They are always fast with refilling water and attentive when we raise our hands for something. They don't do the tier bullshit--oh tier A you get this meat, Tier B is better, Tier C is best. You pay one price and you can have anything in the AYCE menu. Even seafood! Plus, other places actually charged us for our two year old but they understand that a two year old can't eat that much meat and they're not really losing money so our daughter ate free.The servers are so nice, always smiling and polite and saying thank you. Nobody rolls their eyes when we ask for food, or gets mad when we want more water...or turns are fire so far down that our food takes forever to cook, which is really messed up at places that have an hour maximum per table. So, if you want KBBQ, come here!!!"

And no one has checked on us again if we all here or not?? Worst, he told me you could just come in and check yourself, in a bad manner.

10/22/2016,5 star rating,"I came here for my birthday dinner. This is probably one of my favorite kbbq places. It's on the pricier side but I think it's worth it. Sometimes the waiter will help you cook the meats if they aren't too busy too. The short ribs surprised me at first. I'm so used to seeing short ribs with the bones still in them. This was the first time having a kbbq place with no bones in the middle. It was a good surprise. I don't have to eat around it. The meats all seemed fresh and I didn't see a single old brown colored meat that came in, unlike some of the cheaper but lower quality meat places I've been to. In terms of how good it is, I think this place and Moodaepo are my top places to go to for kbbq. This place is more home style and close together though. Moodaepo is more like a club and has a darker setting. They also have a lot larger seating and they play music and put the birthday boy or girl on the screen. But yea, definitely will be back in the future."
7/24/2016,5 star rating,One of the best kbbq spots ice ever eaten at. Service is quick and friendly never asked for refills because our waiter kept checking on us every 10 min
3/8/2013,4 star rating,"One of my favorite kbbq places in ktown but I seriously dislike coming here sometimes because it's always so crowded! But that just shows how good it is because this place is always poppin! The price has definitely risen from the first time I've tried this place but its been 1 year so I'm not surprised. It went up from 16.99 to 17.99. Still it's normal price for kbbq and that's a good price for what you get here. You get a wide variety of meats AND they make you kimchi fried rice after you're all done with meat. I seriously sometimes come here craving the fried rice more than the kbbq!! It's pretty darn good. It's pretty small here and so is the parking lot and you have to valet unless you find street parking. It's small so it can get cramped but it's not too bad. There will most likely be a wait when you come here on a weekend, maybe weekdays too but I always had to wait when I came here. However, the wait isn't too bad like some other popular kbbq places. It can range from 20 minutes to an hour, it depends. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it."
6/1/2017,3 star rating,"Ok so I have to say that it was a cool Â spot to dine at but, their version of potato salad compared to our OG spot Â Bak Kung Korean BBQ restaurant in Mid-City so far is the best I've had hands down!!!!!

2/7/2015,3 star rating,I'll give this place three stars mainly just cause their service was good. As for their meats and steamed egg there wasn't anything special about it... it was pretty bland the only item I decided to order twice was the marinated short rib. Probably because it was their best item at their restaurant. Besides that everything else didn't have much flavor and their sauces on the side weren't that good either. They did manage to come by and grab the tongs and cook my food every time I grabbed them.. Also we ordered the kimchi fried rice but they didn't want to bring it out until the end which we ended up canceling the order because we were full already. We had not too much meat left over but maybe 10 pieces they didn't charge us for it so I'll be happy for that!
1/31/2019,1 star rating,The server rushed us on our food and constantly badgered us about getting more food. They also requested that we pay the check halfway through our check when we made it known that we did not want anymore additional meats. I highly do not recommend coming here if you want to sit down and enjoy a relaxing meal with someone.
9/22/2014,4 star rating,"** Food* Price* AtmosphereThis is definitely one of my go-to spots for KBBQ. It's $21.99 / person for all you can eat for dinner. Great selection. Great food. I LOVE their banchan (small appetizers served before food). The wait is never long for walk up. They have valet parking (I think it's $5?) and street parking is a BITCH but doable. Friendly staff and service. Never had to wait for anything, and even if I did they have the little button that gets someone's attention if they're super slammed. Do: Tongue, Brisket, Bulgogi, Kimchi pancake, Kimchi Fried Rice"
3/26/2014,3 star rating,"Arrived on a Tuesday night around 9:00 PM and had about a 1 hr wait.$18 a person for AYCE. Wanted the kimchi fried rice but my dining associates jumped the gun and asked for steamed rice, not realizing we lost out on our chance for that kimchi fried rice, which is pretty delicious (I've been here once before many moons ago)Started first round with brisket, short rib, and beef bulgogi.Brisket was good, with decent marbling and overall quality for AYCE.Short ribs were okay, but I didn't care for it much at all.Beef bulgogi... I did not care for the cut and quality of the meat at all.Second round: thin pork belly, beef tongue, and bbq chicken.I never get chicken at a Korean BBQ place, but admittedly it was decent. Came out juicy and with a decent flavor.Thin pork belly was good. Not much to say about it, but I enjoyed it.Beef tongue was okay. I'm usually quite a fan of tongue - and it was decent - but nothing much to write about here either.Round three: just thick pork belly. This was good and delicious, although not as thick as I'd prefer.If I came here again, I would go for the brisket, thin pork belly, thick pork belly, and try the pork shoulder.The kimchi pancake was good, and the steamed egg was a nice touch.Banchan included: thin radish, cabbage, and bean sprout kimchis (all separate)Pickled carrots and fish cake - I liked the fish cake. The carrots melted in the mouth (not sure whether I actually enjoyed it that much or not, but I'd eat it again.)Potato salad wasn't all that flavorful. Didn't dislike it, but didn't much like it either.Lightly pickled mustard greens (?) were tasty and had a spot on texture. This was my favorite banchan here besides the kimchi.Service wasn't bad, but nothing much to say here either.The star rating description pretty much sums up my feelings on this place: ""A-OK.""I think when I was here a couple years ago, it was slightly better and a couple bucks cheaper. This is the first AYCE I've been to in quite awhile, so maybe I'm just used to shelling out twice as much money for half as much food for exponentially more satisfaction.For what it is though, and for what it's worth - because maybe this is the bottom line for any Yelp review - I left decently satisfied. Just don't expect to get your mind blown here."
7/17/2017,3 star rating,"Got there at 4pm and waited 1.5 hours for table for 2. I like the variety of dipping sauces for the meat, it's a great value for ayce at approximately $25/pp and waiter was attentive. Brisket is tissue paper thin though. Kim chee was bad and really sour.

Would be nice if they were able to have a phone text option to notify you when your table is ready since we did take a walk to kill time and they had already called our name so that may have caused the delay longer to be seated. But other than the wait I would definitely come back here."

10/29/2017,5 star rating,"Best AYCE I've been to by far! The fact that it's all you can eat and they still provide good quality meats and service is amazing! There's nothing much to complain about... kbbq is kbbq. If you're looking for a BANG for your buck type place, this is it! Guaranteed satisfaction!"
4/7/2015,3 star rating,This place always has a line & great reviews but i don't really get it. Â Food was OK but nothing special. None of the meats had very much flavor. Â My favorite was the thick pork belly. They use a different type of grill then I am used to & it didn't really brown the meat unless you left it on for a long time. Â The sides were just mediocre too. The price isn't bad for all you can eat but i would rather spend a little more for better meat. Â For AYCE i would recommend Road to Seoul over this place....

1/13/2015,4 star rating,"K-town has a million AYCE KBBQ restaurants, but at $18 a pop, Hae Jang Chon gives you the best bang for your buck. This is probably my favorite KBBQ restaurant. In fact, I have introduced non-asian coworkers who have never tried AYCE KBBQ to Hae Jang Chon, and we had a great time. Many KBBQ places have limited option for the cheaper AYCE, but Hae Jang Chon has a great variety in addition to the typical brisket, pork belly and short rib.There are 3 things that really stand out at Hae Jang Chon: the service, the stone grill and the fried rice.Korean restaurants are notorious for having horrible service. Even with the service button, it is impossible to get the servers' attention and impossible to communicate if you don't know korean. I did not find this to be a problem at Hae Jang Chon. The waitress was very friendly and very quick. She also noticed when we were low on meat and actively came by to take the next order. This really goes a long way because multiple long waits interfere with the dining experience.Most AYCE KBBQ restaurants use metal grills, but not Hae Jang Chon. However, the meat does not taste any different than those cooked on a regular metal grill. What is kind of interesting is the way they clean the grills. Because the stone grills cannot be replaced easily, they put daikon strips(??) onto the grill and use the moisture to wipe the stone grill clean. The white strips end up completely brownish/black, which is gross yet somewhat interesting.Because Hae Jang Chon has stone grill surface that prevents food from falling thru the cracks of the metal grill, it is possible to cook fried rice on the surface. After you finish your meal, this is exactly what Hae Jang Chon does! Because the grill is also hot from the 1-2 hour usage, the rice heats up quickly and even chars. Topped with seaweed at the end, the fried rice is a great way to finish a delicious meal.Hae Jang Chon is incredibly popular in the area, and a relatively mid-sized restaurant, so BEWARE OF THE WAIT."
5/17/2015,5 star rating,Great and friendly customer service. The staff came by to clean our stone grill multiple times without asking. They also make kimchi fried rice for you at the end! I would definitely come back again. Advice: look for street parking since their parking lot is valet.
10/10/2015,4 star rating,"Man, what a line. That was absolutely ridiculous. It's not their fault obviously haha but I'm never waiting in that line again. I didn't feel their KBBQ was much different from any other place I've been thus the wait was not worth it. I know the stone grill is cool but still, not worth the 1.5 hour wait. Overall the service was GREAT everyone was nice. But the food was like any other KBBQ place. Slightly disappointed I waited SO long."

10/9/2015,4 star rating,"Lunch for 2 = $43 We ordered the marinated short ribs, bulgogi, brisket only and they were pretty good. The steamed egg was really good. Kimchi pancake was meh but it's free so why not. & of course the kimchi fried rice (which would be nice if we got earlier). Their customer service was impressive. Different servers coming to fill our waters, replacing our side dishes, flipping and cutting our meat. It was nice."
10/9/2015,4 star rating,"Despite the... your party must all be there in order to be seated. Food was great and the service was on point. Before being seated, your appetizers are all laid out on the table. Yeah, place can be a tab small BUT the selection of meat, seafood and refills of their appetizers, Â you cannot complain. Â Yes, we came here for the food and of course drinks. You cannot eat korean bbq with just beers, must order soju(s) . You heard me right, order more than one soju. Do prepare Â yourself when it gets busy, the service can be slow but just wave them down when they are looking your way, they will come. Unlimited refill on small appetizers and salad. Love their salad because of their salad sauce, which makes me have an appetite even more. Don't forget to try their kim chi fried rice, they make it in front of you.They have a neat way to clean their grill, using sliced radish to clean. Â All that grease will disappear so no need to worry about burnt food. Will be back!"
10/8/2015,5 star rating,"Absolutely LOVED this place!! Unlike most Korean bbqs where a person in your party gets stuck cooking while everyone else eats, the servers come around and cook/check on your meat, allowing you to eat comfortably and not burn your food! So awesome! Great service. Delicious food. 5 stars."
10/8/2015,4 star rating,"pretty good, always crowded though. If you don't mind long waits or enjoy eating during of hours, this may be the place for you. It's no Park's bbq or OO-kook, but it's an acceptable replacement for large groups at a lower price point and all you can eat, with some unique factors that the other premium joints don't offer (fried rice)"
10/7/2015,4 star rating,Used to order delivery from this place everyday when I was working in my Koreatown immigration law office. The food is decent although a bit expensive. The only dish that is really worth it is the salmon with crab meat at $15 I think.
10/7/2015,5 star rating,"Best Korean BBQ place I've been to. Came in on a Tuesday around 7 and was seated immediately, they weren't busy but by the time we left there was a line. Coming early or making reservations is ideal. The quality of meat was excellent. Service was excellent. Beer was very good. I have no complaints. I would definitely return and definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious Korean BBQ."
10/6/2015,4 star rating,"AYCE Korean BBQ!This place is so packed and popular... We were quoted 2 hours but got a table in like 30 minutes. The time really turns people off, and people wonder off when they call your name so just check in at every 30 minute mark. It's a bit different here, you get to cook the meat on a cast iron skillet, which requires less cleaning and when they do clean it, is with radish which had moisture and it's a good cleaning product. We ordered a bunch of meat, the usual. Except chicken and pork. Brisket, octopus, squid, bulgogi, galbi, beef tongue, thin pork belly, etc. it was all good, lots of flavors. Service was so so. My friend said service is usually better and they come around and help you cook, this time she said it was lacking."
10/6/2015,3 star rating,"We came in here after a long day from waiting in line and actually watching the concert we came to see in the area. Anyway, it was almost midnight and the place is pretty much bustling with people (who some of went to the same venue we came from) since they're open til 2am. The wait was an hour or so, but hey what's another hour of wait when you're tired and starving and it's the only place what will satisfy us. After the long waiting game we got called and seated and immediately started to order. Our server came and as we put in our order he told us we can get 4 meats (as there were 4 of us dining). Hungry and tired we hurriedly abide and got our ordered put in. He also asked us if we wanted gyeran jjim and kimchi pancake, in which we all nod in agreement. Ordered bulgogi, brisket, bbq chicken and bbq squid. They all came at once and we immediately started grilling. The smell and wait is a torture but once they all cooked, it's all worth the wait. Their meat marinate was very flavorful and with the banchan it came with (set up right at the table when they seat you)were paired very well. What's a korean table set up without an awesome banchan right. Anyway, right after we finished all the meat, our server kept asking us if we wanted more meat in which we declined since we were full and satisfied. He also asked if we wanted kimchi fried rice to finish the grilling, in which we also declined. The downside to these is that we weren't informed that we were doing the AYCE that's why our server's insisting we get more meat. Also, hygiene is one thing when you're working in Â food industry, know how not to sneeze in your hands right in full view of your customers while prepping their food. Gross!The busier the place is tells us that they're pretty much well recieved by people. But, we might explore into some other places that have the same offerings like this. They're plentiful around K-Town, just opening up some options."
2/16/2015,5 star rating,"Comparing to the kbbqs in toronto, this place is on a totally different level! The selection and quality of the meats is just not something you'd expect from an all you can eat. Great service too as the servers will keep dropping by to cook your meats and clean the grill."

Nevermind.This place is so good it's like I died and went to food heaven and then came back to life and had some more.This place is so good I would have this meal as my last request if I got put on the electric chair or whatever they use nowadays. This place is that good!"
11/3/2014,5 star rating,"We've stumbled on this location looking for an AYCE KBBQ when we were in LA and have made it our go to spot when we're craving KBBQ. Â We've talked about trying other spots but we have not had a bad experience at this place to risk experimenting with another place. Â This place is usually packed and will have a waiting list. Â The average wait time is usually 30-45 minutes but sometimes it can get to 90-105 minutes. Â Everyone in your party must be there in order for them to sit you when they call your name. Â With this place being an AYCE and not that many seating, the flow of people finishing up and people being seated is fairly quick. Â The staff here are very friendly and quick hard workers. Â They offer a good variety of meats here. Â Our favorite is the beef brisket, beef tongue, thin pork belly, squid, and more beef brisket lol. Â They only allow you to order a 3-4 different types of meat at a time with 1 order per meat type. Â My party would usually consist of 3-5 people but Â I would assume this would be different for bigger parties. Â When the employee brings out the meat, they will place it on the grill for you and come back time to time to move the meat around if you have not already done so. Â Sometimes we get caught up in our conversations that we forget to flip our meats. Â  We've never left this place unsatisfied. Â I would highly recommended this place if you have not yet tried it yet."
2/17/2019,5 star rating,"Worth the wait! Best Korean barbecue in the nation. Pork belly and beef belly were some of the best cuts of meat I've had. Amazing service, memorable experience."
7/2/2017,5 star rating,"I ate there around end of March with my sisters during our Spring Break Vacation. Also, we ate there around 9-10pm at night. We were recommended by our urber driver about this place as having the best Korean BBQ in LA. Let me tell you, after a long wait for our name to be call is 100% worth it. The food was absolutely amazing. The atmosphere is outstanding and more importantly the way they have iron pan to grill the food is fantastic. In the future and hopefully, we shall return for a second round. Highly recommended!"
1/5/2015,5 star rating,"Went there on a Friday night with a cousin. Parking was hard to find, so we opted for valet parking, which is only $2, so not a big deal. The place was crowded, but we got seated in about 20 minutes. As for the food we chose the all you can eat menu of 22 items for only $22.99, which is a pretty fantastic deal. Tried beef tongue, bulgogi, brisket, bbq squid, shrimp, pork belly, octopus, etc., but by far the bbq shrimp and beef tongue were the best selections. Make sure to save room for the kimchi rice they serve at the end!"
12/30/2014,4 star rating,"The wait: about 1.5 hours The parking situation: difficult, had to circle around a couple of times in the neighborhood to find parking The service: meh, it's okay.. they do come by the table frequently to see if we wanted more meat.. but they were also quite forgetful and missed some of our orders. Also, they were quite ""demanding"" (in a sense)... made us clean up our stone grill twice during our meal, so they can clean the grill with daikon (that was pretty cool!)The food: delicious Korean BBQ! Definitely see why there's a long wait and why it's so popular. I'm a fan of the thick pork belly and any type of beef that they had! Chicken and pork were less desirable for me. All the side dishes were great too, but they don't give you too many side dishes. Or maybe I'm just used to more. One of the main differences that I noticed is that they use a stone grill instead of your traditional grill.. I wonder what the difference is? Also you can end the meal with kimchi fried rice.. they cook it right on the grill (which is an awesome idea, especially since you've been grilling all night, so all the meat flavors are infused in your fried rice!)Bottomline: When in Koreatown and craving Korean AYCE BBQ, do strongly consider Hae Jang Chon. Yes, there's a long wait and the parking sucks, but you'll be a happy customer. Definitely way better than Korean BBQ places that I've had in the Bay Area."

8/26/2017,5 star rating,This place isn't even 5 stars it is 10/10 everything about this place is your dream Korean BBQ our server though was amazing his name was Min and holy crap he put up with me and my Husband that alone is a feat he's great the place is great I would always recommend to my friends to come and really enjoy some quality and authentic Korea BBQ!!!
9/28/2014,1 star rating,"DISappointing. I dont appreciate not being able to communicate about the price and what they charge. (losing your money here folks). Service? Not sure they understand that word. Food, I could live without. They left raw meat sitting on the table to be cooked, and there was no way we could eat the rest of the food. Very bad marinated beef. Watch out, they push the food and charge for food you DONT eat. Overall BAD."
10/13/2012,5 star rating,"This was the first time I cooked my meat on a clay surface. The clay surface imparted a unique texture to the meat. It did not taste better or worse than a grill but it was remarkably different. All the food tasted great. I loved the sauteed greens and the salad with a light sesame dressing. I especially enjoyed their potato salad because they put big chunks of apples in it. The apples really added bright notes to the overall flavor. The best part about Hae Jang Chon is the service. The staff is very attentive and quick when it comes to bringing you more food. Each table has a call light. If you press it, someone will come running. The parking out front is valet only. Thank goodness I took the metro rail."
6/26/2015,5 star rating,"By far one of the best Korean BBQ places I have ever been to. The usual $20 KBBQ Â places are always good but this is on another level. It's honestly worth the price. First thing that caught my attention was the ambience. Nice interior and has a calming feel to it. And their stone grills were a first for me. Never had a problem with burnt meat or it sticking to the grill which was very convenient. Hands down the best part of this place was the service The staff were very friendly and accomodating. They made sure we were taken care of whenever possible. We hardly had to do any work! They cooked for us and cleaned our grill without even needing to ask for it. They were very attentive as they always asked to refill our sides or to order meat when we were done. Only downside I can find for this place is their small parking lot which is valet only apparently. So if you don't want to pay for the valet you might spend some time looking around the neighborhood for parking, which could take awhile since it is LA.Other than that, excellent service, excellent food, excellent place to eat."
5/1/2016,5 star rating,"I've been trying new kbbq places for awhile, but every time i just get disappointed and then told myself i should've just went to gen. Gen taste more like mainstream kbbq, meaning the flavor of the meat caters to mostly everyone. But this place taste so authentic!! They use a stone grill, which i've never seen before at a kbbq place. (Wouldn't this be really hard to clean...), i think that's why it taste so good, is the grill.Even tho its an AYCE place, tables tend to flip pretty quickly, because the service is really good, they cook for you at the right pace that you'll be able to finish before the next batch of meat is cooked and they're all really friendly, don't look like they hate their lives at other ayce kbbq places.I loved all the small dishes too, taste kind of home made, and not mass produced (if that makes any sense). I can't really point out which meat is best, because all of them are really good, beef tongue is a must get though, brisket and marinated short rib are all delish.Parking is a pain in the ass, go find street parking, but have someone go put their name down first. Expecting to wait like atleast 2 hours during dinner time, so try to come early if you can."
11/25/2009,4 star rating,"Came here for my AYCE korean bbq fix when I was in town for the weekend. First thing we noticed was their large stone grill in the center of the table, that has grooves in it and is slanted so that the oil drains into a hole on one side of the grill. Â They start you off by preparing your grill with kimchi, pea sprouts, onions and all that stuff. Â We started off with a plate of brisket, galbi, bulgolgi, and bbq chicken.Maybe it's because of how the stone grill drains the oil away, but the brisket didn't have that crispy good texture to it that I've had at other places. Galbi was alright. Bulgolgi and bbq chicken were FANTASTIC. Â The flavors were delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about it).Service was good-- they always gave us extra rice papers and even eggs when asked for it. Maybe they wanted us to stop bothering them? Â Anyway, the meal ends with them scraping the grill and then making kimchi fried rice in it., which is pretty good. We were so full we couldn't finish it. Wanted to ask for a takeout box to take it home, but they wouldn't let us. Â Definitely a satisfying meal!"
3/1/2011,4 star rating,"A couple of buddies and I went to this place last Wednesday (2/23) and now is the first opportunity where I could write a review of this place. Â Here it is:WHAT WE ORDERED:This place is known for their AYCE and that is what we were there for, carne, carne and more carne! Â I was actually surprised as to the quality of the meat. Â We tried a little bit of everything (even the tripe and bbq squid) and just came back to the meat that used to oink and moo. Â The unmarinated cow meat (joo muh loke) was probably my favorite. Â The chunks were pretty sizeable and tender to say the least.I know that this place also has the kimchi pancake. Â Unfortunately, I was so busy with eating the meat that I overlooked it. Â But I'm sure that it was good, given how quickly it was gone! Their side dishes were decent. Â None of them stuck out so the point of me saying ""wow"".The kimchi fried rice at the end was pretty good. Â I was thinking that they would incorporate some meat into it, but it wasn't. Â They also give you a soup that goes well with the fried rice as well.WAIT STAFF:This place is very non-Korean friendly. Â Of all the tables that were there, a few of them were occupied by non-Koreans. Â The wait staff here speak English pretty well and without the accents either. Â Kudos to the management for hiring friendly, English speaking staff!The wait staff were also quick to clean the grills whenever we would get new plates of food. Â A definite plus!VERDICT:AYCE Korean BBQs in K-town have come a long way since the days of Manna and the every-other-second birthday songs that they used to blare on their speakers. Â I'm glad that I came to this place and would definitely go back,"

12/17/2017,5 star rating,"I eat here way too much. Korean BBQ has become my favorite dining experience this year and although I try new places often this place has the best selection of ""appetizers"" that they serve before the meat comes out and the absolute best bulgogi I've ever had. It's pricey at $28 a person but it's all you can eat. When I'm not that hungry I will go to another place that charges per item ordered, not AYCE. If you're trying KBBQ for the first time, this is definitely the place to go and to take others."

6/22/2017,4 star rating,"Their panchan (side dishes) is very high quality, especially the fish cakes. Their meat you can tell is high quality too. I definitely recommend their brisket and if you're feeling adventurous, you should try their beef tounge, best Korean beef tounge I've ever had, super tender and juicy! The only downside when we came in was their AC wasn't on. So it's a little stuffy. Otherwise, ive had a good experience here and would come back again"
11/15/2016,2 star rating,"Why does this place have so many reviews and stars? It is not good. The meat quality is terrible and the selection is so limited compared to the other ayce places around the area. Their banchan is mediocre and their steamed egg was salty. After a disappointing meal, I was at least looking forward to the fried rice at the end bc it's not easy to mess up fried rice but even that was flavorless. The only saving grace was our server who was attentive and hard working. However, service doesn't make the restaurant, the food does."
4/24/2014,2 star rating,"No idea why my friend said this is the best KBBQ place he ever tried. To break it down...PROS:- Wait time to get food was not so bad- Loved the round tables- Service was GOOD, which is RARE- Cheap valet, $2- I liked the saladCONS:- The make-or-break of any KBBQ place for me: beef brisket. Did not enjoy their dry, chewy brisket. This is the biggest con that knocked down my rating by two stars.- Steamed egg (which is usually a weakness my tummy has) was not good here. In fact, this place is the first one whose steamed egg was nasty. It was too salty.- Wait time to get in- The kimchi pancake was doughy. I may consider coming back here though. That's just based on the other reviews. Maybe I came here on bad day."

Servers actually assist with cooking. If I come on a good day/night there is little to no cooking on my part. The meats are quality and consistent cuts. Good price for variety. Besides beef, chicken, pork there are other options like tripe, squid, octopus. I love that they have radish paper to wrap meat in. Banchan is good, better than most places. If you save some room, you can get kimchi fried rice. I haven't disciplined myself to wait for it. Food is good, what else can I say :)"

The location has a mandatory valet that costs 2 dollars which I found more convenient than not. The host Jay was very good at keeping us in the loop about our place on the wait list. The food was well worth the wait! It's way better than Gen and the quality is better as well . Our server was fast & efficient, I never felt like he forgot us & they don't rush you at all .

Really as good as any of the all you can eat places in ktown that I have found. (Ala Carte places are NOT included in this comment.) The problem is that it is a pain in the rear to actually eat here. Parking sucks. We had a reservation but waited :50 minutes past our time to get in. They are militant about you needing to be on time, everyone there etc... but don't seem to really value your time or planning. It seems like they are busy enough to not really care. I don't like that."
4/21/2014,1 star rating,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service.wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, I'd probably never go back. It all started when the host ignored me as I patiently waited to ask him about the current wait. I wanted to ask how many were in front of my party, but he kept walking, didn't stop to answer my question, and gave me a one word answer. He then comes out calling my name, only to find out that he's just calling allthe names to see who is present. He didn't explain that, however, and he rudely kept reading names as my whole party eagerly thought we were about to get seated.When he finally seated us, he THROWS a menu onto the bench, as if he couldn't wait to hand us our menus after we got seated. If I was a restaurant manager, I'd fire him immediately. Why does he even work there if he hates it so much?The food was normal korean BBQ, not great, not horrible. I honestly wouldn't make a trip back because of the wait, poor service, and poor parking lot."

I no longer consider this restaurant as a good authentic kbbq restaurant. The meats were just mediocre. Not delicious, but not disgusting.

Large Hite $6.50!And Daen jang and kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal... for your ""dessert"" haha.Good fast service. Valet parking and street available if you can find it.If you're a party of 4 or more, I recommend making reservations during the week. I don't think they take reservations during the weekend so be prepare to wait if you go during rush eating hour. Make sure your whole party is there when you are called up."
6/6/2017,5 star rating,"I came here with my friends and it was such a good experience! This place has excellent quality meat as well as good service! They and fast and efficient about bringing us meat, and are very attentive which I appreciated. Their side dishes are amazing as well. The prices are decent too (~22 dollars for lunch and ~24 for dinner) Would definitely come again with my family."
5/13/2011,4 star rating,"Really good korean bbq. It's all you can eat deliciousness. Went there for a friends bday and they play a loud ass song for the bday person. LOUD but it's fun. The only bad thing about this place is the wait. Like dude, me hungry NOW. Me want to eat good food NOW. It's worth the wait though. I would advise not to go late at night and not to go with big parties or else you will be waiting FOREVER. You have to go at some in between time like at 4p to not have to wait...but I haven't tried that yet so who really knows...that place might just be packed ALL DAY LONG. Parking kinda sucks...but that's what the street is for."
10/3/2011,5 star rating,"I haven't had ""good"" Korean BBQ until I came here! My sister said this is the spot to go since its all you can eat and its open LATE! Coming on a Friday night, I'd thought we'd never get seated since there was a 15 minute line just to park/valet your car! Well, we ended up waiting for a total of 2 hours! 1 hour of it was spent at the bar next door to it.Once we finally got seated (10:45 pm), we ordered our first round of meats and Hite beer. Just to keep this review short and simple, all of the meats, especially the pork belly, were OFF THE HOOK! Some people might think we're crazy for waiting this long to eat, but it was well worth the wait! Every time our heated stone thingy got crusty or dirty looking, some one would come by and clean it and help us cook whatever meat we had left. Basically nobody was talking since we were all stuffing our faces! SOOOO good...I love me some all you can eat Korean BBQ! All the staff was very friendly, even though it was mayhem in there!"
10/17/2016,2 star rating,I found a dead fly in the side salad Â no apology from the manager or even a discount. All I got was a nasty little friend for my bday. Â Gross... Â overall food was good and prices is reasonable but the table was to small for our party.
6/5/2017,1 star rating,I came from Valencia to dine with my friends at this place. Our reservation was at 8:30. We came at 9:45 because of traffic. The host guy who in charge with seating was rude and gave us our table to other people. He spoke very rude to us saying that this is not his problem that we came from a very far place and not getting the table. Very bad in their services and how to speak with their customers
4/11/2014,5 star rating,"This is the KBBQ restaurant I always take out of town guests to when they visit. Â My first visit was because of a recommendation from a long-time local and everyone I know who frequents ktown would rank this as one of the best. Â Everything I've had here has been very good and the price for AYCE is very reasonable. Â I know other yelpers have complained about the quality of the meats but in all of my experiences the meat has been just as good if not better than other ktown establishments I've been to. Â The service has always been good here and the kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal is a treat. Â They are also very good about refilling side dishes which is one of my favorite parts about getting KBBQ. The wait most nights is kind of insane and although it's good, I always try to avoid their dinner rush which seems to run from about 7-10pm Â Valet parking is only $2 and there are other bars and a hookah lounge in the same plaza if you want to spend more time in the area without having to re park your car."
4/28/2014,1 star rating,"This place confuses me. Its the first KBBQ place that I have been to that I haven't liked. FIrst - they were super rude and seated people who came after us and didn't even bother to explain when we pointed it out.The meat was low quality. Sorry to be gross, but when you're spitting more into your napkin because you can't chew it than swallowing, there's something wrong. Go somewhere else."
10/9/2012,4 star rating,"One thing i'm always admire hae jang chon It's just because theirs have a greatest service kbbq AYCE in ktown. However, food is okay but not the best as service.Service - 3.7 starsClean - 2.3 starsParking - 1.1 stars Ban chan - 2.5 starsquality of meat - 2.3 stars"

They gave us our food n cook it as well . Cheap place . Great place to eat . Like the fact that they close soo later , that's awesome !"
3/20/2014,4 star rating,"Came here on a Wed. night at about 9:30pm and we had to wait about 20-30 min. to get seated. The place is pretty small compared to other kbbq places in LA.It was about $18 per person for AYCE. Includes the usual meats like brisket, pork belly, and bulgogi (about the only meats I eat hehe) kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice.The meat was pretty good quality considering its AYCE, it wasnt superrr amazing though. the kimchi fried rice was really good though. they cook it for you at the end of your meal!What really gave this place 4 stars is their service. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. Considering all the kbbq places I've been to in LA, the waiters are usually never around and really indifferent. For this place, we never had to ring the bell or ask for our waiter once. He also did most of the cooking for us.Anyways, overall pretty good place to get AYCE! btw, parking is valet ($2)"
5/24/2014,5 star rating,"Average wait will always be 45 mins minimally if you go at and anytime after dinner time (all the way till before closing). Even with a reservation, still count on a nice long wait for you to already run out of conversations with your friends. That's what you get for wanting a cheap AYCE kbbq. Everyone, do the right thing - order kalbi, brisket, beef tongue, and pork belly thick or thin. Dont be a noob by ordering rice. They give you kimchee fried rice at the end anyway so do what you must to eat your moneys worth. We ate for 3 hrs and the server didnt know to be flustered or amused. Overally, greattt korean bbq, dont miss out - it is worth the wait."
5/30/2017,2 star rating,"This used to be my usual go to kbbq spot. Until they rejected to seat us Saturday Night after a table was already set for us. Last call was at 1:15AM ( they close at 2am), as hostess explained, the time was 1:12AM. A table was ready for us, hostess also mentioned we only get 1 order ( 3 plates), we were headed to our table to be seated, we knew it was a stretch but we then requested if we can make at least 2 orders, since we'd kill the first round. She went to check with manager or owner, the owner then told us ""we're close, no more"" and then rejected us. Â We woulda have been okay with the 1 order, but instead they retracted from seating us. The hostess should have openly admitted to owner/manager that she accepted to seat us already, instead she stood quiet. It was upsetting, we just paid for parking, parking guy should also be aware of notice."
7/27/2015,5 star rating,"Good service! Must try beef tongue and rib. Suggest to avoid the dinner time, go early or late, or waiting may take u about 1 hour."
4/8/2017,4 star rating,"Never tried this type of korean bbq. It was different from our typical Bay area style korean. They brought out eggs that would cook on the side of the cooking pot/bowl. That was new to me. It was good though besides not having my anchovies, cuz that is a must for me. We made this pit stop on our way back to sf and it was pretty busy on a weekday. It must be a popular place."
4/8/2017,4 star rating,This is a solid Kbbq spot. Being a lover of all things kbbq it definitely satisfied my craving. My husband and I are visiting Cali and tried this since it got solid reviews. Like any Kbbq come hungry to get your money's worth. The kimichi pancake is a must try. Meat was delicious. Service was friendly and quick. Valet is 2bucks. Finish all the meat there is a charge if you don't :-/. But we had no problem with that!
2/11/2014,4 star rating,"I am a vegetarian. I just had to say that outright first! I went for a celebration with friends but I still had a good time and some good food! I saw another Yelper mention they had a vegan in their group and the waiter brought a bibimbap for them to eat. And you know what, that's what I did and that's what I got! I was happy I had food other than the ban chan to eat! Even though I probably would have been happy with just ban chan. The bibimbap was delicious! $17.99 delicious idk, but I was just glad I could eat something.They help you cook and clean the grill often! Which is nice!"
2/20/2019,5 star rating,"All you can eat!!! No rush, good service. Long wait though be ready to wait 30 to 45 mins at time. Valet parking only its $2. Enjoy!"
8/30/2015,5 star rating,"WOW!!!!!! Through and through before we even got in the restaurant while waiting for a table, service was noticeably helpful, attentive and courteous! Food is amazing, flavorful and plentiful. Service is so great!! This place is hands down far ahead of the competition!!!!!"
8/30/2015,5 star rating,"BEST SERVICE EVER. Not once did we have to ask for a refill on any side or water. The meat is better quality than other AYCE. Good quality food, decent price (21.99), and splendid service. Love this place! Worth the wait."
8/30/2015,4 star rating,"This place usually has an hour wait even if you get there at 10pm at night. Its seriously that popular. The place is good and it has amazing customer service as the waiters are always helping you cook your food (probably wanting you to get out of there as soon as possible, but you never feel rushed). The best part is at the end"
8/30/2015,4 star rating,I have late dinner tonight no longer for waiting the line I love this place everything is awesome service good
8/27/2015,5 star rating,"I've converted. No more $12 AYCE KBBQ for me from now on! (I say that but realistically I'm a college student paying rent.. so...)=SERVICE=Walking into Hae Jang Chon, I knew almost immediately that I had to write a Yelp review and give this place 5 stars. The staff was attentive and courteous; they smile at you and actually try to have a conversation with you. This never happens at any other KBBQ restaurant that I have tried. Not once did I have to flag a server down either. They come by routinely to make sure you're not overcooking your meat and will actually cook it for you. When they do this, they refill your sides and water too!=MEAT=We ordered almost everything on the menu. Squid was good, but you can honestly skimp on the seafood. Brisket came out fresh, not frozen, which was a plus. Thinly cut pork belly was something new to me; I'm not a pork belly fan so having it thinly cut made it much easier to chew and stomach. Spicy bbq pork was a disappointment for me; I honestly don't remember much of it and this makes me sad because I usually love spicy pork. Hands down the best meats at Hae Jang Chon though are marinated short ribs and bulgogi! Get this and never turn back!At the end of the meal, they cook kimchi fried rice for you right on the grill! The concept itself was cool... but the rice was too sour for me. Definitely a disappointment because I'm a huge fan of kimchi fried rice.Overall, I would definitely come back to Hae Jang Chon just for the service alone. If there was an emoji I could use to describe my experience, it would be the tears-streaming-down-your-face emoji for all the tears I cried out of joy. Highly recommend.TIP: HJC will probably always have a wait. You'll wait a lot less if you come in Monday-Thursday and avoid rush hour times. We came in on a Wednesday night at 10PM and only waited 20 minutes for a party of four!"
8/27/2015,5 star rating,"Now THIS is what I call all you can eat KBBQ! My friend took me here and I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing the meats/seafood was. The service was impeccable and I love that everyone came by to help cut up and watch over the meat on the grill. When I go to a KBBQ spot, I enjoy the sides more than the protein. This place was no different. ALL of the sides were bomb. Their pancake though?? It took the cake (no pun intended hehe). It was SOOO GOOD. So was their kimchi.Overall, a great place that I'll certainly be returning back to."
8/26/2015,5 star rating,"This place made me very happy today. It was a 45 minute wait to get seated, but it's always this busy... It insures that it's worth it. It's super busy, but the staff always seemed to be on top of it, and very prompt to assist. Never waited longer than a couple of minutes for refills on anything. Environment is very fast, loud and full of life, it actually adds a bit of spice and entertainment to the place. It's a one price for all type of deal and I love it, it gave us an opportunity to try the different meats. The BBQ squid was my favorite. Sides are what you would get anywhere else, they do however have this pancake that I tried for the first time, it wasn't too bad actually. I had a great time and I left with a happy stomach. I will definitely be back."
8/25/2015,5 star rating,Best Korean bbq I've been to so far! The customer service is amazing. I love that they frequently checked up on us and they practically cooked the meat for us. We really got to enjoy eating more than cooking. The meat was great especially the marinated ones
8/25/2015,5 star rating,"I was around Koreatown and wanted to get some AYCE Korean bbq for lunch and stumbled upon this place after searching through yelp. It was $19.99 per person during lunch hours and $21.99 for dinner. Visiting from the Bay Area, that is a really good price for AYCE kbbq. Parking was fairly easy, did not have to pay $3 for valet. Right when I walked in during lunch hours on a Wednesday, I was quickly seated with my boyfriend. Just like every Korean restaurant there were a lot of side dishes and they were amazingly delicious! The fish cake was my favorite! There was also a side of salad with a light dressing. The menu was simple and had an okay amount of meat selections. For each round, there was a limit on only ordering 4 meats at a time to avoid wasting any food or there was a charge of an extra $15. The staff was very friendly and they helped us cook our food in front of us. While we were eating, they would come by very often to check on our food so that it didn't burn and told us when they were ready to eat! Personally, we mostly like to eat beef so we ordered several rounds of the bulgogi and marinated short ribs. The thin pork belly was also really good.I will definitely come back when I'm in the area."
8/24/2015,5 star rating,"I looked on Yelp for a good AYCE KBBQ place in Koreatown before picking up my friend and this is probably the best KBBQ I've had so far! My family arrived at restaurant around 2:00 PM on Sunday and there were about 5 groups of people waiting before us. The wait was about 30 minutes, considered to be pretty short for an AYCE place.For the first round of meat, we ordered the beef brisket, bulgogi, beef tongue, and BBQ chicken. The restaurant was so generous with their meat and gave us A BUNCH of brisket and tongue. After cooking, the beef tongue was SO TENDER and the fat and lean meat of the brisket was evenly proportioned! oh my god. I have never been so content with my life. I was so deprived of all you can eat KBBQ ever since I got back from vacation and eating here definitely made up all the times I missed out on. The kimchi pancake did not disappoint either! We ordered more brisket, thinly sliced pork belly, squid, shrimp, and small octopus. The steamed egg and bean paste soup were really good too! I also love how the workers check up on you every once in awhile to make sure we're not overcooking the meat!We finished the visit with the kimchi fried rice. The sesame oil on the dried seaweed added in the gochu paste, kimchi, and rice was the perfect ending to our meal.Lunch is $18 or 19 and is from opening till 3 PM.Dinner is $21.99 (w/o tax & tip) and is any time after 3 PM.OVERALL: Will definitely come back here when I'm in the area! One of my top KBBQ place now!"
4/1/2015,4 star rating,"Quick service, good food. Marinated meats are a little too sweet for my taste. I like the marinated squid. Some time especially busy time, it is hard to ask for thing cause the server walk so fast. And about closing time server take turn to come and ask twice or three times of the same thing. Thats pissed my friend off. Overall it a nice BBQ place and open untill 2( sometime close early)"
5/23/2015,5 star rating,It was absolutely amazing! Great food and atmosphere! It was my first time top the place and I would definitely go back again! It requires having two people to eat but who would be able to eat here alone with as much as you get! Â Definitely be sure to not over order and to try a couple things I enjoy the cooking and our server did come back and help us continually with the cooking!

10/17/2018,3 star rating,"I've been to this location many times. It was one of my favorite places to get AYCE Kbbq until tonight. I don't know what happened but our server was in a terrible mood. No ""hello"" or ""have you been here before"" greeting that I usually get. He went straight to asking what we wanted to drink which was great but damn...he didn't need to be so rude and sarcastic. We literally just sat there and he had an attitude. Maybe he's having a bad shift? But that's no excuse. Me and my coworkers (we were a group of 8) just came from a long 12 hour shift and we know what it's like to have a bad day at work, but we don't take it out on our patients. Basically he just had terrible customer service. We thought we made him upset but he looked upset with all the other tables he served. A couple of my coworkers have never had Korean bbq so that was already a bad experience for them. It was bad to the point where our charge nurse felt traumatized and was scared to ask him for more salad. Now, that's just sad! Luckily, the manager came and intervened from time to time to make sure our table was ok. If she didn't come, I probably wouldn't go back. But since this was a weird one time bad experience, I'll let it go and give the place another shot because the food was bomb. Service was just lacking today. Hopefully, today really was just a freak one time experience."
2/4/2014,5 star rating,"this is my new favorite ayce kbbq place. i was afraid it'd be super young vibe, playing clubbing music, people getting drunk, and them playing that ANNOYING birthday song every hour on the dot. (oh gawd i hate those places...is anyone with me here?!) it was surprisingly a very laid back family like environment (at least on a tuesday night...). they take reservations, which is a plus bc not all kbbq places do. and they weren't blaring clubbing music. and i didn't even hear the birthday song at all! hooray!i like the grill they use. their service is amazing. so friendly, and they pretty much do all of the flipping and cutting of the meat for you. the meat was good quality and lots of choices. and the kimchi fried rice in the end...umm how can you not even with a belly bursting of meat?? they have everything you need with your kbbq (dwen jang jjigae, steamed egg, etc) and it was mighty tasty. A+ in my book!"

1/7/2014,5 star rating,"I am a dorky white chick from the suburbs but I've lived in K-town a few years now and have been to many of the popular KBBQ joints...I certainly don't claim to be an expert but Hae Jang Chon is by far and away my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant, especially for All You Can Eat (AYCE). As far as I am concerned, this spot has the best meat and the best side dishes (I also love their sauces). Â The meals come with kimchi fried rice and Korean pancakes, too. The price is right and the service is good (considering it's a Korean spot and interaction is pretty sparse). It's always slammed here: most nights, plan on putting your name down and waiting for an hour or more. I think it's worth it, though. This is a great spot for groups and the ambiance is perfect for a casual, fun Korean BBQ dining experience. Â It's smokey in there, but damn gurl, you know you gonna be smellin' like meat all night if you get Korean BBQ ANYWHERE.Highly recommend!"
5/20/2015,5 star rating,"My favorite kbbq place. I don't mind the almost 3 hour waits sometimes, because the food is that good and very decently priced!They only have one menu, but it includes shrimp.Valet is even good.When they are super busy the kitchen will take a little longer to bring out your food. But even ten the wait isn't long. A must try."
12/1/2018,5 star rating,amazing service not just by our waiter but the entire staff. even when he was busy attending to his other tables if any other staff saw that i was trying to flip the meat around on the stone they would jump right in and do it for me. i had asked a random sever for a refill of water and after she did she flipped our meat without hesitating. another random server asked if we needed more food and placed the order for Â us. i love how everyone can do everything. it makes the entire experience so much more enjoyable. thanks for the amazing service and i love that beef belly.
3/28/2014,4 star rating,"Long wait for a party of 5 . But it is totally worth the wait ! This is my first time visiting this place from San Francisco ! Compare to SF , LA for sure have the most ""worth it "" food . Reasonable price with great amount of food . $18 per person , all you can you eat ! What ? Â That is pretty crazy , down in sf japan town , it is $25 all you can eat exclude tax and tips . But $18? I'm like ... Amazed ! There's 20 choices from the menu here and the food and service is great ! The waitress will keep coming to you and ask if we need more meat . The meat are fresh and the environment is clean ! Good for even a party or gathering . Will definitely come Â again when I visit LA again !!!"
12/18/2013,5 star rating,"I'm going to write a review about this place, but it almost seems like I'm just doing it to increase the review count so people know how good this place is. Â I'm so glad to have made it out to K-Town for K-BBQ after SO MANY dinners in Westminster. Â The meat was great and the sides were surprisingly better. Â The fish cake was delightfully spicy. Â The spinach still had great texture. Â I think the oil was more flavorful than I'm used to. Â On the down side, the egg pot was watery. Â Moon BBQ's egg pot is the best I've had so far. Â I'm also confused by the Kimchee fried rice. Â All the pics I've seen on Â yelp show half of the grill covered in rice. Â When we went it was maybe about 2 cups. Â I guess it doesn't matter since at that point we were so full we could only pick at it. Â HOWEVER... the kimchee fried rice was.... not... good.. :'( Â I was severely disappointed. Â Way too salty, way to strong of seaweed flavor, even too much Kimchee. Â End of the meal people... it needs to be lighter. Â Not sure if we got a bad mix or something, but it made me sad. Â Also, why can't we get it early on in the meal?!?! Â They clean off the grill for the rice anyway. Â On the plus side they do it right at the table and its fun to watch.Parking and traffic is a nightmare. Â We parked on 6th on the street, I'd stay away from the actual parking lot. Guess I did have alot to say! Â Oops."
3/20/2012,4 star rating,"Came here recently for a friends birthday party. We had to wait outside for about 40 minutes before we were seated because it was so crowded. Â There were at least 25-30 people waiting outside as well. Â The wait was unbearable because of the smell of KBBQ and Kyochon filling my nose.After we were seated, we ordered immediately and received the food in a timely fashion. Â Their chadol was some of the best that I've ever tasted at any KBBQ restaurant. Â Their tongue was not too chewy which is how I like it. Their thinly sliced sam gyup sal was definitely something new for me and it was great! Everything I tried was delicious.After each plate of food you cook, the waitresses clean the grill for you instead of replacing it. It was quite different from what I was used to, but it was fine. Â I would definitely come again."
3/29/2012,5 star rating,"It's a place where I feel my appetite was rewarded. Â The price is the typical K-town Korean BBQ rates at 16.99 all you can eat. I would recommend the following meats: // Briskets (request double meat).// Tounge (I know you're probably thinking eeew, but seriously it taste closely similar to brisket). Its really smooth and not chewie at all.// Pork Belly (you could order the thin or thick slices)// Short Rib (marinated or unmarinated) It is by far my fav.// BBQ Pork (Cooked inside a tin foil for 20+ min)Typically the staff were nice. On the weekend night, the wait can last average around 45 min. But it's all worth it."
12/30/2014,5 star rating,"I can't believe I've never written a review for this place. I'm here at least once a month and anytime we have an out of towner visiting. Reasons why I love this place;-Good quality meat (Thick pork belly, BEEF TONGUE, marinated kalbi, & pork shoulder are my favorite)-Great banchan -Service is pretty good. Could get spotty on the busier nights but thats to be expected at any restaurant, right?-Cheap! I think it's only $22 per person for AYCEReasons why I hate this place;-The wait-The parking situation Still my favorite place for AYCE bbq in LA though!"
7/12/2017,5 star rating,I have been to many Korean barbecue spots by far this is on my top three. Yes the wait is long but with good friends and good food it's all worth it. They have excellent service and food was delicious. Will I come back? Yes I will..
5/15/2017,1 star rating,I didn't like this place at all. They let you pick three items at first but after that it's only one item at a time.Quality of meats are not that great Â and there were only two servers for the almost packed restaurant. Hard to get attention and felt like we were rushed. I would prefer Star BBQ over this place.
1/15/2016,5 star rating,"In the heart of Ktown my cousins, aunt and I stopped here after a day of Korean beauty shopping at the Ktown mall. This place was one of the best kbbq experiences I've ever had! Every thing was fresh especially the tender baby octopi and the service was on point. There were many appetizers not just a handful like most kbbq joints. I would def come back again. Only complaint would be that the parking lot was packed. But that's always a good sign that the food is good!"
3/23/2017,3 star rating,"I would say the meat is average here, had to hit the restroom right after my dinning there. The service is friendly and attentive, but the meat is questionable."
12/6/2010,5 star rating,"Kimchi Fried Rice !!One of the BEST KOREAN AYCE BBQ EVER !! For $16.99 and 19 pieces of meat to choose from.. belly bloating waiting to happen, but well worth it. I've always ordered the usual Galbi, Beef Brisket, Pork Shoulder and Spicy chicken. I also ordered the hot dog but that's all it is, a normal oscar meyer hotdog, I'd figure they would wrap it with bacon or some delicious brisket but no.. just a hot dog, I'd stay away from it unless you really like hotdogs.Overall food is good, great stone skillet where you grill the meats, they also add bindaeduk and kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal. Soup is also served hot right on the grill. Venue is a bit small compared to Mannas or Road to Seoul, but the quality of food and service is much better than the rest. Â They also close at 2am I believe so if you're craving this at that time. Perfect place to come. Wait is long all the time, so arrive early or late late at night. Â Valet parking is also offered at $2 in the squished parking lot. Great Korean BBQ !!"
4/1/2014,5 star rating,"Best Korean BBQ AYCE? I think yes! The quality of meat was great and some of the best I've tasted. The bulgogi and brisket were fantastic, but I loved the marinated beef short ribs. They were so tender, juicy, and flavorful. Many people don't favor the stone pan, but I loved it. It cooked the meats more evenly and it was more forgiving in terms of accidentally charring the meat. Â There weren't that many side dishes, but I didn't even care because the focus was on the meats. The items that they did have were my favorites: the steamed egg, fish cakes, kimchi, bean sprouts, and potato salad. They also have the obligatory daikon and rice paper with salad. They had four different dipping sauces - I really liked the sesame and sweet garlic in addition to the bean paste and chili sauce. Later in the meal, they brought out the kimchi pancakes, which were grilled on the pan. Save the best for last because the end of the meal was topped off with kimchi fried rice, prepared tableside. The stone pan was perfect for crisping the bottom of the rice a la stone pot style. The service was excellent! We were checked on regularly and the servers took over cooking the food at times. There was no wait at midday on a weekday and valet parking was free (aside from tip). For such high quality meats and great service, $18 for AYCE KBBQ is well worth it. I was pleased and couldn't ask for more."
5/11/2015,4 star rating,"This is my boyfriend's kbbq spot due to the price, quality of meat, and banchan. I'm definitely a fan of this place as well, the meat is good and service is awesome. They offer a lot of different kinds of meat. Can't really complain about anything except that the restaurant is pretty small. We go often for lunch and dinner. It gets busy around 1pm for lunch rush, and then from 7-10pm for dinner. Be prepared to wait for dinner!!"
5/9/2017,4 star rating,"$2 valet parking fee plus tip. Not much parking available most of the time. Long wait, no reservation, good food, great service. We came on a monday night around 745pm and there was a 30 minutes wait. I brought a cake for a surprise for bro's bday and left it w the host. We sat in the corner booth w the uncomfortable booth (too wide). Our servers were the older lady w short hair who was fast, effective and great and the guy on training on his first day which was great, friebdly and effective too. He was doing a great job for his first day. Food was great. Ok amount of noise. At the end our meal i was hoping they'd bring my bro's cake as a surprise but the lady kind of accidentally came to our table and ruined the surprise by saying ""you have a birthday here right? U were the one who brought the cake?"" Lol .... surprise fail. My bro was on the table, but whatever...she was still great and the trainee was great. We even gave them a piece of cake each....good times, good ambience and good food."

5/8/2015,4 star rating,"I took my boyfriend here for Valentine's Day (I know, I know, what better way to show you love someone than taking them to stuff themselves with delicious KBBQ?). This place definitely didn't disappoint. Food - For $21.99, you get a nice selection of meet, seafood, and sides that you can order from. The marinated short ribs, brisket, and kimchi pancakes were my favorite! The seafood selection could definitely be a bit better, but the meat and side dishes were on point.Service - Talk about attentive! One person would check on your food for a quick second and leave, and then immediately ANOTHER person would be there right after checking on your food again. Â They're all EXTREMELY nice, and super friendly. The service alone definitely makes them stand out from all the rest.Cleanliness - The service and the food were remarkably clean. The stone bowls were wiped clean using radishes (which I loved), and the meats always looked fresh.Overall, I would definitely go back again!"
5/8/2015,5 star rating,"I haven't been to too many kbbq places, but of the ones I have been to, this one is my favorite!Great quality meat and all the extras and sauces are just delicious! Well worth the $21.99. The place looks nice inside and all the servers are very nice and attentive. I also like how they clean the hot plate with radishes instead of just bringing a new one like most places. Definitely recommended!"
7/4/2015,1 star rating,Came by this place Â 7/2/15 food and service not impress at all. Sat down with Â few friends I felt that we were rush out of the table. Couldn't enjoy the time while we were there when the waiter kept coming by every freaking 5minutes asking if we were done eating. What fuck can we at least digest what we eat first yes it was pack in the restaurant but there other people before us and they didn't harassThem to hurry and eat. So I m taking my Business somewhere else It's not worth it and at the end we still gave good tip I wish I took that back. Food and services SHITTY.
5/6/2017,5 star rating,Yummy food!!!! And the awesome kimchi fried rice at the end was amazing!!! Went for lunch because I heard the dinner was too long. Will come back when I return back to LA.
8/11/2014,4 star rating,"My friends and I were really hungry after going through a whole day with only breakfast. Although more expensive for a KBBQ place in LA, $18.99 for AYCE was an incredibly good deal considering all the great options they had of meats and even other side options! We were completely satisfied with the food and the service. The waiters and waitresses constantly checked around to see if we needed anything, helped us cook the meat, and cleaned the stone grill frequently."
11/25/2018,5 star rating,RION is the homie. He's one of the best servers ever. I've been to nearly all popular kbbq restaurants in LA County and I've never had such impeccable customer service. He got us everything we needed to make our experience enjoyable. It was also Thanksgiving and RION took such great care of my family. His suggestions were on point. You guys should definitely try the beef tongue here.
3/13/2017,1 star rating,"This review is about their service. Â We didn't get to eat, and left pretty pissed off. Â I made reservations for 15 people. Â You know how that goes, people usually flake last minute so we were 9. Â 8 of us were there and they would not sit us. Â They said because the last person was not there we would take too long to leave?? Â Really? Â Honestly, once you're full you're full. Â It's such BS!!! Â And, why should we be rushed with our dinner anyway? Â I get it, that they get busy but so what?? Â They could have sat the 8 of us that were there, ordered drinks till our friend got there. Â We all got pissed off and went down to street to Moodaepo on 7th. Â Had a great time there and they were busy but sat us within 15min of arriving. Â Shame on you Hae Jang Chon!"
4/3/2014,3 star rating,"The low down: really rude service but good k BBQ. The waitress snatched the scissors from our hands to cut meat, stood right next to me without saying excuse me to clean the grill, and spilled raw meat juices on me. Really gross. Just bad service.  Â  The meats and accompaniments were good.  Â Maybe next time I will go earlier so the waiters and waitresses aren't so tired and grumpy."
12/23/2018,4 star rating,"We came here with my friends, group of 8. The table was slightly tight but service was relatively quick. The food was excellent. We enjoyed food and conversation. One thing is that the background music was a little loud. It was difficult to talk to the person who sits in front of me. Overall it was a great dining experience! Loved it."
11/27/2011,5 star rating,"This is my all time favorite AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant in Los Angeles. Â They have a variety of meat including tripe, gopchang, and a thin pork belly that are often not included in other AYCE menus. Â They also serve kimchee and the bean sprouts directly on the grill. Â In addition, they give you a korean kimchee pancake as an additional banchan. Â The banchan is not the greatest here, but we all know we aren't at an AYCE place for the banchan.After eating your fill of meat they make a kimchee fried rice. Â This rice is delicious! Â I know it's insane to think you'll have any space left to eat anything else but you're going to have to. Â Kimchee fried rice and daejangchiggae at the very end after gorging on endless amounts of meat at Hae Jang Chon will always turn out delicious."
10/16/2012,4 star rating,"After reading reviews perhaps I was expecting more? Â In any case, maybe it is a3.5.Came here and the small mall parking was CRAZY. Â Luckily, they have valet where these Mexican guys can shuffle your cars around to make space. Â You can leave your car fast, so that you can spend the time waiting for your table.As expected the side dishes were great. Â They start you on that first and takes a while to get you your meat so you will full up on the sides. Â I didn't mind, as I didn't want to just be a pure ravenous carnivore but for those who came for red meat only, take that as a warning on their tricks.The meat was so-so (or maybe it's because I'm spoiled making my own marinated kalbi and firing them up on my grill). Â The meat was tougher than I expectedand tasted ""gamey."" Â I ordered marinated kalbi and I had to confirm that it was marinated because it looked virtually un-marinated. Oh well. Â They also start your food on a hot plate with fatty pieces of meat or something to get it greased up, but expect you to eat it. Â Not being wasteful, I had to spend time removing the adipose tissue from my meat. Â Bulgogi was pretty decent. Â We had octopus (as I never had it before) and it went well with the grill.Service was pretty good--except for the trick they pull to full you up on sides.However, overall I measure by the kalbi and that was so-so in my opinion...."
10/15/2014,3 star rating,"Aside from the poor customer service that every other review talks about (inability of servers to do anything other than take your order and anger if you try to cook your own food), the food itself--if you like to eat all types of animals--is decent quality. Yes, you can still see some fat, but very little unlike other experiences I have had with Korean bbq. However, coming from a place of not only wanting decent food but wanting a good experience, I left here not wanting to come back. In short, you pay $22 plus tax and tip for all you can eat, which is great if you have the appetite for eating pure protein for 90% of your meal and a lot of it; I think this was the final nail in the coffin to make me realize I'm simply not a meat and no potatoes type of girl. You have your choice of many types of meats from beef tongue and intestines to octopus and squid, and they don't skimp on the servings by any means--in fact, if you think you want to try more than your first round of four items, I recommend you make it very clear to them that you want half a serving for your first round, especially if you've eaten the steamed egg and rice wrap and other appetizer items the preceded the meat. Our first round came out, and it was enough to fill me up and then some; in fact, keeping in mind the $15 surcharge for leaving meat on the plate, I felt sick trying to finish off the bbq pork that was overseasoned and had started to burn on the grill... They don't give you a plate upon which to put your cooked meat, and censure you if you touch the knob on the grill. Bottom line: Ready to eat meat and lots of it? Go! Don't bring your carb-loving friends. Oh, and like some others said, you will NOT get the kimchi fried rice at the end unless you ask."
6/26/2017,5 star rating,"MY STANDARD FOR KOREAN BBQ. Coming from the bay area (where good and decently priced kbbq is almost nonexistent), I never leave without getting some legit korean bbq when visiting LA, especially in Koreatown. This particular visit, I went in around 1pm on a Saturday and got seated only after 10 minutes. Our server was named Yerin who went above and beyond to serve us making sure we got the bang out of our buck. She gave us an additional side dish that wouldn't usually come with the order and made sure that we would try the fried rice at the end of our meal even after stuffing ourselves to our limit.The amount of food we ate would have totaled to be about $80 for 2 people in any norcal korean restaurant (with very limited meat) but we grubbed happily at a total price of $59 (unlimited meat!!) at hae jang chon. I came out of the restaurant feeling 200% full with #noregrats. Thank Yerin unnie!!"
12/10/2016,4 star rating,"This is one of the best Korean barbecue joints I've been to and I've been to a lot. Not a large place. If it can seat 70 though. Heart of KTown proper. Beat to know Korean at this one, which is the only reason it gets 4/5 stars. Some things get lost in translation. Other than that always go for the AYCE."
3/19/2012,4 star rating,Best chadol I've ever had. But I like the unmarinated galbi from Gui Il Bun Ji better.As for service--they really try but it's never really there.The novelty kimchi fried rice is interesting but would have preferred it in the beginning. I understand they didn't want to get the kimchi taste on the grill and contaminate the meat flavor so that's why it's just novelty.

3/6/2015,4 star rating,The food is so yummy and good price for korean BBQ. The portions are huge and the short ribs were a fat slab of meat. The only thing I didn't like was if you didn't hear your name called they skipped you so everyone's smothered around the door and bring with a person in a wheelchair it was hard to maneuver close to the door Â yee
11/7/2011,4 star rating,"Came here with family for AYCE lunch. Â Take note that while they open at 11am, they wont seat you until they've prepped things. Â Basically, they dont open until after 1130am. Â Place fills up by 1pm on a Thursday afternoon.Meat quality is great and aren't over marinaded. Â I would suggest the angus brisket and the short ribs. Â These were the two best meats I tried. Â The bulgogi is above average and so is the pork belly. Â The squid is good if you like squid. Â Side dishes are good, but I began to ignore them once the meat was ready. Â I really enjoyed having the option of both the sliced radish and the rice sheets to condiment the meat.Service is very attentive and their attitude is great. Â Be sure to save room for the kimchi fried rice at the end!"
1/20/2017,5 star rating,"Came here on a Tuesday night with a party of 11, made a reservation before hand. There is a large selection of meat, the quality is great and fresh, and service was good - they checked up on us often and brought us what we ordered quickly. There is a rule that you cannot order until you have cooked all that you ordered, which is fine, but just a heads up! We ordered beer and soju, and yes, they check ID. I really liked it here and def will come back to this KBBQ joint in Ktown!"
8/14/2017,3 star rating,"I went here based on Yelp reviews but it's not really my favorite AYCE kbbq restaurant.For dinner time, the AYCE is about $24 (PLUS $2 for valet parking) and there are a variety of options to choose from. But I've had better korean bbq with more options (esp beef) for a cheaper price. I'm more of a beef person rather than a pork or chicken person, so I wasn't that satisfied. BUT the meat quality is pretty good!!Also, the service was slow (even though there weren't that many people when we went). It took a while to order our food and get them to us."
9/1/2014,5 star rating,"After a long day we were all really craving some korean BBQ and decided to try a new place. This place was pretty good. The grill is different from what you see at a lot of other KBBQ places. They use a stone griddle here, and I think it makes the meat taste better. :PThey had a really great selection of meats. My favorites are obviously the brisket and the thinly sliced pork belly, which is just melt in your mouth delicious. The only downside for me was the service. Everything else was great, but our server kind of forgot about us, and after waiting 20 minutes for them to come make our kimchi fried rice (which he never did) we finally just decided to go. The wait to get in here usually runs upwards of an hour, it gets pretty ridiculous, but the food does make up for its + food/atmosphere + good selection of meats- service- wait time"
3/4/2013,3 star rating,"They really enforce the rule of having the ENTIRE PARTY there before being seated. Â Our group showed up and were waiting on 2 more friends, but we thought we'd put our name on the list, before the line got any longer, since they were on their way. Â The hostess was really adamant about finding out how long they would be and we tried to say we didn't mind waiting, we just wanted to get on the list..she kept forcing an estimated time of arrival.. She even threw or some numbers for me! ""5minutes? 10 minutes? Almost here? 2 minutes?"" I said I'd call them and she was okay with that answer.. it was pretty funny.. Yes, the entire party has to be there before we can be seated.. Yes, we know we won't be seated until the entire party has arrived..yes, we know we will have to wait for the entire party to arrive. Haha.. Anyway..Food was ok..Lots of fatty pieces and brisket tasted like rubber/plastic.. I did like the kimchi pancake and steamed egg, though! Yum.. Everything else was just ok.I liked how attentive the employees were! Unlike some other kbbq places, the employees here actually help you cook your food; I was pleasantly surprised :) the server we had actually kept a smile on his face each time he came by and was really good about cleaning the grill, refilling our sides, and asking if we wanted more meat. Â No kimchi fried rice for our group though.. What happened?! :( What I wasn't a fan of was that they charged (per plate) for lettuce.. I forgot what else was on that plate but it wasn't much, and I think they charged $5.. Ah well! Valet parking-$2..and there's a kyochon a couple doors down :) got some chicken while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Remember, they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived! ;)"

Â Only problem seemed to be keeping our waters full. Â However, all of our other requests were granted promptly. Â The atmosphere is open, and the seats are not too cramped. Â The bathrooms are clean, as well.The food is great quality, and I like how the hot stones are cleaned right in front of you with shredded turnips (they absorb the pils and meat remnants). Â There's also an adorable coffee machine in the front, where you pay only $1 for an after meal treat :)If you don't want to valet, then be ready to search for street parking."
12/2/2010,4 star rating,"AYCE....Korean BBQ......$16.99whaaaa? only 16.99 for AYCE, you crazy! nope not crazy, just a new fan of Hae Jang Chon! hubby and i had the Korean BBQ craving, and what better way to fill that void than by going all you can eat style. reading the reviews we decided to get there early to avoid any chance of having to wait for this yummy goodness. ha, i guess we showed up right when they opened because we were the first ones there, score! this is during a weekday lunch, i'm not sure how it is during the weekends. by noon the place was packed, but i always saw the newcomers get seated after just a short wait. as for parking, since we got there early we found parking easily enough in the tiny strip mall lot -no valet needed. otherwise opt for street parking/meters if the lot fills up.the menu is pretty extensive but easy enough to follow. for AYCE you get to pick 3 meats to start with and then after your inhale those 3 meats...you start choosing more=). we started out with brisket, kalbi, & squid. all were really good but of course we kept coming back to the brisket. i was really happy with the flavor and texture of the squid too. at some places we've tried it can be too chewy and bland. but whatever marinade Hae Jang Chon used it really made the squid standout.a simple assortment of banchan, you get a kimchi pancake, steamed egg, kimchi & sprouts put on the grill (first time i saw that and it tasted good!), and don't forget to leave room for the kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal.i'm happy to say we had a good experience at Hae Jang Chon. Service was great and food was yummy! will def be back when the craving hits again!!!!*ha, on a side note - i was thoroughly amused whenever the wait staff would come and clean our grill with what i think was grated daikon? clean and simple!"

11/30/2015,5 star rating,"So it's been several years, which is why I feel the need to update. This place is a must visit for us whenever we come back to Los Angeles, which is what brought us in here last week. We came on last Tuesday at around 5pm, so there was no wait. There were 10 of us including kids, so that was nice. It was great to see that this place is still awesome! The quality and selection of meat is great, with the spicy bbq pork being my favorite. I also really enjoyed the bulgogi more than I remember before, as well as the marinated short ribs. Their service is awesome, as they check on you and your meat regularly. They are also friendlier than the staff at a lot of Korean businesses tend to be, as they're always laughing, interacting with the entire table(including the kids), and just being generally pleasant. At $20 per person, this continues to be a great value, as the food, service, and anything else you can think of continue to be excellent here."
2/21/2012,5 star rating,"My wife and I love this place too! As I stated in my other Korean BBQ review, I'm sure some of you are looking at my darkness and wondering what I know about good Korean BBQ. I'm born and raised in this multicultural mecca known as Los Angeles, went to a predominantly Korean High School, had Korean Friends who educated me in this subject matter, and I have been to Korea twice and dined in numerous restaurants in a few different cities there.On with this review. Â The food is delicious, but I really like how this place is open late! It has been perfect after a few Kings games at Staples, and I have even brought my parents here earlier in the evening. Â There is always a wait after around 7pm I'd say, but well worth it. Our favorite here is the BBQ pork. The bulgogi is also really good here. Â My wife loves the tongue. I think this place is better than Moodaepo, but my brother thinks they both have their strong suits. They also have this kimchi fried rice, but me and the wife are always to full and we forget about it before we eat. They always bring it out last, so we have yet to taste it. Friendly staff here as well and great service. This is currently our favorite place in K-town of the 3 or 4 we've been to(its hard to try somewhere else because we really like here), and it is not far behind my favorite place in Seoul. Good price, and good food!"
4/20/2017,5 star rating,"Went here awhile ago and loved it. For a 2 hour wait I was frustrated and hungry but the food and service there really made up for it. The grill here is unlike any grill I've seen at a kbbq place! It's very traditional and it really savors the flavors of the meats. The meat is very fresh, tender and the stone grill made it even more tastier than it already is. Another thing is the kimchi fried rice, that was totally new to me and it was amazing!!! The staff basically cooks your food for you and even tho it's busy they don't feel to satisfy your tummy. Definitely worth the wait it was a great experience."

And left feeling so stuffed it was hard to move. LOVED this place! You gotta try it!! Also, pretty affordable prices!"
6/21/2014,5 star rating,"Such. a. fan. When you thought all you can eat Korean BBQ couldn't get any better, add in a colorful selection of side dishes, kimchi fried rice and kimchi pancakes, and you will have transcended to the next level of KBBQ tastiness. Open late with bustling crowds frequent on weekends (about a 1-2 hour wait), service is quite swell albeit rushed-with waiters quickly slapping meat on the grill or cleaning your grill with a strange white stringy vegetable that I've concluded to be radish. Their selections of meat is unparalleled with the spicy BBQ pork being one of my faves (not too fatty and very well marinated) as well as thin sliced pork belly, chicken and surprisingly, the squid. The portions are ample. Needless to say, this place is bomb diggity."

11/15/2016,4 star rating,"Meal: Dinner, dine inAll Ratings out of 10:Quality of food: 8Food to Spend Value: 8Quality of Service: 7Overall Rating: 8I love meat, making all you can eat Korean BBQ a no brainer. In LA there are many options for Korean BBQ, but the quality is all over the place. Hae Jang Chon in Korea Town is very consistent and is my go to option when I want endless Korean BBQ.Like most Korean restaurants, you start out with a nice variety of small vegetable plates to start eating as your meat is cooking. This of course is not the reason I go for Korean BBQ, but everything they brought out was quite tasty and a nice flavor change from all the meat I would be consuming. There is a nice variety of meat to choose from. On my last visit I had the following: Beef Brisket, Beef Short Ribs, Thin sliced Pork Belly, BBQ Squid, Octopus, Pork Shoulder, Bulgogi (BBQ Beef), Spicy BBQ Pork, and Beef Tongue. My favorites are easily the brisket and short rib, as I reordered them (yes, this means a total of 11 meat servings for 2 people!). I found that the beef was the easiest to gauge when it was ready to go, and the ability to make it more rare or more done and to my liking was really nice. The octopus and the squid were by far the hardest to gauge, and I was never quite satisfied with them. I found they were either too chewy or too done for my liking. Since I love both meats it may just be that I don't know how to do them very well in this style, but in the future I would likely shy away from them. Outside of the 2 seafood options, though, I absolutely loved everything I had.Service can vary quite a bit at Korean BBQ places, but I found Hae Jang Chon to be just right in this department. Servers would regularly check on us to see if we wanted to order more meat, as well as to assist with the cooking to ensure we were not eating meat raw or letting it cook too long. They refilled a few of the starters upon request, and in general they made the dining experience very enjoyable. The dinner price is a bit over $20 per person, but considering what you are getting and how much you can eat, this is quite the deal. They can get quite busy, so I recommend either going earlier in the week rather than the weekend, and try to show up earlier in the dinner hour. When I have done this in the past I have been seated quickly, and generally by the time I am leaving there is a long wait. If you crave meat and love Korean BBQ style, you should definitely check out Hae Jang Chon."

1/19/2014,2 star rating,"This place used to be amazing, which is when 99% of its customers were asian. Now it's very meh, the quality of meat has gone down by a lot, and because of that I've only gone back 2x since. Also, 75% of its customers are now non-asians. That's how you know an Asian restaurant's food isn't good anymore, because all the asians left to find better food elsewhere.THE WAIT:We waited about 20 minutes until we were seated, which isn't bad at all compared to before when we had to wait 1hr-1hr45mins (when their food used to be amazing).FOOD:The side dishes haven't changed. Still really good and delicious. It's just the MEAT, the most IMPORTANT food when you eat kbbq, that has gone down tremendously in terms of quality. My favorite meat was their brisket, but now I hate it. It's become my least favorite at Hae Jang Chon.SERVICE:Service has definitely improved. They used to give better service to Koreans, but I guess since most of their customers are non-asians now, they've stopped being so..racist? Many of their employees have changed since the last time I went, and these newer employees are much more attentive to the customers.1 star for the side dishes, another star for the improved service. Took away 3 stars for the degraded meat quality.Btw, this is my (i think) 3rd review for this place. 1st review was back when it was amazing. 2nd review was after their food quality when down. 3rd review is to see if they've improved anymore from the last time I went."
5/27/2015,5 star rating,"A long 5 years. That's how long it's been since wanting to eat here back in 2010. I only tried 3 times but in all three tries, I ended up at another place because the wait was way, way beyond what I expected. When you're hungry, you're hungry.So I finally made it after 1 a 1/2 hour wait. Totally worth it. I'm not a Korean BBQ expert by any means but when I compare the other places I ended up vs this place, I can now see why it's worth the wait. Is it freshness? Is it flavor? Is it service? I think it's all of the above. I would rather wait next time than sacrifice what I experienced here. Though I'm not looking forward to the wait next time, I'm looking forward to everything else. Go here and give it a try. You won't be disappointed."

2/26/2014,5 star rating,"Me, my bf, sister and her fiancÃ© came here one day after hiking so we were super hungry! There weren't too many in here so we were seated within 5-10 minutes!We had the all you can eat buffet for $20/person. We chose a wide assortment of meats: bulgogi, short ribs, squid, pork belly, beef brisket and more meat.We also ordered a bunch of sides to eat the meat with: kimchi pancake, steamed egg, steamed rice, salad, plus everything that was already on the table when we sat down (kimchi, rice cake rolls, potato salad, bean sprouts, and different vegetables).At the end of our meal, we even had the korean miso soup and also kim chi fried rice!We spent almost 2 hours eating!!! Overall, I would definitely recommend others eat here and would like to come here again if I'm ever in town!"
7/17/2017,5 star rating,"The food was definitely worth the wait. Just had drinks next door while waiting. Plus the hostess was nice enough to make a note that we were at the bar so they wouldn't skip us. Overall, we were extremely happy with the service and the food."
3/28/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious! Fast and kind service~ the crowd is young and hip. The meats were tender and good. The women's bathroom is neat and tidy. The small dishes were excellent. Too bad we don't live here. We would pay our monthly respects to this place. If we went on the weekly it would be no good to our waistlines bc we would order too much meat. Soooooo goooooood! You have to try it. Too bad the wait is long even on a tues night. ""Got the club going up on a Tuesday got your girl in line bc she's hungraaay"""
7/16/2017,5 star rating,"I went with my wife and a friend. Â Delicious, but the people are very pushy. Â Parking is no longer free. Â The staff was very good about bringing food promptly. Â You will have to ask to get a pitcher of water - so make sure you do, or you'll overheat with them meat sweats!The pork belly was really delicious, and the brisket was nice and savory... don't get greedy, though! Â Make sure you'll eat it all or they will charge you.Make sure you come on time or everyone will have to wait for you."
7/16/2015,5 star rating,"This place is Suweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.Feels like a long wait only because you go when you're super hungry. 30 - 40 mins of hunger is what stands in your way of experiencing this Korean food. Can you handle that?I can.You should.I did.worth it.do it,"
9/10/2012,4 star rating,They have the best beef briskets! Everything else was okay. Their steam egg was pretty gross. I can taste the tap water lol. I went with my friend At night around 10pm. We had to wait 1 hr before we were Â seated. Even though there were plenty of empty seats. Minus one star for the wait. Other than that cant think of anything negative bout this place. I'd def come back. Btw valet parking is mandatory. $2! Be sure to bring your cash!;)
2/13/2014,5 star rating,"My boyfriend had been talking about this place for months! He first came here just before his birthday with our friends on an evening when I unfortunately had to work. He absolutely loved it and promised that he would bring me one night.When I finally came here with him and a few friends, I totally understood why he said this was the best K BBQ in town. The meats are fresh and neither too lean nor overly fatty. My favourite is definitely the beef bulgogi because I also prefer marinated meat over others. However, everything else we ordered was delicious too. In addition to our usual orders of beef brisket, pork shoulder, and thin pork belly, we also ordered beef tongue and squid that night. I had never tried beef tongue before, and it wasn't that great for me, but the squid is marinated and quite good after it is grilled.I really like the fact that they allow half orders here. It makes it easier to finish all the food towards the end when you still want to try something but already feel quite full. Â I think it also works well if it's only 2-3 people but everyone wants to try a lot of different meats. Â They also serve kimchi pancake, steamed egg, and the servers are always coming around to refill the little kimchi plates and rice rolls. Then, when the grill gets too dirty, they sweep by with a bowl of sliced radishes and use it to clean the grill. At the end, when you decided you are too full for any more meat, they clean the grill and cook kimchi fried rice to serve everyone. Make sure you leave room for that fried rice at the end!"

7/17/2014,5 star rating,"Nice place for kbbq! We waited no longer than 5 minutes to get seated around 6:50-7:00pm. The meat selection was pretty good along with their fish cake! It was good with a kick of spice. The cooking grill/tray was much more different than I was used to but it was really cool looking! When you are busy eating, servers would come and cook the meat for you. As well as clean your grill in an amazing way! They also put the cooked meat on a plate for you so it wouldn't get burnt! Overall the experience was pretty good I'd say! And I believe they don't charge for a small amount of leftover food! Valet parking was only 2$ btw and really nice, sweet guys."
7/31/2012,4 star rating,"This is my favorite AYCE restaurant! They have the best service and the meat selection is wonderful. The one thing that sets this restaurant apart from others is the fact that you cook on a stone top. Therefore grilling isn't really involved at Hae Jang and you're most likely to come out less smelly. Â Everytime I come to this place, they are always playing rave/dance music... The atmosphere is great and once in a while you'll get to witness a big party having a good time with their soju. I would recommend skipping the ""hot dogs"" since it's not worth it at all. Hae Jang Chon is located in a shopping center with it's own parking lot which is valet. Parking in the lot will cost $2 bucks. Side note: My girl friends love hitting up this joint because of all waiters are nice looking ""Korean"" meat. ;)"
3/24/2015,2 star rating,"I came here on Monday late afternoon with my girl friend. We came here, fooled by the 2000+ reviews and 4 stars...There was maybe 5 other group of people besides us when we first came in and 3 or 4 waiters and waitresses. But for some reason, it took a really long time for our order of meat to come out. And we were not allowed to order more food until we finished our previous plate of food we ordered. The service was nice but really slow. We had to ask multiples of times to get more salad, more sauce, order of meat, etc. We definitely had better Korean BBQ in OC..."
8/20/2016,1 star rating,"The service at this place has really gone down in the past few months. It seems that arrogance has taken over the attitudes of the servers as they feel like they don't need any new business. We had a server by the name of Esther who was extremely rude to us and every time we asked for something, we had to put up with her clearly annoyed facial expressions. We even tried to use humor to lighten her up but with no success. Refills were not offered and when we finally got her attention, she Â took the glass to refill my wife's drink but never brought it back. We will start going to Quarters now which is another Korean BBQ joint in the same complex. What a waste of a place which has decent food but horrible and miserable service with a server who is unhappy to be there!!!!!"
3/24/2015,5 star rating,"For a pseudo-vegetarian, I really appreciated the amount of salad that this KBBQ place offers. I often feel overwhelmed by too much of a meat-heavy meal, but I was happy that the side dishes of tofu, daikon radish, veggies, and mashed potatoes helped the meal to feel quite wholesome. Keep up the great work with the options! :) and I truly appreciated the seafood! Best tasting shrimp I've had in years!"
1/30/2017,5 star rating,"Coming from Olympic Spa, I did not expect that my day of pampering would continue. THEY TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU here at Hae Jang Chon!!! When your water is always filled, it means they pay ATTENTION to their customers. When they ask if you want your banchan refilled and you don't have to hunt a waiter down to get it done, it means they WANT you to ENJOY their food. ENJOYED we DID! To top it all off, they would help cook the bbq for you. AaahhhhhhhhhMAZING!!! I can not state enough how much of a delicious delight it was to stumble upon this KTown gem. This is the kind of restaurant experience where you know every penny is worth it, and you actually want to tip the waiter well."
7/7/2016,4 star rating,"All the things we ordered here were delicious! Service here was great, the stuff was patient and helpful. But I wait for a long time for my food, hope they will be better! 4 stars!!"
5/26/2014,4 star rating,"$2 Valet is worth it, parking in the area is horrendous. This place no longer takes reservations so recommend getting there really early (think 5pm dinner). They won't seat you until your whole party arrives, so if you have a group let them know to be as prompt as possible. Also they only have one designated table that can seat more than 8 people, unless you're okay breaking up a larger party don't recommend trying to fit 10+ people in there.We've been here many times but unless we are early enough and have a small group, I'm not sure its worth all the hassle."
5/19/2015,5 star rating,"Omg go here for lunch. 20$ all you can eat meat. Enough said. Super clean, fresh sides and amazing staff. Super healthy options for us picky eaters! The meat is juicy and fresh. My favorite? Spicy pork!!!! Yuuuuuuuuum I want to triple the star rating! Tried two beefs, chicken and pork all amazing. And the kimchi pancake? Owowowowow I have dreams of this place :) take time from your LA trip to visit!"
5/19/2015,5 star rating,"Have I mentioned that Korean BBQ is my new favorite thing in the world because of this place? My boyfriend took me here on my birthday and it was my first ever Korean BBQ experience! I have always gone on a Saturday and although they typically say the wait is going to be over an hour, they always get us in within about 20 minutes. There is always appetizers sitting on your table before you sit down so it doesn't feel like such a long wait before and after you order. They also bring everything (meat, rice, sauce) quickly after you order it and they have a bell that you can ring when you need more of something. it is a very nice environment as well. There is a mixture of different people that eat there and every time we go, everyone is either deep in conversation or laughing and having tons of fun. It is decorated to make you feel like you are in an authentic Korean community and is perfect for the heart of Koreatown. I recommend anyone who has hungry visitors from out of town take them here!"
6/19/2016,5 star rating,"Tentative service and good meat quality, probably one of the best AYCE places if you are willing to wait in line."
3/21/2015,5 star rating,"Great service. Lots of great spicy food. My family members hadn't had Korean so they really enjoyed this experience. The place is popular so I would subject getting there well before you'd like to eat, however they get you in as quickly as they can though you MUST wait until ALL your party members are there! Try the Raspberry wine my family says it was delicious! Also this place is not great for the vegetarian, if you like fish there's shrimp. Also valet parking is cramped so I'd suggest street and get ready to eat A LOT because the food keeps coming and coming for s feat AYCE price of $22!"
8/16/2017,1 star rating,"They didn't finish cooking the meat on our table, so we had to do it ourselves. The egg bowl was still uncooked. The potato salad was white and horrible, and in Korean tradition is supposed to be yellow. The other appetizers were just as bad. For the sauces they give you, they just smudge in some store bought, non traditional hot sauce. Absolutely trash, never going back, wouldn't reccomend to ANYONE."
5/15/2017,5 star rating,Have been coming here for sometime now. Best KBBQ in Koreatown. A lot of places to choose from & cheaper but can't compete with the taste. You will always find a line & make sure your party is all there to be seated.
3/7/2011,3 star rating,"If molesting a service button is a crime, throw me in the slammer.I am not high maintenance by any means. And EVEN with my low standard of service for AYCE K-BBQ, Hae Jan Chon takes the cake for worst service. I'm normally very service-button shy, but I think Hae Jang Chon relies on patrons to press the button to get their attention. Service aside, here are some some notes:Pros: Open late- 2am!Pretty good deal- $17 for AYCEDecent banchansMeats were great! Boneless ribs=delishCons:Poor ServiceTea-water is filled in a large container. Let me explain that last point. The water is a diluted tea (bor-ee-cha?). Now, I can see that something like that might need to be brewed in a large container, but it's one of those things I wished I didn't see. Â After asking for more water, our server proceeded to the back corner of the dining room where there was a large container (think supersized dish washing bin). He dunks the pitcher into it and scoops out the tea and ice. I dunno- I'm sure it's perfectly sanitary, but seems like it would be a health code violation of some sort. Ugh.Even with my complaints, I think it's definitely worth trying when all the other KBBQs have closed their doors at 10 or 11pm. Right across the street was Dessert Haus (sp?), but it was closed when we got out-definitely on my list of places to check out next time!"
7/8/2015,5 star rating,"Great place! My favorite AYCE KBBQ place for going to when I'm with friends from out of town or are looking for something better than my standard sub-$20 KBBQ fares. I've tried out a number of other KBBQ places nearby and this one is my favorite as it stands out with its service, selection, and overall quality. Parking is handled by a $2 valet, and the area itself is a bit cramped for how popular it is. But, the workers are very quick to move and will help you cook/cook for you, which is unlike most KBBQ places I have been to. The wait time might be something to gripe about, but I can't ding this place for being popular.They also have:Korean PancakesKimchi Fried Rice (Requestable only when you are done with meats)I love this place!"
9/2/2014,4 star rating,This is a great spot for Korean BBQ especially for beginners! I really enjoy it and take people there often!
7/7/2015,5 star rating,Seriously loved this place. We were seated immediately upon arrival . Happened to go at lunch. The meat and sauce was just to die for. Love being able to cook own meats to personal preference. I will most definitely will be back when in the Los Angeles area. I left full & happy. Well worth it
5/15/2015,5 star rating,This one is by far my favorite kbbq in ktown! Lovely and professional service. They had great choices of banchan which were served before we sat down. Great atmosphere and definitely will be coming back very soon. Ps: I hope they can make a separate price for people who only eat fish I paid 22$ to eat only 2 things off the list. Why do I still eat at kbbqs? My boyfriend eats everything.. And it's a two person minimum. I left eating mushrooms and 2 prices of baby octopus.
5/21/2014,1 star rating,"I was hungry after shopping nearby and decided to yelp search a Korean BBQ place nearby. This place came up and had 1800 reviews at 4 stars so I though ""why not?"" Got food poisoned!!! Whether it was because the meat was undercooked or bad meat, they kinda rushed me by bringing the other meat and implying that the meat on the stove was ready. I've been to Korean BBQ before and have never had a problem with cooking the food myself! I can't go back to this place :("
3/18/2015,4 star rating,"This place is great. First time trying KBBQ in Ktown and man did it exceed my expectations. Excellent customer service and the meat was delicious! Didn't Â even have to pay for my meal because the girl I was with was so pleased with the service, she wanted to pay. Thanks Hae Jang Chon, you the real MVP."
9/1/2014,5 star rating,"Super delicious KBBQ! We came here originally on a Friday night, but parking was horrible and there was a 1 - 2 hour wait. Tried again on Saturday but at an earlier dinner time, and the wait was only about half an hour! We were also able to score parking half a block away! :) We opted for the AYCE for $18.99 per person. The AYCE menu comes with 19 items - beef brisket, beef short rib, bulgogi, beef tongue, BBQ pork, BBQ chicken, pork shoulder, pork belly, shrimp, hot dogs, beef abomasums, beef honeycomb, octopus, BBQ squid, kimchi pancake, rice paper, steamed egg, bean paste soup, steamed rice or kimchi fried rice. Definitely a great deal since it comes with so much food for its price! It also comes with side dishes too! We basically tried all the items on the menu. Meats were in good quality and marinated very well. Everything just tasted very good. Each time we ordered more, the staff would clean up our grills. My favorites were the beef brisket, short ribs, and the pork belly. By the end of our meal, my stomach was sooo stuffed. Service was excellent. I really liked our waiter because he was funny, friendly, and attentive. Definitely will be back again for my next SoCal trip (which will be coming up soon)! :)"
12/12/2012,5 star rating,"I am from Orange County so I had Gen, Cham Soot Gol, Star and all those places on Garden Grove Blvd. I think Hae Jan Chon is probably the best I've been to so far. I don't know if the grill made the difference but this place is my favorite. Compared to all the AYCE KBBQ places, this place had amazing service! Everyone is nice and efficient. I highly recommend the kimchi fried rice and get there before dinner rush or else it will be 2 plus hours wait. The parking lot is small but they valet."
12/25/2018,3 star rating,The meat is really good -- soft and tender. But it's the same marinate for all meat so I got sick of the meat real quick. I enjoyed the kimchi fried rice tho. It's abit bland but goes well with the meat. Great service :-)
3/31/2014,2 star rating,"This place is a bit overrated in my opinion...After reading reviews on how popular this place is and how long the average wait is, we decided to go early. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon around 4.30pm. There were plenty of seats inside... but we waited for 20 min before we were seated. We had to put our names down on the list they have by the counter. There were 4 other groups all waiting the same time. We were all wondering why we had to stand and wait. The guy taking reservation was rude, did not want to really explain why we had to wait. At one point I was standing in next to the counter as we rang out of space to wait, he just pushed me over so he could get around me. 20 min later, we were seated, along with the other 3 groups. For some reason the other 3 groups all got served while we waited for another 20 min. No server came to our table. Finally, I had to pressed the bell and ask for some water and ask to see if we can order some meat and steam eggs. I got an angry reply...""its being cooked!!!"" and she stormed off. Later-on she came back and took our meat orders. At this point I went outside and topped up the parking meter as its still before 6pm and you still have to pay for street parking on 6th St.Finally we got some food. its ok..... Still prefer the unhealthy chargrill taste from other places. Stone grill is a bit too healthy. Beef tongue and angus beef were nice. Bulgogi was average, a little chewy. Â The side dish selection was average. To give this place some credit... the second shift people were much better. She was actually friendly. But still, the initial 1hr in this place just runnier it... i've had better experience next door and down the street."
1/8/2014,5 star rating,"LOVE this place!!! Their meat and services are amazing! I've gone to this AYCE kbbq several times and every experience was a good one even though the wait can be a bit ridiculous sometimes but that is expected at any AYCE kbbq so I don't get why people complain about that. The place is also slightly small, but I could care less about how spacious the place is, I just want to eat! We always get the briskets and marinated beef, yum! It is also served with steamed eggs, all the sides (potato salad is my fave and their PS is quite unique compared to elsewhere, it has apples in it) and kimchi pancake and you get a choice of regular fried rice or kimchi fried rice at the end of your meat grilling session, so save some room for that!The staff is super duper friendly, they will come around and help you cook if they see you struggling a little or cut up the meat. I am always amazed at how they clean their stone grills with the radish, my favorite part of their service.Overall, my To-go-to AYCE kbbq!! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants good quality meat and a good service experience."
10/28/2014,5 star rating,"The unique stone grill MAKES this place. Â It's the best non-stick grill I have experienced out of all the kbbq places, which affects the taste of the food. Â For the price you get squid and octopus too, can't beat Hae Jang Chon at this price point when it comes to the AYCE-level of kbbq.My favorite is always the beef tongue and brisket. Â They also have this sliced bone-in pork belly that makes me wonder how anyone can be vegetarian, good lord!TIP: get there early on weekends, put your name down, go get some coffee across the street at Haus and then check back an hour after. Â They don't take phone reservations due to the high traffic."
1/5/2016,5 star rating,"This is my fav KBBQ spot in SoCal. You will wait in a long line, but food is worth it at this AYCE spot."
5/8/2017,4 star rating,"Now my favorite KoreaTown ayce BBQ joint. The wait line for a Sunday evening may have been considerable but it was definitely worth it. My favorites were the brisket, the spicy beef and hands down best was the short ribs. Service was great and the location is kept clean. All of my friends were really satisfied with the meal and experience. We weren't kept waiting very much for the next round of meats to come our way, and server was always respectful and courteous. Definitely coming back to this location"
5/13/2014,5 star rating,"Twice I have been in LA, and twice I have come to this place for all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ.The price in unbeatable (less than $20 per person!). The meat is also of great selection & quality. I don't like to pay more than $30 per person if it is all you can eat. Normally I'd refuse to wait for *anything* beyond 30 min, for this, I make an exception.The good:--- service is fast, esp when they are busy. we were never out of water or anything.--- meat quality good, don't get the tripe or cow stomach or tongue, they don't taste good when grilled--- my favorite meats were: beef brisket, marinated short ribs, BBQ squid--- Korean fried rice (served only when you are done) is amazing--- you get to grill your own food, although the servers tend to help a lot too--- $2 valet parking isn't a bad dealThe bad:--- wait can be long, expect to wait up to 1 hr. If you are not present when they call your name for checking, you may be crossed out. --- like all BBQ places, it is smoky and loud. If you are looking for a quiet atmospheric dining experience, go somewhere else."
9/8/2008,3 star rating,"My friends just live right around the corner. They saw this place always pack with people, but they never try it. So last Wednesday, we decided to give it a shot. Probably it was the weekday, we only waited for less than 10mins to be seated. Okay. in here you can order $16.99 AYCE which i think is the best choice. LOL Just because there are not much other choices. The only thing i really like is they use stone grill. They don't have any small dishes, but cold steam eggs, and bean-sprouts. Besides, they'll give you a little kimchi and kimchi pancakes on the grill. 4 of us had the 1st round - EVERYTHING - which included Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, Marinated Short Ribs. Â Yup. they don't have much choices as I said, that's bascially all you can get. Beef Brisket, the best among the others. pretty good quality. Pork Belly, hmmm a bit too fatty and also a bit of the pig smell... Marinated Short Ribs, not too bad, but not the best. Â We ordered for the 2nd round with EVERYTHING, and the waiter looked at us like... huh? EVERYTHING again?? Â geez. what's wrong with that!! Compare with the 1st round, 2nd round came with smaller amount of meats. While our wait, another waiter came to help us clean the stone grill. He was pretty good and professional. I like how he cleaned the stone grill by using some water n' sliced up radish. v. smart! We'd like to have more meats but then we deicded to try the fried rices and tofu soup instead. well just because we don't want to be stared like we eat big. ~_~ Â The fried rices was mixed with seaweeds and kimchi, pretty good. The tofu soup was a bit too salty. Meat quality was just okay. But the kimchi pancakes are pretty unique. The smoke vents here were okay. Probably because there were not too many tables that night. Overall the experience was okay."
10/20/2016,5 star rating,"Best AYCE KBBQ resto I've been to in ktown. Service was fantastic, but the food was even better. The meats were fresh and marinated so well.

5/20/2014,2 star rating,"The only reason I came here is because my usual place, Sonagi closed down which I think is tragic.Their meat is okay. Don't have much variety though. Banchan is very weak. They are very stingy with EVERYTHING. I understand that many people come and waste food but still. WORST SERVICE EVER.Service: I felt like I was being treated like a little girl. Our waiter basically told us we can only order two types of meat at a time and he always cringed each time we asked for anything. When we asked for Coke he cringed. When I asked for a bowl of rice he said: we make kimchi rice at the end. Just eat that. And I replied by saying I don't like kimchi rice so please give me a bowl and he cringed at that as well.I will not be going again."
11/30/2015,3 star rating,"don't know what the hype is about. sure, stone plate is cool! radish to clean? awesome! service? superb! however, for the price the meats are limited. no beef belly, no intestine?? come on...also because its a stone pot and not a grill with holes, the oil tends to sit around...which made it really heavy. considering theres so much more options in ktown, i definitely will not be returning. the only good thing was the service because it was top notch."
1/13/2017,5 star rating,"We've been here maybe 3 times. It's always so good. However, it was weird the third time because I ordered 2 sides of rice twice and when he brought it out he said if you eat this rice you can't have the kimchi fried rice at the end. I was really confused because I always eat lots of rice when we come here and we've always had kimchi fried rice at the end."
8/3/2017,1 star rating,"So I just went there. It's 1:20 am and it says they close at 2. Guy at the front told me the kitchen is closed(after he ignored me for 10 mins), but didn't say sorry you can't sit or anything else, and walked away. Not too sure what that means since you cook at the table and it's pre cut.... so the guy was just telling me to get out in a rude way. So if you want to eat at a place that's closed when it's open and open when it's closed, this place is for you."
10/3/2013,5 star rating,"i don't think i'd ever be able to date a vegetarian guy... have you all ever been to this place?!? important stuff:- best bang for your buck ($18.99 ayce kbbq includes a great selection of meat choices, steamed egg, soybean paste/miso soup, kimchi pancake, unlimited side dishes, and bomb kimchi fried rice at the end... if you even have room in your tummy lols) Â  - ayce bbq price is $18.99 all day Â - however there are $5.99-8.99 individual lunch specials for those not in the mood for bbq- parking lot in front is $2, but you can usually get lucky with street parking outside - great service for those of you anticipating one of my super long and beautiful stories full of rich and delicious details... i've got one here for ya ;) but don't worry, i'll keep this one nice and short. Â here's how my ideal kbbq meal looks like: - brisket (lean meat here, yummm. not super fatty like other places) Â  - pork belly (kindaaaa contradicts my brisket up there... lols however i'd still say it's a bit leaner here than other places as well... mmMmm i can't understand ppl who don't love samgyupsal... what's wrong with you alllll?!) - this place also offers thick and thin slices of pork belly, but i always prefer the thick cut :P- squid (recently tried this one), super yummy, great marinating sauce :O - kimchi! adds a little spice to my meal cuz you all know how i like things spicy! ;) - sojuuuuu! (take a shot and then chase the alcohol away with a nice thick slice of meat ;) - rice wine :) hehehe only when my other girlies are here though, cuz we all love ourselves a nice cup ...or two of makgeolli- kimchi fried rice (be sure to save room for this deliciousness at the end of your meal!) the next time your carnivorous cravings kick in, be sure to check this place out!"
1/12/2017,5 star rating,Delicious! I always come here when I'm in LA. Totally worth it and very attentive; delicious food. Get the beef tongue; don't be put off!
6/23/2017,5 star rating,"Last minute plans. We got out of a concert and was starving and google nears food. It looked ok but the lines were long, which means it was promising. Best Korean BBQ I ever had. Totally worth the wait. Spicy pork was amazing."
8/19/2014,4 star rating,"Met my cop buddy and his wife this past weekend and we had a less than memorable experience. Â I always thought the ventilation was lacking in this place and since it was a 95F day in LA, the heat was pretty unbearable for most patrons including myself. Â Furthermore, the service wasn't up to part this time around. Â Forgot to bring out the soup, the steamed egg, and worst of all, when it came down to making the kimchi fried rice, the waitress didn't bother to clean off the stone grill with the sliced radishes. Â It made for a very unappetizing taste. Â They were busy of course, but you come to expect a certain level of service that makes this place so popular."
2/28/2013,5 star rating,"Hell yeah, my cop friend took me here for my birthday in Feb. Â You bet we chowed down. Â It's amazing what the internet and Yelp has done for Korean establishments. Â This place was full of non-Koreans! Â In fact, I think at one point, me and my friend were the only Koreans in the place. Â That's great in my opinion unless the non-Koreans demand that they water down the flavors/taste. Â Then we have a problem!But yes, this place rocks in so many ways. Â Love the stone grill. Â The service is pretty attentive. Â They don't intentionally try to slow you down and frustrate you like other places. Â Service is downright good and the food as I mentioned is pretty darn tasty. Â Word to the wise: get there early!"
10/10/2012,5 star rating,"Best Korean AYCE hands down in terms of cost, quality of food and service. Â It is small, so get there early. Â Save room for the kimchi fried rice!"
1/12/2015,3 star rating,"It's known to be a very popular place for all you can eat Kbbq. We went a bit early (around 5 pm), so the wait was at least 15 minutes. The meat is standard. There really isn't anything special. It's just as good as the place down the street. Service is a bit too slow for me. Â Having said all that, it is a decent place to go for kbbq, but it didn't live up to its hype. It is a good environment for young adults to eat."
1/29/2018,4 star rating,"Extremely popular spot in Ktown. I went with a group of friends and the wait was about an hour ( I think we waited less) but it was well worth it. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great, not once did we have to press the buzzer for service. Food was pretty good."
3/2/2016,4 star rating,"Great meat for a great price. Came here for AYCE lunch after emerging from 2 days in the desert. Didn't have to wait and it was 1pm on Presidents' Day. Service is either great or meh, depending on who you get. Side dishes are uninspiring and the bbq did not come with garlic. But regardless, the meat stole the show. It was an epic meal and I left fully satisfied!"
5/31/2015,5 star rating,My new favorite ayce kbbq in K-town! I am so glad my friend introduced me to this place. The price is a little pricey but the quality of the meat is number 1! The side dishes aren't that great in my opinion but the meat is what I came for. They also offer kimchi fried rice at the end but I'm always too full to even try it. Their steam egg is also delicious The service here is great. Especially Sally. She was very kind and caring. Always checking up on us and asking if we needed anything. The food and the service is great!!
5/29/2015,5 star rating,"Best Korean bbq Buffett I've been to. We went there at 9pm on a Thursday night and there was a line. When we left at allmost midnight there was a line. The place is packed, smoky and noisy, just like a Korean bbq should be. The meat cuts were excellent. The staff was attentive, friendly and got us what we wanted right away. The only ding is the baby octopus, I didn't care for. We call this the piggy place because at one time they had a drawing of a piglet in front."
5/29/2015,5 star rating,"Our friends brought us to Hae Jang Chon when we mentioned we wanted some KBBQ. KBBQ spots line the streets of Koreatown in LA; there are literally maybe 3 every block. Hae Jang Chon, however, was the one restaurant that was recommended to us. I came with a group of guys (and 2 other girls) and ready to eat. We ordered the squid, boneless seasoned short rib, pork belly, pork shoulder, and beef tongue.. all were so delicious, I can almost guarantee we packed down at least 5-7 lbs of meat in one sitting. The great part about Hae Jang Chon is that they are very attentive to your needs and are always refilling water, banchan, and will cook your food for you. What's even better is that they cook everything on a hot stone plate, eliminating all the smoke inhalation from traditional wood grills. You have the option whether to have white rice or kimchee fried rice at the end of your meal, and I would recommend the kimchee fried rice all the way. I know by that point you've probably had a week's worth of food in your stomach, but the kimchee fried rice is just like dessert. You may be extremely full, but all of a sudden your stomach just makes room. Great place in Koreatown that I highly recommend!"
5/27/2015,5 star rating,"A long 5 years. That's how long it's been since wanting to eat here back in 2010. I only tried 3 times but in all three tries, I ended up at another place because the wait was way, way beyond what I expected. When you're hungry, you're hungry.So I finally made it after 1 a 1/2 hour wait. Totally worth it. I'm not a Korean BBQ expert by any means but when I compare the other places I ended up vs this place, I can now see why it's worth the wait. Is it freshness? Is it flavor? Is it service? I think it's all of the above. I would rather wait next time than sacrifice what I experienced here. Though I'm not looking forward to the wait next time, I'm looking forward to everything else. Go here and give it a try. You won't be disappointed."
5/26/2015,4 star rating,"This place is definitely pricey, but for all the options that you get, I think it's worth it. I went with a small group though, so we didn't get to order everything on the menu (out of fear that we'd get charged for wasting food). But I was pretty satisfied with everything that I did get to try. The side dishes were good and varied (seafood pancake was so good), and they were very generous with the refills. As for the meat, the chicken, beef tongue, and bulgogi were my favorite. They were all marinated very well and the meat came out tender and filled with flavor. The best part about this place is how they do most of the cooking for you. They cut up everything, cook everything, and let you know when things are ready to eat. And once you're all out of meat, they ask you for your next order right away. I was VERY impressed with the customer service here.At the very end, they make you the kimchi fried rice. Unfortunately, I found it to be a little disappointing. The kimchi was so sour and the rice came out a bit too soggy for my taste. Sad way to finish off an otherwise delicious lunch. But even then, I'd still rate this place 4 stars. I can't say that this place will be my go-to KBBQ place from now on since it is quite pricey...but if I'm ever in the mood to splurge, I'll be back for sure."
5/26/2015,4 star rating,It s always a crazy line here. Take at least half hour to be in the restaurant but fortunately it opens until 2 am. Be prepare to wait until you are really really hungry and then enjoy the good meat with a reasonable price. My favorite is black angus beef brisket and bbq squid.
5/25/2015,5 star rating,Found a new AYCE kbbq spot for us girls to go to! Meats are deelish and of quality! Service was awesome! Gets super busy! $21.99 for dinner and weekends. $19.99 for lunch and weekdays. Our faves are the marinated short ribs and Canadian thinly sliced bacon!
5/25/2015,4 star rating,"I don't like Korean BBQ or Korea food at all, but this place deserves the four stars. The line can get a little long sometimes (we waited 1.5hrs), but workers are extremely attentive and kind. They work hard and it shows. I love watching the teamwork demonstrated at this place. Food is of good quality and more a classy crowd comes here as opposed to other Korean BBQ's I've been to. My friends love it and they are regulars so I guess it is worth coming to! I just don't like how I smell like it right after though :p"
5/25/2015,4 star rating,"The day after consumption.All the meats are undeniably delicious. They're tender and not overly marinated( e.g HoneyPig). They provided with five-six banchans( kimchi, beansprouts, fishcake, radish,etc) I love the sauces: soybean paste, chilli paste, sesame oil,and something similar to a sweet lighter soy sauce version. They also have salad with light dressing as well. All you can eat for $22 with quality meats... Who can beat that?** but make sure you finish what you order or they'll charge you $15 for leftover meats.Now for the downsides:1) the wait was literally 1.5-2 hours long.2) your legs/feet will disown you for standing that long so I suggest going somewhere and come back, but make sure to check in with the host when you come back to make sure they didn't miss your name.3) this is probably the most negative pointer...When I woke up this morning, I felt like I'm having a hangover. My head was mildly pounding, I felt so bloated and my throat was clogged up. Â I honestly know my body, when I consume too much salt and MSG, that's what it does... REBEL.Verdict: I'm definitely down to come back, but I really have to be on a really good diet for 3months straight then treat myself. Lol"
5/25/2015,5 star rating,"If you haven't come here for Korean BBQ, you're doing it wrong *I mean that in the most non-offensive way possible*. The quality of the meat and the service here are really exceptional. Â We decided to try something new last night and came here. Â When we arrived, we were slightly discouraged by the number of people outside. Â I put my name on the list for 2 people and was told 'If everyone on this list is still here, it's a 2 hour wait'. Â We weren't thrilled, but in our experience, everywhere with a wait is usually worth it. Â We waited patiently, and while waiting we were approached a few times by the host who had been checking to see if everyone on the list had actually waited. Â We were pleasantly surprised to have only waited about 50 minutes before we were seated. Â The table was already laid out with small plates of pickled radishes, sesame oil, chili paste, kimchi, bean sprout salad, green salad, and other various delights. Â We were greeted immediately by our server (I think his name was Steve). Â He was super friendly and helpful in picking out which meats to try. Â We had Bulgogi, Beef Tongue, Pork Shoulder, Thin Pork Belly, Shrimp, Thick Pork Belly, Beef Brisket and Marinated Short Rib. Â Our favorites were the Bulgogi and the Marinated Short Rib. Â At the end of the meal we had the Kimchi Fried Rice, which is loaded with green onions and seaweed. Â It was truly delicious. Â We ordered 3 meats at a time, and each time they came out someone was there to put it on the magical cooking stone and start it for us. Â Then, someone would come around and check on us, and cut the meat if needed. Â They made sur eour waters and beers were full as we happily grazed on everything in front of us. Â This was seriously good service - I hope we get the same server if we go again. Â This guy was great. Â This place changed the game for us. Â It's so good that we'll wait in this line forever going forward if we want Korean BBQ."
2/23/2017,5 star rating,"In my opinion, best Korean BBQ in all of the US and Korea. People may think Korea has the best Korean BBQ, but no, LA hands down has the best Korean BBQ. Not only is this place priced very reasonably, the quality of meat is great. They have an assortment of all sorts of meat including Galbi! (which for those who don't know, is the best quality Korean BBQ meat you can get) Whenever I go back to LA, I ALWAYS eat here. One cool thing that they do here is that at the end of your meal is that if you ask they mix rice and a bunch of side dishes together to make Kimchi fried rice. Very cool and another plus about this place! Too bad they don't have any places like these in the East coast."
5/16/2016,5 star rating,I love this restaurant! I live within walking distance and frequent here once a month at least. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.
4/21/2015,5 star rating,"I've been coming to this place for years, I take friends here every chance I get. The food and service is ALWAYS on point!!! It's a meat party in your mouth!! AND they have Kimchi pancakes, they are by far the yummiest of yum yum yummyness. I LOOOOVE THIS PLACE. They've remodeled a bit but the ambiance is still super chill the servers are quick to help you cut your meet and give you refills. Don't be afraid to ring the little bell at your table for a server, that's what it's there for! This place gets super busy so call first to see if there is a wait and get your name on that list quick. Don't miss out on their awesome selection. I've been to other places but I always come back here for the quality and service."
7/6/2014,5 star rating,"This is my absolute favorite AYCE KBBQ spot. It's just captured my heart and never let go. Whenever I have friends visiting town, this is a priority place that I must take them to, and I love seeing them fall in love with the experience and the food.It's about $20, not including tip, and you get a big variety of options to pick from, plus some solid appetizers. My favorite meats are the beef bulgogi, brisket, and pork belly. One time I was feeling adventurous and tried tongue and squid, both of which I wouldn't normally get, but I was pleasantly surprised by both. I love to eat all of the meat drenched in the spices and then rolled up in the rice paper. Practically every time I come in, I just ask our server to give a whole stack of the rice paper, and they're more than happy to. Pace yourself, because you've GOT to leave some room to try the kimchi fried rice at the very end! It's the perfect cap to end AYCE KBBQ. This place also gets some extra kudos for the stone grills you get to cook your meats on, they just seem to taste better that way.There is $2 valet, however I was turned away last time I was there because the wait was about 2 hours. No worries, there is free residential street parking around. Speaking of which, there is almost always a wait here. Last Friday was my first Friday ever coming here, and it was insane how crowded it was and how long the wait was. Most other times, it can take 15 min-1 hour. It's so worth it though, and I think the time goes by really fast if you're with great company.Tip: If you can come here with someone who speaks Korean/is Korean, I think the experience becomes even much better. When I went with a Korean friend, I swear we were hooked up!"
4/27/2014,4 star rating,"Note: I am not a fan of AYCE Korean BBQ and only do AYCE when I don't have a choice, i.e., it's a friend's or Grandma's birthday. It's because I prefer QUALITY over quantity and it's extremely uncomfortable stuffing myself as I did when I was in my teens and twenties. However, I do have to say that this is my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ, if I had to choose one. The quality of the meat was pretty good, and I enjoyed the beef tongue, brisket, and short ribs, but the squid was my favorite. My favorite way of cooking Korean BBQ is with charcoal, but the stone grill was pretty good. The meat cooked pretty evenly without burning. I liked the salad, and there was a good selection of banchan. The only thing that disappointed me was the kimchi fried rice. They cook it on the grill for you last, and it was super wet and soggy to me. I do want to mention that they get an A+ for ventilation here. I don't usually mind the smell of Korean BBQ, unless the ventilation is so bad that I'm coughing and my eyes are watering (that's another story for another review). By the time we got home, hubs could barely smell the BBQ in my hair, and that is a great measure. This restaurant started to get really busy at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night, and we were one of the last cars to valet before they got full. Valet is only $2, so get here early!"
1/21/2014,4 star rating,"More like 3 and a half stars. Â Hae Jang Chon has excellent sides and service, but I was not as impressed by the meat selection and the grills are just skillets basically - no smokiness. Â What you cook on makes a big difference for me as far as flavor is concerned.While this place was decent, nothing really knocked my socks off. Â If this had been my first exposure to KBBQ, I probably wouldn't get what the fuss is all about."
7/26/2010,3 star rating,"I went to this place, thinking it was another restaurant I had been to in the past (the name sounded familiar and the address was close). Well, I was wrong! But we were already parked and didn't feel like looking for the place that I had in mind, so we decided to give it a shot. I would like to give this place 3.5 starts - 3 is too harsh, but not good enough to be 4 star restaurant. Banchan, salad, and steamed egg was really good. Kimchi pancake was decent. But the meat was just okay... The highlight of my meal was the Kimchi fried rice and the soup they served at the end. I'm not a fan of All You Can Eat places and this is only my second AYCE BBQ place I've been to, so I can't really make any valid comparison to other places, although this was better than the other place I've been to (can't recall the name). My husband said it was way better than Manna. Â I won't be going back to this place, unless I have a large group of people who really want to do AYCE."
6/19/2011,5 star rating,"Went here a while ago (maybe two months?); let me see how good my memory serves me after consuming the equivalent of two olympic size pools of Crown Royal during my lifetime. Â Parking-Valet only. Â You can street park around the residentials, but its usually packed and difficult to find a spot. Wait-Went on a Friday night, around 9 PM, there was a long wait ahead of us, my friend and I put our name on the list and were told the wait would be around one hour. I've played Feeding Frenzy on the computer, but this place redefines that term. Got some chicken wings a couple stores down at Kyochon, and friend had a beer next door at nandarang while we passed the time. Â We came back and were seated, luckily we were seated right next to the kitchen and could beckon to any one of the waiters/waitresses whenever we needed something. Â Service was awesome considering how busy it was.They serve wild boar pork belly, which was so good, as well as black angus brisket. Â Top quality meats at a price that is pretty much unbelievable. Â Hands down the best quality for AYCE I've had personally. Â Can't really say more than what everyone else has already mentioned, but it's definitely worth coming by this way if you are hungry and looking for an excellent korean bbq experience."
7/3/2014,3 star rating,"Good food and service but they are so busy!NOTE TO SELF: 1. Brisket= good, few orders first before fatty meat comes out. 2. Thick slice pork belly= good3. Cow tongue= good, thinly sliced4. Marinated ribs= good, no bone5. Non marinated ribs= okay, no bone6. Thin slice pork belly= can't taste the pork flavor because it's too thin. 7. Pork shoulder= okay. More fatty better, need to fry longer. Come in tiny bite size pieces, more for beer food. Not worth it for ayce. 8. Squid bbq= soft and good, but two squids for 4 ppl is too much! 9. Kimchi pancake= don't get! I had plenty of better kim chi pancakes and this is not good. 10. Steamed egg= don't get! Watered down and bland11. We asked for the fried rice with kimchi + seaweed at the end (similar to dosirak minus the box and egg.)Overall: good service because they cook for you, always there for banchan refills and to order more meat, but they also have a paging button! Â Waiting to get seated after 6pm can be an hour or more. There is valet because parking there is hard or park on side streets free after 6pm."

5/19/2015,5 star rating,"My new favorite AYCE KBBQ restaurant! I was thinking that I better get the money's worth when I came in because it's pretty expensive compared to other KBBQ restaurants, but trust me, you definitely will get your money's worth here. Everything you pay is worth it! The meat is sooo good here, you can tell the quality is MUCH better than the other places, and I love steamed egg and they make it delicious. They help you cook the meat, but you can cook it yourself also so I love that part about it! Plus they don't shove it in your plate when you're done or anything, you're free to get it yourself. Other places, you either cook it all by yourself or they cook it for you and put it all in your plate without even asking. The service was great -- especially Sarah. She was so funny and kind to us and really attentive :) I don't eat spicy so she styled a fried rice at the end! I'll definitely be back whenever I'm craving KBBQ! There's street parking and valet for $2."

5/16/2015,5 star rating,"I can see why everyone says this place has great customer service because it really does. Â There's a call button at the table, but my boyfriend and I never even thought about having to use it because the waitress was so attentive and helpful.At first the $21 weekend price made me hesitant to try this place because I've always gone to another place for half the price, but all of the reviews and different food options available convinced me to give this place a try. Â Eating here today made me fall in love with it. Â I almost felt as if I was cheating on my regular Korean bbq place with Hae Jang Chon. The meats are so good and omg the kimchi fried rice that they make for you at the end on the stone...I die. Â It was delicious. Â I love seaweed, so the fact that it had shredded seaweed in it made it unbelievably good.I will definitely come back, but not as often because it is a little pricey."
5/16/2015,4 star rating,"Take this review with a grain of salt given that I came here at 2 am on a Saturday after a night out. Â The lady who seemed to be the owner was super nice and put up with 6 annoyingly drunken fools, so props to her and her service. She did however refuse us Soju since it was past 2am despite us asking several times. Lol. So don't come here expecting to get beer or soju in a tea pot after hours. The food came out quick and in my state I thought tasted good. The lady helped cook our meat on another grill seeing 6 hungry dudes. Will have to come back here and try it not after a night out"

5/16/2015,4 star rating,"I have never been to Korean BBQ before so had no idea what to expect when my friends invited me out for dinner. The minute I pulled up I KNEW it had to be a great restaurant just from the crazy line and the *minimum* 45 minute wait there was for a table- I definitely was not disappointed.When we finally got inside we were seated at a table against the back wall, I noticed the tabletop was absolutely stacked with different types of fresh sauces, traditional Korean side dishes and also rice paper rolls to wrap the eventual meat in. I also discovered that it was all you can eat! By this point I was in absolute heaven!My friends had been before so knew what was good, we ordered three servings of the Angus Beef Brisket, some Baby Octopus, Pork Belly, the Beef Bulgogi, Mushrooms as well as trying some Cow Intestine- which was surprisingly pretty good. The meat was beautifully cooked, really fresh and absolutely delicious and our servers were constantly attending to our hotplate, our drink orders and anything else we needed.I have one criticism and it is a really big deal- if there is a manager reading this you should probably have words with your staff about safe food handling when patrons have allergies.At the start of our meal I advised our server that I had a deathly allergy to shellfish and listed to her the foods that triggered it: prawns, shrimp, crab, lobster and scallops. Halfway through the meal that same server came over to our hot plate and put prawns down with the rest of the meat. Nobody had ordered it- she had mistaken something we'd said I assume. Obviously everyone freaked out because I might die, I tried to explain to her that we couldn't have it anywhere near me so she used our tongs to pick them up and take them away. We asked if the hot plate could be cleaned thoroughly, otherwise I wouldn't be able to eat anything. She then used the same, prawn tongs to touch some of the meat already on the hot plate. We managed to get her to stop enough that only some of the food was tainted and she did go and get us clean tongs and clean the plate. I also didn't think I'd eaten anything that she'd touched with the tongs... However, I woke up later that night and have spent the last two days covered in painful hives with mild angioedema. But yes, apart from that my experience was great and I will DEFINITELY be returning... but this time I will be continuously reminding the servers not to bring shellfish anywhere near me."
5/15/2015,5 star rating,"Hands down best service I have ever experienced.A group of 8 of us came here Thursday night. The wait is inevitable, but everything else after we sat down was a dream. We had, what felt like, 5 servers for our table coming around right after another watching over us like guardian angels. They were practically cooking for us, serving us, noticing we needed water, bringing everything we ask out without a hitch. I'd wait in line to come back for this kind of service! Â :) They are super polite and smile as if nothing's gonna bring them down! HahahaThe grill is awesome and instead of switching it like most other AYCE KBBQ, they clean it for you right on the spot and you can continue grilling right away.Everything was so delicious! I wish I was nott so full so that I could finish the kimchi fried rice they made us at the end of our meal! Soooo yummy!It comes out to a little over $25/person (excluding tip). All of us agreed that a large tip was well deserved! Â :)"

8/17/2013,5 star rating,"I would have to say this place is my favorite spot for AYCE KBBQ. The service here is always really good, the waiters/waitresses are very attentive even though I'm not Korean. I hate that some places only treat you like royalty because you're Korean, otherwise you get treated like dirt.I'm pretty simple when it comes to Korean BBQ as long as you have marinated beef, potato salad & green onion pancake I'm happy. They also let you pick between steam rice or kimchi fried rice at the end. I've always went with steam rice in fear of not liking my kim chi fried rice. I like that they have four different sauces, I only like the Korean pickle soy sauce one though. But they also have sesame oil, chili sauce and soybean paste. Thought it was neat that they come and clean your grill with shredded radish which absorbs the oil and scrapes off the burnt parts. They have a call button on the table if you want to get your waiter/waitresses attention. I've never had to use the button because they've always checked up on me very regularly. Only issue I have with this place is just with their parking. The lot that they have is for valet only otherwise you're on your own with street parking. I always end up with street parking instead of paying to valet. On busy nights I end up looping around a few times and eventually find a spot. I love when I get lucky and come on a slow night, parking is a stroll in the park and there is no wait for a table.Dinner is $17.99 & best part is that they close at 2am! I normally get off pretty late so this fits in to my schedule perfectly."
3/24/2014,4 star rating,"Meat, meat, meat...what else can you ask for. I've been here several times and it never fails. Well, service was a bit slow on my last trip but I forgive them, for now. Quality meat, clean restaurant and extensive side dish options that comes with the AYCE meat."
2/3/2017,5 star rating,Their beef tongue was great and servers were very nice. The chicken and pork belly were also good. The bulgogi was the only thing I didn't love but it wasn't bad
8/14/2014,4 star rating,"The staff don't speak English that well, but I don't care. Because the food rocks! The wait can be long so be sure to come early and carpool if you can.I've been to other eat-all-you-can style Koren BBQ joints but the quality of the meat can be found wanting. Not in this case. The meats were thick and of good quality. On top of that, you don't get a dirty look if you ask for more. We also had a few rounds of drinks during our meal. Even though the place was packed and there was still a long wait while we were eating, we never felt as if we were being rushed by the staff. Well maybe they just didn't know how to tell us off in English, hahaha.But honestly, I'm impressed. LA in general impresses me when it comes to Asian food."
6/3/2016,4 star rating,"All you can eat meat. As someone who is not typically drawn to this style, I was pleasantly surprised. The meat was all high quality and tasty. Cooking it yourself makes for a fun experience - good to do with a group to make sure you can finish it all! Probably wouldn't repeat because you know, ARTERIES, but still a fun time."
10/27/2016,3 star rating,"Great service and like that it's stone pot with a casual atmosphere, however their quality of meat was like a 3 out of 5. Â Really fatty and was not the all that great."
4/12/2016,4 star rating,Hae Jang Chon is by far my favorite AYCE (all you can eat) KBBQ (korean bbq) spot (no definition) in Ktown (Korea Town). There's always a damn line for a reason! If you are willing to wait a while (as all good spots in LA) you will be blessed by the Korean AYCE KBBQ gods. There is a great selection of meats that are of good quality and they have a unique style of cooking with the stone grills. Don't forget to save your belly (not the pork belly) for the kimchi fried rice at the end that is just DANK (an expression frequently used by stoners and hippies for something of high quality.) urban dictionary. Disclaimer (I am neither a stoner or hippie but I aint got a problem with them)
5/18/2017,4 star rating,"It was an okay place. I always wanted to try this place because so many people are waiting in front of the restaurant most of the time, and when I went there during the peak time, the wait time was 2 hrs. We went somewhere else because we didn't have time to wait 2 hrs. When I was finally able to go with my friends, the waiter was not friendly at all. Even my friends said that. Whenever we called him, he had a vibe that 'ugh they are calling me again...' Â but later another waiter came, and he was a lot friendlier than the first guy. The meat and food was good, but nothing to wait around for... I loved their kimchi fried rice that comes out after you are finished with meat. I'll go somewhere else if I have to wait more than 30 minutes."

7/16/2017,5 star rating,"A great Korean BBQ Restaurant. Obviously does not compare to the high end BBQ restaurants (non-AYCE) but nonetheless, decently quality and great prices.

2/17/2014,5 star rating,"Boyfriend and I came here for our third KBBQ dinner in one weekend (we love our KBBQ!). I had heard a lot about this place, so I was really excited to try it, and for the price you're paying (18.99 for a selection of 20 items!!), you really can't go wrong.We were attended to and seated right upon arrival (it was about 1:30 and we didn't have to wait for a table for two). Banchan came out and our order was taken right away. Though their banchan selection isn't as large as some other places, you have the basics and they're all tasty - quality over quantity! The AYCE also comes with kimchi pancake, steamed egg, soybean stew, kimchi fried rice, and steamed rice.We started off with beef tongue and brisket. The beef tongue was unexpectedly melt-in-your-mouth good. Brisket was good, but I probably wouldn't order that to save room for other things. The winners were definitely the thick sliced pork belly and the kalbi. I'm a huge fan of pork belly, and this hit the craving I had been having from the night before that went unsatisfied. The kalbi was PRIME kalbi - not the kind with three bones. It was the kind with one big bone and a massive slice of meat, my boyfriends favorite! I was surprised that an AYCE would place would serve kalbi and pork belly of this quality. You can tell they don't skimp on quality just because they're AYCE here. We also had pork shoulder, which I thought was good, but wouldn't order again because it's heavy and fills you up fast, and octopus that my boyfriend liked more than I did (it was a little too soft for me). You can also do half orders, which I really liked, since it was just the two of us and it made sampling different things much easier without having to worry if we could finish the portion.Service was attentive and fast - there was always someone attending to us, cooking our meats, or taking another order from us. It's the most annoying thing to sit there waiting for someone to come around and help you, and that didn't happen here. Even though they have those buzzers on the table to call service over, we didn't have to use them because we were constantly receiving service.Our total bill came out to be $45 AFTER tax (we had two Cokes as well). For that price, we definitely are our fill - 1.5 orders of prime kalbi, 1 order of thick sliced pork belly, beef tongue, brisket, octopus, and pork shoulder. Soybean stew, pancake, rice, and so much more food that I can't remember..I'm pretty sure this is hands down the best AYCE KBBQ place I've been to in LA, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great deal without having to forgo quality."
12/3/2016,5 star rating,"This place is hands-down my favorite Korean BBQ place! It is reasonably priced - $24 per person for dinner, and has a vast variety of meats to choose from - including one of my favorites, the thin sliced pork belly!! I am surprised not all kbbq places carry this meat choice- it is literally like grilling thin pieces of bacon, and it cooks super fast! The traditional pork belly is delicious, but it honestly takes way too long to cook. By the time it's ready, I've already filled buckets with my drool :( This place also has all of the typical cuts of beef and chicken, along with squid and octopus. But the best part of the meal comes at the very end - the servers will make kimchi fried rice on your grill (with all the amazing fatty oils left on your grill for extra flavor). **A special tip for the kimchi fried rice - order some of the spicy BBQ pork right before making the fried rice. The spicy pork is cut super thin and is almost like ground pork. If you ask the server to combine this bad boy with the kimchi fried rice, you will create the most amazing fried rice you've ever had! I'm surprised that the restaurant never realized this.. they can make some serious money on this dish alone!!!"
4/30/2016,1 star rating,They told us the wait would be about an hour. We understood it would be long because it's the weekend but this is ridiculous!!! We waited well over 2hours. He should of told us it's over an hour not about an hour. We wasted so much time here. It's freezing out. He management is bad. They kept seating the small tops instead of our big top. Food is not that great for almost 3 hour wait.
1/23/2017,3 star rating,"Food was very tasty! The grill/pan itself was cool and different from usual kbbq places. The service was quick, but the only thing I didn't like was they servers did NOT want us touching/cooking the food. They would stop up and say ""no!"" Which was weird because i thought kbbq is where the customers cook their own food the way they like it? The servers would cook the brisket and when they believe its done cooking they gestured us to eat it. And when i left some on the grill to get a crisp, they placed it on my plate ): the servers seemed to rush as us well which isnt pleasant. overall, great food but i rather cook it on my own..."
5/26/2014,5 star rating,"So worth the 2 hour wait.Service was excellent and attentive,Our server knew we liked the clear wraps and she bought us an extra plate without us having to ask for it.They even come around and help you with the cooking.Will be coming back.Valet parking is only $2"
2/27/2014,3 star rating,"Tried this place for the first time about a week ago.Their brisket, Â squid, pork belly and spicy pork (on the menu, it said pork bulgogi. Didn't indicate spicy) was pretty delicious. On the other hand, marinated kalbi was full of fatty tissues and hard to chew, so I had to spit out most of it. The service....they are very attentive, Â helps you with the cooking and cutting the meat. Â But at the same time, I couldn't enjoy my food at my own paste, because I felt very rushed. Maybe I'll try this place again someday. ...not anytime soon."

Â Surprised last time that we were declined by the waiter when we try to order more shrimp, and then Â (We did order shrimp 4 times, but it is all you can eat after all?).Overall I find service much worse than meat at this place, save yourself the 3-star experience and just go to some other KBBQ place."
7/30/2016,5 star rating,"My girlfriend and I went here after universal and it was AMAZING! Expect a long wait, but it was totally worth it. Very reasonable ayce price and good quality meat. We personally liked the briskets (who doesn't) and the thin slice pork belly. The service was good considering the volume. They really do a good job on getting to everyone and food comes out fast. Can't wait for our next trip! Ish was dankkkkkk"
10/15/2016,5 star rating,Hands down my favorite Ayce kbbq! The meat quality is always fresh and the service here is on point every time I've been here!

It didn't seem full in the restaurant so don't know what was the hold up.There were open tables everywhere. They must've run out of something.Price is decent but the wait wasn't worth it.
12/16/2018,5 star rating,"This place is amazing and authentic Korean BBQ. With awesome service! Not very expensive as well! Great food! I have never seen any restaurant that has service as good as this place. One of my friends burnt her finger and the waitress saw it, then handed her an ice bag to cool her wound. We didn't ask for it. They did completely out of their own will. This is something that can't be trained at any restaurant. This is a reflection of how nice they are! Definitely worth coming thru :)"
9/6/2018,4 star rating,Really good! I love that you can pick 3 different meats at a time so you don't waste anything! There's plenty to try. My favorite was the short ribs. I don't really like their kimchi fried rice or kimchi pancakes.. the kimchi was too sour for my liking but overall service is really good and the sides/bibimbap it comes with it's plentiful and good!
5/7/2017,5 star rating,Best BBQ in LA hands down! Nuff said. Best quality meat first and every time after that! Best customer service! Parking only 2$. Prices are very reasonable on meats and drinks! Keep up to good work Guys!
1/18/2015,4 star rating,"Don't let the crowded entrance steer you away. Stopped by on a Friday night with a party of 2 & waited about an hour and a half. No reservations, so a long wait is expected. We patiently waited over a few drinks at Beer Belly two blocks down on Western (try the bacon fries). Once seated, sides were present & the stone top grill was fired up. Our waitress seemed to have had a shitty night as she came off as peeved during the entire service. Â Whatever, As long as the food kept coming, I was happy. Our menu choices included Brisket, pork belly, bulgogi, short ribs, marinated and unmarinated steak. Brisket and marinated steak were my favorite. The bulgogi was, ehh. Kimchi pancakes are a must. 21.99 all you can eat dinner. Definitely worth going again. Also, make sure to eat all your meat or else they'll hit you with a $15 charge."

8/30/2016,3 star rating,"As you walk in, you see lots of round tables that can seat up to 6 people. Â Now, with 6 people, they allow you to make reservations... but wait. They have so may rules I can't list them all. I guess I should have take a picture of the guidelines. Anyway, your whole party must all be present, you have a 15 min grace period and if someone doesn't show, your reservation automatically gets cancelled. Â That's few of the 10,000 rules they have. As for the food, it was good quality, but you are paying a higher price at $23.99/pp compared to the other ayce places and your server comes around often to cook the meat for you. Maybe I just haven't been in Ktown that often lately, but man I was so happy to get out of there. It was so noisy with all the food cooking, the TV, music blaring, and people talking, I couldn't even hear my husband across the table. Even our server sounded as if she lost her voice. The meat quality was good, but nothing to write home about.Food 4 starsService 4 starsatmosphere 3only 1 stall bathroom for a restaurant full of ppl 1noise level 1"
10/12/2014,2 star rating,"If you have to dine & entertain your enemies that you're forced to sleep with, bring them here. Food is relatively cheap (for Korean food) and edible but blahhh.....1. Bulgogi was marinated way too sweet. Onions weren't caramelized. The meat was cheap low quality. But I'll let that fly, since this order was only $8-10 (can't remember)2. The spicy pork and squid was better but still on the sweet side. But onions were slightly more caramelized than bulgogi.3. The fermented bean soup didn't have much of the well aged, deep, and sweet fermented bean. It was thin and salty.4. The spinach that's served as the banchan and the barley tea were the best items at this Korean BBQ joint."
3/10/2014,5 star rating,"This place was highly recommended to me by my Korean pharmacist who had moved to the valley from LA. So I know this place had to be good. Â It was located in the nicer part of Korea town which made us feel safer about where we parked.Date visited: 3-8-14 (Saturday)Time: afternoon about 1:34pmGroup size: 3 adults + 1 toddler Upon arrival I noticed a sign on the wall saying reservations recommended because of how quickly the restaurant gets full. But when I arrived with my family, I signed my name on the waiting list only to learn the restaurant still had plenty of free tables so we were quickly seated. A quick glance at the menu revealed that we could order meal items and/or choose the all you can eat option. Just be sure to read all the fine print! ($15 extra charge for wasting meat)Interior decor: to me was adorable. Murals on every wall that made me feel like I was in a forest full of autumn leaves turned gold & red/orange. Even the bathroom is a cute starry sky over a wheat field. And a whimsical lit tree in the middle of the place. The grill: was old school made of stone. And it was good. Cooking this way imparted a different type of flavor to your food that I can't quite explain. Â And on top of that our waitress cleaned it with some kind of daikon and water mix half way through our meal to eliminate burnt sauces from previous marinades. Staff: was attentive. We had two consistent people always coming to check on our table and ask if we needed anything, or refills on side dishes. Or ""how is everything so far?"" And they would flip our meats and cook them and when it was done they would cut it into bite size pieces and leave it so we knew it was ready to eat. Takes all the guess work out of cooking!Delicious food discoveries: their kimchi pancake turned out to be my fav! Â And their kimchi is way more authentic than the stuff I buy at the grocery store. Â The thick cut pork belly wrapped in the rice paper with the side sauces were amazing. And BBQ chicken was tender, a fav. For my little one. I would highly recommend only sharing one bowl of rice with everyone and fill up on the meats & sides. **as with all baking and BBQ places, it gets warm inside from all the cooking so be sure to dress lightly and enjoy!!**"
1/14/2017,3 star rating,"I haven't tried the food yet, but if the food is amazing the highest I would give is 3 stars because of the false ""reservations"" they offer. 30 min after our reservation we are still waiting.. after we were told our party would be delegated because there were not enough tables #disappointed"
1/14/2017,4 star rating,"I came here around 3pm today and the wait wasn't too long. Parking is valet and it costs $2, but I didn't mind it too much. My favorite meats were the beef tongue, brisket, bugolgi, and marinated short ribs. The service was very fast paced and we didn't really have to cook our own meat so that is definitely a plus for me. The only downside is the meat took a bit longer to come out at times. Either than that I have no complaints and I'll definitely come back."

8/8/2013,4 star rating,"Some people complain about this place - the wait, the quality of meat, etc. - but I have never ever had a problem, and I've been here eight times or so. On my last visit, it was a Monday or Tuesday night and there was no wait at all. We were seated right away (the first time that's ever happened to me here!)I didn't notice the meat being any better or poorer quality than any prior visit. They will relatively courteously bring you as much of any menu selection as you want, and come by periodically to cut up or flip the meat (though being a Korean BBQ expert, I usually just do this myself). I agree with others' comments that you have to specifically and pointedly ask for the tofu soup and kimchee fried rice at the end of the meal. If you don't, they won't bother bringing it to you, especially if you are obviously non-Korean (they assume you wouldn't know any better). As it was, on this occasion I asked for both. They brought them, but evidenced a tiny bit of reluctance/ less-than-stellar attitude. Still, I'll keep coming back... it's good, reliable and affordable AYCE BBQ!"

1/9/2014,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite AYCE KBBQ places. Consistently great meat, great service. Love that the lettuce is served as salad - just makes eating the meat with lettuce so much more easier. I LOVE that you get four different sauces! That's my favorite part. Great to switch it up. Each sauce is awesome. I always bring people here now - especially newbies who've never had KBBQ before. The quality of meat has been consistently great (except for the brisket ... sometimes fattier than others). The banchan has never disappointed (sometimes the spinach and bean sprout side dishes at other places taste like they're going bad). Always a great vibe. Better ventilated than any other KBBQ place I've been to. Love the decor. The wait is usually tough, but it's always worth it. I just wish they served dessert, but you can head to Haus across the street. And it's probably for the best to keep the tables flipping. If you're feeling a little adventurous, but not intenstines-adventurous, try the beef tongue. It's like thicker, chewier brisket. Seriously, it's sooooooo good and super addicting. I usually go in this order: brisket, galbi, beef tongue, pork belly, then whatever spicy BBQ people feel like. Next time going to try the shoulder ^_^"
3/8/2017,5 star rating,"Honestly, this is probably the best kbbq place I've been too. The meat and the side dishes are on point! And they had FISHCAKE! I LOVE FISHCAKE!!!

7/23/2014,3 star rating,"Came here for dinner Saturday night.Pulled up to valet parking for $2. We didn't mind because parking looked difficult, so it was kind of nice to have the valet take over that situation.We were seated about 15-20 minutes later (a nice surprise because there were a lot of people waiting and we thought it would be much longer). The host really moved the line of waiting crowds along quickly, which we appreciated.The banchan was already waiting for us at our table. There was a dish of spicy kimchi and bean sprouts, slivered pickled radish, fish cakes, potato salad, and rice wraps and radish wraps. I wasn't too crazy about any of it. Most of the banchan were too spicy for me to enjoy. I normally love the bean sprouts and fish cakes, but couldn't really get into them here because they instantly set my mouth on fire. My boo normally loves the potato salad but Hae Jang's version was not good. It was bland and flavorless and we didn't care for the sweetness of the apples in it. The salad and the egg pot, however were quite delicious. There were four dipping sauces and I really enjoyed three of the four--this was a plus for me.As for the meats, we ordered only brisket and bulgogi. The brisket was shaved in large, meaty pieces that when cooked, just melted in our mouths. Succulent and tender and moist! The bulgogi, however, was really fatty and I found several pieces that I couldn't chew through because they were heavily ribboned with tough gristle. The marinade for the bulgogi wasn't particularly flavorful either. I ust stopped eating it after a few bites.As for the service, at the beginning we sat there for about 20 minutes all by ourselves with no servers acknowledging us or making eye contact. And our table was right in the middle of the restaurant. My boo said he thought they were snubbing us on purpose to discourage us from returning. That didn't make sense to me because everyone else around us seemed to be getting great service. We were the only table being ignored. When I asked a waitress who was passing by our table for service, however, she was really nice and ended up serving us politely for the rest of the evening. The stone grills here cook the meat thoroughly and quickly, but the servers do everything for you and tell you when the meat is ready. My boo and I like a little crispness on the meat, and we kind of wanted the meat to cook longer. We wish the servers would have let the meat go for longer. I like to say when the meat is done to our liking, not to be told when it is done.This place is great for:--delicious brisket--yummy salad and egg pot--varied dipping sauces--eating late--not cooking the meats yourself (our waitress cooked our meats and would tell us when it was ready)This place is not good for:--enjoying varied banchan (these went from spicy to spicier -- there was no nuance in flavors)--bulgogi--cooking the meats yourself to your likingWe might return, but there a couple of other places we prefer to this one."
5/22/2016,5 star rating,Probably the best AYCE Korean BBQ place I've been to! Well I've mostly frequented ones in SD and the bay so I guess I can't really compare but this place blew all the other places out of the water! It's a bit more expensive than other places at 23.99? And not as many meat choices but the quality plus the service were all bomb. I think I like this place mostly for the service. They would actually cut the meat for you here and they were super fast. I was trying to cut the pork belly myself and the waiter took the scissors from my hands and cut it in like 3 secs. I love how attentive they are. Like they know when to get you more meat or side dishes quit even asking. The kimchi fried rice at the end was of course just amazing. It was a good way to finish off the meal. I loved eating right off the plate mmmm it just needed an egg.Will recommend and keep coming back!
7/9/2012,3 star rating,"I tried their all you can eat/Ayce bbq for lunch. All I can comment on is a Meh!Good quality meat, great 19 items included in the less than $20 all you can eat menu. But none of them really stood out for me. I ordered beef ribs, port belly, baby squid,and beef honeycomb (Which I had no idea what it is. And for people who do not like belly or any animal organs, DO NOT ORDER). My biggest problem with their bbq meat are the source. They dont really marinate their meat, even the ones they do, they don't really have strong flavors. So that was kinda disappointing. So far I think my favorite is still honey pig. But I guess you get what you paid for, for $20 this is not a bad deal. PS: they do not provide mouthwash in their restroom, WHAT?! You are a Korean BBQ place, you cant ""torture"" your customer like this. Come on! :P"

Â If you order the AYCE, you get to select from 19 different meat options. Â We went for our standard chadulbakgi, seasoned and unseasoned galbi. Â The banchan was very lacking on this day we went. Â I notice someone said they had lot of banchan, but they only had 4 banchans on this day. Â Along with the banchan, there is a bowl of salad, rice cake wrapper, dipping sauces. Â You'll have to ask for garlic if you want some.They placed the soy bean sprouts and aged kimchi on the grill. They also brought steamed egg. Â As for the meat goes, I would recommend you skip the seasoned galbi - it wasn't the best. Â They also have unseasoned pork meat chunks, which was good. Service was okay, could have been better. Â You end the meal with them making kimchi fried rice on the grill and they serve miso soup.I'm not sure if I'll re-visit, but with so many Korean BBQ's in LA, it'll be a while before I make my return trip."
1/10/2010,3 star rating,"To start this review off, I LOVE Korean BBQ! But I had to dock it for a few reasons. Lack of staff; I was there around 6pm on a weekday and there were 5 other tables of at least 4 people and 1 waitress... it wasn't untill 7:30 that I finally saw 3 more waitresses. The temperature of the whole place was freezing too, their door that lead the the patio kept swinging open and letting the air in, sadly it was the only table that they were serving. Another negative that I think is it's size.... the valet guy said that at night there's a line around the corner that has a wait for an hour and a half, I can see why because it can only hold like 80 people, when other places I've been can house much more with just as many options and price.The plus is their brisket is sooo good. It's the best I've had in LA. It's sad because I see their ad in LA Weekly every week and it looks like such a great deal. It is, but with everything I dealt with I'd rather go to my other place. One last thing that is a neutral comment is that their BBQ is a stone slab instead of the grill that I'm used to using. It made A LOT of smoke too and they didn't service the plate till 2 other tables left. poo. Enjoy it or not, Korean BBQ is still good, but everyone has their faves, this just isn't one of mine."
6/12/2010,2 star rating,"The meats seemed to be of poor quality and they were all very fatty... they also serve you hot dogs - yes, american hot dogs. The best part of this place is their kim chi fried rice, where they save the best for last, which is stopping me from giving 1 star."
6/14/2010,4 star rating,"For a long time, I heard my friends talk about this one really great AYCE KBBQ place. They couldn't remember the name, but remembered there was a giant pig on the sign. So that's what they called it: that pig place.Parking was not easy in the local area, but valet parking was only $2. The interior was very nice, and our wait for 4 people on a weekday night was relatively short. The sides were good, the usual fare at Korean restaurants. I won't go into detail with all the meats, since most are the same as what's available elsewhere. I'll say that the marinated bulgogi was extremely succulent and tender, and I've never had comparable bulgogi at any other KBBQ places.Service was good, waiters were friendly, and extensive English was used!"
8/6/2010,4 star rating,"Ambience 4/5Nice environment, place is pretty clean minus the restroom, which is only one stall and really dirty, but other than the restroom, place is clean and looks cool. The walls have pictures and frames of I assume famous people who came here or guest. They use this stone grill to cook the food on which is quite different from a lot of korean bbq places, something different which is goodFood - 4/5My friends and I chose the all you can eat, which has 19 items on the list! Damn! that is a lot. Food taste great, no argument there, but like most korean bbq places, it taste the same. We ordered the angus brisket, short ribs, and pork belly...good. Not much there on the appetizers but I guess they do that for the huge selection of meats they have for you. In the end the waitress cooks some kimchi fried rice which tasted great.Service 5/5One of the best places with excellent service. They prepare some appetizers for you in the beginning and they place some kimchi on the grill for you in the beginning. The waitress is extra nice, she kept coming back and cooking for us, always made sure everything was ok.13/15....overall great place and would come back here with friends"
10/4/2010,3 star rating,"We went on a Sunday and it was fairly crowded but luckily we made a reservation. I like the stone grill it was something different that I haven't seen at a Korean bbq place. Their sides were good. I like their potatoes salad, Â the spicy fish cake, and the kimchi pancake. I actually did not like the kimchi fried rice at all. Â Also, this place had rice noodle so that was a plus to the place. Now bring on the meats, the meats were just okay and that was not good cause if we are heading to a Korean bbq ayce. The meat's quality was lacking in flavors and I didn't think it compares to other places I been to around the area. Also, the service was kind of slow. However, I really like how they clean up the grill after every plate order. It made the grill all nice and pretty for the next round. All in all, it was just okay!"
12/6/2010,4 star rating,"The food was good for $16.99 and they had 19 pieces of meat to choose from, but not all the selection was great. Â I like the idea of the food cooking on a stone grill...it made the meat more tender and yummy. Â The only down side was their cheapo rectangular grill which took forever to cook the meat with, and it's fire was not evenly distributed on that grill. Â I tasted the meat from both grill, and the meat cooked on the stone grill tasted a whole lot better. Â I wasn't a big fan of the kimchi fried rice. Â It was okay and too salty with this strange after taste, but maybe because it didn't suit my taste buds. Â The soup that came with it was super salty too...too much MSG. Â By the time you get to the fried rice portion, you would be too full to enjoy it!"
2/28/2011,4 star rating,"Love this place! So good, but make sure you're not a vegetarian =POnly down point is to make sure you make reservations, it's usually packed, especially on the weekends"
4/30/2011,3 star rating,"I would have given this place 5 stars, but their HORRIBLE service definitely left me very unhappy.First of all, the waiting time is RIDICULOUS. Â The girl at the front can never give you a proper waiting time. Â She tells you to wait half an hour, then when you go ask her how much longer you have to wait after 45 minute, she gives you this exasperated look and tells you that she's not sure and you'll just have to wait. Â Once you FINALLY get seated, the service staff act like they're either better than you or don't want to work anymore. Â Either way, all I can say is that they need to be thankful for their thick-cut pork belly...Once you're close to finishing your meal though, you tend to forget about the bad service and the girl at the front. Â By the time they bring out the rice and start frying at your table's grill, it's all history."
6/24/2011,4 star rating,"Located in a plaza I've been to a million times. Parking here is a biatch but they have valet to take care of it. The line is usually 15-20 mins at night but its pretty worth it.Service is good, side dishes yummy, meat is great for the price you pay. I love the atmosphere. Definitely a good place for a big group and the prices are right around what you'd expect to pay for all you can eat (~$17-25) depending on what else you order (drinks, etc)."
8/13/2011,4 star rating,"Loud... definitely loud. A touch crowded... 8 around a pair of tables, tops. The secondary grill on the extension table is just a portable stove, so not the greatest-- if you can keep your groups small enough to only use the real grills with the lovely hot stones it's pretty good.Avoid the thin sliced pork belly, it wasn't as bacony as we were hoping, even after ample grilling til crisp. And the banchan is good but a bit limited in choice? It felt like it was missing something.The rest, though, was pretty good. Marinated galbi was very good, brisket was surprisingly tasty, the squid was delicious. The thick-sliced pork belly is a solid above average-- definitely not the best, but not bad. 'bout the only letdowns were the tripe (flavorless) and the beef tongue, which was merely passable.Add in the fried rice on the stone grill and, well, it's pretty good. This place wasn't nearly as busy 6 months or a year ago, but whatever they seem to have done evidently merits its praise and its crowds.The 10% off for repeat customers within a month is nice, too."
12/15/2010,2 star rating,"Kimchi pancake is good... but keep in mind it's just a kimchi pancake! No seafood! A coworker liked 'em so much though that we hit the house limit per table for pancakes! o_0Service is pretty good and cooking on a hot stone is a little different. I can say I didn't particularly care for it, as it was hard to get the food seared nicely. Servers also had a hard time understanding that we wanted more rice paper... bit odd.Galbi was okay. Beef tongue was also just okay. The brisket wasn't bad, and the selection of 2 dipping sauces plus hot sauce and bean paste for every person was convenient. Baby octopus was decent. The pork belly was only so-so-- probably 'cause we had a hard time getting it cooked hot enough, and the beef abomasum was much tougher than I expected.Novelty: they have hotdogs on the menu. That's right. Hot dogs. Just plain 'ol hotdogs, not even Ballparks...Steamed egg was purely forgettable.I really wanted to like this place after all the good things I'd heard about it. The way it adds up though, even while we were eating it... I just had a hard time bringing this place beyond an average for AYCE Korean BBQ, and thinking about it more... it's not quite even average. Of course, part of that is just because so many other AYCE places here are sooo good..."
8/14/2011,5 star rating,"WOW, I think this is one of the best AYCE KBBQ places I've been to when you consider the price, the service, the selection, the quality and the whole place in general. Â Plus, they're open until 2AM! They have a HUGE selection of meat, which is great! Â It includes all the normal stuff chadol(brisket), galbi(marinated and unmarinated), beef tongue, pork belly (thin and thick, my personal fave), bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken, even octopus, intestine and hotdogs. haha I'm sure I left several out, but let's just say that this place got a LOT of quality ingredients with a lot of choices as well. Â The service is excellent. Â They all kind of work as a team, so everything is fast and efficient and they are always SO quick to bring the stuff you need, including the meat. Â When I went I went with the expert AYCE bbq strategist so we ended up putting away plates and plates and plates as in 5+ plates of meat. Â The tip is to order your next round of meat right when you get the new meat, that way you have a constant flow of meat. Â This is key! hahaTheir salad is really good and everything was fresh and delicious. Â We were celebrating a birthday so it was really nice of them to bring our cake out with candles playing that crazy birthday song and gave us plates and a knife to eat it with. Â Another cool thing to point out is that they make the kimchi bokeum bap (kimchi fried rice) at the end which is DELICIOUS. Â That, and the dwengjang chigae at the end perfects the meal.It's all pretty cheap, I paid 30 bucks at the end including tax and tip and sharing 5 bottles of soju and 2 hites. Â Can't wait to come back again!Oh, BTW if you like your dinners quiet, this isn't the place for you. Â It's loud as a club inside, music on full blast, but fear not, it's all top 40s including korean hits so I actually enjoyed bobbing my head and dancing while I was eating. ;)"
10/23/2011,5 star rating,"I took my family here last night and I was impressed by the level of service, quality of meats, and, of course, the finish with kimchi fried rice. This AYCE place but for a single price you get access to all the types of meat from brisket to pork belly to even sausage. Some AYCE have tiered pricing where you only get certain meats at tiered prices. One price = all meats = better value.The side dishes were all great including the spinach, salad, kimchi, and steamed egg. My one and only disappointment was the soy bean soup, which tasted very ""instant""; however, I did not come here to have soy bean soup.Overall, I would come here again, again, and again = unless something changes."
11/30/2011,5 star rating,"Hands down, the best AYCE Korean BBQ place you will find in LA. I haven't found another place that had been able to top the great food and awesome service here. But first things first, if you try to eat here during dinner time, YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT. There's always a large number of people anxiously waiting and attempting not to salivate at the smell of fresh, roasting meat. Send someone in your party to grab a table and valet park for $2. For $16.99, you have your choices of practically any kind of meat you could find in a KBBQ restaurant. Bulgogi, short ribs, marinated short ribs, pork belly, pork shoulder (my fav!), brisket, bbq chicken, tripe, beef tongue, squid, etc. And it's good quality meat too. You're allowed to choose 4 at a time, and your waiter will consistently come over to check up on you and help you prepare your meat. Besides meat, you also have unlimited access to banchan (side dishes) which include kimchi, potato salad, kimchi pancake, fresh salad, odeng, rice paper and radish paper. Oh, and you get kimchi jjigae and that egg dish (I don't know what it's called). At the end of the meal, they will make kimchi fried rice for you if you ask. Save a little bit of leftover meat if you wish to mix it in with the kimchi fried rice.There really isn't anything negative I can say about this place. Every time I've been here, I've had great service where the waiters were fast-working and attentive. The only negative thing I could really say is how much agony I'm in while waiting where I must smell the fresh meat cooking and see other patrons scarfing their food down while I'm stuck outside the window staring at them. Just kidding, that's creepy. Heh,I don't do that."
2/12/2012,2 star rating,"This place is overrated!Their service is OK but I HATE how you have to wait at least 45 min to 1 hour, even WITH a reservation. What is the point of a reservation?The quality of meat is not even that great!The kimchi fried rice in the end is probably what draws a lot of people's attention to try this restaurant. Other than that, why not go elsewhere? It's ktwn, there's a kbbq restaurant on every corner.Price-wise, it's not bad $16.99 for all you can eat- so make sure you get your money's worth. On the upside- they have a private lot with valet..."
2/16/2012,5 star rating,"Along with Moodaepo II, this is one of my favorite AYCE korean bbq places. Â Their banchan are the best of the AYCE places and I love the beef tongue and brisket here.Be prepared to wait a while especially if you come on the weekends.

2/29/2012,4 star rating,now I am not one to like Korean BBQ...actually it would be the LAST choice on my food list.BUT THIS PLACE IS THE BEST IVE ever had in terms of AYCE Korean BBQ!
3/7/2012,5 star rating,"LOVE LOVE this place. Â The small restaurant can get pretty crowded bu I love the all you can eat BBQ prices, quality of the meat. Â A waiter also comes in and cleans all the gunk off your grille between every meat change/plate of meat with radishes (it's awesome to see). Â Plus the service is exceptional, friendly, and fast!My Favorite part of the night comes from the delicious soup and fried rice at the end. Â It's by far my favorite!! Â So I try not to get TOO full so that I can eat the delicious treats at the end of the meal.Great for crowds, dinners, any occassion! Â Just make sure to grab reservations in advance =)"
3/10/2012,4 star rating,awesome AYCE KBBQ. The meat and chicken were fabulous. Staff helpful and completely cook your meal on a hot flat metal grill which cooks up nicely and it's all you can eat topped off by kimchee fried rice. We got there at 6:45PM and by 7:10 PM it was packed. The banchan is totally yummy and flavored just right.
4/30/2012,4 star rating,"I came here about a week ago I think.I wouldn't eat KOREAN BBQ on a late night... but ended upstopping by around 10:30 PM haha.It was packed!!! We made reservations but apparentlystill needed to wait around 10-15 minutes butthat's because we were a big crowd.When I first heard about the marinated squid, I was like,YUMMY! and I tried it... it was so not yummy.. it was YUCKY.It didn't suit my taste buds... I was disappointed.I was really excited about their banchan (side dishes) though!I love the ... potato salad thingie? Those are always dibs for me.The other banchan was just whatever but there was so manyit was overwhelming and wonderful!I of course love my chadol (brisket) and I can't recall... I thinkit had a bit too much fat on it... :/ I don't like fat.I got some on me too :/ but I have sang gyup sal! Â shhh!I don't think we tried the sang gyup sal at this specific location.They had JJOO GOO MI Â (WHAT!!) I know right.. the whole piecesof baby octopus?!They are my ultimate favorite living creatures of the sea to eat, cooked.I know it sounds weird, but I like the head O.O it just bursts intoyour mouth with flavor.Let me tell you... no flavor burst into my mouth that night... it was PASTY!ew... I know... writing this review... makes me think of that night.I didn't even want to try the tentacles... (my 2nd favorite part).I usually even eat it whole all together! That's the best...Of course I do like my short ribs! Those chunky pieces of sweet meat...mmmm savorryy!The waiter seemed to know the group I was with so had plenty of serviceand that was great:)Unfortunately, I had to leave around 12 in the morning because I had a lamehistory test to take at 8 in the morning!I definitely want to come back here sometime with less people and havethe option to order my way :P"
2/15/2014,3 star rating,"Heard that this place was really good but I felt a bit disappointed. When my boyfriend and I arrived it was a two hour wait, which is usual for a busy kbbq place. The waiter we had was super awesome but the food was just okay. Brisket was dry, short rib and bulgogi was under marinated but loved the spicy pork! It was amazing along with kimchi pancake."
6/14/2014,3 star rating,"Seems packed, so our group decided to give it a try. Come on weekends and there will be a long wait. The KBBQ is a bit different than most places as in the choices you get, like you can opt for a hot dog. Stone grills are used which gives the meat a slightly better taste. They can't change out the grills, but at your request, the servers will clean the surface with a radish. Not all so wow that how crowded it is makes it hyped up to be. It's an AYCE type of place."
4/16/2014,4 star rating,"From what I recall, Â this place is a solid four stars for the food. Service wasn't bad either. Â Our water, banchan, and lettuce were always refilled.Go btwn 12pm & 5pm. Park on the street.Come hungry, Â but expect a wait. Wear comfy stuff, you'll smell like bbq and feel fat afterward.Ask for specifics, Â for example, Â if you'd like the egg, soup or pancake and you're at fried rice, Â they may have forgotten, Â do ask.Enjoyed this place overall more than other ktown bbqs and would be back. :)"
8/30/2013,4 star rating,"Come as early as possible, by 7pm there will be a line waiting for a table and you need your whole party together even if you have a reservation. Â Valet parking in front, for $2, otherwise street parking if you can find on 6th street or close by. Â  Look for the happy pig sign.I really like the quality of the food here, they have great tasting banchan, with fresh crunchy kimchee and tasty potato salad. Â We ordered additional pancakes which were awesome and were seated just before the dinner crowd on a Thurs night. Â Other appetizers were the steamed egg and tofu skins which were just as good as any other place. AYCE costs $18.99 per person, and in my opinion it's some of the best quality of the AYCE places. Â My favorite was definitely the short rib, which tastes like ribeye, and the beef brisket. Â The chicken was also really good but by the time we got around to that I was already full and only had a little. Â The pork shoulder was also really good and tender, worth saving your appetite for next time too. Â In between the cooking, the waitress will come around and clean the stone grill with radishes, which is a show in itself and pretty handy. Â They also have an electric bell to call the waitress over so you're not wasting time waiting for them to come around with refills. Â At the end the waitress comes and you can request fresh table made kim chee fried rice as the very last thing. Â Otherwise, no dessert but you can always walk across the street to Haus if there's enough room in your belly and you really want.Great quality, excellent service but seriously bring an appetite or starve yourself because the food is good and you may feel bad you didn't come hungry."
3/2/2014,4 star rating,"We ended up here because EMC was packed and in retrospect, it worked out pretty well cause I now have another Korean BBQ place I can add to my list of favorites. You can't miss this place, there's a giant PIG on their sign out front AND it's directly across from Dessert Haus. We got here maybe around 5-530'ish on a Saturday night and the wait time was about 30 minutes? and this is for a party of about 8, so already that's a PLUS! The grill here is stone and slants on one side so that helps drain the fat/oil. They have a pretty great selection of meat as well! I was thrown off a bit by their option for thin or thick pork belly; I've only ever had the thick ones. We tried the thin just to see and let's just say I wasn't missing much; the thick was and is still the winner in my book. Tongue, brisket, short rib were great. Octopus was good, too. I forget which other ones we ordered but overall, everything was appetizing and fulfilling. At the end of the meal, they'll fry you up some kimchi fried rice on your grill so don't forget to save room for that!"

2/20/2014,3 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon has fallen a long way from the throne of KBBQ on which it use to sit. While the quality of meat is still superb, there are a ton of other KBBQ joints that have good quality meat for a lower price. It used to be priced standard fare but the prices have been rising gradually due to its increase in popularity.The service is also pretty meh. Even on a slow day, I have to ask servers multiple times for the same thing. Hae Jang Chon just isn't exceptional anymore. There are a ton of other restaurants you can go to to get the same thing for a lower price or for better at the same price. I don't think I'd ever come back unless one of my friends really, strongly insisted."

4/14/2014,5 star rating,"Echoing all those before me, the best kbbq I've ever had. I'm a sucker for 10$ AYCE places (literally tried all of them) and they're good yes, but the quality at this majestic gem, the meat, the sides, the EVERYTHING was just leagues ahead of anything I've ever had. It's pricey, around 23$ including everything, but if you go in ready to commit this money, you get your money's worth and soooo much more. The quality really is unbeatable. Like seriously, everything I put into my mouth tasted like it was touched by the gods. Everything.What's good: everything. literally. even the chicken was so tender when i hate chicken. particularly the octopus and shrimp were good. also kimchi pancake, best one i've ever had. omg this was heaven just writing about it makes me cry tears of joy.Ambiance and service were all superb. They cook for you and they really take care of you! And one more note, I went with a group of 6 at around midnight and there was still groups of people waiting until they closed. This place is bangin' so plan ahead! Hands down, best kbbq all this hype does it justice ^_^"
10/13/2013,4 star rating,I really enjoyed my dinner here. I came with 7 friends and was able to make a reservation because I was a part of a large party. They seated us a little late but not terribly. They scrambled tables around for us so they were trying. Service was quite good. The early dishes were good. I always love the small side dishes. Their steamed egg and kimchi pancakes are truly phenomenal. It's worth coming here just for those. The meats were tasty and came in huge quantities. We couldn't even get through all the various types of meats they offered. We tried the beef tongue which was good. They also had stomach and intestines which we didn't try. Their kimchi fried rice at the end was great too. They added additional veggies and seaweed.
10/1/2013,5 star rating,"I'm a regular when it comes to kbbq in k-town, and this place is hands down my favorite. Price for all day is $18.99, worth it. They have the best variety of bbq-able foods, their brisket is just perfect. Other than always getting at least 3-4 plates of that, we usually get pork belly, kalbi, bulgogi, and finally tried squid the other day (deliciously marinated, best squid I've ever eaten at a kbbq place). I actually have never had trouble finding parking, always lucky to find street parking and even when my friends or I park inside, it's only $2! Service here is really great, they refil side dishes and brings over the steamed eggs and kimchi pancakes without you ever asking, always prompt with taking more orders and cleaning the stone grill constantly before your new plate of meat arrives. And to top it all off, delicious kimchi fried rice. Come hungry, leave hungry for more."

11/2/2014,4 star rating,"I came in with a group of friends for lunch. We came in and didn't have to wait to get seated, since we came in before the lunch rush. All 4 of us did the AYCE for $19.99. All of us left two hours later with happy bellies. Some highlights:- They had over 20 items to choose from. The marinated beef and thin slices of pork belly were really good. - Our server came by and flipped the meat over for us and cut it up when it was done. She was very attentive without being overbearing and refilled our water often.- Make sure to order lettuce and perilla leaves to wrap your grilled meat in. It's an extra $5 but well worth it. I like putting a couple of pieces of meat with some of the bean paste and chili sauce and a bit of radish banchan in my wrap. Yum!A solid KBBQ spot. I'm definitely coming back when I return to LA."
9/29/2015,5 star rating,MUST TRY!!!!! We waited almost three hours on a Friday night because there was was big party that was there forever. But it was definately worth the wait. There's no time limit which is a plus! All you can eat without being rushed! And the servers are so friendly. Made the experience even better.

The food itself is delicious, and things are a bit different than usual because they use a stone plate with a drip pan rather than the metal ones. The service is what's outstanding. I totally expected to do it all myself, but really, you get doted on here (they cook and cut for you), and pushing the button gets you multiple servers at once. All the servers are so nice and pleasant! Price is $24.99/per at dinner, parking is valet only due to the popularity, and street parking is non-existent. My favorites included the spicy pork and octupus, and the ban chan are on point!"
12/23/2015,5 star rating,Aahh manns... where do I begin.. Great food and excellent service. Â Our server Steve was the best he had a great personality and was very helpful and friendly. We will definitely be coming back here. . Mmmmm... cow
8/5/2016,5 star rating,"Best KBBQ in LA for the price. Do yourself a favor and just load up on marinated short rib. Also, the chicken is surprisingly good."
9/18/2018,5 star rating,"First time trying the place and it was really good. The hot stone keeps the meat from getting charred! Beef tongue was really good, very tender. I've been to other Korean BBQ places and their beef tongue tasted like rubber! I went with a coworker so we didn't get to try all of their dishes. Will definitely go back again. Oh, ventilation was good too. Jjukuu Jjukuu'a food was good but their vents don't work at alI and was really smokey."
7/9/2014,4 star rating,"Great all-you-can-eat KBBQ joint with service that doesn't make you feel like you're at an all-you-can-eat KBBQ joint. It's smoky, crowded, and loud as it should be. Banchan offering is decent but not nearly as exhaustive compared to non-AYCE restaurants. You get a range of 4 dipping sauces which strikes me as above average.Much better than somewhere like Ookook, where service and portions dwindle until you decide to cut your losses and leave.The only catch, of course, is the wait, which is pretty much an unavoidable reality at all Korean BBQ restaurants worth going to."
9/16/2016,4 star rating,"One of the better all you can eat Korean BBQ places in Koreatown. Meat quality is decent for the price, with good side dish options. It gets very busy very often so think twice before going there at its peak hours (6 pm-10 pm)."
6/27/2015,3 star rating,So I've been back here twice since my last review and I gotta say they're starting to grow on me. Far better service now and meat quality isn't as bad anymore. Still would like the price to drop but can't have everything. It's better to go for lunch or early dinner when things are not as hectic as late night.
6/19/2014,2 star rating,"Does this place pay people to review them so well? I seriously doubt these people are worth anything near 4 Yelp stars. Their meat quality was just straight up pathetic, probably equal to some meat quality I find at Korean supermarkets (a bit of exaggeration added of course). Their service was slow and I do not recommend this place; there are plenty of better alternative options in Koreatown and nearby LA."

2/25/2011,4 star rating,"This Korean BBQ all you can eat is different from the ones I have been to or experienced. Â It is Different in a way because the food is cooked on top of a stone plate instead of a traditional metal grill. Â The waiter comes by so often and cleans it with some sort of radish soaked in water to help moisten the stone plate and scrape off the burnt crust of sauces and what not.It is all you can, but you first order 3 items from there menu. Â The waiter services here is good, they help you cook some of your food, refill your water and take your orders of refilling the meats you want to cook. It also comes with this tangy sweet vinaigrette type of dressing on lettuce.Some of the varieties of meats- BBQ Beef (Bulgogi)- Black Angus Beef Brisket- Marinated Choice Beef Short Ribs- Canadian Fresh Pork Belly [thin or thick sliced]- Pork shoulder- Beef tongue- BBQ pork- BBQ chicken- BBQ squid- Beef abomasums- Beef Honey comb- Hot dogs- Kimchi Pancake - Cone tortillas- Rice Cake- Bean Paste Soup- Kimchi Fried Rice or Steam Rice$16.99 wow! Out of all the meats, I like the short ribs the most and the beef brisket. Â The Pork Belly is good, but a bit greasy, get the thick sliced. Â The longer you leave the grill, it will start look like bacon! It is Crispy and a lot of flavor that melts in your mouth from the belly fats.Beef tongue was also interesting, first time I tried at a Korean BBQ. Â It's chewy and a bit different and it's good. Â BBQ squid is good especially the legs! OH MY!! IF you leave it longer and let it grill longer and it will taste crunchy and super delicious.Kimchi fried rice was also good, it's spicy! And they make it for you in front of you! Â I let the rice sat on top of the stone plate for a bit longer so I can have some parts crispy / crunch from the hot plate. Â It is super delicious. Â Overall, this place is crazy good! Â It also has a crazy line indeed because everyone wants some good Korean BBQ for a good price and this is the place. Â When you tell them it's your birthday, they place a song for you a cheer for you! Â There were like 3 that night I went, it was awesome! Â Oh try to wear clothes you don't want to smell, because you are gonna smell after eating here.-Parking-The parking here does suck really bad, you can try park in their small lot or let them valet it or try find street parking. Â YOU Might have to park a block or two if you do street parking.I suggest you drop a friend off to write your name down first before finding parking!!!"
4/12/2014,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is one of the best value AYCE KBBQ places I've been to in ktown. At only $18/person, you get pork belly, beef tongue, pork shoulder, octopus, and more in addition to the classics like brisket and short ribs.What stands out here is the stone grill on each table instead of a regular metal one. I'm not sure how functional it is, though, to be honest. I couldn't taste a real difference in the meats, though I suppose there was less char and burnt stuff on there, but then again I don't have the most sensitive palate. Â Also, your clothes will still smell like smoke and BBQ, there's no getting around that.The service is good and the quality and variety of banchan (side dishes) are amazing. The biggest downside is the wait, and I think that's partly made unnecessarily long because the stone grill takes so long to heat up (so you'll get really drunk off soju and beer quicker while you're waiting). Â Parking is pretty typical for ktown with a $2 valet.If you're willing to brave the wait or come at non-peak hours, you'll get a very good Korean BBQ experience for the $18 price!"
1/9/2014,5 star rating,"I came here after a Clipper victory a few miles away on a Wednesday night and I was pleasantly impressed by this korean bbq.After a 15 minute wait or so, my girl and I were finally seated. Â All concerns about lack of service due to the long wait were answered once we sat down. Â The staff was excellent and treated us very well.The menu is all you can eat and what a bargain for $18.99plenty of meat and the side dishes were delicious.Some of your meats included brisket, short ribs, shrimp, and barbecue chicken. Â After you eat the meat, they served us kimchi fried rice, which was delicious.The only thing that was backwards to me was the fact that they brought the rice out after we were already stuffed from all of the meat.But I digress.. Great food, great environment, great service and great price.This place is now bookmarked and I will stumble on in after the next Clipper victory :)"
2/13/2015,1 star rating,"Honestly, this place was a sad joke. We thought it having a really high Yelp review would make it a safe bet, but we were wrong. Our usual place is Manna on Wilton/Wilshire but we went at a time when they were closed already so we thought of trying a new place. The brisket was a joke. Half of it was fat and really chewy compared to the beautiful marbling on the brisket we were used to at Manna. None of the meat was really that impressive and the sides were your standard KBBQ sides. They were stingy with the food. I asked for a larger bowl of potato salad since a few of us are big fans of it and they said they'll just bring us new ones in the small bowls when we're done. If you sat directly in front of the grill, the heat from the fire and skillet was pretty annoying.We paid $230 for 6 people including 4 soju bottles whereas we would pay $230 at Manna for 9 people and 6 bottles of soju. I was just really disappointed and even more disappointed when I saw the bill compared to the joke food we had. All 6 of us agreed that we will never step foot in this place again. Overall, let me put it this way. I made a Yelp account just to come on here and tell others about how awful their food and pricing was. I wish I could give this place 0 stars out of 5."
4/6/2017,5 star rating,"The best bbq place in Korea town. Would recommend it to people who like to cook their own food and enjoy this type of setting. It is going to be a little bit of waiting in line most of the time but once you get sitted, the service is great and the food is definitely worth the wait."
5/16/2015,5 star rating,"GREAT, GREAT SERVICEThe meat is good, and the servers are kind and immediate to our needs. This is what kbbq place needs to be in terms of service! They also clean the stone grills with radish -- what!"
12/2/2013,4 star rating,"This was an AYCE paradise, as far as I'm concerned. Whenever I'm leaving L.A. late at night, usually after a screening or a show, I like to eat big. And for whatever reason the thought of going to a late-night Korean BBQ had never crossed my mind until a friend insisted we eat here recently. $19/person might seem a little steep, but if you've got an appetite that won't quit you're likely to leave feeling like you got your money's worth.There's a little grill on each table, but most of the cooking gets done by your server. Not that you can't do it yourself. Before the meat, they brought out various dishes filled with kimchi, something that had the consistency of a moist tortilla but was spicy, bean sprouts, something that looked like noodles but was clearly not noodles once you ate it, and... dry German-style potato salad? It's a hodgepodge, and I had no problem chowing down on items I couldn't even identify. If you're not an adventurous eater, this probably isn't for you. On to the meat! So. Much. Meat. We got BBQ beef, beef brisket, short ribs, pork belly, beef tongue, and baby octopus. Was anything not fantastic? Nope. Every single item cooked up to perfection, brimming with savory flavors and dripping in whatever sauce I randomly dunked it in. I kinda screwed up and cooked by beef tongue a bit too long. Gotta watch that stuff; it cooks up very quick since it's so thin. Baby octopi weren't rubbery at all, they tasted great after a generous slathering of hot sauce. Most of the beef didn't even need a complementary sauce, they just tasted exquisite on their own. I went into a blind meat coma after consuming all of this, so I don't quite remember how we ended the meal. Probably with more meat. Since this is my first authentic Korean BBQ, I can't say with any degree of certainty how this stacks up alongside other similar spots. But if some place can beat this, I need to go, because this was incredible."
1/2/2014,5 star rating,"Thank you yelp for pointing me to this all you can eat BBQ joint. Â The fried chicken on the corner is to kill for, but if you're looking for a change of pace, but want to overindulge, this is a great spot for it. Â The meat was good, not crazy high-quality, but for the price, it's worth it. Â The BANCHAN itself is worth the price! Lots and lots of good variety of korean kimchi and side dishes. Â Pointer for all of you bitching about service: Â Follow the lead of the Korean customers! Â Call on any of the waiters for help. Â They're all there to serve you. Â Be aggressive if you want something. Â Unlike the US, most asian countries don't operate under the one waiter per table thang. Â So take some initiative and ask any of their staff when you need something. Â Dude. Crap...now I'm hungry for some Have Jang Chon."
10/23/2016,5 star rating,I finally came to this spot after seeing it over many years. The buffet price for lunch is 21.99 and dinner is 23.99. I know these prices costs more than the average Korean BBQ spots in K-town but I would say the meat quality is definitely better and the service is quite consistent in refilling your side orders. The parking is tricky like all K-town spots are but they do have valet parking or paid parking on the side.
10/22/2016,5 star rating,Amazing food !! Great service as well. With that comes a wait but other than that it was definitely worth it! Best kbbq yet
4/3/2014,3 star rating,"If I could review this place purely for their food, it would be 4 stars. Really good AYCE quality meat for 17.99.They also offer kimchee fried rice at the end of your meal, which is absolutely delicious! Their kalbi, brisket, tongue are always good. Salad and sides are delicious as well. I love the food here! Also, instead of swapping out the grills everytime it's dirty, they clean it with radish, pretty cool and it's fast! You don't have to wait for your new grill to heat up each time. The main problem here is that service is slow and there is always a pretty long wait. Parking is hard too unless you decide to valet. There aren't a ton of seats inside, which is why the wait can't be torturous. I always want to come, but just thinking about parking and waiting usually deters me. If you don't mind either of them, definitely give this place a try."
8/13/2013,2 star rating,"So I'm not quite sure what the hype is about this place...Firstly, the wait was ""at least"" an hour. Under normal circumstances, I would have starved myself throughout the day knowing KBBQ was in my future and would therefore be too hungry to wait, but KBBQ was a last minute decision this Sunday (aka I actually ate other food and wasn't ready to claw someone's eyes out upon arrival) and I figured this place has been touted as ""one of the best"" KBBQs so we decided to stick it out.Instead of waiting and subsequently dying of boredom, we decided to go across the street to Haus for some lattes. Â We came back to Hae Jang after about 45 minutes and were seated pretty shortly after.Service was fine, people were consistently checking on us and making sure we were taken care of. Â I was also completely blown away by the waitress's spatula work when making our kimchi fried rice.As for the food, my favorite part of the evening was the fishcake banchans, which are more flavorful and spicier than I've had elsewhere. Â I also like the garlic laden dipping sauce which was delicious. Â As for the meat itself, it was just meh. Â The brisket was pretty red and un-marbled and while this was probably better for my waistline, my tastebuds were unsatisfied. Â The bulgogi and marinated galbi also weren't as tasty as they are at other places. The bulgogi wasn't sweet enough and actually borderline dry, while the galbi lacked flavor and had too many chunks of gristle. Â The miso soup was really REALLY salty and the kimchi fried rice, while a great addition, had way too much seaweed.Not to say that the food was bad, but I kind of expected better considering the other glowing reviews on both Yelp! and in various news articles. Â I mean, the price was pretty standard ($18.99), so I figured the meat would be on par with some of the other AYCEs at this price point that I've really enjoyed... but I think if anything, I'd rather go back to one of those places instead of trying this one again."
4/14/2011,5 star rating,"Took my brother there for his birthday and LOVED it!One of my favorite bbq place for AYCE! Â The price is reasonable, the beef tongue is the bomb! Â Also the kimchi fried rice at the end, it's sooooo delicious but i can NEVER finish because by the time we get to the rice, i'm already full!!!Remember to make reservation before you go if you don't want to be stuck in line waiting and feeling hungry........."
6/23/2011,4 star rating,"This place is just FANTASTIC!!!I typically hate waiting for a table, but I didn't mind waiting the 40 to 60 minutes we waited for a table here. Â (If you get really hungry while waiting, the trend seems to be to hit up the friend chicken spot a few doors down, while waiting).A word of caution, you will smell like cooked meat when you leave this place Â :) Â Also, be sure to turn the meat in case the server doesn't come by in time; otherwise it will burn!We did the all you can eat option, and the pre-tax bill was $33 for two people. Â The sides were divine, as were the dipping sauces. Â We went with the following for our BBQ: - bulgogi, -chicken, -short ribs, and -squid. Â It also came with kimchi pancakes, rice cake and bean paste soup, and kimchi fried rice! Â YUM! Â Quite the bargain!!!A very young vibe. Â Some people were there celebrating a birthday. Â All of a sudden, disco music came on, a disco ball started spinning, and there was some major singing. Â What a fun bday!Can't wait to take my husband here the next time we're in LA!"
2/14/2016,4 star rating,"I have found my new AYCE Korean BBQ. I loved Road to Seoul, however they had slowly started to let their menu lose some stars, like no more pancakes! But today I decided to give a new place a chance. I'd like to start off with the service, they're very attentive and I like how they have trays set aide for your meat and put it on the grill for you, and come clean the grill without having to be asked. The meats are fresh and the bulgogi is on point, it's nicely flavored. Their pork belly, rib meat, and brisket were all great too. The only one we didn't care for was the shrimp. But everything else, even the endless banchan was delicious. And their pancakes were yummy! And if you have room at the end go for their fried rice at the end. All the flavors from the grill made the fried rice delicious. I will definitely we returning, just like any other good place, there's a wait, so come prepared to wait and arrive with your entire party or you won't be seated."
3/17/2014,4 star rating,"The wait for the restaurant was two hours long (that's what the host said, but it was more like 1 1/2 hours), and it was definitely worth the wait. The quality of the meat is exceptional and plenty to choose from. A little pricey, but the food is good. Service is very prompt and the staff never miss a beat. Once I sat, I never felt neglected. I highly recommend this restaurant."
9/18/2013,4 star rating,"I absolutely adore this place. Â If I could marry a restaurant and start a family with it, this would be the one.Like other users have stated, I can't believe I haven't written a review about this restaurant! Â I come here everytime I'm in L.A. Â I don't need a lot in my life. Â Just thin sliced pork belly, bean paste, rice paper, and a stone grill. Â The most basic package comes with most of the variety of meats people Â usually order anyway Â (kalbi, bulgolgi, etc) and it's like 20 bucks per person. Â And just because it's AYCE doesn't mean it's bad quality meat. Â And just because it's AYCE doesn't mean you have to eat until you die. Â It just means you can eat as much as you want of this awesome shit and only pay 20 bucks + tax. Â What more could you want in life?I'm not giving this 5 stars because sometimes the service can be crappy, depending on who you get. Â The staff is usually attentive and quick to refill your grill, but I've had a couple who seemed like they need a good knock over the head. Â Anyways, love love love this place."
10/17/2016,4 star rating,"Definitely has become my go to for AYCE KBBQ! The value and quality of the meats are all there. The beef tongue is by far the best I've had in LA. Also, pretty legit that they give you seafood too. The servers are fast and they cook the meat for you. There's a $2 valet in front of the restaurant. The wait can be long, but what awesome KBBQ restaurant in LA doesn't have a wait?"
5/6/2017,5 star rating,Service was great and the bulgogi was flavorful and soft. I would definitely recommend coming here. It is a bit pricer than other kbbq places but the quality of the meat justifies the price.
5/23/2009,5 star rating,"Talk about awesome. I've never been to a better kbbq at this point in life yet. Not to mention the fact that from time to time...several hot chicks stop by to eat, so there's always the opportunity for some checking out ;). 19 Items on their AYCE KBBQ menu. This is what I remember:1. Black Angus Brisket2. Beef Short Ribs (Marinated OR UNmarinated)3. Pork Belly (Thin or Thick)4. Bulgogi 5. BBQ Pork6. Pork Intestines7. Tongue8. BBQ Chicken9. BBQ Squid10. ""Hot dog"" (Yeah I didn't bother trying it)11. BBQ Tripe12. Pork Shoulder(that's all I can remember)Other stuff included the kimchi pancakes, kimchi fried rice and the soybean soup if I can remember. At first I thought it was much less from what the website said. I liked their bulgogi , squid and chicken the best. The marination was all good. There were 4 types of sauces, so you don't get easily tired of the dry taste from the same sauce or without any sauce at all. We came in at around 5 so there weren't that many people there. but it slowly filled up as it reached 6:30PM-ish. I thought the service was more or less exceptional, as we didn't really have to repeat anything much. The barley tea ""water"" was pretty good too. I had like 7-8 cups of it by the end of the meal. And so we chowed down on around 9 plates of meat, until me and my group of friends came to a consensus that it was time for the ""signature kimchi fried rice"" and the soybean soup at the very end. Maybe it's just me but I thought the kimchi was pretty sour compared to the other places I've eaten kimchi. I don't think I'm very much a fan of kimchi other than the beansprouts. The soybean soup was a great way to finish everything , I thought. Would I come back here again? Definitely. Nice service. Great food. Excellent Price. 5 StarsEdit: I've noticed the recent lacking ratings...I wonder...did they think I'm Korean? LOL"

6/17/2013,1 star rating,"If there was a 0/5 for yelp this is where I would apply it. The service was terrible and the meat quality was mediocre at best. I know kbbq are a big thing in LA but I'd honestly eat at kbbq places in San Diego over this place. Thursday night my friends and I came in around 1 am starving. We had a party of twelve and were split into two tables. Our table had 6 and the other had 3 waiting for others to come in. We were told that it was already last call for meat (which was confusing since it was an ALL YOU CAN EAT that closes at 2 AM). Dismissing this inconvenience, we decided to order two of everything on the menu so we could get our fill before the time ran out. The waiter then said that we can only order 4 items at a time... We ordered four dishes in which they brought out to the other table as well. We explicitly stated that the two tables were separate, but they said that they already brought out the raw meat so they'd charge us if we left any out. The other table said whatever and was forced to start eating before the rest of the group came in.In addition, the waiter refused to serve us alcohol at 1:15 AM. Last time I checked, one could consume alcohol until 2 AM. The only reason I wanted some alcohol was because at this point, they didn't even serve us water (when we did finally get water, they never refilled our glasses once).And so, apparently this place is well known for its FRIED RICE. We decided to order some since they were closing in about 20 minutes. We asked for some fried rice but the waiter said, ""I don't think you guys can finish it by 2."" After arguing that we would all finish the food, guess what? IT NEVER CAME OUT.RECAP:-All you can eat till 2am is really ""as much as we serve until 1:30 since putting RAW MEAT on a PLATE takes soooooooooooooo much time....-Alcohol until 2AM in the state of california does not apply here-Water shall not be served until the waiter feels like it-If you have a group with 2 separate tables, everyone gets the same thing-Fried rice is a privilege only given to VIPs Conclusion:The bill came out and we paid the $20 for the BBQ. Those of us with credit cards left the tip blank so that we could pay with cash. This place is honestly the worst experience I've ever had with ANY SERVICE. But my group decided to tip about $4 (Which is honestly better than nothing).Now, there was the main douchebag waiter and another girl who was just helping out with service. After we left the restaurant, the girl (whom I actually felt bad for) came out and returned $2 saying that they were sorry about the service but didn't deserve the tip. HOWEVER, $4-$2 = $2.... so the douchebag kept the other $2 while this girl gave it back....SHITTY SERVICE, LAME FOOD, NOT AS ADVERTISED. THERE ARE PLENTY OF KBBQ PLACES IN SOCAL I'D GO TO BEFORE EVER COMING BACK TO THIS DUMP"
3/22/2017,4 star rating,"One of the best Korean BBQ places I've eaten at. A friend took us when we were in town and as soon as we pulled up, we could see tons of people waiting at the door. We ended up waiting about 1.5 hours but once we got in, the service was fantastic! We loved the beef tongue, thin pork belly, and steamed egg. Wrapping up with kimchi fried rice at the end was a great way to finish. There are places with higher quality meat, but this place is a great value with their large variety of meat options. Will definitely come back! The wait can be pretty painful, but at least you're super hungry and can eat your money's worth once you get in haha."
7/31/2013,5 star rating,"I would definitely recommend this place! Good quality meat and good service! Came here on a Sunday when they just opened so no wait at all! My friends and I all opted for the AYCE $18.99/person. It comes with plenty of choices of meat, the typical sides, steamed egg, salad, and rice (white or kimchi fried rice). Beef brisket: my favorite here! It tasted so good and I honestly could've eaten just this and I would've been happy.Short ribs (marinated): this was okay to me, not bad at all. The company I was with say this is their favorite.Bulgogi: I was not a fan of it; too fatty in my opinion.Pork belly (thin): this was good, your typical pork belly.Pork belly (thick): aaaaamazing! We overcooked it to make it crunchy and it was bomb dot com! This was my second favorite!BBQ pork: this is a bit spicy, but decent. If you like spicy meat this is for you.Overall, I loved this place. The servers are friendly and attentive. They come to your table right away when you ring the call bell. The only thing is they serve the rice in the end, we were actually getting really full from the meat that we told them we didn't want the rice anymore. I'm a bit sad that we didn't get to try it. :( That just means I have to return to try it! If you like Road to Seoul you will like this place too!"
11/24/2013,4 star rating,"Came here, reserved a table for 6, and waited two and a half hours for my friend's birthday. This was one of the places she was excited about and no matter how hungry we all were, we wanted to fulfill her birthday weekend so we literally waited that long.In the end, it was worth it. We finally got seated and then the feasting began. I am absolutely in love with Korean food, so I have absolutely no complaints about this place at all. The crazy cool thing is that they cook it for you. I've only been to places where you cook it yourself, so this was a bit of a shocker when they cooked it for us. I like it =) It was on the pricier side ($19/person), compared to the ones I've tried ($10/person) but like I said, it was worth it and we came out of here about to explode in our pants and with the worst food coma.Definitely coming back here next time I or we are in L.A. I wonder if it's always busy..."
1/27/2014,4 star rating,"I feel like I've been here before, but I'm not quite sure. This place had good reviews and I liked the menu they had for the price. I can't eat marinated meat anymore since I found out I have Celiac disease :( so I need to have Â a place that has a good amount of non marinated meat. We waited for about an hour. It was super busy, even on a Sunday night. There were quite a few of the side dishes and most were pretty good. The meat I would say as of medium quality, but it wasn't amazing. The service was fast and fairly friendly. We also had a vegan with us and they accommodated with the bibimbap dish, which was really nice. So, one person with an allergy, and another with a pretty strict diet and we were both pretty satisfied.Would I recommend this place? Yeah I think so. Would I come back again? Possibly, but honestly I still feel Road To Seoul has still been the best place for me."

I'll review all the meats we had..Galbi: My absolute favorite, i'd order this over and over bulgogi: too sweet; the meat was a little dry tooKim chi pancake: very good, if you put it on the grill a little bit, it gives it a little crunch as well!Canadian pork belly thin slice: eh, it's kinda like bacon since there's so much fat that it doesn't justify eating it for the meat. there's also a lot of socket/bony pieces in it too. won't order againAngus beef Brisket: my second favorite-- it's nice and fatty, but still meaty unlike the thin pork belly.beef tongue: chewy :(marinated chicken: i'm not a fan of eating chicken at a KBBQ place, but it was pretty goodWe came on a monday afternoon and there was no wait, and waitress/waiters were very attentive.. didn't have to ring the bell for service once (though we were tempted). They also have good ventilation so you don't walk out smelling like a walking bulgogi stick."
1/14/2014,4 star rating,"Whenever I come to Koreatown I gotta revert back to my cavewoman roots with AYCE KBBQ! There's something about cooking my own food over a fire. Hae Jang Chon KBBQ shines with quality meats, banchan varieties, comfortable ambience, and a Grade A health rating. I came with a group of friends on a Monday night and the place was crowded! Good thing we made reservations. We let our inner beasts free and feasted on their $18.99 AYCE, 20 item menu. Favorites were the Black Angus Beef Brisket, Marinated Short Rib, Bulgogi, Thick Pork Belly, and Beef Tongue. Other items on the menu included Pork shoulder, BBQ Pork, BBQ Chicken, BBQ Squid, Beef Abomasum, Beef Honeycomb, Hot dogs, Small Octopus, Shrimp. I love wrapping the rice cake sheet with pickled radish, meat, salad and dipping it in the sesame oil and salt! That flavor combination is unforgettable. Â Don't forget to also order their unlimited Steamed Egg, Kimchi Pancake, Bean Paste Soup, and finish with Kimchi Fried Rice. I feel like these items are a luxury to have because not all AYCE KBBQ offer these delectables. (I can definitely go for some Kimchi Fried Rice right now!) My only complaint is the service is a bit slow. It was more on an as-needed basis. We had to ring the bell a few times to get service. Some places help you cook and cut your meat--we weren't as fortunate.Restaurant is clean and spacious. I didn't get the crowded, stuffy feeling as other KBBQ places. They should get better vents--I can probably make my own Kimchi Fried Rice in my clothes from last night because it smells like MEAT!Parking is virtually impossible to find on the weekend. You can valet your car any day of the week for $2.Make a reservation, especially for a big group. They don't seat the party until the entire group has arrived. They only hold the reservation for 15 minutes after the booked time.This place opens until 2AM. Literally a party in your mouth."
6/3/2016,4 star rating,"This place was alright, I don't think it's worth the wait considering you have to pay quite a bit more than other korean bbqs. The meat was very good and the little dishes were delicious as well. However, I can't get over the price point and the wait that was required to get in here. I think your time is better spent somewhere else."
11/20/2015,3 star rating,"Meh. I'm not a fan.Valet and self-parking is both $2 here. Not quite sure why I have to pay to park my own car in an extremely small parking lot..I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and this was the first time I've ever eaten here granted I've eaten at other kbbq AYCE places in Koreatown. It's $21.99 for dinner and I think for the price that you pay the options are very limited. There aren't too many things to choose from. My table got the beef brisket, bulgolgi, kalbi, and steamed egg. We wanted the tofu soup but apparently they don't serve that here? The brisket was good but after the first round all the refills we got were basically all fat. I typically don't mind a little fat on my brisket just because it gives the brisket a lot more flavor and I mean if you're going to eat kbbq might as well go all out and forget your diet. But I ended up having to trim off the fat and was left with a fairly small portion of actual meat. The bulgolgi and kalbi were both pretty good. The banchan was okay...I thought some of them tasted kind of off.Also, they don't use the typical grills here at this place. They use stone grills, which I'm personally not to big of a fan of because I personally like my brisket (one of my favorites) to be crispy on the edges, and with this kind of grill, it takes forever to happen. It also doesn't give the meat the kind of char taste that I like. It is nice though that you don't have to get a grill change and that there's less smoke when cooking your foods.The service was okay. The servers that helped us were really nice but there was a huge communication gap between us. Neither me nor my friends were Korean or able to speak Korean and had extreme difficulty understanding and communicating with them. And although they were very nice and accommodating to us, they kept forgetting to fulfill our request. My friends and I requested water and a refill on the salad 2-3 times and still weren't given any, and it couldn't be that they were refilling it or making more salad because I personally saw them refill and bring the large pitchers of waters to other tables.Maybe I need to give this place another try? I'm not sure. I just don't see what's so great about this place that everyone else is saying."
6/15/2014,5 star rating,"DANNNNG this place provides such a good deal. AYCE for just under $20. I gained 2 lbs eatting here, but it was two pounds of deliciously cooked, tender beef/octopus/pork that was sooo worth it!!!!Weeknight ~6pm, no wait for table of 6 (but we did see a line forming soon after). Service was great - you sit down and they bring you orders of meat and they come quick! They accept credit card. Plus they make kimchi fried rice for you at the end of the meal (cause you prob were not full enough at that point). Only con -$5 addition for lettuce is a little too pricey for greens (especially when you need it to wrap the beef around)!"

6/2/2010,4 star rating,"All you can eat Koreann BBQ = $16.99- Nice selection of items (19 items total)- pork belly (thin) melts in your mouth- bulgogi is average. Can definetly get better elsewhere- kimchi fried rice is pretty good so try to save some space!- service is hit or miss.Overall, it is very good and i would definetly come back! Well worth the money!"
10/5/2016,2 star rating,I took a 2 hour train ride out just to come eat here and NOWHERE in their official Yelp description did they say there was a minimum party requirement of two. A lot of Yelp foodies eat by themselves! This is irresponsible advertising and also insulting to single party diners.

11/21/2016,5 star rating,"Came here two times for separate trips to LA. Each time, the service is great and the food is delicious and fresh as always. I favorites are the marinated short ribs, spicy bbq pork, thin pork belly, and brisket. We always come hungry and leave super full and satisfied. It's $21.99 for all you can eat lunch. The sides are great and they also offer steamed egg, which I absolutely love. Get here early because it does get packed as it is one of the more popular AYCE KBBQ places in the area."
7/6/2014,4 star rating,I have been here three times and I really enjoyed both times. The first time was a Thursday evening no crazy lines at all! The service was great and the food tasted good. They served a good selection of side dishes. I didn't have enough room for the kimchi fried rice at the end :(.My second time here I brought my husband and he absolutely loved the food! We came on a Saturday night and waited quite awhile. It was worth the wait. Service was on point! Third time in was with a group of friends. We waited some time to sit and eat so we went next door to drink. That killed time. Again their service was great and food was delicious! Parking on street or valet.
7/6/2013,1 star rating,"I am a long time customer for this restaurant for 10 yrs, and today is really driving me crazy, maybe because it is my birthday today.We had a party of eight, and then they offered us 2 tables to sit separately because it could be a long way for a table for eight. We said ok we understand that.Then, there was one table ready for four of us, and they asked some of us to sit down first. However, nobody was serving the table even the second table was ready. When the second table was ready, there was a table for 8 people that can fit all of us was ready at the same time. So, we tried to see if we can take that table.The receptionist said you guys agreed to take two tables at the first place and we had a party of 8 reserved for the table already, so we cannot give you this table.Of course, fair enough, so we ended up took one table for 6 and one table for 4.But, what happened was, they only had party of 5 for the 8 people table, which made us really upset since we could take that table to enjoy our dinner together and another party could take our 6 people table. I don't know if I am thinking wrong or not. It makes sense that we took the 8 people table, and another party took a table for 6; so they can have a table of 4 for other party. Make sense for business, right?At the end, we tried to tell them what we felt about the service; and another receptionist just gave us the attitude that because that was our fault and we did not make a reservation. We just told him another receptionist already admitted that she made a mistake. Then, that guy was just simply pointing finger to somebody without any apology.I really like this restaurant before maybe because I has been here for 10 yrs; however, I will never come back again since I don't want to spend my money with the service like this anymore. If I can rate 0 star, I would definitely do. :("
11/19/2016,5 star rating,"Get ready folks, wait times are insane but what great restaurant isn't? It will surely be worth it with their great service and selection of meats! We went on a Saturday afternoon and waited about an hour. We were then seated promptly to an array of sides and ordered the meat right away. Everything is quick and efficient, but the best part is that they assist you with the cooking! Talk about customer service. WORTH THE WAIT!! Persevere and you will have food coma for days!*** finding parking around here is RIDICULOUS (as with any place in LA). Go straight into their small parking lot and they will have valet there for $2. Save yourself a headache and pat the $2 for parking."
3/10/2017,1 star rating,"Me and my friends came in at 12:40 and we were treated with an awful server. (He looks a little tall and pudgy) the moment we sat down. We didn't really mind it at first but their attitude was just god awful. We were trying to eat as much as possible despite the time and the portions were really good until the last call when they served a super small size that feeds one. The waiter kept asking us to sign the bill for three times even though we were trying to enjoy our food well before closing as well. Hence, we decided to not leave any tip and left a little note in hope that they'll improve their service in the future. But our waiter instead of taking our criticism seriously, decided to pursue me outside like he wanted a fight me even though he was probably 5ft and weigh 130 pounds. But good food though"
9/2/2018,5 star rating,"Great choice and cuts of meat options. The 5 stars goes goes to the host and staff. I was Impressed with the level of service provided considering the amount of groups and long waits, on a Sunday evening of Labor Day Weekend. Making reservations for a group of 6 or more is highly recommended"
9/27/2016,5 star rating,Best Korean BBQ ever. Been here multiple times and always impressed by the service. The food here is amazing but worth it. There is always a wait and for a good reason!
6/2/2016,4 star rating,"Great AYCE KBBQ joint among the many in KTOWN. It is located in a small plaza with minimal parking but they do offer valet which is about $6. The price is pretty average around $25 pp. You get plenty of meat choices, but my favorite are the galbi, pork belly and beef tongue. The meat is good quality and the side dishes were delicious and plentiful. The servers are very attentive and help cook your food. I like the idea of using a stone grill instead of the normal cast iron grill. Make sure to not get white rice and save room for the kimchi fried rice at the end! That was my favorite."
1/12/2015,4 star rating,$21.99 is a lil high but they make it up with great service. Â Service was great and the brisket was so bomb...
6/29/2016,5 star rating,"Quick service, food came quickly! Waiters are very friendly and eager to help you grill & recommend their favorites. Great for groups, large and small. Good price for what you get, would return again!"
6/30/2014,5 star rating,"Excellent galbi- marinated or non marinated without the bone. Â I love the fact you can cook on your table on these round stone grills. Â The side dishes are delicious and they always keep them filled on your table. Â You can order 3 meats at a time. Â I always do the marinated short ribs, brisket and bulbolgi. Â After that, I will order the unmarinated short ribs. Â They offer you the fried rice at the end, cooking it on the stone soaking up the meat juices left on the stone, but by that time we're way too full so we always tell the waiters/waitresses in the beginning that we won't be getting fried rice, but instead give us the steamed rice with our meal. Â It works out well. Â The kim chi pancake they give you is good to, but we tell them not to give it to us because it will just get us full. Â Be prepared to wait. Â Theres always a line here."

3/29/2014,5 star rating,"We got to Hae Jang Chon at around 10pm on a Saturday night. The other reviewers weren't kidding when they said the wait is long. Man, the wait was practically an hour long. Making a reservation is probably a smart thing to do. I heard you have to be early/on time otherwise they give your table away, though. We ended up waiting outside to be seated cause it got really crowded inside. There's only two benches to sit on, so you either stand or sit on the curb at the parking lot. We didn't mind at all. Anyways, the food was delicious and came out pretty quick. They offer two types of pork belly: thinly sliced pork belly and thick sliced pork belly. The thinly sliced one reminded me of the brisket.They also serve their pork in a tin foil. We didn't really know what to do, so we let the waitress put it on the grill. Another waiter walked by later and took it off the foil. Slightly confused at this point, be we rolled with it.The interior was really comforting. It felt like we were having a barbeque in a cabin in the woods. The waitress we had, I didn't get the chance to find out her name, was really nice. She asked us if we wanted to try their kimchi fried rice after our meal, and we were hesitant, but she insisted. It was pretty good. She kept refilling our salad and ban chans, too. Oh, and another unique thing this KBBQ place did. The way they cleaned the grill. They don't change their stone grills. They clean it with this.. Thinly sliced.. Vegetable? It was a first for me, and man, that was pretty amazing LOLTotal for three adults came out to around $70 or so.Valet was $2, not bad for a place in LA. Would totally come here again."
5/29/2013,3 star rating,"After a really long day at work, I suckered one of my friends to getting AYCE KBBQ with me at 1am.... At that time, there isn't much open, so we searched for the places still serving until 2am on a random Tuesday. Ran across this one and here we are!Walked in to find open tables, but they warned us that they closed the kitchen at 1:15am, meaning all orders had to be in. We had 25 minutes to stuff ourselves silly, and that's just what we did.AYCE is $17.99 per personBanchan - decent. Kimchi bean sprouts boiled mustard greens, were good. The salad was a little over-dressed.Brisket - too thick cut. Was chewy and felt like you were eating tongue.Thinly-sliced pork belly - my favorite of the night. Cut as thin as brisket at most other placesThick-cut pork belly - very fatty, but did not crisp up very well.Service was ok -- they rushed us through our meal a bit, but it was very late in their day. They were nice enough, but not as attentive as they would be at a non-AYCE spot.There are better, but for the late late night ones, this isn't bad!"
6/24/2014,5 star rating,"I've lived in LA (or LA area, technically speaking) forever but haven't had too many KBBQ experience. This was my first ayce spot in LA. Came here on a Monday, no wait at 5:40pm. The menu was short and sweet, we ordered off of the AYCE menu which had 19 items (ranging from Black Angus beef, BBQ pork, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, beef short ribs, beef tongue to shrimp, octopus, fried rice/Kimchi fried rice), $20 per person (minimum two-person party). Service is fairly fast, they use a stone cooking pan that tilts so all of the oil from the meat would drip to a reservoir off of the pan. We were in and out within 30 minutes and had plenty to fill our stomachs."
5/19/2014,4 star rating,"Wow, my review of this place is more than six years old. High time for an update, since much has changed and my original review didn't even say anything important.1. It's waaay better ventilated now. The first time I came here, I stank like Korean BBQ for a month. That doesn't happen anymore.2. The food is as good as ever.3. The sides are amazing as always.4. The service is even friendlier than it was the first time I ever came here. We had the nicest waiter on Saturday.5. It has been renovated and seems a little bit larger.My only complaint is that Haejongchon has some obnoxious anti-customer policies that keep us from going there as often as we like. Case in point: you cannot get on the waiting list until you are physically there. I guess so they can watch you starve in person? What's the point of that? I mean, if I'm not there when my name is called, too bad for me - move on to the next name. I just can't see any good reason to not have customers be able to call en route to get on a waiting list and make their wait shorter, unless you're just trying to be a total jerk. For that, minus one star.Because this place is so good and affordable relative to a lot of Korean BBQ restaurants, the wait for a table can be upwards of one or two hours.Since I don't see them changing this dumb policy anytime soon, if you want to avoid a long wait and not deal with the valet racket, get here early - before five and you should be fine."

5/21/2013,1 star rating,". Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â To be NiceThere is a quote once uttered by one of the greatest wine makers in the world that goes as such:""Striving for quality: that's the point. There was a time when great care was taken in the search for beauty and excellence. Then the masses came to prefer the faÃ§ade to what lies behind it.""I was a little hesitant to make this place the first restaurant that I reviewed which wasn't in an ultra premium price range, because any fellow semi-studious Yelper could easily look at my other reviews and think to him or herself, ""what a sad, entitled, and supercilious douche bag"". I am also fully aware that quoting a vinter does not help my case (but the quote just really fits the bill for this place). However, I felt THAT compelled to devote a good portion of my time to let you know that there are much better places in this world to enjoy Korean Bar-B-Que. I visited this place with my father who had recommended this restaurant based on an ad that this place had bought in a Korean newspaper where Hae Jang Chon had touted themselves as being well regarded by the Los Angeles Times. This restaurant is also known for their faux rustic appeal (e.g. tin soju cups) and a stone grill that diverges from the typical metal grill you get from any other Korean BBQ joint.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â A Good First ImpressionGetting to the restaurant, I was surprised to be greeted in really good English. Upon being seated, the first language that was initially served to us was in good English. In fact, most of the customers here were not Korean. So I first thought to myself, ah, this is great. This place can certainly serve as a restaurant to well represent my people. After all, Korea has come a long way in its largely beleaguered history and we really deserve a place like this. But then....We got the $17.99 All you can eat special which had an array of ""good quality"" meat. First we had the beef tongue. Now I love beef tongue because the it is so versatile and it can be found in a range of diverse foods (from Mexican Tacos to Kosher Sandwiches). Needless to say, the tongue was good. Then we had the tripe and this is where you could tell that the quality was not there. The tripe served at this place is akin to the tripe that is served at Chinese dim sum STEAMED. When grilled you get a soft and jelly like consistency with a bland taste. To be fair, I thought, maybe the nasty bits aren't this place's speciality so let's give them the benefit. Then we had the kalbi (short ribs). The beef was so tough and bland that I would have actually preferred Taco Bell horse meat. I was the first one to try the meat and I quickly advised my dad to give it a go. He ate one and admitted it was tough but that there are actually Korean people who like meat cooked this way (I prefer my steaks medium rare). I thought that this logic was reasonable but in this case, there was no fucking way that Koreans enjoyed meat this awful. I watched in amazement as he had another piece and then in horror as he spit started spitting eat piece that he chewed into his napkin, only putting that meat into his mouth and giving it a couple chews as he was afraid of getting his crazy ass charged for leaving leftovers. As he was eating he remarked, there are actually a couple of okay pieces on the grill. Fantastic dad. At this point my mind was wandering. My appetite was gone. I started looking around at everyone else in the restaurant in an almost punch drunk stupor, thinking to myself, good God, this restaurant is full. Amazingly my crazy father ordered more meat. (AYCE right?). I told him to only order for himself (which he did). Gordon Ramsay could have served the next course and I would have rejected it. He struggled to finish and ingeniously left it over and asked the waitress to cut it up and mix it with the fried rice we got at the end. To be courteous we asked for a to-go box to take the rice home, the server said there was a no take home policy. Oh well. So it has been a while since I have given up on humanity. Therefore the rave reviews by my fellow Yelpers are actually not surprising. After all, it might be easy to get distracted by the unique ambiance and the interesting way the grill is cleaned in front of your face. At first I thought the stone grill would be an interesting alternative method to cooking meat. It turned out to be a gimmick. As for the LA Times reporter that recommended this place, I have concluded that she must have been on crack, or even worse: white and reviewing a Korean restaurant.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  On a Final NoteAs I was walking out the door (it did not hit my ass), I noticed that Psalm 28:7 was prominently emblazoned on the window by the owners, perhaps suggesting that this food would bring you to Jesus. I have since lost faith in God."

8/2/2014,3 star rating,"We arrived about a quarter after 4pm and we were seated in approx 5 mins or less. We informed the host that we'll need 1 highchair. The high chair situated at our table had broken seat belt straps and they changed it out for us quickly. Â I like that they had banchans ready at our table. There were kim chee, bean sprouts, potato salad, and my favorite was spinach. After we gotten our iced water, we were ready to order (AYCE). We were limited to 4 items at a time so we asked for brisket, galbi (marinaded), thin cut pork belly, and kim chi pancakes. Our grill was very hot just by the steam and the waiters came by to lower the heat. I thought the waiters and waitresses were pretty attentive to our grill in terms of heat, the meat, and they usually cleaned our grill a few times after we consumed each food round. I am a fan of briskets and galbi, however some of the brisket cuts were too lean or the galbi marinade was too young and tough, also the thin cut pork belly had cartilage in them. I was somewhat disappointed but it wasnt a big deal. We asked for pork shoulder but the waitress convinced us to not order that cause it was too greasy and the hot oil/grease would bounce off the grill and injure our kids face. We took her advice and ordered something else. Â Customer service was exceptional even if we pushed the HELP button a couple times. They had patience with us the entire time so our dining experience over all was good."
5/10/2014,4 star rating,"Mmm...I love the fried rice that they make at the end! HJC is my favorite AYCE restaurant in LA. The service is surprisingly friendly and attentive, given how busy the restaurant is. The wait is always long, but stick it out! Deliciousness awaits you once you are seated. I haven't been here in a few years, but from what I can remember, prices were comparable to other AYCE places in K-town. Other random bits of advice: don't order the squid (takes forever to cook). Don't be that person that orders the hot dogs."
8/16/2010,5 star rating,"Yay for late late night Korean BBQ! We picked up my husband from the airport around 11:30pm and he was starving and craving Korean BBQ! Thank god this place is open late. We got here around midnight and there was plenty parking and plenty seating.We ordered the short ribs, bulgogi and squid to start and it was so satisfying! They had the traditional sides to eat with your meat and the waiter was so awesome to recommend placing the kim chi on the stone burner. It was so good. You also get your choice of steamed rice or kim chi fried rice. Since I was the only fan of kim chi, I opted for steamed rice because they make the fried rice for 2 people. Waiter: ""would you like more meat?""Us: ""yes!"" Â Another 2 orders of short ribs hit the spot! Â The kids, my husband and I left so full and happy. The kids knocked out in the car and it was a happy ride home for mom and dad!!"
6/14/2011,4 star rating,I love the kimchi fried rice here. I wish it would be available when we eat our meat though. The meat is also good quality meat. I like the fact that we have an option to pick between thick or thin sliced pork belly. There bbq pork is also delicious and very tasty. Their side dishes are not that bad and their salad is fresh. I like the fact that there is a lot of meat selections for only $16.99. I would have to say that it's a lot better than Road to Seoul. The service is great and they were also readily available. p.s. Did I say I LOVE their fried rice---probably the best dish at this place!
9/22/2018,5 star rating,"It's a tourist 5-star rating, where I live there isn't a decent Korean BBQ place. Despite that, it is probably still a solid 4. Lots of meat choices, I really like the beef tongue, but thought Galbi is a bit weird; another thing odd is they cook it for you, it's not like they don't let you flip the meat on the stone grill, but it still takes some of the fun out of doing my own BBQ. I guess they do that to control the flow."
1/5/2016,4 star rating,"Great bibimbop and bulgoghi but really weak on bahn Â Chan! Â Go to place for pork tonkatsu, Terri chicken and tofu soup. Â Free yogurt used to be better but a very good place to grub out. Â I always bring my own eggs to add to bibimbop and tofu soup!"
6/15/2016,4 star rating,"Finally got to try this place. Honestly the only reason why It took me this long to try it is because of the line and it's because of how much it is. I mean this place is so much more convenient for me since its down the street but it is a little pricy and I understand why. For lunch it's $22 & for dinner it's $24 for ayce!! Just a tip, come during lunch because it's not busy but for dinner you'll be waiting for hours!!! The food here is great. The brisket is a good quality meat and it's not too greasy for me. The bulgogi is also good, marinated differently. Also tried the Canadian pork belly and it's very similar to brisket. Got the thin slice and it was pretty good. All the meat are good. Miso soup was a little different but I guess that's just how they make it. They have fish cake and it was spicy. So it was different. Also tried the kimchi pancake!!! Pretty good. Overall the food and quality is really good and that's why it's a little pricy compared to other Korean bbqs down the street. The service was okay. I like how they come here and there asking what we want next and how they would cook our food. However I'm holding back one star because one of the server that was helping us was like not happy to serve us. He had a weird tone to his voice but whatever cause everyone else was nice. Also I asked for a side of rice and napkins a few times and it took awhile to come. Actually the side of rice didn't even come. So I them cooking was great but they forget all the little stuff."

9/7/2016,3 star rating,"Everything was very tasty, but they were very busy, and thus pretty pushy. Every time we finished cooking something, they asked if we wanted more. When we said we wanted to just take a little break, the servers just kept asking, ""What meat do you want?"" So, I don't know if it's worth the wait, but the food is good."
2/27/2014,4 star rating,"I've been here a few times now. Â It's one of my top AYCE Korean BBQ. Â The parking lot is valet only.The Service ---The service is good. Â They're really quick to fill up any banchan or salad you're low on as well as clean your grill and cook your food for you if you're lagging. Â On a side note, you have to have your whole party there to be seated.The Food ---As for the meat, my favorites are the Brisket, Bulgogi and the Thin Pork Belly. Â The Thin Pork Belly is definitely the best. Â If you get anything, get that! Â They give you some pretty good Kimchi Fried Rice at the end of your meal so make sure to save room!The Prices ---$19 for AYCE.I recommend this place. Â Check it out!"
10/13/2013,5 star rating,"I can never get tired of this place! My mouth is watering thinking of the next time I'm coming back! $18.99 AYCE is pretty darn good! Â Come hungry leave so stuffed that you don't even have another meal for the rest of the day!Front Valet parking for $2 in the afternoon. Â If you come early it's self parking. Â I think they start the Valet around 1 or 2pm.They won't seat you if all of the ppl in your party is not there. My favorite meats I always get is brisket and marinated short ribs! Soooooo good! Â I have a 3 year old Daughter so she eats hot dogs which they do have.For the most part, they are pretty attentive but once or twice I had to push the button to ring the bell at my table to get there attention but they come running fast.I always eat wayyyyyy too much to even order their Kimchi Fried Rice that they make at your table at the end of your meal. I mean....it's AYCE soooo who has room for Kimchi Fried Rice after all that protein you been stuffing in your mouth? !?! Â The Kimchi Fried Rice is included in the price so next time. ..I'll try to leave a little bit more room. One time I wanted to try it so bad so I asked them to make just a small portion which they did and it was really good! Â But it's just too much carbs to eat after you're already stuffed!Hands down... I'm hooked on this place!Just a tip. ..it's best to come early! Â I came on a Friday night at 8ish and waited almost an hour cuz the line was out the door! Â I waited cuz it's worth it but never coming back on a Friday night again! :-)"
11/25/2015,5 star rating,"This place is great for AYCE KBBQ! I've only been here two times but the meats they offer for even the regular menu is already containing a large variety to choose from. Their meats are always fresh, abundant, and tasty! Aside form the amazing food you would get from the place, their servers are extremely experienced and nice. They are willing to even help you cook your meat if they see you struggling. I've enjoyed my experience every time I went and think it was definitely worth the price!"
12/23/2016,5 star rating,Great place for some real Korean BBQ make sure you try to beef tongue it's the best and get some steamed egg and kimchi pancake to go with the meat
7/24/2014,4 star rating,"This place is one of the best Al You Can Eat Korean BBQ places in LA. The meat is very tender and fresh and they are very generous is asking if you want more meat. The Bugolgi and the brisket are probably my favorite meats that they offer on the AYCE menu. While the meat and everything is very fresh, the one thing that is kind of lacking is their variety of BanChan. There have been times ive come here where I have only gotten 3 dishes, and the most I have gotten is 5. They are also less than reluctant to refill them when they are empty, I had to remind our waitress 3 times just to get some more."
10/26/2016,5 star rating,"This is the spot for Korean BBQ. It's definitely one of the better ones I've been to in LA. The meats tasted good, the deal is decent, and the service was awesome. We are so much and it's cool that they don't have a time limit like some all you can eat Korean BBQ places. This place gets pretty busy so you'll probably be waiting for a while if you come during peak hours. The only thing that was disappointing was the kimchi pancakes, they weren't very flavorful at all and mainly tasted like dough. The servers cook everything for you and make sure to get kimchi fried rice at the end. That stuff hits the spot for sure. I'll definitely be back here."
10/26/2016,5 star rating,"Seriously the best AYCE in Los Angeles. Eaten here 3 times and they never disappointed. I love the fact that they cook for you so you don't have to deal with burnt meat or having to be responsible for the cooking while others ate!! Price is reasonable for what you get too. Also the workers are easy to communicate with and are very informative when you ask questions. They all seem eager to do their job haha. Service is great, quality of food is great. It gets super busy by 3pm so I would reserve if you're eating with a lot of people if I were you. This place is hands down my favorite kbbq."
10/27/2015,4 star rating,"Interesting grill and the way they clean the grill too. It is quite entertaining. Beef quality is not bad. Services are quite good. The only negative thing about this restaurant is the grill. Even though it looks cool and different from other restaurants, it act like a steaming grill not actual grill. The meat doest get crispy enough of the design of the grill."
1/17/2016,5 star rating,Our waiter look like carrot top!! $30 tip and all!! I'm always a big fan Korean BBQ. I would never eat tofu house is not worth the money but Korean BBQ is worth the money!! To the math next time u eat at both places.
9/3/2016,5 star rating,"This place is awesome! Amazing service, great cuts of meat, and a steal of a price! I'm normally not a fan of all you can eat Korean bbq, typically going to places with higher quality meats, but this place is def special! I've been to most of the best Korean bbq spots in LA, NY and ATL (the top 3 Korean good cities) and think this place is one of my faves. The two best meats you need to order are the thinly sliced pork belly and beef brisket. The beef brisket is prime cut and you can def tell! Also had the short ribs that were good, but not what to go for IMO. The fried rice at the end is a great close to the meal. Highly recommend going. We went on a Saturday afternoon (of Labor Day weekend) around 12 and only waited 15min. Lines were piling up after we left though so go early! Go hungry and give the servers a nice tip bc they'll make sure you get through your meal happy and satisfied!Can't wait to come back!"
9/3/2016,5 star rating,"It's lit! Awesome means, great drinks... Long wait is a buzzkill but perfectly worth it once you get to try the marinated short rib ... To die for!"
9/20/2015,3 star rating,"Not so impressed . Came there on Saturday , the wait time was an hour . Meats was ok , but nothing crazy. We tried pancakes it was ok also. The reason I rate that low because you don't feel relax there ... They fry meats for you which is cool , but I think I actually prefer do it myself and take my time.They brought the check quicker that I ever seen and as we were finishing the rest of the food and drinks the server stop by about three times just staring at us like - are u done yet ? Before we even finish they start slowly take stuff away and look at us making me really uncomfortable... Again the food was nothing special ... They are open until 2AM and they have bunch of reviews but I don't think I will be back here ......"

8/31/2013,5 star rating,"Been here once, and it's easily become my favorite KBBQ place! I went on a Thursday night, tried to make reservations for 2 but was just told to walk in. Got there around 7pm and had no trouble being seated right away. The host / cashier was awesome and attentive!The service was great from the minute we sat down. Side dishes came quickly and they even have kimchi panckae which I've never seen as a side dish elsewhere. We did the cheapest AYCE which was 18.99 I believe, and so worth it. The quality of the meats were great, and at the very end, they cook kimchi fried rice over the skillet and it's sooooooooooo good.Would come here again and again, especially since they take reservations for larger parties!"
9/2/2016,5 star rating,"WOW, amazing korean BBQ....if i could go everyday and just eat at this place i would. The service is amazing they always take care of you when you order meat. One thing you should consider is the time/day you go. If you plan to go on fri or sat after 6pm be prepared to wait about 2hrs to get a seat. If you go during the weekdays you may even still wait 30mins or so...there is a reason why this place is packed and you have to wait a while to get your food. I've been going to Â korean bbq places for the past 15yrs and i usually go to 1 or 2 places till they change owners or the food/quality changes but this place has so far been great and now is my new korean bbq spot."
7/20/2016,5 star rating,I was so overwhelmed by the service. He was so enthusiastic and quick every time we ordered. Meat quality was great and there was little time between every meat that we ordered.
9/13/2013,4 star rating,"I had a craving for some Korean BBQ so me and the boyfriend decided to try out this all you can eat spot out late on a Saturday night. We found parking on the street and had a 20 min wait but after we were seated everything else happened pretty quickly. I like how the sides dishes are already on the table when you sit down that way you can snack as you wait for the meat to cook. We ordered all kinds of meat my fav was the short ribs, they had great flavor! Our server was pretty attentive she came over a couple of times to check on us but pretty much let us do our own thing. Toward the end of the meal they make kimichi fried rice but by that time I was already full.Good deal for all of the delicious meat options, we'll def. be back soon to get our fix"
7/18/2014,5 star rating,"First time eating here and it was bomb as f***!! We were looking for a good place to eat and we were feeling kbarb! Thanks to one of our friends recommendations we ended up in ktown! This place has the juiciest meat i have ever tasted!! They have really good side dishes as well! We got some kimchi pancakes and it was delish! The service was really good cause they'd come to our table and cut our meat. When we were low on meat,they'd ask if we have any more orders. The place is pretty small but it felt like i was in korea! They dont use traditional grillers too! The griller is like marble or something where your meat dont get stuck! Good experience and is definitely come here again when im in cali!!!!"
8/30/2014,4 star rating,"The meat fresh and the service is good. They take care of customer, but not go there on Friday or weekend. Really busy and we have to wait almost one hour! The price is $21.99 per person for dinner. $19.99 for lunch."
2/25/2014,4 star rating,"Got here at 6 p.m. on a Friday, so we didn't have to wait at all! Â However, that changed as a crowd slowly formed. Â Initially, I had called to make reservations, but they said that they only take them for 8 ppl or more on the weekends. Â We were lucky to have been able to arrive when we did to beat the crowd. Â AYCE is $18.99, and they allowed us to get up to four different kinds of meats at once. Â Service was excellent - most of the time, someone came by and cooked our meat for us and cut it! Â That's pretty rare. Â I had been looking forward to the marinated kalbi, but I was disappointed. Â While the quality was good, it had barely any sauce. Â A friend who had been there before said it was much sweeter the last time she came. Â We thought we got the wrong one, so we ordered another plate, but it was the same thing. Â We also tried the shrimp, cha dol (thin meat), pork shoulder (my friend best described this as a cross between chicken and fish - it had a weird texture to it though the flavor was fine), beef tongue (a little thicker than the cha dol), and the sam gyup sal, which was delicious. Â We got a couple orders of the thick sam gyup sal, it was so good. Â Their sides are okay - I think the rice cake wrappers were old bc they were stiff, so no one wanted to eat them.At the end, they made some kimchi rice for us. Â I thought it would be really good, but it was just alright. Â Tasted a lot like too much butter. Â The fried rice at Mapo Dak Galbi is a lot better. Â Anyway, good service and good meat, so four stars overall."

Â They give you the Korean fried rice at the end, but during that time I was already beyond full to even eat any of that.Meat was delicious and came in some pretty big portions, they were quick in trying to get us in and out putting the meats in our plates the minute it was done.

2/5/2014,4 star rating,"This is my uzhe kbbq restaurant. Peter & I started coming here about 4.5 years ago because I was lured in by the cute pig logo. I used to just refer to it as ""the pig restaurant.""The food here is bomb diggity. Banchan is good, service is good. There's really nothing bad to say about this place! It does get crowded though if you wait til peak hours to get yo' eat on. Highly recommend coming early! My fave meats are the pork shoulder and the beef tongue. Super tender and tasty! You also want to save some of your meat for the end of the meal when they bring out the fried rice & chigae! NOMZ. I've taken tons of non-asian friends here who have been begging me to take them out to kbbq. Every one of them has loved it. There's lots of non-asians who eat here...so if you're not asian...you don't need to feel sheepish about dining here!One year I held my birthday party here. They have a recording that sings happy birthday to you! The picture of me & my fam is hanging somewhere on the wall ;D"
2/23/2014,5 star rating,"AYCE Korean BBQ for $19?! I'm in. I was heading to LA to meet up with a couple of friends and was deciding on which Korean BBQ place to go. I yelped up a bunch of places and this was the one that stood out the most. I got there around 7pm on a Thursday night and there wasn't a wait. We got seated immediately and started ordering the meat (bulgogi, short ribs, thick pork belly, etc.).They first serve you some ban chan and then all the meats. For $19, it is definitely worth the price! You get so much food and everything tastes really good! I highly recommend the short ribs. They marinate it so well. The sauces that come with the meat complements the meat very well. They clean your grill every time you order more food, so your grill will always be clean. You also get kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal, but I usually never get it because my stomach is about to explode by the time I'm finished with the KBBQ.The waiters here are very attentive to your needs and will cook for you when they come by your table. The only thing that sucks is that the parking lot at the plaza is valet. Other than smelling like KBBQ after your meal, this is definitely a place I will go to whenever I stop by LA."
1/8/2016,4 star rating,"I am an avid KBBQ eater and I my family came to Hae Jang Chon on Thanksgiving, for we would rather devour meat than turkey. For the price, this restaurant is really good, has a lot of choices, and the service is pretty great. Korean restaurants are not exactly known for their service, but the meat came out very quickly and the manager was very friendly. That is all I can ask for, honestly. I love that you cook on top of old ceramic lids, cooking the meat fairly quickly. They do fry rice for you at the end, and I found the rice to be a bit too buttery for my taste, but I know that a lot of people enjoy that aspect. I'll be back for more :)"
3/16/2017,5 star rating,"First time here and my sisters and I had the best service from our server Jun. Sweet, kind, and a little dorky but it makes him cute. Always came back to make sure that our meats weren't burning, refilled our waters when we ran out, and always asked us if we wanted more meat. Giving him a shout out because he made our experience ten times better! :) Overall good variety of meats and it open late for an all you can eat KBBQ, so thats a plus!"
8/26/2016,5 star rating,"This is honestly the best kbbq all you can eat place I have ever had. From the service to the food, the customers get the best quality. The meat is all very tasty , but throwing in the options of kimchi pancakes and kimchi fried rice adds more bang to my buck when I go here. It is a little pricey since I am working on a college students budget, but it was worth it because not only the food was good and filled me up, but the customer service was good because the servers would always check in with me and manage the meat on the grill while I eat. Also they clean the grill with onions...yum! I approve and recommend this place"
12/12/2016,1 star rating,The worst customer service ever. Â The greeter at the door was very rude. I also found a hair in my food and an insect in my side dish. Then my drinking glass had lipstick mark on it. I had the perfect trifecta of a horrible dinner experience.

2/20/2014,5 star rating,Good quality meat with good customer service ?! One of the best korean BBQ I've tried in ktown. I've been to plenty of different kbbq restaurants in LA to say this with a reason. I was surprised how all the side dishes tasted good and marinated meat was just on point. I especially liked the BBQ squid and beef tongue. It was soft and delicate. I will definitely come back :) I would rate this place above almost all the ayce restaurants I've been to. -5/5 stars!
8/24/2014,4 star rating,"Okay. AYCE meat, obviously. But you will be very wrong if you thought all AYCE meats are the same. There are some subtle, but important differences between them. One quick note about this location: I thought it was rather small. If you have a big party, I think it'll be better to choose a large kbbq place to accommodate you.The AYCE here will come out to right around $20. They have a large selection of meats to choose from, so no worries there. They also have different flavored samgyupsal, which I thought was pretty cool, as well as sausages.. Yes.. sausages.. Â Extremely odd, so we tried ordering it, only to receive those 50 cent weiners you can buy at any Vons or Ralphs. So don't get that.The service is great, since their place is so small. Unlike other gogi places, this is a place that you can actually sit and talk to your friends. Also, one thing that really sets this place apart from other AYCE places is their famour Kimchi Bokkeumbap they make for you on the grill at the very end. This is absolutely delicious, but I do get pretty darn full by then, so I am not TOO crazy about it.Parking is valet, or a very very tough time at finding street parking. There is also a nice dessert patbingsoo place that just opened up in the same plaza. I'm not too crazy about it, but I heard some people love it. Easy dessert option after.David's VPP (Value per price): 7/10"

But yes, they lied. They don't even care!Second time, we were ordering more meat. Instead of taking the order, the waitress came to us and warned us that they will charge Â $15 per person for wasting food and walked away. Oh my, I was working for a all-you-can-eat restaurant, the meat we didn't finish was far less than so called ""wasting food"". I am not sure the waitress had a bad day or what. We did not appreciate the attitude. She ruined our evening. I admit that the second time we went there by mistake. We don't live in the area so I completely forgot that we went to this one a couple years ago. My parents were with us so I didn't want the hassle looking for another restaurant. That's why we went for the second time.I don't care what high class meat you are providing. Customer service takes a big part of restaurant business."

Came here for an after work gathering of the minds and boy, was my mind blown!This was my first KBBQ experience and if I ever go again that place will have some big shoes to fill. Located right in the heart of K-Town, easy to find. They have valet parking for 2.00. The lot can get pretty full and Valet does fill up fast. If you have a larger group they wont seat you till the whole group is there, so be sure your buds are on time because the wait can get crazy!Reasonably priced and good service, what more can you ask for? Oh yeah, amazing food...CHECK!There is like a dozen+ typed of meat to choose from, the kimchi pancake was delish and the steamed egg. The kimchi fried rice at the end was a little lacking but still very good.You walk out of here full and satisfied!"

Really good sides and a long list of options on the menu. The BBQ squid, pork shoulder, marinated short rib, and brisket are all standouts. Love that they give you fermented soy bean paste as a dipping sauce, too."
9/4/2013,1 star rating,"Came back to LA and naturally I Â wanted some AYCE Korean bbq. Â A friend of mine rec this placed based on yelp reviews. I don't know what all the hype is about. The meat quality isn't good. They skimp on the sides. The sauces are bland. The wait staff it worst and most korean places. It was impossible to get their attention to get more food. I got tired of ringing the ""doorbell"" so I went up to the counter and grabbed a tray of meat and brought it to our table. The waiters didn't even notice. To make the experience even worse. They are super cheap with the AC. I was dripping sweat while eating. I would eagerly anticipate when a person would walk thru the front door because a cool breeze would blow in . It's literally hotter inside this tiny establishment than it is outside. While eating I eagerly waited for someone to walk thru the door because a cool breeze would blow in. It got so bad that I had to go to the car to change my shirt! Turn around, get back in your car, and go somewhere else. This place is overrated and they literally make you sweat."

12/2/2013,5 star rating,"Oh. Emm. Gee.This place was fabulous! My only complaint is that my stomach could not hold as much food as I would've liked to have eaten.Here's the run down...Parking was a breeze with $2 valet service. You can't beat that!Seating can be tough here and they don't take reservations. Plan ahead and go early. That is the only option.Food is awesome and a steal at $17 bucks a head especially when you consider that they do most of the cooking for you! Seriously. I couldn't believe that they were cooking the meat for us. It's no wonder this place can have a 2 hour wait on the weekend. We didn't have the room to try all 12 kinds of meat but we had marinated bulgogi, pork belly, beef, hot dogs, intestines, and shrimp. We may have eaten more than that but I can't remember it all because of the food coma I was in when I left this place. As if that doesn't make you want to jump right up and run to your car I have three words for you - kimchi fried rice! All of the sides were amazing too. I seriously cannot wait to go back here. My friends and I decided we should even make this a regular monthly affair. It was that good. I mean it, get in your car and go there now. They are open until 2:00 AM everyday so there is no excuse not to have time to give it a try. GO! NOW!"
3/4/2017,5 star rating,This place is great! The food is fresh and has a lot flavor. The brisket and spicy beef where my favorite Â by far. The only bad thing I can say is theres is a long wait.

4/7/2014,4 star rating,"Under $20 AYCE is almost always a good time and Hae Jang Chon does not disappoint.Meats were aplenty, sauces were great, service was alright, and the steamed egg/tofu soup was delicious! Â Kimchi fried rice was pretty good too but definitely a trial to eat after the torrent of delicious meats. Â Come here hungry and wearing something you don't mind will smell like Korean BBQ afterwards because baby, you'll be smelling it for the rest of the day.This is definitely on the list to hit up on SoCal trips and if you love KBBQ, it really should be on yours too.

2/15/2014,5 star rating,"Salad dressing is awesome.The side dishes remind me of my childhood. Meat quality is awesomeblossom.I can perfectly describe this restaurant with not just one word but with one letter. The letter of the day is ""M"". As in: MmMmMmMmMmMm. It's a bit pricey ($18.99) compared to other ayce places but there's a reason for that. The quality is definitely better than the $9.99 places. (You have two options. One is to go with the all you can eat meat. Two is to order meals. Stews and rice&veggie meals and whatnot. As in ayce is not mandatory here.)My group got cha-dole, seng-galbi, chun-gyup-sal, sam-gyup-sal (thick cut), and yang-nyum-galbi. After finishing the meat portion of the meal, your party chooses to have (a) kimchi fried rice (DANKDANKDANKDANK) or (b) stew and noo-roong-jee (to gogi noobs: Idk how to describe it so that it sounds good....It's rice soup but not porridge...google Â for more info ha). Â I'll remember to edit this review with the meats translated in English. If you can't settle on what to get, order from the short list above. My friend ordered for us. She knows what's up. Trust us. Ps gogi means meat in Korean. You're officially a gogi noob if you didn't know what gogi meant until right now. But that's ok. I can teach you all about Korean food. Also: gogi and kogi is the same thing. As in the Kogi truck. I personally think gogi sounds less foreign than kogi. Personal preferences."

With 2 people it can be easy to get a table but if you have a large party of 4 or more... good luck.Best times to come are before 6pm, before the dinner rush.There is valet parking for $2 but its a one way lot, so becareful!"
10/4/2014,5 star rating,"This restaurant is without a doubt the best AYCE KBBQ place that I know of. Â Having gone to school in LA where the KBBQ options are pretty extensive, I went to 3-4 different places which were pretty good before my girlfriend recommended this one.Whenever I need AYCE KBBQ in LA, I come here. Â For less than $25 per person, you have over a dozen options. Â Most places (for a little less, granted) will give maybe 3-6 options of basic cuts.Here you can get brisket, tongue, bulgogi, squid, octopus, bacon, marinated pork, stomach, etc. Â I certainly tried a number of new types of meat while at Hae Jang Chon. Â The tongue is a must try. Â All other options are very good to excellent. Â At the end, (if you are not dying from overeating) you get Kimchi fried rice.Because this place is very popular, if you go in the evening be prepared to wait. Â During the day it tends to be less crowded. Â I have been 3 times, and next time I am in LA, this restaurant is on my list."
4/3/2013,1 star rating,"WORST, MOST DEGRADING TREATMENT I'VE EVER HAD.What the eff. As a usual patron here, what just happened to my Gf and I absolutely bewilders me. I've never been so treated rudely and ignored like that before at a restaurant. At a 4-star restaurant that I'm a regular at. So, around 5:15pm, we enter and the restaurant is slow. Being regulars, we knew we were there before the rush and were relieved we didn't have to wait, and we would get our choice of the tables, and efficient service. Wrong. On all assumptions (guess I made an ass of out me). 1) We were sat in the corner of the restaurant where the sun glared into our eyes. Upon being asked to move to the table next to it, we were met with an exasperated sigh and muttering under his breath on how much of an inconvenience you are. Don't let these eyes fool you-- I understand Korean too, jackass. I replied back that I was sorry for inconveniencing him, and he answers back, ""good thing we aren't busy."" Seriously? Am I supposed to be happy with sun in my eyes? These eyes don't have automatic shades, buddy. 2) so after the moaning, groaning, and under-the-breath shit talking, we are moved only for our waiters to disappear on us. They didn't even bother lighting the fire for our stove. They just told us that we had to wait for it to heat up. So we wait. And wait. And wait. Then we watch a new group being seated, and have their stove lit. Uh... Then another group. I feel like the waiters were passive aggressively ignoring us-- more on the passive side. So the Gf kindly flags down a waitress (red headed broad) who finally lights it for us with ease. Walks away without any word. Then the flame goes out. We flag her down again. And this time she scolds us that we would have to wait another 10min for the stone to get cold. You gotta understand. We waited 30 min staring at our raw meat left out in the sun because we got the defective stove. And we were punished for not wanting to sit where the sun was shining. 3) she tosses the meat onto our stone grill and then we wait some more. We watch as our raw brisket remains.... Raw. Like lukewarm heat waves waft from the still VERY raw meat. We try flagging down our waitress. Once. Wait. Twice. Wait. Third time is the charm? No cigar. It's no conspiracy. They were intentionally ignoring us. It was when we flagged down the hostess (who was the only silver lining to this degrading horror story), did the waiters come around. Or maybe it was my asking for a manager that did it. But our waitress had the audacity to scold us that we needed to wait for the meat to cook. Uhh lady, we waited for 30min total. Even your grill guys agreed it was broken. But they just added more meat onto the grill, sautÃ©ed it around a little, and left our table basically saying there was nothing they could do. We just sat there stunned. What just happened? I couldn't believe that we were being so mistreated. As regular customers. Hell as customers period. I never ever ever do this but we literally stood up and just left. Our raw meat still sizzling on the stone top. I wonder if that meat ever really got cooked. Thank you for treating dogs better than us. We will never come back again. The manager conveniently was away from his post but if his employees are this rude and careless, I don't see how he can trust them to handle his business."

1/20/2017,4 star rating,"The meat is good and there is service. Some all you can eats, never come to get your order, but this one is pretty good at checking on if you want more meat. Only thing is, the waitress seems to have attitude. But whatever, food is good. Veggies are extra $5. That part sucks... it's like $26 per person and they charge for veggies?!? Kimchee rice is tasty but they should add an egg. I think that would make it bomb. One of the better Korean BBQ joints."

All of the kinds of meat we ordered were very good, and the kimchi and other side dishes were solid as well. After we ate all the meat we could, they cooked us some great kimchi fried rice. We were very full by the time we left.All in all this was a very satisfying meal. Can check AYKE BBQ off the list."
12/14/2015,4 star rating,21.99 ayce with kimchi fried rice and kimchi Pancake options? Â Deal! Fishcake banchan was kinda strong with jalapeÃ±o flavor but kimchi Pancake was delish. Â Music was great! Felt like I was partying through my dinner
3/21/2015,1 star rating,"TRIGGER WARNING: This is the saddest story ever told.It was 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon. I had 1.5 hours to kill in Koreatown while my car was being washed/waxed at Sun Hand Car Wash. Was I alone? Yes. Was I feeling secure in my solo afternoon? Absolutely. All of this confidence, however, would soon come crashing down when I was denied a late lunch at Hae Jong Chon.You see, this restaurant HATES single people. If you are not with a friend, family member, or lover, you are not welcome here. An incredibly cruel boy working there explained this fascist policy to me. I tried reasoning with him, pulling out my Apple iPhone 5S to show him the troves of wonderful people in my life: friends, family members, coworkers, the new dog my Dad just adopted. None of this worked.Even though there were plenty of empty tables available (as I mentioned it was around 3:30/4:00 p.m.), and even though I promised to eat a ""shit-ton"" of food, the cruel boy would not budge, ""We have a two person minimum.""Left with no other choice, I began to cry and explained that he had really hurt my feelings. This tactic didn't work, unfortunately, and only filled him with more contempt for me. His cold, silent face seemed to say, ""Pathetic. Friendless people like you don't deserve our BBQ..."" As I wept openly, the restaurant's patrons began to take notice. A mother clutched her infant son tightly, surely thinking, ""That poor man. I hope my child never grows up to have lunch by himself.""I ran out of the restaurant, and proceeded to descend into a shame spiral that would take me through the darkest corners of LA and of my mind. I never made it back to Sun Hand Car Wash, I don't know where my car is, and I'm writing this review from a public computer at a library somewhere in Mid City. I wish I had just gone to Dan Sung Sa!"

8/29/2013,4 star rating,This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ places in Los Angeles. The only thing I hate about this place is they don't serve Pork Intestines compared to other KBBQ places. You cook your food too in a fancy hot pot lol!
11/27/2014,4 star rating,The food was good. We didn't have to wait to long for a table but I felt the staff very rushed. Our waiter did his best to be attentive but be prepared to wave down and call for attention. Â I would come back.
10/20/2017,5 star rating,"One of the best and busiest KBBQ spots in LA! Been here a few times, and although every time there's a line out the door, I think it's usually worth the wait. This is an AYCE KBBQ joint, where the meat is cooked on a stone surface. They have a wide variety of meats (up to 27 I think), plus additional sides. Personally, I felt that the staff was very attentive throughout our meal; they answered the call light within seconds, came around every couple of minutes to help assist cooking our meat, and asked if we were doing ok or needed anything else. We never had to ask for them to clean our grill off they just came by and did so between meat cooking. The meat quality was very good. There is only a couple dollar difference between lunch and dinner, but you get what you pay for. Overall, this is an excellent place to go to if you're in the mood and have the stomach for it. The only downside to this place I would have to say is parking, there is a parking lot, but it's valet only ($2.00), otherwise street parking it is!"
7/2/2013,5 star rating,"One of the best AYCE KBBQ. It's always packed at night since they are open late. Best time to come would be for lunch on the weekdays.If you are a big rice eater than you should know they only allow one bowl of rice per person unless you want to pay more, but who wants to waste stomach space on rice with so much good meat?Good variety of sides. Love the Kimchi Pancake and Steamed Egg. Can't go to another kbbq without those.You get your standard brisket and bulgogi. Quality is way better than other places. The meat is fresh and not frozen. Beef tongue is very soft and tender. Best thing on the menu are the Pork Belly and Pork Shoulder. Some of the best I ever had! So soft and tender. The thin cut is better than the thick cut. Just melts in your mouth.There are dozens of kbbq places in this area, but none have compared. It's as good as, if not better than, Road to Seoul."
4/13/2013,5 star rating,"The best Korean BBQ I have ever had.Whenever I have a chance to make my way over to Koreatown, Hae Jang Chon is a must. Â Although parking was difficult and waits were lengthy the times I had visited, it is so incredibly worth it.The All You Can Eat menu is set up very simply; for only $17.99 you have a diverse selection of meats and a series of sides that will be served periodically throughout your visit.The last time I was here, I came with my buddy and his girlfriend and we ended up ordering five plates of kalbi (BBQ short rib), five plates of chadol (beef brisket), four plates of bulgogi (BBQ beef), two plates of samgyupsal (pork belly), a plate of spicy pork, individual bowls of rice, pajeon (korean kimchi pancakes), and of course the kimchi fried rice (we were all ridiculously full by the end of the meal). Â Every piece of meat was especially tender and flavorful -- and the quality was top notch.The servers visit your table extremely frequently, often times expediting the cooking process by draining your stone grill or distributing the meat for you. Â I'm not the best at speaking Korean, so it was also awesome that the workers were all bilingual and willing to communicate in whichever language was most comfortable for their customers.Most All You Can Eat Korean BBQ restaurants I visit tend to wait varying periods of time before bringing customers more meat (in order to save money and let the food settle in their stomachs, I suppose). Â What Hae Jang Chon does is brings you meat so incredibly quickly and efficiently, that you can't help but to feel full even after forty-five minutes or so. Â I honestly don't think there was ever a time when our grill was meatless.Hae Jang Chon is a quirky Korean BBQ restaurant known as one of the best in Los Angeles. Â It's unique stone grill, radish-grill-cleaning-techniques, and awesome meal-end kimchi fried rice make visiting Hae Jang Chon more than just a meal -- it's an experience."
12/7/2013,3 star rating,"Recommended by my friend that lives out in the area. He didn't disappoint. Food:Great selection for $20 AYCE and the meat is of pretty good quality. A lot of different banchan choices and dipping sauces. One thing I don't like is that they don't do free refills on the rice, not a big dislike though since that means I'll be eating more meat. Also if you get steamed rice they don't do the kimchi rice for you at the end. But then again I'd would like to eat my meat with rice not meat THEN rice. The table next to mine got the kimchi rice and it smelled wonderful though, they cook it on the grill so it picks up all the meat droppings. Service: Bad service when it is crowded so I'd usually try to avoid the peak hours. It can take awhile before they bring you your meat and if you want something else/more it takes awhile as well. Good service though and are great when it comes to birthdays too. Restaurant is kept nice and clean.Location:Like many other places in and around K-Town parking lots are usually crowded and street parking is hell. Good part is they have valet here and it's only $2 (not sure if the prices have gone up though). I'd rather spend the $2 than struggle to find street parking. Overall its good, but doesn't stand out greatly from the many other KBBQ places. My go to place with friends if we are feeling like driving from the valley."

4/5/2009,5 star rating,"FIrst off, this is a glowing review. Â This place is an AYCE that has it all -- great food, great service, and good extras (Kimchi pancake, Kimchie Fried rice at the end). Â This is the longest time I've ever spent at a Korean BBQ place -- 3 hours.First off, we showed up with a party of 8, and got placed in a big combo table with TWO grills. Â That was great, because then we were able to double the amount of meat we were eating. Â Their menu is a little bit more limited than most places, you have your choice of pork belly, chicken, kalbi, and beef brisket. Â The meat was excellent -- I have to rave mostly about their pork belly, which I'm told is ""Canadian Black Pork Belly"" -- it was definitely a huge step in taste above other KBBQ places. Â Juicy, tender, and hugely flavorful, esp when dipped in their samjang sauce-- I've never had such good pork belly, even at a la carte places, let alone at an AYCE. Â I am pretty sure I ate like 3 lbs of pork belly alone. Â The waitress also cooks for you -- so be forewarned if you like to ""man"" the grill. Â I found this actually entertaining and pretty cool. Â They were pretty quick with refills of meat and surprisingly good at checking in on your meat to make sure it wasn't overburning etc.The extras that I mentioned -- Korean Kimchi pancake, and the delicious Kimchi fried rice at the end, were a first for AYCE restaurants. Â Kimchi pancake was ok, a little squishy and not a huge flavor, but still pleasing to the palate when combined with all the greasy flavorful meats. Â In the end, we all left stuffed, happy, and I will definitely come back to Hae Jang Chon again in the future. Â Peace out."
8/15/2009,5 star rating,"This place was awesome!i myself am a korean food novice, but so far this is my favorite. The servers were really friendly and attentive. Thats probably what made it so enjoyable. They bring the meats in intervals and put it on the grill for you. All you need to worry about is flipping it over and devouring the food in front of you.That was the problem with the restaurant Masa. Your raw meats were intermingly with your cooked food.Here at haejangchon there is a seperate serving table to keep you salad, large bowl of kimchi and raw meets and prongs. we had the all-you-can-eat (just $17!). The pork belly was amazing. It melted in your mouth. I was a big fan of the kimchi pancake as well. I would definitely return. I would NOT recommend for a very large group of people. I'd say keep it at 6 people (max.)"
1/23/2012,4 star rating,"My friends and I drove one hour to try this place out. I saw on reviews that the wait was usually 1-2 hours so I went ahead and made reservations for ~15 people. A friend and I arrived first but they wouldn't seat us until we had everyone in our party present. And then after everyone arrived, we had to wait another 15 minutes until we were finally seated. :(Besides that, they have 19 items included in AYCE and the meat was delicious! The meat was well marinated and the side dishes were quite good. I sat with three of my friends, and we ended up eating 8 rounds of meat (2 types of meat each time) with many, many refills on radish slices and rice paper - all within two hours. :DOur favorites included:-Bulgogi-Marinated Beef Short Ribs-Black Angus Beef BrisketThis place does a pretty good job on cleaning the stove and disposing the excess oil. We rarely had to ask and someone would come by and change it for us.Towards the end, when we were all dying from happiness and meat in our tummy, our server came by and asked if we wanted kimchi fried rice. KIMCHI FRIED RICE?! Hell yes, we do! We request for 1/4 of the usual making; someone came to our table to prepare it for us, and if it were any other day, I would have happily asked for the full serving.Good: AYCE KBBQ with so many choices for $18 dinner, delicious meat, good service for a AYCE placeBad: parking, won't seat you unless all in your party is present"

5/3/2016,5 star rating,"Excellent venue and even better food! Service is top notch and the staff was very friendly and helpful. They cook the food for you so you don't have to mess with it too much and the best part was that they use cast iron over an open flame so the gas smell doesn't translate in to your food. Great side selections. My only issue was that they do not have duck breast, iced tea and do not make reservations for party's less than 6. But not bad enough to demerit this place. Thank you for a great experience!"
8/30/2013,4 star rating,"Came here with a group. We missed our reservation because I was late and they don't seat until the whole party is present. Luckily, the place wasn't that crowded and we were able to get a table. Place did get packed by 8pm. We did the all you can eat and the rib eye and tri-tips were good. The kimchee fried rice is also really good. They also have a little doorbell to ring for service, which is very convenient."

You can't go wrong with that. The meat selection is crazy....If you eat meat, you have to come here. Make this a must-do dinner excursion the next time you want a fun a delicious dining experience. Cheers mates."
11/18/2013,4 star rating,"Damn! Don't know why it took me so long to try this place. I remember coming here one time at night and the wait was too long so went to another place but went here for lunch and it was maybe less then half full.They got a pretty good variety of meat for your standard ayce price of $18.99 as of November 2013. The brisket is definitely the highlight as I'm not a fan of the heavily sauce marinated meats. The thin slice pork belly is great as well, a good alternative to the thick giant bacon sized ones that take a long ass time to cook.So you probably know its cooked on a stone grill which I find burns the meat a lot less easily compared to metal grills at other places but the one thing about a stone grill is that all the meat oil gets the time collect creating an oil bath for your meats. I don't know about you but I feel like I'm about to get acne just looking at my meat bathe in all that oil. The servers do come around every so often to clean up the oil using some daikon. Kimchi fried rice comes along at the end although you probably full as hell by then.Overall great place with good meat for an ayce. Stone grill is a good alternative even if the oil buildup will make acne prone people cringe. Long wait times at night. and small parking lot could cause a problem if you aren't patient."

6/9/2013,5 star rating,"I must echo the sentiments of my fellow yelpers, Michael P. and Catherine J. when I say that this is the best KBBQ I have had!Literally came here RIGHT when it opened at 11:00 AM Saturday because my friends and I were just too excited to get our grub on + we wanted to avoid any lines.Once we were seated, we immediately ordered our first round of meats: brisket, bulgogi, squid, and pork belly + the steamed egg and kimchi pancake. They have a good amount of banchan(?) I think its called? so we kept busy with the side dishes while we waited for the meat. I really liked the fishcakes & salad is always good. Once the meat came we immediately got down to business! Â I seriously loved everything that came!!! My favorites would have to be brisket (mah #1 love) and pork belly (we got the thin sliced - was like bacon...yum)!! and let me just say, I love my sauces and Hae Jang Chon gives you 4 SAUCES as oppose to 2! My favorite was the bean paste and the ponzu type sauce... mhm so good! Â Next round we got more brisket (duh), marinated short ribs, and pork shoulder! Â I am not much of a marinated lover, so the bulgogi and short ribs didnt stand out to me... dont get me wrong they are good! but I'd rather dip shiz in sauces ya know? Â I LOVE THE PORK SHOULDER THOUGH. it is seriously da bombdiggity, ESPECIALLY dipped in the bean paste!!!!! so so so so so good. Â We also ordered 3 kimchi pancakes (3 is the limit...sadlyfe) during our time there and that was delish! I like to keep it on the grill for a little bit so it gets nice and crispy mmmmm. Â We only ordered 2 rounds because we didnt really want to eat until we hated ourselves and given that it was 3 girls, i think we did pretty good! Next time I DEFINITELY want to try the intestines and beef tongue forsure though! sounds good hehe Â oH Â and even though we were full we HAD to get the fried rice at the end because... i mean how can you not?? Â The fried rice has a strong seaweed flavor so if you arent a fan of seaweed you probz wont like it. Â But there is rarely anything I DONT like so you know I went ham on dat rice by myself hehehe :D again.. I like to leave the rice on the grill for a little longer so it gets crispy on the bottom. then when you scrape it off it is like HEAVEN!!!! yes i love my carbs...Other than their AWESOME meat selection, I think the reason why I love this place is because of the other shiznits they give you! the fried rice, kimchi pancakes, and awesome sauces nailed it for me and I will definitely be coming back! prolly not soon because im not tryna gain 100 lbz here but I WILL BE BACK! $22 (including tax + tip) was money well spent!"

7/21/2014,5 star rating,"Easily my favorite AYCE KBBQ place in LA!I came here around 9:00p on a Sunday night so the wait wasn't very long at all, but I often go to KyoChon in the same plaza and see a million people waiting outside here so I imagine the wait can get very long. When they seat you all the banchan is set up and the stone grills are already heating up.Dinner is $18.99 and includes a very good variety of quality meat AND SEAFOOD. I love seafood and at most KBBQ places seafood is only included in the higher combo options. I had beef brisket, bbq beef, pork belly, baby octopus, squid, shrimp and kimchi fried rice at the end. The brisket and pork belly were slice very thin which I love. The bbq beef was good. All the seafood was delicious. They also bring you kimchi pancake and steamed egg. I love both. Â The kimchi fried rice comes at the end and is so good especially when you let the rice get crispy.I'll admit a lot Asian restaurants are a little lacking in the customer service department, but the service here is excellent. The waiters are all very attentive and friendly. They cook and cut all the meat for you and refill your water and banchan as soon as they get empty. Â They clean the grill between every order of meat without you having to ask...wow. As soon as our current selection of meat was almost done, our waiter took our next order and it was out quickly.

7/16/2014,4 star rating,"Wow this place is delicious and a bit crowded but hey that's what creates great atmosphere right? What makes this place unique is that the grill is a large hot stone which gets cleaned in-between meats which makes the grill less sticky like other places. I recommend the tongue and brisket ... i'm not to big on marinated meats. Only down side is that we kept asking for the kimchee rice and they kept saying at the end of cooking the meat, but hey i wanna eat my rice with the meat not when i'm full. So unfortunately i had to skip out on the rice. Hopefully next time I'll be able to try this out."

4/18/2018,4 star rating,"This place is crazy busy! For an all u can eat meat place, ...the service is what makes this place better than most!!! Very attentive staff that is courteous and friendly. Their choice of meat cuts,marinades, & side dishes are more like a 3 star but I put another star for their service. It's not a big place so the seating list gets backed up pretty fast. They don't have a limit to the length of how long someone can sit at a table ----i would add this as a suggestion to this establishment!!! (You should get a 2 hr limit, that's my 2Â¢) They have valet parking for $2 cash for their rinky dink parking lot but we'll worth their service since parking period can be scarce! Â Once in line, Â don't leave!!! They commonly come out and take inventory of those still ""present"" & waiting and give updates on times. We waited 2 hours on a Friday night for a party of 6, that's even with them crossing off half a dozen who jumped ship to pursue other food choices."

8/6/2017,5 star rating,"I came here around noon on Saturday and waited for about 20 mins for a table of 2. This is probably one of the best ayce kbbq place I have ever tried. I liked how the waiters and waitress cooked for us, but the downside of it was that it made us feel a bit rushed. Overall, everything was delicious!"
5/12/2015,3 star rating,"it was mothers day. i understand that the rush, in and of itself, is somewhat horrible and expectations are high. considering it was lunch hour, perhaps we chose the wrong day to come, accompanied by the overwhelming bad timing as to which hour of the day we chose to drop by, which proved to be a mistake. being forced to pay two dollars for some idiot to move my car 12 feet into the parking lot seems a bit excessive and equally contrived with a scent of racketeering. the food is excellent. this is the most amazing korean bbq joint that i have been to in a long time, and trust me, i have been to most, i just don't like writing bad reviews of korean places. the line scheme seemed disorganized, the waiters leave the waiting list on a stool for anyone to come and edit it--which is what i would have done. the quality of the meat is about 80 percent. which is a B-Minus. presentation makes it better, the earthenware they use makes it seem more authentic than it is, but if you're a real korean, and not some nit-wit who falls victim to impermanent trends that are fly by night, then you will know good meat quality. the alarm should go off when the meats are over marinated, the beef should have the quality, so that even if you just used salt and pepper, the taste of the superior cut will surface beyond the smoke and grease, which we strangely crave, don't we? Â 77 dollars between three people including a healthy tip, not bad for mothers day. 21.99 per person + tea + tip."
8/29/2014,4 star rating,"I'm not a big KBBQ fan but the one time I had it, it was pretty good. Â I like the summer vegetable rice dish on the lunch menu. Â Their lunch menu is limited but my coworkers and I all agreed the food is tasty, fresh and there's lots of PURPLE RICE! I love purple rice! Purple rice and side dishes = happiness. FYI - Service is not so great here. Â I think I had to buzz a few times for water ."
5/5/2013,4 star rating,"Been there four times now. If you have a large group, make a reservation, it significantly reduces the waiting time. Otherwise, expect 1 hour to 2 hour waiting time.But once you are sit, it's really good experience. Waiter and waitress are all very nice and keep thing coming up, like the endless appetizer and meat.The meat quality is definitely good. Brisket is my favorite. It's not marinated, but with the good quality, you know, it smells awesome. Beef tongue is another must-try. My friends says the squid are marinated very good flavored, if you like that, try it. I'll pass on that though, simply can't handle the squid.Their pork belly has thin or thick sliced, which I love a lot. The thin version just doesn't taste that oily any more.The kimchi pancake is good. Don't get steamed rice, remember to get kimchi fried rice, that's awesome! After it burnt a bit on the stone pot, the crispy bottom tastes so good and I got addicted to it a bit. The appetizer's spicy dried tofu is good, and steamed egg is good too.And they will help wash the pot with raddishes fast, which makes you feel clean and organic :DAgain, food quality awesome, marinating good, service great. Just the waiting time sucks, but that's just bc this place is good. :D"
7/8/2016,5 star rating,The food was so good! Â Best Korean BBQ I'd ever had. Better than any I'd been to in NYC. The food was great and so was the service. There's always a wait so make sure you're whole party is present and be prepared to wait! It's worth it!!!
4/12/2016,5 star rating,"LOVE the AYCE bbq but I hate the price of it($26 for one person). The service is outstanding(unlike other kbbq where they unwillingly refill your side dishes) they don't ask they just do it! Plus, the food is always super good!"

Â The owners do want to get you to order, eat and get out since there is a huge line-up outside. Â The fried rice at the end was a treat even though I was stuffed, but couldn't pass it up. Â The price was super cheap and the food was tasty, just expect to be rushed out...."
10/23/2016,5 star rating,"Came in here during lunch hour for all you can eat BBQ and it was great, not much of a line. All the beef was USDA prime choice and the dipping sauces were perfect. Everything was delicious and it was only 21 a person. They have beef brisket and all other sorts of cuts of meats. The staff was really friendly and brought everything out when told to and the place is very clean. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner or lunch, they do have other menus besides Korean BBQ."
10/16/2013,4 star rating,"This place is very busy and the wait even on a weekday is around 30-40mins. Â Service was really good and the food was great. I'm fond of all their meat except for hot dog. Maybe I was expecting something different.... considering how good the other meat was. It was just a plain hot dog... Lol sides are delicious but not many though.... the grill is amazing. ....i was so fascinated How they clean the grill so fast in front of us. this place is very good but it's not one of those ""I need to go to"" places I would crave."
12/12/2016,1 star rating,"I never experience this bad service ever in my life. We reserve a 5 people table, but one of our friends come late, they won't allow us to sit. We come in when everybody is here but they said we need to make another reservation. There are so many open tables and they don't allow us to sit. I swear I won't go to this restaurant in my life."
8/24/2014,4 star rating,"After 2 hours of workout, my coworker brought me to try this AYCE KBBQ. He always talk about how good their brisket and marinated squid compare to other restaurants. He was not lying. It was shockingly delicious. And with a beer to go with it mmmm lala.For a party of two, it only took 10 minutes to wait in line. But like as many other AYCE KBBQ it takes a while for big groups to be seated.Great quality meat and good service."
5/30/2013,1 star rating,"I usually go to Moo Dae Po II for AYCE BBQ and had it there for my bday dinner so for my bday this year, I wanted to try something different. Â MISTAKE #1. Â MISTAKE #2: CHOOSING this restaurant. Â This place is good for groups of 5-6 people. Â Not more. Â Their biggest table seats 6-7 people. Â When I made the reservation for 20 people, I admit the person explained the following:1. your party will be separated2. you will probably have to wait 30 min because of #13. seating will be difficult because of #2 due to #1I was thinking, okay that's not a big deal. Â This restaurant had such high reviews on yelp and people are always running late anyways, so why not. Â I got there at 6:25 PM (my reservation was at 6:30 PM). Â Went to go check in, and what do they tell me? Â That my whole party has to be there before they can seat me. Â Okay, that would have been an important piece of information. Â At the time, I only had about 15 people, which was communicated to the hostess. Â GREAT. Â So, by the time the rest of my party was here, it was about 6:45-6:50 PM. Â We went up to the hostess about my reservation, and she asked ""how many people?"" I responded 21 since there was a straggler. Â Then about 10-15 min pass by. Â Other people are being seated and I am getting super annoyed. Â The hostess asked my boyfriend, how many people, he responded 21 people. Â Another 10-15 minutes pass by. Â Other groups are being seated. Â Now, I am super upset. Â I have been there waiting an hour. Â I asked my friend to go talk to the hostess because I am too heated. Â And what does the hostess respond with? Â She claims that she was waiting FOR THE REST OF MY PARTY TO GET HERE!! And she stated that we told her there were 15 people here so far. Â I stated that we told her that over half an hour ago! You asked how many people were here and we said 21!. Â She kept saying you said 15. Â GRRR. I left the restaurant because I did not want to yell at the hostess. Â Then, she comes outside a minute later and said the same thing to me ""you said you had 15 people"" Â So apparently, I am a liar, the two other people in my party she spoke to are liars, and she is the sharpest tool in the shed. Â SHE IS INCOMPETENT. Â PERIOD. Â The warnings the restaurant gave me with the reservation of 20 people were not an issue apparently. Â They should have warned me about the DUMB HOSTESS instead.Then, we sit to eat. Â The beef is low quality. Â The only thing good about that place was the BBQ squid. Â I barely ate anything. Â My bf enjoyed the kimchi fried rice, but I thought it was just okay. Â $17.99 for AYCE but I barely ate. Â I am going to pay a few bucks more and eat like a pig at Moo Dae Po II and actually enjoy my food and my company. Â Moo Dae Po also has better service and competent employees. Why this restaurant has 4 stars boggles my mind."
11/28/2013,4 star rating,"IMO all korean BBQ places are almost all the same. You have brisket, pork belly, bulgogi, etc. this place was actually kind of unique. They had octopus, squid and different types of traditional korean BBQ meats, with your choice of marinated or not marinated. It does get a little crowded, but it's one of the few BBQ spots that stay open till 2am. Reasonable pricing, a little bit stuffy inside but good ambience. Would definitely come back."
8/21/2016,3 star rating,"Let me tell you.....we waited for about 7 mins and then we walked into the restaurant blasting different types of music, people moving up and down the place, its all very hectic really. We had a nice waitress I could tell she was having a bad night. Homegirl rushed us to eat, told us they were closing soon and brought the bill so quick but no one helped us out once she left to her break! That is NOT good customer service like WE WAS LEGIT GONNA TIP our waitress good but no one bothered to pick up our bill until my friend literally stood up for 10 mins with the bill in his hand...If you gonna rush me at least have the decency to be there to pick up your money. I'm not mad at the waitress but more at the fact that you guys rush people out even after they spend 90 dollars here. What type of place does that...Vegans can go here and be hella full.I'm vegan and I ended up here last night because my friends suggested it and I'm a team player. haha. but I was surprised with all the side dishes and got full w rice, salad, fish sticks, bean sprouts, etc, I ordered the veggie bibimbap and it was good but I felt they added too much soy sauce so I just added a bunch of spicy chili sauce to mask it and it didn't work. All the side dishes were enough to get me full but dang that customer service tho...lol"

7/16/2013,2 star rating,"First and LAST time going there. I get why the long lines. College kids need to eat cheap. The kimchi rice was nothing to write home about. Seriously? Why all the great reviews over the kimchi rice? I should really open my review with THE SERVICE SUCKS. People need to open their eyes and realize that restaurant experiences should include the service. I am a firm believer of ""you get what you pay for."" And in this case, this AYCE is cheaper than most others, but the service is probably the reason. Maybe the servers are just unhappy with their wages. Something. I need to come up with some reason why they allow such poor service? NOT WORTH THE ALMOST 2-HOUR WAIT FOR A TABLE FOR 3."
8/19/2016,5 star rating,"Never disappointing. At this point it's probably verging on an institution, or I'm being stupid and it obviously already is one. There's a wait on most nights, you cannot ignore that kind of business consistency no matter the time of year. It's one of the safest bets for an exciting night of LA eating and drinking of which I could think. As Koreatown continues to boom or begins to contract on restaurant and nightlife expansion (or LA in general for that matter), this spot will remain a stalwart of the scene."
8/16/2018,5 star rating,"Yum! We came at 3:30 on a Wednesday and there were still lots of people inside and a steady stream of people coming in. Staff was super friendly! The meat we had was so good. I think the marinated short rib was my favorite. But pork belly, bulgolgi, brisket, and beef tongue were all good as well. Parking was valet for $2 in the lot. Overall I would definitely come back when we are in town!"
7/19/2017,2 star rating,extent service but food quality is not good.
10/13/2016,4 star rating,It was a Hot Hot Sunday night so we all decided on AYCE korean bbq for dinner. The wait was long but fortunately for us we got bumped up because the party before us left. It was totally worth it! Best korean bbq i've ever eaten in my life and I most definitely will be coming back with everyone. Our party decided to grab drinks at the bar two doors down that served super strong delicious watermelon soju. 4 stars for the long wait
8/31/2015,4 star rating,"I know AYCE is terrible because it's a waste of food and gluttony to the max. However, it's just so darn delicious!First off, I highly recommend you make a reservation because this place had a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night. Luckily, I made a reservation a week in advance and we were seated right away. First thing you notice coming in is that this place is relatively small. Second thing you will notice is that there are no grills, instead you get to cook your meat on giant stone pots. Something that all Korean BBQ place have is banchan aka side dishes. The side dishes here are solid but nothing phenomenal. Onto the meat, so for $22 per person, you get the usual brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, pork shoulder, beef tongue, octopus, and more. However, the meat here is just decent, I've had better at other AYCE places. The only thing I thought was exceptional was the pork belly. Furthermore, at the end of your meal, they will make you kim chi fried rice. Unfortunately, the kim chi rice was more hype than anything. It didn't really taste like anything.Overall, this place is top notch and the stone pots are amazing. No smoke and no char on your meat. Plus, no splatter from the excess oils or fat. If you're in the area and crave AYCE kbbq, I definitely recommend this place!"
6/24/2014,3 star rating,Nice all you can eat BBQ Korean restaurant. Â  The meats are ok. .. maybe a little to much fat on some. Â  Service a little slow when busy. ... parking is okay Â cause they have valet ($2). Â Food price will cost about $20 per person almost. Â  Nice place to have dinner and drinks with friends.
12/2/2016,5 star rating,"Great food, beautiful little place, cheap $2 valet parking, great service, got there on Friday around 6:00 pm and didn't have to wait for our table. 100% recommended, definitely will come back!"
12/2/2016,5 star rating,This is by far my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ! Excellent Meat Quality and Prompt Service! Just be prepared to wait a bit. The wait is worth it!
9/15/2015,5 star rating,"This place is the best KBBQ AYCE I have found as of yet. The meat is pretty good quality for how much they seem to be dishing out every night. The wait can be an hour or more if it's busy so I am occasionally tempted to just go get wings at Kyochon, but if you are really hungry then persevere because it's amazing. I recommend the short ribs and tongue, and don't fill up on banchan or kimchee pancake, as tempting as it is."
2/4/2017,4 star rating,"I'm a regular here, and my recent trip inspired me to join Yelp and write a review. Â The meat quality is usually good here - as with all K-BBQ you have good days and bad, but I'm rarely disappointed at this joint. Also the service is quick and the grill changes are frequent. Definitely recommend to try this place at least once...as long as you don't mind a really busy atmosphere!"
4/25/2010,4 star rating,"I wish i could give it 3.5 stars instead, but i guess i ll round up.the meat selection is good. the one thing i am still kinda shocked is that they have hot dogs in the menu. they put 'sausage' in korean so i though, hmm maybe it's home made or something special. but to our surprise they were like ballpark sausages you get from the market. could be oscar mayers, ballparks, or any other sausage maker.the 'unique' thing bout this place is that they use a stone grill to cook meat. personally, i like the charcoal taste above everything else. with the stone grill, i guess it's healthier (?). there isn't much or any charring, more even cooking i guess.the service is pretty good for an all you can eat. most of the staff speaks english too so that's cool. parking lot is small, but valet park for $2. same as any where in ktown.meats:-tongue, samgyopsal, squid, marinated ribs were great. the tongue and the ribs were the better ones.-beef bulgogi and the pork shoulder weren't that great. the bulgogi didn't seem fresh or marinated enough. the pork shoulder, maybe that's how shoulders are, but not that much fat, so it was a little hard or chewy (they were frozen before since some pieces were a bit hard)they also give you two kind of wrappers, the rice cake and the radish wrapper. the side dishes were ok also.i would recommend the place just because of the location, since from here you can walk to other bars that are nearby on 6th."
8/7/2016,5 star rating,"Ughhhh my favorite place to eat, I have a weakness for this place, I drive 1 hour to get there, then I wait 2 hours to get a table but is sooooo worth it. When people ask what's my favorite restaurant, I say hae jang chon! I just wish they would open a second location ten times bigger"
5/27/2013,2 star rating,"This place wins for the fastest quality decline I've ever seen. Â First time I came here a few years back, it was amaze balls...and the last 3 times I came here (because of the mere reason that they were open late) it's been GARBAGE. Â The kalbi tasted like cheek meat...I don't even want to know what they marinate the ""marinated"" kalbi in to hide the bad quality of the meat. Â KEEPING AWAY from now on.btw...if you look in a Korean restaurant and there are barely any Korean/Asian people eating...it probably sucks."
7/12/2018,5 star rating,"Very good for all you can eat. For quality over quantity I would go elsewhere, but as fast as AYCE Korean BBQ goes, this is by far the best I've been to in the US."
1/21/2014,2 star rating,I feel like I am judging this place a little harshly. Â But after trying out so many Korean BBQ's in Cali this was one of my least favorites. Â I did not like that the brisket came out frozen and didn't taste so fresh to me as other places that I had tried in San Diego (Surprise surprise!) The meat was not bad but it was not the best quality meat I have had as other places. Â I did love their bahn chan (side dishes) though and it is the only korean ayce where I was served kimchi pancakes which I LOVED! Â All in all the food was not bad and at 18.99 the price was ok. Â But with so many other choices and places to choose from I probably will not be back the next time I come to Cali.
1/4/2016,4 star rating,"This was my second time on this place and it was as amazing as the first time. The service was great and attentive. They make sure that your grill and ban chan is never empty. My favorite was the beef tounge, short ribs, and octopus. My favorite is the stone grill, because it cooks the meat evenly and makes it tender. Also, they clean it out with radish right away.The kimchi pancake was alright. Very starchy/floury and less kimchi flavor."
12/11/2013,4 star rating,"BBQ on clay slabs instead of metal. Â The best when it comes to side dishes. Â Definitely a great place to go to eat but beware, when night time comes, good luck getting a seat if ya'll didn't reserve one. Â Prepare for long lines, but at day times it's easy to get a table.One thing I do miss with a metal bbq is that I could burn some of the meat. Â Toasty meat."

12/27/2013,4 star rating,"This place is pretty good and alright. Now coming from SF, where Korean AYCE this is way better than some of the places in SF. I didn't eat the entire day because I was sleeping all day and this place was the first meal I ate when I woke up LOL. Korean BBQ senses was tingling in my dreams I guess, no my last night I really wanted somedecent Korean BBQ before I left. Hungry and a bit tipsy I went straight to my phone to find BBQ place. First one on my mind for a while was Kang Hodong place but then that ended up not working out due to long waits. But this was a back up replacement. And it end up being worth it, I came here once before and I came back ahaha. They gave a perfect amount of banchan, I wish there were more variety, but I ended up thinking they wanted us to eat more meat, as a sign of caring about our health, PROTEIN YEAHHH! The meat was pretty good, the perfect quantity, a lot of extra sides like kimchi pajun and jigae and kimchi fried rice. So this place overall is awesome! Comming back again ahaha."
9/27/2016,2 star rating,Came here for my nephew and brother bday..that quality of the meat her is not great..I guess cause it's all u can eat type of restaurant. And the side dishes was limited not much of it. Their salad is plain.Would not come back. After the meal I was not satisfied.
7/31/2014,4 star rating,"Very reasonably priced AYCE KBBQ.Four of us went for lunch on a Saturday. We went shortly after 12 noon & managed to get seated without more than a few minutes wait. Â They only take reservations for groups of 8+ on the weekends. Â We also managed to find parking nearby; parking was a little tight though.We tried a mix of the different meats available. The pork belly, BBQ pork & the brisket were my favorite. Â I liked that there was some seafood included. The had a pretty good banchan selection for an AYCE place. The servers helped cook the meat & let us know when the meat was ready/cooked. Â They also made a kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal. The Hite beer was a good complement on such a warm day,"
5/3/2015,4 star rating,"Probably one of my favorite AYCE kbbq places! THEY HAVE THE BEST ""BRISKET"" EVERRRR! The thin pork belly was also great! I would come on their down time or none lunch/dinner rush times, you will be stuck with a hefty wait time! I would call before you decided to come, just in case. I like that they use the stone grill, instead of the standard grill with extra carcinogens added to your meat lol. I really like their sour brown daikon dipping sauce, it makes the meat taste more refreshing I guess? Less oily! You might want to order early for your next round of meat, since it takes them awhile to get to it, so be patient! The kimchi pancake and friend rice is also a delicious bonus! Don't forget to have cash for the valet!"
7/29/2014,4 star rating,"Came here for a friend's bday celebration. Group of 6. We got seated to the side, which was bad because the wall helped trap the heat from the grill. Not a deal-breaker though.Rather than the usual open fire, flat grill you're used to in most Korean BBQ places, this place uses closed cast-iron skillets that have a notch cut on the side to drain the yummy meat juices as they render from the cooking meat. Apparently they use the juices to prepare a fried rice towards the end of the meal, but we all opted for white rice instead, so no fried rice for us.The meat quality was pretty good. Even tricked my GF and her cousin to try the beef tongue and they enjoyed it.The service was average. Parking is not the best around this area, but the plaza they are in does have valet parking. It seemed a bit unnecessary on a Sunday afternoon, but $2 isn't bad.Will try again. Hopefully we'll get better seating next time and give that fried rice a go :)"
3/12/2016,5 star rating,"This place was actually fantastic. You must go here. If you do not, I will find you, and I will take you there. Make sure to Don the close toed shoes, leave the flip-flops at home, comb your hair, and make a reservation for crying out loud because it got pretty busy. Also, the valet parking is a rip off. Ignore them park your own car and don't pay. If they tell you to pay, tell them to mind their Ps and Qs."

10/18/2015,1 star rating,This place is absolutely horrible; which is really a shame considering it was once really good back in 2008. Well its all gone to shit now. This is really for tourists and non-Koreans. The meat sucks. Eat at your own peril!
1/26/2014,2 star rating,"okay this place is just horrible. there was a time when it was great, really great! that was before way before they were on yelp and a horde of foreigners came in. its really sad but when you start seeing more americans coming into a korean restaurant the quality just goes down. let's face it americans don't know good korean from bad korean. the meat comes out frozen and it has this texture and after taste as if its been in the freezer for a very long time. the quality for the side dishes have also gone down hill. its side but none of them are as fresh as it used to be. the only thing that has remained consistent is the post bbq fried rice. i have nothing to say about that."
11/14/2014,4 star rating,"Definitely plan where you're going to park because I had to park a couple blocks down!! Â Anyway, this place is pretty good for kbbq! Â It was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect.When we got a table, I was so surprised and amazed that they already had the banchans set. Â They were pretty good, but the kimchi. Â Not my type of taste, it was more vinegar-y than spicy so I didn't even touch it the rest of the night. Â I loved the potato one though despite it having some random apple slices in there, it made it very sweet. Â The quality of the meat is amazing!! The pork belly is to DIE FOR and that's usually my favorite for kbbq. Â I forgot which order it was, but one of the spicy meats was overpowered by it's marinade that you can barely taste the meat. Â The seafood isn't too bad either, I particularly liked the octopus.I didn't even know you get the kimchi fried rice at the end.. Guess my table lucked out!!! Â I guess that's okay but boo. Â It was about 25 per person, which I think is fine for the quality of the meat and service. Â I would come back here again if I wanted expensive kbbq."
9/29/2018,1 star rating,Service is HORRIBLE. They speak Korean. However when we want to speak Korean they just talk English. Stop being stupid.
12/8/2015,4 star rating,"This place is really good for your AYCE kbbq. It wasn't amazing, but for $22, you get some nice selections and everything is of pretty good quality. We mainly stuck to the brisket, kalbi and shrimp. All very good. If you want garlic and peppers, you have to ask them. Lettuce wraps is an extra $5, but they give you a salad which you can use to eat the cuts of meat. The soup was a bit undercooked and flavorless so I had to ask them to heat it longer which they did. The service was efficient and they come around constantly. I mean these guys are moving around constantly. We were in a corner and we never had to look around to call anyone. They cleaned the cool stone grill 2 times while we were there too."
7/20/2014,4 star rating,We waited for 1 hour 30 mins to be seated (party of 4 and 1 toddler) I guess worth the wait. They are very generous. Whenever they saw our glass of water they automatically refill it. THEY WON'T LET YOU COOK THE MEAT. They are the one who will cook for you. And they freaking amazing!Less one star for the restroom. Hoping for a renovation. Will come back soon.
9/13/2014,5 star rating,"My favorite kbbq spot!Atmosphere is awesome. Some times you will have to wait over 30 minutes to get a table. They don't take reservations or let you call your name in. Just be ready to commit to a wait, for great food and you won't leave hungry. The all you can eat is my favorite AYCE in all of LA. Don't forget to get some squid."
7/5/2013,4 star rating,"Honestly, this is my favorite AYCE KBBQ joint. The flavor of the grilled from the stone grill is just too good. It's way different than those over fire. The meat selection is great (although it's not the best or most interesting, that goes to Road to Seoul). The wait is usually about an hour or less.I'm often way too full from the meat to try their kimchi fried rice.Recently I've seen way more fat content vs. meat on their brisket slices and that's kind of disappointing. Their kimchi pancake could be crispier, but that's just me. Oh yeah their way of cleaning the stone grill is a treat the first time."
4/10/2016,5 star rating,"It ended up being about $26 per person for the all you can eat lunch on a sunday after tax. Totally worth it. The squid is the best. I also suggest the pork belly, beef tongue, and spicy pork. Great sides, great service!!"
4/10/2016,5 star rating,I honestly can't say enough good things about this place.... The table is filled with all the sides you'll need for your BBQ adventure lol The kimchi and the kimchi pancake were both delicious! We got several types of meat which were all very tender. The bean paste.... oh the bean paste... I could literally eat that stuff on ANYTHING! You most definitely have to make your reservation wayyyyyy in advance because there's always at least a 2 hour wait. It's so worth the wait though!
2/27/2014,3 star rating,"Not too impressed.Yes, it is AYCE and cheap at $19 ppl. The quality of meat was okay, nothing to write home about. I like the option of kimchi fried rice and soy bean stew in addition to the meat, except they were kinda sloppy with the flavor. Service was definitely lacking."
5/22/2016,4 star rating,"One of the best kbbq places I've ever gone to! Every time I come, there is at least an hour wait but definitely worth it. It is all you can eat and there are lots of varieties to choose from. My favorite dish here is the spicy pork belly! It's soft enough, has nice smoky flavor and is really saucy! Just the way I like it. The other meats are good as well but uncomfortable to the spicy pork. I love coming here also because of all the sides, the kimchi fried rice and pancake that is also part of the all you can eat menu. The food is fantastic but there were times where I feel like we were rushed to finish our meal. The woman at the restaurant would come around and cook tons of meat for us but we actually wanted to do it ourselves. Felt like she just wanted us to finish and leave so that the next party could come in. Overall, this place is still great and is a must-go everytime I come to LA!"
12/3/2013,4 star rating,"Pros:- so many options! $20 for 20 choices. You can barely finish it!- pork belly comes in thin and thick slices.- meat is definitely tasty. super tender and well-seasoned.- lots of dipping sauces!- the place looks great!- banchan includes steamed egg, kimchi soup, kimchi pancake (!)- they have rice wraps and - AWESOME KIMCHI RICE. Let it dry so it gets crisp on the bottom!Cons:- banchan is limited (tasty, but limited.)- extra $5 fee for lettuce and mint wrap. There will be a salad, but it's not the same thing.- I wish there was dessert! like a cube of watermelon or something.Overall, value for money and it tastes very good! Only giving it a four star because of the $5 lettuce wrap charge and the lack of a little dessert.. Lettuce isn't that expensive..."
7/13/2014,5 star rating,"Went on a Friday at 630pm and they seated us (party of 2) immediately. We saw some people waiting but I think it was because they had a larger party and were for their complete party to arrive before getting seated.$2 valet out front- quick service. Some street parking but it looked full. Two parts to the restaurant, left side is AYCE. Food: Â had galbi, beef brisket, squid, thin and thick pork belly- all delicious!!! They had 4 different sauces and enough side dishes so our bellies were very happy with the tasty selection. They helped you cook and were very attentive in cooking the meats and moving them aside when done, refilling our drinks, and asking what else we needed. We did not feel rushed at all and they were so nice! Â Would definitely recommend coming here for AYCE Korean BBQ- it was also only $18.99 per person.5/5"
2/27/2013,3 star rating,"$17.99 lunch and dinner!I was sad to find that there was no discount for the lunch menu. Most Korean places have a better price during the day especially on a weekday!The service was poor. There was only one server working at 11:45 AM when we got there. Odd, that there was only one person working during lunch. With limited servers, you can only imagine what could have gone wrong. It wasn't too bad, he just forgot extra tongs. Within 30 minutes, two more servers started their shift so things went a little smoother from there on.The meats are pretty good quality and you aren't too limited to what you can get since it's $17.99 flat rate and not the hierarchical all-you-can-eat menus at other places where the cheaper the price the cheaper quality your meats are.My favorites of the day were:- beef tongue (ask for lemon juice; it gives the flavor a nice kick and it comes in a convenient little bottle)- beef brisket (usually the cheapest meat and toughest to chew, but it wasn't as bad as expected)- bulgogi (wonderfully marinated)I would skip on eating the kimchi, it tasted pretty awful. I've had jarred kimchi that have tasted better.Overall, I wouldn't go back since there are other cheaper restaurants in the area and there was nothing extravagant or special at this place. It just happened to be conveniently located near a salon I visited."
7/11/2016,5 star rating,"This isn't the typical Korean BBQ place you go to; where the waiter takes your order and put it on your table, then you have to cook it yourself. They'll also cook it for you. This isn't the place for you, if you like to cook it yourself. It's 23 a head, but it'll be worth it because it's delicious. Waiters are very attentive to service you, despite having multiple tables. I suggest ordering the beef brisket at the beginning and end of your meal. You'll get a bowl of kimchee fried rice at the end of your meal. Tell them to mix the brisket with your fried rice. You won't regret having that."
9/5/2013,5 star rating,"HJC deserves a 5-star rating because they have excellent, friendly and attentive service when I was there; it is open til 2AM most, if not all of the time; and the selection for the price range ($19-22 per person for AYCE) was fantastic. I usually go to Oo-Kook but this place, if it's not too crowded, is my other go-to spot. Plus, I love the Kimchi Fried Rice at the end."
5/1/2013,4 star rating,"Brought my 4 coworkers (non-Korean friends), 2 of which never had KBBQ before. We really enjoyed our experience as we came just before 6pm. Prompt service and we were happy with our food. We had the brisket, bulgogi, and joomooluk (unmarinated galbi). Unfortunately ran out of space for samgyupsal!!! Will return for pork since that's what they're known for. My friends loved the kimchii pancake (buchinggeh). The denjang jjigeh (soy bean paste stew) and gehran ggim (egg souffle) were lackluster.Overall, an affordable price for the variety of meat, banchan, and extras. Will come back but at an early time before the dinner rush."
10/27/2016,5 star rating,Fire! The beef brisket is too clutch. Fast service.. Would it hurt to add a larger variety of drinks though?
5/18/2014,5 star rating,"I came in with a bunch of my friends at around 1 am. We're a rowdy group and it's understandable that we might not have gotten the best of services. However, this place has excellent timing and service. The waiters and waitresses basically cooked the food for you and the sides were filled in a timely manner. The meat selection was on par with their service. For 20 bucks a meal you better get good meats. By far one of the better Korean BBQ places I have been to. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the Korean area of LA."

4/3/2016,4 star rating,"We decided to come into this place after seeing it on a ""50 Places to visit in California"" article. We valet parked because we couldn't get parking outside it was way to packed. We were seated fairly quickly as we were told people sometimes wait hours in line but it could have been because we for there around 4pm. It's an all you can eat Korean bbq spot so they give your table the option of picking 3 meats at a time... I have to say our server was amazing! I'd definitely give him 5 starts if I could, he explained how the ordering worked and all about the specials. He was really attentive and very nice! The food itself is alright I wouldn't consider it the best Korean bbq in California but it was good... You have the option of getting white rice as you eat or wait until the end for the fried rice which was not my favorite. It had too much sea weed and the taste just wasn't too good but overall I chose to give it Â 4 stars because you get your money's worth..."
5/17/2016,1 star rating,Rude. Â Didn't want us to eat here and we got here a few mins after 1. Why say your open till 2 when you turn away people at 1.
5/16/2016,4 star rating,"Pretty darn good for the uninitiated. Â Had several meats, soup, salad and many sides. Â Everything was fresh and tasty. Â I wish the shrimp was deveined, but for $27 for lunch(with tip) whose gonna complain?"
9/28/2013,5 star rating,"my friends and I needed a to eat after a concert in Greek Theatre so we found this AYCE that opened until 2. Service was definitely fast, but i guess it was late night and they want to crank out all the meat and sides asap. Service was attentive and everything was prepared within minutes of our arrival at the restaurant. I also liked the fact that there is a stand for you(the person who does the cooking AKA me) to put the tongs, meat, salad so you get extra space to put the uncooked stuff. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu but what had me going was the bugolgi and short ribs, it was pretty good. I was also surprised about the kimchi pancake which I don't see often at other AYCE places.Now here is the sad part of the night though, it was my friends birthday and we brought in a cake, but somehow the hostess misplaced the cake and it was no where to be found. I wasn't furious but a little disappointed, so i shrugged it off. What surprised me was that a waiter reimbursed the money i paid for the cake. I am honestly surprised and very grateful for his act. Hence the 5 star, even though the cake was gone. I mean it was 2AM and the restaurant was closing so I understand since i also was a server. We laughed about it but normally you don't experience this often.Oh and also, good luck finding parking if you are too stingy to pay for valet parking, GGWP"
9/2/2016,1 star rating,Here's the thing. I know that the food here is good. I know because I've eaten here multiple times but today I made a reservation for 8 people at 8:30. I have my name and my number. According to my iPhone it took 3 minutes to do this. Â But they lost my reservation and then made no attempts to rectify their mistake. Customer service has to count for something. I like Hae Jang but won't be coming here anymore. You can't screw a loyal customer base.
5/15/2016,4 star rating,"The crowd starts coming in after 11 pm because most all you can eat KBBQ places close by 12. The wait time wasn't so bad when we got seated. The service was quick and the food was very tasty. The servers would come by your table and cut up and make your meat for you. The price is ok, something you'd find at most kbbq places. Most definitely would come back."
2/19/2016,5 star rating,"All you can eat bbq place and the quality of food is great! The servers are super efficient and attentive. The only downside to this place is the long wait (sometimes upto even 2 hours) you have to endure on Fri and Sat nights, but that is typical of a good eating joint in Koreatown."
1/8/2014,4 star rating,"I get really excited about new food adventures, being that I'm from the Central Valley and the food choices here are blah. Â So when I found out that we were going to catch a Clippers game in LA, I knew I had to see what the hype was all about with Korean BBQ All-you-can-eat. Â I've tried Shabu house in San Francisco (Japanese fondue/steam pot), Brazilian all-you-can-eat where they come out and bring the food to you, and other AYCE buffets around the Bay Area and Vegas.... this place definitely ranks up pretty high on my list. Â The food tastes good, reasonable pricing, and all the portions they brought out were huge, except for the shrimp. I dined with a group of 6 friends so it was a surprise to us that after all the big servings of beef, when the shrimp came out, we only got 6-8 pieces of shrimp. Â We were thinking like, ""wth? lol"" But other than that little mishap, everything else was gravy. I'm definitely coming back on my next visit to LA."
4/4/2015,5 star rating,Here is where to find a wonderful Korean bbq in different level. I came here with my GF we honestly never expect to have the bbq on the big wide stone plate instead of the usual grill. First I doubt myself if its going be really good but couple things that I admire.1. Â  Â  Â  They manage to keep the restaurant clean and good effort to keep A from the health dept2. Â  Â  Â  The quality of meat is good and worth what you pay.3. Â  Â  Â  Delicious kimchi.4. Â  Â  Â  There are good banchan and there is a delicious banchan (you people should know what I mean LOL).The parking was little bit hassle especially towards dinner time and the funny thing about it that the valet was in front of rest which right in the middle of plaza BUT they claim all the parking space EXCEPT if you are faceshop customer. I would feel want to come back the second time in case Road to Seoul is packed. We showed up around 2 PM and we put it on bookmark on yelp for the last couple months. I didn't realize they don't have a lunch special which is fine with me. Food is amazing and we kept ordering and ordering the meat until I could not handle it anymore and we call for the check. The service is not the best but better than other Korean bbq. They also have a good salad bowl with less dressing that perfect since the dressing often make you full faster and honestly its HEALTHY. The meat selections were authentically fresh and for $20 per person for lunch or dinner is a fair price better than Gen Korean BBQ. You hear that Gen yes YOU!! LOLWe will be back after my love come back from OHIO!!!!!!!!!!
2/16/2014,3 star rating,"So in my personal experience, the service was not very good. We waited FOREVER, and for some reason the waitress skipped us when seating.But when it comes down to the food, this place is pretty delicious, one of the best kbbq places in LA. Their squid is super good. I really liked their brisket too. I would definitely come back again, I just wish the service wasn't shitty."
11/29/2016,5 star rating,Top notch Korean BBQ. Amazing customer service and the food was amazing. The servers even encouraged you to get more meat and were very attentive. Pretty pricey for most Koean BBQ places $21.99 but well worth it. Keep up the good work. Anyone interested in trying Korean BBQ please look no further and come here. Thank You!
8/29/2014,2 star rating,"Hae jang chon is really crowded and busy place. It became popular that i see  many people waiting to eat. However, the quality of ""all you can eat"" meat is very poor. Â Not worth money i would rather go order regular korean bbq in other store at same price"
9/15/2014,4 star rating,"First time trying Korean BBQ in Los Angeles, have done it before in Tokyo and loved it. Tried this place out tonight by choice of some friends. Thought it was great since it's all you can eat! It may be a bit expensive but you are eating good quality meats and seafood so it is definitely worth it. The best meats that we had were beef bulgogi, BBQ pork (spicy and soooo good ) and the shrimp. I liked that the grill was a stone one, that was interesting and a new experience for me. Made the meat taste good and crisp. Also, enjoyed a nice refreshing chopped romaine salad with a light dressing before chowing down on pounds of meats. The only down fall to this place is it's hot as balls in there. Def need more ventilation and AC flow happening. Otherwise, a fantastic experience and really tasty food. Looking forward to coming back here !!!!"
9/14/2014,4 star rating,"My favorite thing about this place was definitely the service. The waiters were always coming around asking if you need anything, they cut up your meat for you, and are quick to clean the stove. I've been to cheaper kbbq places but the service isn't comparable to this place.The meat quality was really good also, and they serve korean pancakes free here unlike the cheaper places (even though I'm not really a fan haha). And the grills were the much nicer stone ones, not the replaceable ones at most places.My main complaint is how expensive it was... Maybe it's just me being a broke college kid but $25 per person was wayyyy too much when you can find it for $12 elsewhere! I'd honestly rather pay half as much and get less service than double the price."
9/14/2014,5 star rating,"Hands down my favorite AYCE kbbq joint! It's on the pricier end of AYCE bbq restaurants I've been to ($21.99 per person), but well worth it! Their banchan is super tasty, meat is fresh (brisket, marinated short rib, and thin pork belly are delish!), and they give you bombbbb kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal! One thing that definitely sets this place apart from other kbbq places is their service, which is amazing. The waiters are constantly refilling dishes and always ask if you want anything else. If you're looking for a great ayce kbbq place, definitely come here! Although the wait can be long (expect 40min+), you'll be extremely satisfied with your meal by the end of it all. One more thing, parking is easy! Just valet in the lot for $2 and you're gold."
9/13/2014,5 star rating,"My favorite kbbq spot!Atmosphere is awesome. Some times you will have to wait over 30 minutes to get a table. They don't take reservations or let you call your name in.

9/12/2014,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time now and finally had to chance on Labor Day weekend. It's AYCE place. Â We just got their before the lunch time rush. Â The food and service was great. Â I liked that they used a stone grill instead of the usually grill plates that other KBBQ places use which needs to be changed out often. Â The selection of side dishes that they provide are all tasty. Â Especially the kim chi. Â It's in a busy plaza in Ktown, but they have valet parking available for only $2. Â The squid, marinated short ribs, and kim chi fried rice was our top items, but all other items we ordered were tasty as well. Â They open late too so that you can get your KBBQ fix before heading home for the night."
9/10/2014,4 star rating,"Great Korean BBQ place. Â The restaurant is well lit and spaced out enough that you don't overheat as at some Korean BBQ places. Â Good selection of meats with enough variety to get something different each time if you choose. Â Service was pretty good, which can sometimes be a downfall at some KBBQ places. Â Also, appreciated the fact that we were able to make a reservation so long as our party was more than six people. Â All the meats were tasty. Â The salad had a great dressing on it and the waitress frequently came back to check if we needed anymore. Â On top of that, it felt like the meat cooked a bit quicker than at some other locations. Â Only complaint was the parking, which forces you to valet, but oh well. Â At $18.99, it is not the cheapest place out there but is definitely reasonable within the AYCE KBBQ realm, especially given the selection of mets."

9/5/2014,3 star rating,"I haven't had the best of luck with Korean BBQ lately. My previous go-to spots for KBBQ have all but gone to the dogs (Moon Dae Po, Furusato, etc.) and I've been praying to the stars for some grill-it-yourself salvation to come knocking on my door. Hae Jang Chon answered the call - to an extent.I visited this spot with some friends not too long ago, and was pleasantly surprised at how HJC edged out its competitors in terms of the variety of its offerings, the quality of service, and the overall cleanliness of its dining environment (by KBBQ standards, of course). Even on a Monday night, the dinnertime wait time at HJC was pretty brutal for our group of four; after being told that we wouldn't be seated until approximately 45 minutes or so, we decided to go grab a drink at nearby Beer Belly. Thankfully, HJC is in a pretty lively part of town, so you shouldn't have much trouble finding a place to stroll to wander over to and kill some time at - just make sure that your group makes it back before your party's name is called!After being seated at HJC, I immediately noticed how the aesthetics and overall setup seemed to be a couple steps ahead of the competition. In place of the metal grill devices used at other KKBQ establishments, Hae Jang Chon uses large, round stone grills - which accommodated more items than what I was used to. Also refreshing to note is that the servers at this particular spot will ACTUALLY take the effort to switch your party's grill out - often without being asked to do so. Unlike other reviewers, I found the cleanliness of the establishment to be relatively on-point (again, in comparison to other KBBQ spots). Plus, the overall setup didn't have me feeling that sense of slight claustrophobia that I sometimes get from at other Korean BBQ restaurants. Between our group, we ordered a variety of meats from the eighteen or so available options on the AYCE menu; I remember sticking primarily with the brisket, chicken, and pork belly options. The brisket was decent - it wasn't as fatty as I would have hoped - thus detracting from both its meaty flavor and its overall texture when cooked. The pork belly and chicken were pretty standard, as well - nothing to really write home about. I suppose the increased price was more of a result of the range of options made available for order; the quality of the meat was altogether underwhelming. This being said, the flavor at KBBQ places - in my opinion - comes less from the meats themselves and more from your ability to pair them with the onslaught of side dishes that are sent to your table; thankfully, HJC provides diners with four different sauces/oils to dip their grilled goodies in. Unfortunately, only two of these sauces really appealed to me - the two that I enjoyed were the more standard sweet dark sauce (not sure of its name) and the combination of salt and sesame oil. Â Now, I'm not the biggest fan of kimchi, but I couldn't get enough of the Kimchi Pancake at Hae Jang Chon. It had a crisp and crunchy exterior along with a tender and fluffy inside. The sharp, somewhat sour flavor of kimchi was very much mellowed out by the pancake batter mixture, and the combination of alternating bites of this side dish with meat-dipped rice paper was a definite winner. In addition to these offerings, all the usual Korean side dishes were provided, and in healthy portions.Unlike other Korean BBQ places, the servers at HJC (or at least the one who was assisting our table) seem genuinely upbeat and welcoming towards customers. Not a single ""you're welcome"" was missed, and the majority of refills/restocks that were requested at our table were carried out relatively quickly.The staff did run into some communication errors, however - with multiple servers bringing out the same item - but I supposed that's to be expected when the pace of the dining environment feels like the restaurant equivalent of a trading floor on Wall Street. Additionally, with the sheer variety of items being brought to each table, it's to be expected that the servers may lose track of a detail or two; I had to refill my side sauces on my own (I hope that's allowed!) after seeing that the staff was simply too bogged down to take on an additional request. Although it's a bit pricier than the Korean BBQ places that I'm more familiar with, Hae Jang Chon still represented somewhat of a step forward in comparison to other Korean BBQ establishments that I've been to. Sadly, I'm still on the hunt for a place that offers a better balance in terms of quality AND quantity."
12/3/2013,4 star rating,"$20 bucks for a good variety and quality. The stone plate gives the meat a decent sear, so you don't necessarily miss the char from a grill. Meat here isn't as sugary and saturated in marinade as most places I've been to, which gives you an opportunity to actually taste the meat (although I reluctantly admit that is how I like it). My favorite cuts were the marinated short rib, beef tongue, and octopus."
5/16/2011,5 star rating,"So I had been searching the last week and a half for a good AYCE Korean BBQ place. It took me that long to actually find somewhere I walked in to and sat down to eat! The reason being is I hit up around 6 places over the course of a week and a half and 5 of them had B ratings and 1 C rating through the county department of health. I don't think anyone checks this often but folks this is very important you don't just see a cheap AYCE place and not realize a B and C are so unclean.Well needless to say this place had an A... YEEAAAAA!!! For $16.99 you can not beat how much you get! My favorites are like most peoples favorite the Kalbi and the Bulgogi. I also enjoyed the beef brisket and the pork belly. They give you about 7 different appetizers to fill you up on. Some include salad, spinach, steamed egg soup, kimchie pancake, potato salad with apples, kimchie fried rice and a few others I don't exactly know what they are, but I like!We were seated right away on a Sunday at 4:30 P.M. but by the time we left at 6 there was around 15-20 people outside waiting as most of the tables were full by than. The staff was very friendly and attentive and I never had to wait long for something I needed.Parking is $2 if you can't find street parking. So although you might find something a dollar or two less it pays to go to a place that doesn't have such a low rating!!!!I will definitely be going back again!"
4/25/2016,4 star rating,We had good service and a delicious meal. My only complaint is that they brought our Kimchi Fried Rice at the end after we were done eating all the meats. Seemed a little late but other than that we had a good time.
12/13/2012,5 star rating,"The BEST thin sliced pork!The BEST brisket!The BEST fishcake banchan!AND they have hot dogs!!!i love this place, but you must get there before 6:30pm on any night to avoid a multi-hour wait to get in."
8/12/2014,4 star rating,"My Buddy and I like Korean BBQ a lot, and have a usual spot we go to, but lately it's been dropping on the meat quality, so I suggested trying new places out. So far they've been hit or miss, mostly miss. So I went on yelp and began reading reviews for places, checking out prices, looking at the pics, and this place won me over. So last night we checked it out. We had no wait and were sat as soon as we got there. Keep in mind it was a monday and it did look packed. Luck of the draw I guess. So we ordered our meats and began to cook. I'm used to the open flame thing so this was different. I must admit the flames kissing the meat gives it that extra umpf that can take bad meat to good meat. But it wasn't needed at this place. Everything was great and flavorful. Kimchi pancake was effin Dope, the BBQ pork was off the chain, and the pork belly although plain, can be tossed together with the BBQ pork and make that porky goodness into Porky Greatness. Could be the fact that their meat was of higher quality but usually after eating Korean BBQ I feel gross and sluggish, not the case here. I think the stone grill helps render the fat more with it's slower cooking time. Take that George Foreman!! Anyhoo I love this place and might make it the regular spot after further review from the other to ""KBBQ Bros"" I wanted to give five stars but didn't because our drinks were hardly noticed when they needed to be refilled. Food five stars service 3 & 1/4."
10/2/2016,5 star rating,First time coming here last week. Came around midnight and was still a 30 minute wait. Once you try it you can see why. The meat quality is really good for what you pay for and better than most other ayce kbbq places. Their service is great too.
10/1/2016,3 star rating,The meat was good. It was busy but it seems like it's always busy here. The employee that we had was so so. She just seemed so bleh. Didn't ask if we needed anything and didn't even smile. I'm just strictly basing my star on the food. If it was based on service and wait I'll give it 2 and 1/2 star. But food wise it wasn't bad. I'll try it again and see how it goes but for now I'll try some other places.

Our table was pretty small for a party of 7, but the servers were very attentive and made sure there was a tray setup to the side for us to put the meat and banchan on during the course of the meal.The selection of meat was pretty good, though not as good as I would have liked for $19. The brisket had good flavor to it, though parts were excessively fatty and difficult to chew. The pork belly was also fatty (to be expected) but had excellent flavor. The bulgolgi was not overly marinated and the flavor was subtle enough where it didn't dropkick you in the mouth with saltiness. The beef tongue was probably the best meat out of the bunch though, being super thinly sliced and full of flavor. The shrimp was mediocre, and could be skipped over.Overall, I would return here again as I did enjoy both the meats and the banchan. Make sure to bring cash if you come at night though, since the parking is valet only."
4/20/2018,3 star rating,"Overrated. When I saw the reviews I decided to that I had to come here. I went with another person and we decided we didn't want to wait as apparently it gets packed really fast so we went when it first open. We took a Lyft as we didn't want to find parking. You can get valet for $2. The Â restaurant doesn't look big. It might be able to hold 75 Â people max. For ayce, $25.99 is a reasonable price as most locations are starting to up their price similarly. The difference is that there are not that many choices as those that charge the same price. I understand I will only eat maybe 5-8 items but you can't say you have 27 items when in reality you have maybe 12-15 items. I am sorry but radish and rice should not be considered an item. They are side items. Anyways, we ordered the usual beef brisket, pork belly, short ribs, etc. Of all the items we ordered, the brisket, pork belly and thin sliced pork belly was good. The pork shoulders was okay. Everything else was similar or below average to the $19.99 ayce. They pride themselves as serving only premium items but it didn't feel like it whatsoever. For premium item, try non-ayce kanghodong and you will know what premium is. For ayce with 27 real items go to Mr. BBQ in Fullerton. Seriously, overrated and try another location. Don't waste your time waiting for this place. You can have similar quality with less wait time elsewhere."

9/24/2013,4 star rating,"It was my first time dining at Hae Jang Chon Korean BBQ. T'was my brother's birthday and we celebrated the events there. Â I'll be honest with you - I don't really know what to expect - ..My wife warned me that they gonna keep serving me some kimchi..lol.. But the food was great! I tried the charcoal BBQ pork belly and wagyu beef. The downfall is the food is not even done cooking, my brother's already grabbing the damn food - so we have to chopstick fight for it...hehehe....good thing the crew keeps replenishing our food.The only upsetting part of this experience is the Valet Parking, which I'm sure you'll hear from almost everyone who dine in here. I have to wait a while for my car - where the heck did they park my car? In San Diego?..lol...I don't mind going back there again..t'was awesome!!!"
3/7/2014,5 star rating,"This is my favorite all you can eat korean bbq spot in koreatown (at least so far). For what you pay, you get SO MUCH. I bring everyone here when they come to visit. The downside, the wait can get VERY long if you come at typical dinner hours, especially on the weekends, but that must mean its good right?I love the kimchi fried rice at the end. Now that I know it exists, I always try to save some room to stuff in a little bit of this goodness. Service is quick and they stop by to help you every once in a while, especially if you are struggling.The place is pretty small so I'd say its better for smaller groups, especially if you don't want to wait for forever. I always find street parking on the side streets so I don't have to pay for valet.Definitely recommend this place. It's a bang for your buck, especially if you can eat a lot of meat! But be warned, you will smell like KBBQ afterwards."
7/12/2015,4 star rating,"This place is amazing. Â I have tried different places and while I agree that there are better quality places out there, it's hard to beat $22.99 all you can eat. Â The staff is always friendly and smiling and the food is always consistently good. Â There is usually a wait and while some may complain that the wait time can be long, I use it as a time to catch up with friends or get to know a new date."
2/23/2013,4 star rating,"This is me and my friends favorite go to Korean BBQ eat all you can eat place. Yes, I agreed with some comments that the wait most of the time takes forever but it's so worth it. For the price you pay $18 for all you can eat meat, it's so worth it. I rarely eat beef but whenever I come to this place I indulge myself with beef brisket and beef tongue. Oh so yummy! Their side dish spicy fish cake is my ultimate favorite plus it's unlimited so that's a bonus. Â I also love their chicken and squid, marinated well. The place is newly renovated its nice and clean plus the servers are super nice and friendly. I went to Road to Seoul in recommendation of my co workers and the place was just okay and their servers were too busy to cater to me and my friends. Here in hae jang chon, the servers are super friendly and they are fast. No matter how busy the place is. I give this 4.5 because I hate waiting to get in. The longest we waited was 2 hours and we almost give up. But hey it was worth the wait."
1/22/2013,3 star rating,I originally posted a very negative review about this place based off of my last experience at HJC. Â However I decided to rewrite my review based off of all my visits.I REALLY liked this restaurant a lot. Â After the first time eating at Hae Jang Chon I knew this was going to be my regular AYCE KBBQ spot. Â What kept me coming back was 1. The food is consistently tasty. Â For what you pay the quality of meat is rather good. Â 2. Also the customer service is great (as far as the wait staff). They make sure to check on the customers regularly and they're super friendly.3. Nice atmosphere. 4. Great ventilation. Â You don't come out smelling like smoke! Â Big plus!Now the reason I will not be returning to this restaurant that I liked so much is due to a over zealous hostess who felt the need to run out to me and my boyfriend in the parking lot and ask us with a little attitude if we paid our bill. Â To this day I'm not sure what made this young lady suspect we didn't pay. Â My receipt along with an addition 20% tip was left on my table for anyone to see. Â Regardless of the reason you DO NOT chase down paying customers in a crowded parking lot and ask them if they paid their bill for everyone to hear. Â Its embarrassing and VERY rude. Â Hopefully management will address this with their staff so this doesn't happen in the future.Before this event I would have given HJC 5 stars.
7/11/2018,1 star rating,I understand the line is long. All we had was a terrify sick attitude from the receptionist!!! We were totally turned off!
1/24/2013,1 star rating,"This place can kiss my arse. I now understand the horde of non-Koreans here waiting here for hours. This place has the leanest, toughest, and blandest meat I have ever partaken in. GROSS.It was so disappointing. Â We tried to leave as soon as we tried most meats but dumb service kept ignoring me holding a credit card in front of their face. Then they charged the incorrect amount. FRUSTRATING even thinking about this."
4/17/2014,4 star rating,"Be prepared to wait, and wait and wait!Once you finally get a table, about an hour after you have arrived, you will find good food and service. Â You will definitely want to come here for the stone cooking experience and save room for the Kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal."
8/5/2018,5 star rating,"When family and friends visit LA, we take them here. This place is the gold standard for Korean BBQ. There is a reason there are a lot of people waiting outside to eat at this place.."
1/19/2014,4 star rating,"Came here for a late dinner and was not disappointed! My friends and I ordered kalbi, bulgogi, spicy pork, and Kim chi pancake. Service was very prompt and polite. The guys brought out lots of ban chan and rice paper. We normally don't get rice paper in SF so I was stoked. The meat was very fresh and super tasty. The servers also made sure our meat wasn't getting burnt by checking in on our table regularly. We also got complimentary egg soup. Prices are reasonable. Open until 2 a.m. I will def come back again when visiting LA!"
9/24/2016,4 star rating,perfect service!! so glad to be able to speak korean for order!!! never have to wait for a waitor or waitress cause they will approach you immediately!perfect ï¼ï¼the pork belly was good as well. though the Â disappointed me a little... most of food were fresh. really cheap!! Â It was quite a smart choice for korean bbq!
4/15/2014,4 star rating,"I don't frequent many restaurants but Hae Jang Chon is one of them. It's the perfect spot for when we have folks visiting LA or just meeting up with friends for a great casual dining experience. FOOD: we always do ""All You Can Eat"". The side selections are fantastic with dipping sauces and an assortment of Kimchi vegetables and tofu, noodle wraps and salad. The Kimchi pancake comes usually half way through of ordering your meat, and it's awesome, leave it on the grill to get crispy. Typically we order 4-5 meats for 4 people. Favorites are the marinated short rib, Brisket and Bulgogi BBQ beef. SERVICE: service is typically pretty average, usually better in the evenings during their busy time. Hard to get your water refilled but if you get a good one they'll leave a water bottle for the table.HIGHLIGHTS: Get the kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal. We didn't know about this the first time we went so we over loaded on meat but the rice is probably the best part of the meal. Large bottles of Hite Beer to share makes it a more pleasant experience. TIP: You should be expected to wait about an hour for dinners. Go between lunch and dinner for a quick table, you're going to stay full through dinner anyway. Reservations available for groups of 8 or more."
7/10/2018,5 star rating,Spectacular service Â the best AYCE place while visiting Koreatown in LA. Is a must if you like korean bbq.
1/18/2016,5 star rating,Yes. Just yes!! It was my first time back in LA in a while and I waited about half an hour for a table for four. The bbq did not disappoint. Best kbbq I've had hands down! The soju may have played a role in that but overall solid joint. I loved the banchan as much as I loved the protein. Must try when you're in the area.
6/20/2013,4 star rating,"After having researched and driven by plenty of AYCE Korean BBQ spots in LA K-Town, my boyfriend and I, on vacation, decided on this restaurant. I am Korean and from New York, so I am not a stranger to good Korean BBQ. This place wasn't the best I've ever had, but I think the value was well-worth it!Plenty of choices in terms of meat plus you got SO MANY EXTRAS! Not only do you get the usual side dishes, but they also give you the egg dish and kimchi pancake... FOR FREE! Usually, those are appetizers you have to pay for... and they just give it away as part of the AYCE price! Amazing.Overall, I enjoyed my dinner and was satisfied with the service and food at this restaurant. I would like to try some more places if I ever find myself back in LA, but this place has done well in proving that LA's K-Town has good Korean BBQ."
4/10/2016,3 star rating,3 stars for the waiting. It was only 2 of us and our usual kbbq spot was closed. The meat was good and looked very fresh and thanks to our master chef skills tasted amazing. They serve this pancake thing by request it is definitely my favorite thing there. It's a bit more $$$$$ than most kbbq places but very good and would return.
12/22/2014,3 star rating,"not sure why everyone loves this place so much.. i've been here quite a few times and it's always been decent but not amazing. it's all you can eat yep! the service is good yep! but the meat quality is a bit sub-par and i really don't like the grill they use, the lack of holes for oil to drip causes a lot of the meat to become soggy! and their steamed egg is meh as well.. the wait is always pretty damn long"
8/13/2017,5 star rating,"One of the best Korean BBQ places around, service is very quick, valet is cheap and hassle free parking, the only thing is the wait because it's always busy."
5/31/2016,5 star rating,"This is my go to spot if I want KBBQ! It's affordable for all my friends. It's definitely a fun ambient.If you are new to KBBQ you should definitely try the experience here. They help and show you how to cook the meat for you. I love their Kimchi pancake and rice. As for meats I would recommend their galbi, bulgogi and octopus. I can't wait to come back!"
8/13/2013,5 star rating,"This is the BEST korean ayce bbq in the area! My hubby and I recently moved to Koreatown and so have been trying kbbq left and right, in search of our favorite. We love this place, and have taken our friends and family here, and they agree too. First of all, the meat is very high-quality and tasty. My favorites are the marinated kalbi, thick pork belly, and bulgogi. (although if you prefer kalbi with the bone, they don't have it here.) Then the sauces take the meat to a whole different level. I absolutely LOVE the sesame oil and salt, which goes amazingly well with the pork belly (and heck, all the other meats!). My hubby's #1 is the garlic, ponzu-like sauce which has the perfect balance of sweet and sour, and is something I haven't seen in other korean restaurants. Don't forget to save room for the kimchi fried rice at the end - leave it on the stone grill long enough to develop a delicious crunchy texture. Coming from someone who never eats kimchi by itself, it goes to show how awesome this fried rice is! Plus, the side dishes are amazing - I can't get enough of the potato salad and fish cake strips.The service here also elevates this restaurant far above and beyond others. It seems like every few minutes, there is someone on hand to stir around the meat, clean the grill using radishes, give you more of that delicious rice paper, or help with whatever requests you have. Hae Jang Chon is within walking distance of where we live, so we definitely will be coming back many more times. It's dangerous to be living so close, especially as we're trying to watch our shape, haha. However, it's totally worth it!!! The food and service are simply outstanding."
10/16/2013,3 star rating,"I know a lot of people rhapsodize about this place, but maybe it's just that I live next to it that I grow less fond with every visit. Is it the meat that's getting worse? The staff? The wait time? Or maybe, baby, it's not you, it's me.Actually, it is you. I love your food - your octopus and tongue more than the rest - but why does everything so good have to take so long? Come prepared with a gameboy and a lot of experience with bad relationships."
5/28/2016,5 star rating,"Make sure to give yourself time as the wait can be as long as 2 hours. But once we were seated the table was already set up. One thing I liked about the place was that they had a sweet dipping sauce. We got the brisket, beef tongue, and pork belly. Very high quality meat. The only con is that the we felt rushed as the server kept asking us for more meat. the kimchi fried ice at the end was really good as well. pretty cheap valet parking ($2). Will com back again."
1/7/2013,2 star rating,"Seriously, my first and the last time at this joint. A friend wanted to do AYCE Korean BBQ on Saturday despite my warning on the quality of the rag-like meat. Again, the old socks smell, poorly handled, long-long-long-overdue-in-the-freezer meat of mysterious ""cut"" and ""quality"" arrived. Cha-dol is semi-edible as it is thin and missing chunks of unsavory fat globules found in other cuts. Brisket is a cheap but lean cut so it is fairly safe. I highly caution you from ordering unmarinated galbi shreds; they smelled and tasted like fungal rags (don't ask me how I'd know the taste of of the fungal rags). The saving grace was kimchi fried rice at the end, the only other edible item aside from julienned radish kimchi (aka moo chae).It all ended on a good note as I've given my friend a good brow-beating and forced her to accompany me to the Galleria 2nd floor cafe to have fruity shaved ice which she is not a huge fan of. I cleansed my palate with a cool serving of bing-su."
11/30/2012,4 star rating,"This was my fifth time at Hae Jang Chon and it is still as consistent as when I first had HJC over four years ago when I just knew it as the place with the Pig as the logo. I was introduced to it by a Korean and it is definitely Korean-tested, Korean-approved at least thats the word from my Korean friends. Â Solid is the best way to describe this KBBQ. It's neither cheap nor absurdly expensive at 17.99 for dinner and you get to choose from over 16 items on the menu which is perfect for meat lovers and especially for those picky eaters that want to try a bit of this and a bit of that. This time I discovered pork shoulder and it is definitely something I'd recommend getting. It is somewhat leaner than the other meats and yet has a great texture to it. It doesn't floor you with flavor like the marinated kalbi but it isn't as chewy and gamey as the pork belly. I would say the marinated kalbi is better than I've had at other places and the bulgogi is still a great choice. I also really like the spread of banchan. They even provide the fried egg and if you bug them enough you get a thick stack of rice papers. Also, the rookie mistake is to fill up without saving at least some room for the kimchi fried rice they bring out at the end. Don't be the one tapping out before you've had this. Don't worry, they also bring out soup so you can wash it all down. Service is always great here as they are still the only place I've seen that uses ginger to clean their grills. While they may not cook the meats for you (unless you look like you're really struggling to cook) they come by frequently and fill your banchan or as if you'd like more meat.However, the huge drawback of HJC is the outrageous wait times. You'll be hard pressed to get seated promptly even with a reservation. That being said, I think HJC is approximately worth a 45 minute to an hour wait but anything over that and I would consider other restaurants. Also, if you're going at night, you'll have to deal with flocks of youngsters. I don't know what happened over time but HJC is like Hipster Juvenile Central now. And these are the crazy kinds of things you think about - seeing what you can make out of the acronym HJC- Â as you're waiting over an hour to be seated. Â Still you can't go wrong with Hae Jang Chon after all this time."
7/19/2016,5 star rating,"So I meet a couple of friends here, It was my first time here an honestly I had never had Korean BBQ but after this place I will defiantly be coming back!!! The service was quick the food good and the place was cool. Â Very good time and good food and service!!!"
8/29/2018,4 star rating,Continue to eat here if you want to have a good time I suggest you go it's really close very friendly very nice you can't get any better prices than this is better than most restaurants that she even walk into great I don't eat meat but they have options like that that's great do you love to eat food if you want to eat food yellow to eat here OK
5/22/2016,4 star rating,"Great food, great service! I love the fact u dont leave smelling like youd been in a bbq place."
5/23/2014,5 star rating,"Just about as flawless of an AYCE Korean BBQ place as you would hope, especially in light of the many glowing reviews for it. Â For the price and selection of meats, you'd be likely to find a greater deal in the area.I arrived with my family, who were in town, and I was aware that they only take reservations for parties of six or more. Â We were told it'd be 45 to an hour wait but they must be an efficient bunch since we ended up seating within 20-25 minutes. Â They prioritize full parties so if you standing in for your group, they may skip over you since they're trying to cycle through as quick as possible.The selection with the $18.99 amount is fantastic: it has your standards like bulgogi (very good), brisket, marinated pork (awesome), pork belly (better crispy), even seafood like shrimp and BBQ squid (both great but you have to be on them so they don't overcook).Overall it's a great time for out-of-towners or experienced KTown journeymen like myself. Â The service was also on top of it, the food tasted of high quality, and it's just always a cool experience coming to a place like this."
1/5/2014,5 star rating,This is my favorite AYCE Korean bbq. Sometimes you really have to wait and I've gone early enough where I walked right in and sat down. They have a parking lot but it can get filled so drive by and see if you can make it work or plan on am street parking. They bring a ton of sides to accompany your meats and they're all yummy. The menu also has tips that describe what the sides and sauces are and how they're typically eaten. Great addition for the first-timer!The price is on the higher end but it definitely matched up with the quality and quantity of items to select from. The service is nice too. I was taking too long to cook my meat and looked pretty unexperienced so the waiter came by and helped us out... A LOT. lolThey have a wide selection of meats as well as seafood. The sides are plentiful and have a solid alcohol selection too. Â They offer a kimchi fried rice which is one of they're their specialities so I suggest saving room at the end of your meal to try some. I've gone back a few time after my first visit I like it so much.
7/25/2013,4 star rating,"This place became one of my few regulars that I go to when I crave kbbq. Â I won't lie, I'm a meat lover. Â Any place with tons of meat, I'm usually there savoring ever morsel of it. Â One thing about Hae Jang Chon that's unique is their Kimchi Fried Rice that the servers make for you at the very end. Â The fried rice is done right in front of you and its really cool to watch. Â Its a good ending to all the meat consumption you just had but be careful not to eat too much meat or else you will not have any room for this bombass rice.Please also note: if you end up ordering steamed rice, you lose out on kimchi fried rice at the end since its one order per person)"
1/4/2014,3 star rating,"First off, parking is crazyy for this place, so you either find nearby street parking, valet, or far street parking. I had to park far for the past two visits to this place. This place gets really busy from dinner all the way up to even 11 PM ! Their cheapest AYCE is 15.99 which roughly makes it, I believe, $17.35 after taxes.Now, I am in agreement with the rest of the reviews. The meat quality is just OK, not great, not bad. Due to its price, the selection of meat is awesome since it has my favorite meat ! Also, they use a stone grill. These people also cook and cut the meat for you, so that is a plus ! However, that also explains why they are mediocre in terms of response times for getting our orders and refilling our water and side dishes. As for the negatives, you can only get ONE bowl of rice, and that is it. That seems like a dumb rule to me. OR you can opt for the kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal. I have the kimchi fried rice, and it was just okay. All in all, this place is decent if you want Â to get away from your $10 AYCE KBBQ joints every once in a while."
5/20/2016,5 star rating,"The bbq is amazing! Great food and service. But their parking lot is small and crowd, and there is always a long long wait if u come during the dinner time."
3/11/2013,5 star rating,"I think this has to be my favorite KBBQ restaurant, AYCE or otherwise.It cost my group $23 per person including tax and tip for all the wonderful offerings: beef brisket, kalbi, bulgogi, thick pork belly, and a bunch of other stuff (you can see the list on the wall). Â Oddly, they offer ""hot dog"" too, which seemed a bit enticing for whatever reason... for the more adventurous, there is beef tongue and a few other things I can't recall at the moment.We were confused when we first sat down because our grill (a large stone circle) seemed to be slanting and about to fall off, but that's because there's a hole on one side that drains all the grease, since it's not your typical grill that channels off the grease by way of groove. Â But this is wonderful, because as all you brisket lovers know, the thin meat tends to stick to an overly hot metal grill and you lose precious bits of your order! The stone cooks much slower and the oiliness seems to help...The meat seemed to be of much higher quality than comparable restaurants, too! Â Quite a few of us commented on that.And perhaps the most amazing of all, for a Korean restaurant, was the prompt, friendly service.The Saturday wait is pretty bad, you've been warned. Completely worth it, though. One minor, inexplicable, annoyance: there's a guy who calls out names long before they're ready to seat you (like 30 min beforehand), just to check if you're there. So you can't really wander off and do something in the hour+ you might have to wait. Quite the ruse. Who knows why?"
1/6/2015,5 star rating,"five stars only because they deserve it. $22.99 for AYCE korean bbq with good quality meats and good service?! Â  yes, i say yes every time. they have a special stone grill they use for every group and they clean it for you every time and throughout dinner. Â the stone grill really makes a difference and i think it cooks and sears all the meats nicely.AYCE meats included that i tried - short rib - really good quality, but was more in a slab of steak form. Â marinated very well and the meat was super tender. Â no bone =/ but the meat was still delicious. Â enough sweet to balance out the flavors, and not too salty. Â this was my favorite =)bugolgi - pretty good! well marinated and thinly sliced. ate 2 plates, but the short rib won my heart. spicy pork - soooo good!!!! Â usually, i do not like spicy pork due to its overwhelming salty flavor/hard texture, but this pork was super tender and nicely seasoned. Â the pork wasn't too salty and it was a well-balanced spicy flavor.pork belly - they offer both thick and thin slices. i only like the thick slices, so i ordered this only. Â it was good, but nothing too special about it. Â thick slices like bacon and good portions.squid - must get this if you go! Â so good, grilled nicely and was not chewy or hard. nicely marinated and dat quality tho! Â i usually don't like this either at most places because when it gets cooked, it usually shrivels up and gets to a very chewy texture.. but not for this one! super delicious, highly recommend!kimchi pancake - yummmmmy, although i would of wished they offered seafood. lol but i'm just being picky. Â still good and a nice pancake to cut into four pieces for four ppl!steamed egg - love the soupy flavor in it, but felt like it kind of had a burnt smell to it, but still nicely cooked.finished off kbbq with kim chi fried rice (they save it until the end). save your meat so you can mix it in with it! Â it was good, nothing too special, but still good.overall, i really enjoyed my experience here. although a long wait, it was worth it. Â their service was superb and probably the best service ever in korean bbq (ayce). Â all the servers helped refill water, the appetizers and helped cook/cut the meat for you throughout the meal. Â i really enjoyed dining here and will be back next time for some delicious KBBQ and excellent service."
7/16/2016,1 star rating,Extremely upset!!!! Waiter spilled a bunch of raw meat juice inside my $300 purse. & almost got on us. Was all over the bench we were sitting at. They apologized but that's all they did. Some customer service. Â I'm really unhappy. They are definitely not getting a tip tonight.
10/8/2015,4 star rating,"pretty good, always crowded though. If you don't mind long waits or enjoy eating during of hours, this may be the place for you. It's no Park's bbq or OO-kook, but it's an acceptable replacement for large groups at a lower price point and all you can eat, with some unique factors that the other premium joints don't offer (fried rice)"
10/13/2016,5 star rating,"If you've never had Ayce Korean BBQ, this place will ruin all the experiences you'll receive at any future k-bbq establishments. It's just that BOMB! Be sure to go with friends and/or family. Enjoy"

8/7/2014,5 star rating,"You see, in my family, we play The Hunger Games every night during dinner. No, it's not like the Hunger Games that Katniss plays. It's the ""if you don't fight for what you want to eat, you'll go hungry"" kind of Hunger Games. So it's only appropriate we go to an AYCE KBBQ restaurant when we visited LA. The wait for four people was around 1 hour at 8pm on a Friday night which wasn't too bad. They are opened until 2am, so you can definitely hit this place up if you have late night munchies/drunchies.For $18/person, you get:- Four banchan choices: the veggies are so delicious! And you'll appreciate them after eating loads and loads of meat. Trust me.- Steamed egg, kimchi pancake, and a big bowl of salad: it's a nice break to eat something other than meats.- A stone grill, unlike the usual ones. They clean it by throwing radish on it and wiping away the oil. Pretty cool concept!- A large variety of meat choices. The ladies also come by to help you cook them! You can pick up to four different kinds of meat at one time.We got 8-10 orders of beef brisket (oh my lord, so heavenly), short ribs (they'll cut this up for you!), shrimp, octopus, and a few other things. Cook your meat, put some sauce on it, and wrap it up with the rice paper. They have a kimchi fried rice option that they'll cook at the end of the meal, but we opted out. I definitely want to try next time though!Note:- Don't wear tight pants. You'll regret it.- Don't be wasteful. They'll charge you $15 if you have a lot of leftovers, so order accordingly!"
8/7/2014,4 star rating,"We specialize in making you wait a long time for food because we are one popular ass store and we can do that because we can!1!1!1!!!We also specialize in cooking your food because you look like bunch of kids who doesn't know how to cook their own meat!1!1!!!These buttheads keep cooking food for us when we still have leftover meats from 2 rounds ago. But I know they care, so I forgive them. I ended up eating 33 rounds to show them my forgiveness. I'm a forgiving person indeed.Their beef tongue and the brisket was pretty divine despite their bulgogi tasted like sewage meat. I recommend getting only their beef tongue and brisket until you want some of their special Ancient Japanese kimchi fried rice. My friend's friend's uncle's son's dog is a samurai from ancient japan. He said that....""Good rice comes from good stone""This magical quote applies to this restaurant because you get to cook your meat and stuff on a slab of giant circular stone. It's like you are in a cult about to sacrifice shit by cooking the dead cow over it.Parking is horrendous. Have the valet people take care of that for you. These guys will drive your car away! But don't worry, they won't steal your car. If they do, they go back to Mexico. 2$ valet parking, cheaper than boba. You go economy!"
8/6/2014,4 star rating,"(+) valet parking, which I always think is a plus in LA. Don't care how much it costs ...always worth it(+) waitress came by to clean our grill and cook for us(+) tasty and juicy short rib(+) steamed egg soup was on point(-) stood waiting at the entrance for 10 minutes when it was not busy at all at 6 pm. Waiters/host was busy setting up the grills, but they could have just told us to hold on a minute and that they'll be with us in a second(-) waitress was pretty attentive at first, but as it got busy not as much :("
8/3/2014,5 star rating,"I'm glad we had reservations for 10 on a Friday night because it was so busy. We were seated as soon as our party arrived but we had to split up into two tables. Food selection was great and service was amazing. We were being taken care of from the moment we sat down until the moment we left. We ordered 6 rounds of meat and had hite and soju. We asked for lemon but they said they didn't have any; ok, no biggie. The staff came by every once in a while to cook our food and were quick to ask us if we wanted any more meat. Will definitely go back again."
8/3/2014,1 star rating,"This place states it closes at 2 but really closes at 1:30. The nerve to tell us "" we close at 2 but our kitchen closes at 1:30. Really?!?"
8/2/2014,3 star rating,"We arrived about a quarter after 4pm and we were seated in approx 5 mins or less. We informed the host that we'll need 1 highchair. The high chair situated at our table had broken seat belt straps and they changed it out for us quickly. Â I like that they had banchans ready at our table. There were kim chee, bean sprouts, potato salad, and my favorite was spinach. After we gotten our iced water, we were ready to order (AYCE). We were limited to 4 items at a time so we asked for brisket, galbi (marinaded), thin cut pork belly, and kim chi pancakes. Our grill was very hot just by the steam and the waiters came by to lower the heat. I thought the waiters and waitresses were pretty attentive to our grill in terms of heat, the meat, and they usually cleaned our grill a few times after we consumed each food round. I am a fan of briskets and galbi, however some of the brisket cuts were too lean or the galbi marinade was too young and tough, also the thin cut pork belly had cartilage in them. I was somewhat disappointed but it wasnt a big deal. We asked for pork shoulder but the waitress convinced us to not order that cause it was too greasy and the hot oil/grease would bounce off the grill and injure our kids face. We took her advice and ordered something else. Â Customer service was exceptional even if we pushed the HELP button a couple times. They had patience with us the entire time so our dining experience over all was good."
8/2/2014,1 star rating,"Wow, what the eff happened to you guys Hae Jang Chon?!This place used to be my go to Korean BBQ place in K-town, the stone grills are awesome, the amazing kimchi fried rice at the end, all you can eat short ribs for about 18$ - but last nights experience was the worst display of customer service I've ever experienced. Girlfriend and I arrive there after spending the day at Venice, and we wait for a good hour before we're seated. We finally get situated, they take our meat order and maxed out the flame so the stone grill gets hot. This stooge that was in charge gave our meat to the table next to us, I said something and he told me ""the kitchen is busy sorry, meat will be out shortly."" ok.. that's fine - some different worker gave our meat to the table next to us again! At this point the grill is so hot that you can see steam come out of it, I lower it because I have some common sense. Couple seconds later the employee maxes the heat again so I assumed it was ideal to have it maxed out . So we're waiting for our meat yet again, and all of a sudden the grill EXPLODES! Yes.. i'm not even exaggerating, I wish I took a picture. It shattered and flew all over the table. Girlfriend and I got scared Â to death now, and walked away from it, everybody in the restaurant took notice too notice except the workers for some reason; so I had to flag one down. All of a sudden all the workers are getting mad and was yelling at each other in Korean asking ""WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THEM?"" ""How could this happen?"" - no one bothered to approach us and ask if we were okay. We got a mild ""sorry"" 10 minutes later after they cleaned up the mess. The service after that then got worse. They kept delivering our meats to the table next to us, I had to order something 3-4 times until I finally got it. There was a crap load tension between the workers so it was hella awkward every time they came over to help us cook our meat. Girlfriend and I tried making the best of the evening until they gave us the check in the middle of our meal. Like dude, we're not even close to being done, and we've barely even started eating. Seems like you're trying to get rid of us. They gave us the check with no compensation or no offers to anything. We payed and left. Hae Jang Chon you guys were my first Korean BBQ love, but I have no choice but to move on. I think as a customer, we deserved at least your concern -for Â we had front row seats to your sizzling hot stone pot bomb."
8/1/2014,5 star rating,5 Reason's why I prefer Hae Jang Chon over other AYCE Korean BBQ places:#1 They cook on a stone grill. Â This prevents a lot of the annoying burning and overly smokey grill scenarios that occur at other KBBQ places. Â They also clean it halfway through the meal with radishes which I really like. Â #2 Their side dishes. Â I love everyone one of their side dishes and I think they give a lot more variety than some other places. Â The potatoes are delicious and so are the greens that they give you!!!#3 Their dipping sauces. Â They give you four kinds of sauces to dip your meat in and every one of them is tasty for different types of meats :) Â  (I also love the rice paper that I can wrap my meat in.)#4 Price/ Waiting/ Meat selection ratio is just right!! Â This place is the best compromise I've found between the amount I have to wait to the amount I have to pay to the amount of selection I have of meat. Â For $17 ayce they have a huge variety of meat to choose from and octopus as well!!! Â Usually the waiting isn't so bad if you come here earlier in the day. #5 Complimentary kimchi fried rice at the end. Â Even though I'm always too full at the end and feel ridiculously bloated the fried rice is still delicious and a nice touch at the end of a meal.
7/31/2014,4 star rating,"Very reasonably priced AYCE KBBQ.Four of us went for lunch on a Saturday. We went shortly after 12 noon & managed to get seated without more than a few minutes wait. Â They only take reservations for groups of 8+ on the weekends. Â We also managed to find parking nearby; parking was a little tight though.We tried a mix of the different meats available. The pork belly, BBQ pork & the brisket were my favorite. Â I liked that there was some seafood included. The had a pretty good banchan selection for an AYCE place. The servers helped cook the meat & let us know when the meat was ready/cooked. Â They also made a kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal. The Hite beer was a good complement on such a warm day,"
7/31/2014,3 star rating,"The wait was long but no longer than anywhere else in K-town. We had the beef tongue, galbi, bulgogi, pork belly and brisket. They ran out of rice!!! How does that happen??? So our table didn't get all the rice and it was a 20 minute wait to get it. Just a tip... When you get low, start the next batch. The food alone would have given this place 5 stars but the service knocked it down. Had to ask for soda refill that I didn't get, dirty look from server who had to wait 5 seconds for my sister to get out of the way so she could cut the galbi, no rice and the rude host when I walked in made this experience a 3 rating."
11/23/2012,5 star rating,"Despite the long waits during the weekends, Hae Jang Chon is definitely my favorite KBBQ place in LA. Although the restaurant itself isn't big, I Â like how the tables are set out so that the place feels spacious, and it never gets too smoky or stuffy. I find the $20 per person AYCE BBQ to be a bargain, there is nothing like this in the bay area as far as I know. They have a variety of meat to choose from, my favorites are the kalbi, brisket, bulgogi and beef tongue. The quality of meat is pretty good for all you can eat. You can order a full portion or half a portion every time. I also love their side dishes, there are plenty of fresh kimchi, radish, bean sprouts and radish to choose from. And on top of all the meat, they also serve kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice. The staff are also very attentive, they help you start cooking th meat, clean the stove halfway through th meal, and are quick to refill the sides when requested. Overall, the long waits will not be stopping me from coming back again and again"
9/19/2015,5 star rating,"Awesome K BBQ. 3rd time here and this place rocks it on flavor. The wait is long but worth it. Except an hour and a half wait on average. Go to the car, take a walk stay occupied. If you are lucky 45 minutes. Great food . Good environment."
11/12/2013,4 star rating,"I like the stone griddle pan and how they use an all-natural way to clean it with radish right in front of you. Their meats are great quality. But don't be fooled by the hot dog on the menu. It's really just cheap hot dogs, not mini sausages, not any thing special. Hot dog. Think 12 pack for $0.99 type hot dogs.Service was friendly and quick.At the end of your meal you get the option of having kimchee fried rice. I was looking forward to that through the entire meal. When it finally came, I was extremely disappointed. However, it was a good meal and I would choose this place over many of the others that I've been to simply for their quality meats and great service."
9/8/2015,5 star rating,"Probably one of my favorite Kbbq place because of the meat quality and sides. The service is pretty quick here but it's always so busy. So expect a wait during busy hours. It's expensive $22 for dinner but the meats available are top notch and very flavorful. My favorite is the marinated beef. You don't even need any sauce to dip in, it's just that good. We also ordered egg drop soup and kimchi pancake (highly recommend). One order always comes in 4. Also, you have a choice of steam rice or kimchi fried rice which they will cook for you in the end only. Only bummer though since I kind of want the rice while I'm eating my meat. As for the sides my favorite will always be the pickled daikon and fish cake (however these were a tad bit spicier than normal). Overall, I like the variety they give you for $22. Other places don't have as much and they charge almost the same. Probably even bad service in other places too."
9/29/2016,5 star rating,Best korean bbq with the best prices!!! Definitely worth the drive! Only downfall is waiting almost an hour to get a table
5/1/2018,5 star rating,"So yummy! Great quality of meat! Always worth the drive and wait. The waiting line is always an hour long, but there are some restaurants next to it that you can chill for a bit."
6/27/2014,5 star rating,"I'm not an expert on KBBQ, but coming here has always been a great experience. It is worth the wait!Item to try: Mini octopus. So cute and so delicious. Get the pan started with thick cut pork belly and then drop those bad boys in. Yum!"
5/28/2013,5 star rating,"Had my first and second Korean BBQ experience here in the past week. Came around lunchtime each time and there was less than 5 minute waits each time and we found street parking around the block pretty easily.It's really hard to say what the best meat was, I was particularly into the brisket. We went through an abundance of the rice paper, making mini meat / spice / lettuce sandwiches. So freakin' good. It's kind of like christmas for a first time AYCE Korean BBQer... they keep bringing out little goodies, the pancake appetizer, the egg bowl, the rice at the end. All jammed with flavor. Come hungry. Like... really hungry. You'll leave not wanting to eat for days."
12/13/2015,5 star rating,"For all you can eat for $19.99?? This place gets my vote! The service there was incredibly fast-they were really on top of their stuff. I ordered brisket, thick pork belly, short ribs and octopus. Here's a tip: I heard the next table order in ""half"" orders so that they wouldn't get too full off of trying too many meats. Definitely want to do that next time. The place was clean and the workers were very curteous."
1/13/2013,4 star rating,"Just wanted to update my review and say I had another fantastic experience at Hae Jang Chon. This time I came with my American co-workers who wanted to check out a good AYCE KBBQ joint. I suggested HJC because I've had a great experience in the past, so I made reservations for Sunday night at 6pm.The only problem I had this time was with the hostess. This chick has a SERIOUS attitude problem and I had to refrain myself from showing my emotions. She calls me at 5:45pm and asks about 5 times if I'm still coming by 6. ""Hi, Are you coming? This is HJC calling..""""Yes, we're all coming and will be there""""Ok... I just want to make sure you guys are all coming""""Yes.......we're all coming""""Ok... well, we can't save the tables for over 10 minutes""(speechless)""YES. WE ARE COMING""""Ok all 10 people are coming?""(WTF IS THIS GIRL STUPID)""YES WERE ON OUR WAY. WE STILL HAVE 15 MINUTES TIL OUR APPT""A courtesy call to make sure that we're keeping our reservation is OK. Badgering me about getting there on time in the most annoying way possible...is NOT OK. What's even worse, I arrive 10 minutes early and she gives me the WORST POSSIBLE ATTITUDE and keeps reminding me that everyone has to be there on time. Let me just say this chick started the night off on such a bad note for me. I would've left if it wasn't for my coworkers who had been dying to try AYCE KBBQ. This girl, I believe her name is Claire.... seriously needs to learn some manners. Especially in the restaurant industry where your hostess is the first form of interaction between a customer and the business, you really don't want people to have a bad impression before they even sit down for their meal. Thankfully all the other workers were SO NICE. The older women who were helping our table were SO NICE. SO SO NICE. At the end of the day everyone loved it and had an amazing time. The prices are great and I would come back. It would be perfect if next time I wouldn't get so much crap from the hostess. Overall, I'm still a fan and would definitely recommend to others."
7/12/2011,4 star rating,"One of the best service I've experienced at a restaurant. They have your typical all-you-can-eat KBBQ price ($16.99) with much better quality meat, soup, fried rice and excellent waiter service. The soybean paste soup hits the spot! And you must save room for the fried rice at the end.The waiters are there to clean your grill, give you more dduk, replenish your salad bowl, refill your water cup, fix the heat...every time you turn around. I was very impressed by the quality of the service. I love coming back and tipping well at restaurants like these. It's a great place to catch up with old friends, have casual company outings, etc. The line gets really long. This place is packed around dinner time, so get there around 6pm to avoid the waiting."
8/16/2016,4 star rating,I really like the food and I ate too much but it was good Â tell all my friends to go there it was great.
4/27/2016,5 star rating,"AMAZING!!!I have been here quite a few times, usually late in the evening. Amazing Food! Amazing Service!But be prepared for a wait. I have waited anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. It is that good and there is always a line and we are willing to wait that long.Once seated they never rush you to leave either, which is really nice.It is first come, first serve with the sign-in sheet. Also make sure your whole party is there, because they will not seat only some of your party."
1/10/2013,2 star rating,"I get what the hype is about, but it doesn't warrant a 5-star review from my experience. Heck...I was about to give them 2 stars in the beginning but here is my story...Came with 3 friends for Saturday lunch around 2PM. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, which was no biggie other than the fact that there were about 3 open tables. Finally, when we got seated, we didn't have a waiter for the next 5 minutes. Water please? Finally, when the waiter came, he took our order and and never really saw him again.The service is pretty damn bad. After our waiter took our order and left for the day, it took about another 20 minutes before we got any meat or side dishes (the place was definitely not crowded at 2PM either). Then there was a girl who we pulled to ask about our food, who seem bothered that we were not being patient enough. It's a pretty bad sign when you, the customer. is AFRAID of asking for customer service. 0 Stars.When the food did come, it wasn't bad. I've had better side dishes, although they were pretty good. I've had better meat as well - the CALBI (my favorite) was a bit dry and chewy....BLEH. And what I don't like is that the waiter gave me an attitude when I asked for the complementary soup and kimchi fried rice, which has to come at the end - BUT WHAT IF I AM CRAVING KIMCHI FRIED RICE NOW? Sorry, I don't mean to be whiny, but I was really craving kimchi fried rice and when we finally had it at the end, we were too full and only took a few bites before wasting the entire thing. I don't get their strategy here.The decor of the restaurant is pretty nice now that I think of it. Other than that, I don't see myself coming here again."
4/25/2016,4 star rating,"Came here with a group of friends on Sunday night with a reservation for 6PM. We were totally aware of the reservation policy and made sure the whole party arrived before the 15 minute grace period. However, we didn't get seated until about 6:45 close to 7PM. That's my only gripe about this place. What's the point of a reservation when we pretty much had to wait as long as, if not longer than someone without a reservation at all?Anyway, the service here is great. We never have to wait long for meat orders or refills of any sort. The wait staff is majorly attentive, nice and funny. The meat quality is wonderful and definitely worth the wait. One of my favorite parts is the kimchi fried rice at the end. The parking situation is a bummer but you may luck out on a Sunday and get free meter parking like we did, P.S. Skip the blueberry soju unless you really love the taste of old school grape Dimetapp, which I do."
3/18/2013,5 star rating,"The only reason you need to come here is Yerim. That's all I have to say. She is awesome.Okay, but really. This is my favorite AYCE KBBQ... a few things to note. They get very busy so be prepared for a long wait, or make a reservation... but they only hold your reservation for 20 minutes and require your whole party to be there for you to be seated... just a warning... they counted my party last time. First time that's every happened but it just goes to show you how strict they can be. Back to the food... DO NOT get overzealous and ask for a bowl of rice. You have two choices for rice... bowls of steamed rice OR at the very end of your meal they will make a communal kim chee fried rice on the pan... this is the best part so hold off on the regular rice and get the one at the end. I also always get an order of hot dogs before i get the fried rice. Tell that you want that in the rice and they will come cook it, cut it up for you and then make your rice. These guys also have think sliced pork belly which I love.... spicy pork, galbi, brisket, even squid... it's all good. Good quality meat and they don't abide by the diminishing plate size policy... you don't know that that is? Next time you go to a random AYCE place... notice that the first plate or two of meat are full size plates with copious amounts of meat. By the time you get to the 3rd or 4th plate, they are half the size with less than half the meat... :( Last Tip for you guys and HJC... if you get there, and there is a long wait, if you ask the hostess nicely, she'll take down your number and tell her that you are going to Nandarang (Next Door) to start drinking. Ask her to call you when your table is ready. They've done it for me on multiple times so waiting isn't as bad as it would have been. Did I mention Yerim?? If she's working request her section :D"
3/4/2018,5 star rating,"There is a reason why my fiance's family visit this establishment often. This place has good quality meats and dishes, good customer service, and somewhat decent prices! Shout out to our servers Shawn and Gina for always being prompt with our numerous requests! Shawn must of cleaned our grill 5 times within an hour with a great attitude without being annoyed or irritated, so major props to him!"
6/22/2014,3 star rating,"If you're hungry, and looking for some late night KBBQ.. this is your spot! Please be mindful that the wait here is in groups, many tables often leave at the same time so I would suggest either coming here really early or very late around midnight. There are 19 items on the menu, which includes angus beef brisket and short ribs. Unfortunately, there is no steak served here.The bean paste soup was delicious, but very Â mild. Furthermore, the type of grill used here will not let you have that charred, slightly burnt taste. Instead, the grills used here resemble more of a WOK. Something to stir fry on.Lastly, their signature kimchi fried rice is an option which is included at the end of your meal. It's delicious because of the kimchi and seaweed, but it is nothing to get too excited about for a price of $16.99 per person.My final say? Go to Road To Seoul."
12/8/2013,2 star rating,"Came and made rsvp at 8 pm for 13 ppl. We finally get seated at 8: 50. Not by the table we were told that will fit all of us. We actually got separated by 2 tables instead. Bummer, but hopefully the food will make it up cuz by then we were hungry as hell. NOT TO MENTION THIS PLACE IS COLD AS HELL INSIDE.Meat comes out and boils on this rock grill, now I said boil not grill. Â The meat took forever Â to sizzle into crispy char and didn't taste all that anyways, their meat sauce was oddly salted. The shrimp and squid didnt taste so fresh, but rather rubbery. The only thing that got me full was the delicious side dishes and their water lol. We had a friend who was allergic to seafood and we had to put her meat on one side. The workers there kept coming by to mix our meat! after we said plz dont do that, Â numerous time. Â All in all, never again. Â For 20$ ill stick to ghen :)Michelle, our waitress was rather helpful and cute lol."
7/24/2013,3 star rating,"My husband and I had AYCE lunch just now.We ordered choice beef short rib one marinated, one unmarinated, and thin sliced pork belly.The three orders filled us up.The short rib was good but some pieces were hard. Marinated pieces were more tender but some pieces were too salty. The pork belly tasted good. I guess their meet is not consistent. Some pieces were cut small some big.The service was okay. I don't have complaint about their job but their attitude.I have 1-year server experience in a busy restaurant. Being a server is not easy but Â can you at least put a smile on for customers?? I'm not coming back because of that.Korean bbq needs the server's frequent assistance. I can't enjoy my meal having unhappy people serving me food.And the price is now 18.99 dollars per person. I feel ripped off. A total rip-off.I was on my lunch break so I left before I was served with the soup and rice.I didn't even want it."
10/12/2014,3 star rating,"Now before I begin my review, I've never had korean bbq before.My girlfriend and I came to this place around 10pm. There was no parking in the plaza so I had to go find street parking. The wait was an hour, and we waited outside with the other large groups of people. When we finally got seated, I noticed the establishment seems a bit too crowded. The table was already placed with other foods. When we ordered the food (22 dollars a person for all you can eat meat) the lady seemed like she was rushing us. Understandable considering there was alot of people waiting for a table. The food was okay. I've never done korean bbq style restaurant before, but I've had some back home in NYC. The food was okay. Not awesome enough for me wanting to come back due to the wait. It now seems to me korean bbq restaurants is just all the hype. 3 stars. 3.5 considering it's all you can eat. But that's about it."
6/18/2016,5 star rating,"Tired of waiting next door, we come here for dinner. Â Turns out not a bad choice after all!! Â We ordered the beef combo with Suju, sea urchin rice, kimchi pancake, cold Â noodles. Â All the food taste great and we received Great service!!! Beef quality is good and our party received great service throughout our meal, which is hard to come by. Â This is a great choice for gatherings, like our party of 8. Â Make sure you check-in to receive beer & suju too!"
5/15/2013,5 star rating,"OMGoodness...This place was Amazebawlls!!!!! Â From the second we got there, they started bringing out the appetizers. Â There were cucumber salads, mashed potatoes and some cabbage side dishes to start ..There was no wait when we went. It was around 11am on a Sunday. Â We got the All you Can Eat.....and boy was it special....the dipping sauces were so tasty. Â I had chicken and a ton of meat. Â They bring out a huge bowl of each meat you want and you then cook everything yourself...I tried the cow tongue....it was very thinly sliced and tasted great. Â Although I have cut back on my meat consumption these days, I would very easily be swayed if somebody wanted to try Korean BBQ....yum yum yum yum yum.Also, the ambiance of the restaurant was very hip...the servers were very informative and nice."

6/13/2016,4 star rating,"I thought this place was pretty great. Â There is always, ALWAYS a wait. Â I got in line at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon and wasn't seated until around 4:45. Â The AYCE price is around $24 per person on the weekend (a lot of the menu photos on Yelp are quite outdated and show a lower price). Â The variety was good and it was nice (but kind of odd) to have the server cook the meat for us. Â Basically, if you have time to kill and have been dying to check this place out, it's very good. Â However, there are a lot of ""very good"" Korean bbq places in ktown, so not everyone will think a 1-2.5 hour wait will be worth it."
6/12/2016,3 star rating,"Would have been four stars if it were not for the service being on the poor side because they were slightly rude. However, for $19.99 the unlimited meats were on point."

10/23/2012,4 star rating,"Deeeelicious! I was able to come here around 7:00 on a weeknight and was expecting a huge wait, but I think I lucked out. The host seemed almost apologetic that our party of 3 would have to wait 15-20 minutes. For a place this popular? Heck yeah!So this is my first trip in years to K-Town for KBBQ. We took the Purple Line to Wilshire/Normandie (I think Wilshire/Western is about the same distance away too) and after only a brief wait settled in for their AYCE option for $17.99. They have 19 items to select from, but you can only order 4 meats at a time. This turned out to be plenty for us, with just a little extra bulgogi as it was our favorite. The beef brisket and the short rib were also delicious, and as usual the chicken was pretty flat compared to the other meats. We didn't try any of the more ""exotic"" meats as it was a first KBBQ experience for my friends, and they weren't in the mood to experiment (and I was pretty happy with that!). The sides were pretty standard, although I thought the egg soup was on the bland side.I'd love to explore more K-Town AYCE KBBQ joints. If they're as good as Hae Jang Chon then there's no reason for me to ever leave this area without being uncomfortably full."
7/15/2013,5 star rating,This place is the best! extremely nice staff and food is delicious nice ambience and reasonably priced.I had Google for the best Korean BQQ in Los Angeles and it actually lead me to the place next-door to this. But as soon as we walked in the waitress said just so you know it's not all you can eat. This place was practically empty only 3 Â people eating at a table. As soon as we open the menus we took a look at the prices it was $35 per person and It was not all you can eat.So we decided to leave and go to this place right next door which had people out side and was very lively and welcoming. The entire staff is very friendly and the food was incredible not to mention the price It was $17.99 Per person and it was all you can eat Including drinks. Not includeing the fact that the valet parking was only $2 dollars!I would definitely recommend this place to anybody.
6/10/2016,1 star rating,I give one star because they said they dont take reservation but suddenly 2 group of ppl cut in front of me.
2/20/2018,5 star rating,"Really really great Korean bbq spot! Valet parking, wait can get long, small place, but..... great food! I like the marble top instead of a regular cook top and they cook and cut the meat for you too so you don't have to worry. Definitely one of the best all you can eat bbq spots I've tried."
6/9/2018,5 star rating,My friends and I wanted All you can eat Korean BBQ and we found this place on yelp. Â You will not be disappointed. Â Great food and great service!!!
1/8/2014,4 star rating,"Love Hae Jang Chon! My husband and I would always try our best to visit Hae Jang Chon whenever we visit Los Angeles. Â The price per person for all you can eat is definitely awesome. Furthermore, they are not afraid to offer more side dishes to their customer =)You would think people need to get up to get their own food or cook their own food since it's ALL YOU CAN EAT but that's totally not the case. Â Their stuff often stop by to check if the customer would like to place more order or need more side dishes and meanwhile, they would assist on cleaning the BBQ grill and clean up the table. Â There is one down side .......... the waiting list can get ridiculous long. Â Last time we waited over an hour to get our table."
6/8/2016,5 star rating,"I had such an amazing time here, it was really busy, we have to put our names on the list and wait for about 20 minutes, totally worth it. I will come back again with a group of friends"
4/11/2018,5 star rating,"If there was an AYCE place I would recommend to anyone in LA, it would be this place. The price per person is reasonable, especially when they don't have a price ladder for certain types of meat (like Kalbi) with no restrictions on how much you can order. They use a stone grill where they clean it up regularly with daikon strips (don't eat it though). Their food quality is above par for an AYCE and service is absolutely fantastic. The wait is about an hour or so on a weekend, but that's better than most KBBQ places in K-town. Parking is not as bad either as other parts of K-town."
5/26/2013,5 star rating,"It'd been a long time since I've been back to K-Town for Korean BBQ. The drive just doesn't make it seem worth it, but we were up here for training and decided to try this popular joint for the first time. IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD. The meat quality was great, the staff was friendly, and the overall atmosphere was lively and fun. There was some misunderstanding regarding our reservation, but it ended up okay and we didn't, thankfully, have to wait TOO long since it was a Thursday night. However, it was constantly busy, and understandably so. When we asked for more rice paper, we were never offered a stingy amount, which is what happens in most places. Plus, their grills are so cool. Just watching them clean it was fun. Wouldn't hesitate to come back here for more meaty goodness. :D"
11/28/2012,5 star rating,"You, you little hidden gem you. Even with your long wait time, horrible parking situation around you and the cloud of cigarette smoke while the customers wait, you're worth it. The kimchi pancake was something out of this world and I couldn't believe I didn't visit this place sooner. It's not only the menu (great selections) or the quality meats they give you but the cherry on top is the service for this place. The waiter was very attentive and if we weren't aware of what we wanted, he always suggested something. The closer was the kimchi rice, not my thing but my friend devoured it. This place is my number one KBBQ to go to. If you're reading this and trying to figure out if the wait is worth it? SHUT THIS BROWSER AND GET TO THAT LINE NOW!"
9/6/2016,4 star rating,Food was good but you need to know what you were getting. Don't order rib. The rib has a big bone and not much meat that you can enjoy. The waiters could not explain their food much and you kind have to figure it out yourself.
10/10/2012,1 star rating,"!! ALERT COCKROACH ALERT !!I'm a very tolerant person and endure gross things accompanying my food. Hair in my food is the usual suspect but I'll just set it aside and continue on with my meal. I draw the line when the foreign object has LEGS!!!!!!!!!!! Are you serious?!Luckily, only 1 spoonful of soup was ingested before we discovered our creature of blackness swimming lifelessly in my meal.You have been warned. Do not eat the soup unless you consider roaches a delicacy like some countries.!! ALERT COCKROACH ALERT !!"
1/14/2015,4 star rating,My favorite ayce kbbq restaurant! The meat quality is good. Their brisket looks different every time you order it but still super delicious. Steam egg is also a bonus. The stone grill is cool. Service is quick and efficient. The only downside is the wait on the weekend is around an hour. Reservation is only for 8 people or more. Valet is $2 plus tip.
8/25/2015,5 star rating,Best Korean bbq I've been to so far! The customer service is amazing. I love that they frequently checked up on us and they practically cooked the meat for us. We really got to enjoy eating more than cooking. The meat was great especially the marinated ones
11/21/2015,4 star rating,Before all the ayce kbbq joints opened I would come here the most. Good meat but the best part is that they give you kimchi fried rice at the end. So good
8/13/2013,4 star rating,"One of my favorite KBBQ places. It would be five stars except for the part where you have to Valet in the parking lot. Because, apparently its KTown and valet parking is like the new thing to surcharge you with.that being said, seating was easy, meats were plentiful, the grill is in a cylindrical shape and as at a angle which allowed for oil to dry to the size easily versus your standard flat rectangular shape offerings you find in other place.And when it was done, they took our remaining items and fried it up in a rice that we could take home. So nothing was wasted.Definitely goin to go back and recommend this to others."
7/25/2016,5 star rating,"Always a line and for good reason that's worth the wait! Service is friendly. Rules are pretty much simple, eat eat eat! Lots of different flavors and options. Well worth taking advantage of the buffet price and all you can eat. It's good stuff!"
6/18/2015,5 star rating,"Alright fine, the wait is long, but the meat at the end of the tunnel shines bright. Â From the moment we walked in, the dinning room was a buzz with sizzling platters, laughing friends, loving families, and whispering lovers. The love of watching their meat cook has brought all these people together. From the spare rib to the octopus, these Koreans really know what they're doing. Â Once you take your seat around the grill, you can either take charge and cook the meats as a table, or sit back and let the servers sear it to perfection. Â Don't worry if you're inexperienced with the tongs, this place is open to all skill levels. Â We started small-- three meats for four people. Let me tell you, NOT ENOUGH. We quickly ordered at least six more meats (we lost count). Â Though I normally have a resting heart rate of 55-65bmp, The excitement of this place brought me up to a racing 86 by the time dinner was over. Â My heart is literally racing right now just thinking about it!!"
12/30/2013,4 star rating,"Went to this place at midnight to satisfy a Korean BBQ craving after driving 6 hours from the Bay Area. We ordered the all you can eat meal and got the bulgogi, short rib, spicy pork, and shrimp. The short rib was awesome. Wrap that bad boy up in rice paper slap on some kimchi and lettuce and you are set! Bulgogi was good too. Boyfriend loved the pork, and it ""warmed his belly"" whatever that means--note it was not pork belly. Tehehe Anyway. Great place to eat Korean BBQ. Cant take the meat with you but the smell will stay with you and tempt you to return.Also, last call for alcohol is 1 am and they take everything so drink up at 12:59"
2/11/2014,5 star rating,Once again this place doesn't disappoint! The wait is long but it's worth every minute! I was one happy gal! I honestly crave this place all the time!
12/31/2013,5 star rating,Amazing!!! We didn't have to cook our own meat! The waitress would do it for us! It was only two of us and we tried to finish everything !!! It was all sooo delicious!! I would come back again because the food was GREAT and the service was TERRIFIC !!! Amen to this place! Super friendly and courteous! Â  Â Good yum!!! BFF said so for life!!!!
2/11/2016,4 star rating,This is my go to Korean BBQ! All you can eat buffet. Â The service is great but you do have to wait a while especially of your going after 7pm! Â Last time we waited and 1.5 hours but it was a weekend! Â Best to stick to this during the weekdays and preferably before 7pm! They do not take bookings before hand. Â I think theres like 21 different types of meat and fish and you pay $22 per head. You can order as much and as many different meats as you wish but if you dont eat it all you will need to pay the extra ;) Which is fair enough! The brisket is my favourite but the only thing is the second time round of ordering more meat it always seems more fatty!!! The quality of the meat os ok but the sides are very good and its a good place to meet a few people.
8/30/2016,2 star rating,"Going to echo the concerns about reservations. The meat is of average quality. Took umbrage with the service, which was a bit lacking and rude. There are plenty better AYCE to spend your money at in K-Town. I'd advise looking around. Kogi King on Western Avenue is superior in my opinion."
12/29/2013,1 star rating,"I never been here. Yelped it and saw the 2AM closing and drove to the place. Got here at 1:05AM and was told they stop taking customers at 1AM. If that is the case, why is the hour until 2AM. Change it to 1AM!"
4/1/2016,5 star rating,"The best Korean BBQ out there. If you go after 5, plan to wait a while. I waited one Saturday night for 3 hours to get a table. But a great option is to put your name on the list, then go next door for drinks! But once you get inside, it's so worth the wait. Make sure you try bulgogi, brisket, and the short rib at least. They're amazing. Also the kimchi pancakes are delicious! Â The service is also stellar. I love this place. I go at least three times a month. Well worth the wait and the price!"
7/17/2016,5 star rating,"Great food and service. Â The restaurant is clean and has a good ambiance. Â The only problem is parking. Â It sucks!!! You gotta pay the valet $5 to park it. Â I know it's just $5, but I just hate paying for parking. Â Anyway, at least the prices of the food are very reasonable. Â Really good quality meat. Â Come hungry!!!"
8/9/2013,4 star rating,"Went in on a Saturday night around 11 pm, waited for a table for about 30 mins. Which wasn't bad considering the large amounts of people waiting outside when we got there. Food was great and great price for the AYCE... I just wish they had a little more things to choose from for that menu like Gyu-Kaku has....And the only thing I didn't like was that when we ordered the kimchi fried rice, they said they would only make it after we finished all of our meat... Its AYCE, just make the damn rice people!Other than that, it was good food and I would go back, but only if I was in the area."
10/12/2013,5 star rating,"Oh gosh I had fun here! Â I came here with a couple people on a Sunday around 7pm. Â We had to wait about an hour. Â You can't make a reservation. Â :( Â Parking sucks donkey around here, but there is street parking if you can find it. Â Since I can't parallel park to save my life, I valet my car. Â It's two bucks. Â The food and service here was really good. Â There are multiple waiters that bring you food quickly and even help you cook the food. Â The food itself was great! Â I love all the sauces that they give you to dip the meats in. Â At the end, they make you kimchi rice which was super spicy. Â I would have liked the rice in the beginning because I like eating meat w/ rice. Â Overall, I will come back. Â But, I'm going to try to come during an off-time in the future so I don't have to wait so long."
12/21/2015,3 star rating,It was okay. I was disappointed that they didn't have rice paper. Sides are just okay.
5/21/2018,1 star rating,"I ate here for the first time & won't be going back again. This is for the unpleasant attitude of the manager whom I did not get the name of. My friend & I were seated at a table for 6 people with only two of us. I'd changed my seat one over, same table to avoid the heavy smoke going into my face. The manager walked by stated that i am in her way, rudely pointed me to sit where she think I should sit. Soon after she came over to asked what my problem was when I had complained about her to the other staff. She had no intention to apologize for the humiliation she had caused me in front of nearby customers."
4/21/2017,5 star rating,"Me and my bf are patron to this KBBQ place whenever I'm in town! Their beef brisket, thin sliced canadian pork, and spicy pork are my personal favorites. I also love their soy sauce dip with radish and their side dishes like spicy tofu (? Not sure what it's called but it's bomb). Great food and great service! We drive 40+ minutes from his house everytime but it's worth it. We just came by again today and man we are sooo full."
4/25/2015,4 star rating,"Great service! Filled banchan automatically, quickly, and without us asking. The wait staff work as a team. Very effective and professional. They even help cook your meats so you can eat. Meat quality is quite good. The best AYCE korean bbq experience I have ever had.Wait was very long and agonizing. You park your car by valet and end up standing around till your name is called. If you go too far, you might miss your table. Be nice to host/hostess and they might seat you sooner. Shopping center stores next door close early on a Saturday night so nothing to look at."
3/22/2016,4 star rating,"First off I would just like to say that this place is one of the best KBBQ spots in LA. Meat quality is great and the service is on point. Price is worth it in my opinion and is around 23.99 for Dinner. The Kimchi Fried rice at the end of the meal is great, but there is one thing about this place that keeps it from getting 5 stars. 2 HOUR WAIT!"
1/28/2018,4 star rating,"Made a reservation for 11 people at 6:30, but didn't sit until closer to 7:30. The staff hustled to try to keep tables moving, but the place is fairly small and it was PACKED since it was Saturday...and I mean packed...like 20-30 people waiting outside. If we were in a smaller group (maybe 6 max), I think we actually would've had our reserved table on time. Oddly, I assumed that there would be existing tables for large parties and there really are not. There are 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate large groups, but it's probably best to limit your group to six if possible. Food was great, service was great. The side sauces were amazing. Basically, my reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is: long wait, no wine/hard alcohol and it was SO HOT inside (maybe it's just me, but I was boiling) with a serious lack of ventilation. You will smell when you leave, but you will also be full of delicious food!"
12/26/2012,5 star rating,"Pork belly and brisket. AMAZING here! Never had better anywhere else. Hae Jang Chon is my favorite Korean BBQ place in LA (granted that I haven't tried them all yet). They use a round stone grill, which is unique, and gives the meat a different flavor from the regular grills found at the other korean BBQ places. Banchan is tasty, though there are less dishes than what I am normally used to. We had a party of 4, and I noted they served two of every side dish (one was placed on either side of the table), which I appreciated since that meant I didn't have to reach across the table for some kimchi. They serve kimchi pancakes and an egg soup thing (no idea what it's called) along with your AYCE meal. Yum! They also serve kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal, but me and my friends forgot about it, and the waitress did not remind us they served it, so we left without it. SAD FACE. Service here is awesome! Especially when compared to other restaurants in the area. They were very prompt and very friendly, even though we were rather needy with our requests to refill our side dishes and meat and waters. Valet is $2 if you can't find parking elsewhere.I wish I didn't live so far away! Though my waistline is grateful for the distance..."
11/3/2013,5 star rating,"Amazing food with pork shoulder , beef tongue , short rib , octopus .... With 19.88 all u can eat ;) reasonable price !!! Must go aGain"
10/20/2012,2 star rating,"I am a huge fan of korean bbq, but this place was not good at all. wtf yelpers! I thought you'd help me out in a time of desperation!! wtf!!!!I wanted to give them a better rating because they had awesome customer service. but seriously guys. why the bland under marinated meats? ugh.... no bueno. even if it were 17.99 a person does not equate to a great deal. I only ventured here because the recommended korean spots were closed :( sorry, but this review will hopefully help an out of towner like myself."
5/15/2016,5 star rating,"This was a very good place to go to. The meats were actually fairly good cuts, the brisket was not mostly fat, their service was really good and at the very end they have a fried rice dish that they make you on the stone pan. I will say this though, we ended up waiting for almost 2 hours to just sit down on a friday night, so keep that in mind if you decide to go here."
5/22/2015,5 star rating,One of my favorite KBBQ places in LA. Mad authentic and not some foo foo KBBQ....if it's too expensive and its KBBQ I get confused. The service is also pretty damn good.
3/19/2017,1 star rating,"99.9% of the experience here is horrendous! We showed up, put our names on the list, and they gave our seats to some other group of people and told us some lame excuse about why the group was here before us. The hostess knew them and it looked like they knew each other. ANYWAY, besides all this mess, the second I sat down, my chopsticks were on actual FIRE! THEY WERE BURNING IN THE FIRE ON THE BBQ IN THE TABLE! I had to get them switched out. The food was not good. I highly recommend staying away from this establishment. They do have a lot of Yelp reviews and they pride themselves on being able to handle themselves, but you look around from the way that they manage themselves to the kinds of POS systems they're using to the archaic system they are using to seating their patron you can tell that the owners truly don't care. Thanks also very cheap and don't reinvest in the business. I noticed no security cameras and tables for 5-7 people taken up by 2 people. When you have cheap, inexperienced owners you can assume that the food is cheap as well. I might be getting sick very soon. This is the last time I'll ever come here and I'm not afraid to not look back."
3/3/2015,5 star rating,"Love this place! Came here around 12am, since our flight landed in LA around 11 and we had to pickup our rental car. We were happy this place was opened late and because it was late, we were seated within 15 minutes. Still a wait because this place is THAT popular, even at midnight! This place has a stone grill, which was cool and they cook the meat for you. Anytime my girlfriends or I tried to flip our meat or grab it for one another, someone would pop by right away to do it for us - which was good service, but interesting because we are so use to doing it ourselves at other kbbq spots. They didn't have many sides, which were fine because there's so much meats to eat instead. I loved the kalbi and brisket best, but everything was sooo flavorful and marinated to perfection. I usually like the beef brisket because it's quick to cook and not as heavy as the other options. Our AYCE came with the steamed egg, which could have been better. We also ordered Japanese red wine and soju, which came out to 37 each person including tips and tax. Not bad including alcohol and flavorful meat. Service was good too - definitely would love to return."
4/4/2013,4 star rating,Is there a slow-down button on this all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ eating thing-y? #emotional
6/25/2018,5 star rating,This is probably one of my favorite Korean bbq places. the service is always great although the wait time can be a little long but definitely worth it. Â Their kimchi pancakes are the bests!! many options on the menu & beer.
5/11/2016,5 star rating,"Went here on a recommendation of my Korean friend from high school while visiting la. Did not disappoint at all. Everyone was super attentive, place was busy but it was organized chaos. Got seated after 30 min but well worth wait. Not used to the valet being from south Florida but will be back again for sure next time I'm in la. It beats all the Korean joints here"
4/6/2013,5 star rating,"All I can say is that I've had an amazing experience at this restaurant and I will definitely be back and recommend anyone who wants to have korean BBQ give this place a go.The All You Can Eat (AYCE) is about $20 per person if you factor in a soda. Parking is $3 I think, they have a valet service once you arrive, they park and retrieve your car for you.ADVICE: Arrive from 5-6 PM if you want a chance of getting in without a long wait.ADVICE: Avoid the seat in the corner because the sun will blind you and you will not be able to see or enjoy your food with the sun in your eyes! Ask for a different table or wait longer if they attempt to seat you there. Not sure why they don't install some curtains or blinds there, seems like an easy fix.ADVICE: They only have 1 male bathroom and 1 female bathroom which can lead to long wait times.We arrived at a little after 5 and we were quickly seated after a 5 min wait. At first they offered us the seat in the corner but I noticed the sun was in the way and would only get worse as it sets to the point where we wouldn't be able to see so I asked for another table which we were promptly relocated to.The service was good and we received the food we ordered quickly and they helped us grill it sometimes and also occasionally came by to clean the pan. However, as the restaurant became more crowded later on from about 6PM onwards, the service became a little slower and we had to remind the server sometimes and they got our order wrong at times. Understandable as it's a very popular place to eat and the servers were doing the best they can.The food quality was very good. All the meats were properly marinated and also very fresh. We tried everything and the favorites were Briskets, pork belly, chicken, and bulgogi. The sides were also very well made. DEFINITELY try the Kim Chi Pancake and ask for extra of their spicy sauce because they go so well together and what makes this place unique. Also at the end ABSOLUTELY make sure to ask them to make the Kim Chi Fried Rice for you because it's absurdly good and absolutely delicious.This place is open until 2AM which is good because by the time we were done, there was a healthy line out the door which I would estimate wait time to be at least 1 hour to maybe even 2 hours (Gasp!). I would definitely recommend anyone to try this place if they have never had Korean BBQ or if anyone wants to try korean BBQ for their first time. Nothing is better than a positive first impression."
4/6/2015,5 star rating,"This place is phenomenal. Best korean BBQ for the price. I love that not only do you get unlimited meat but they also have kimchi fried rice, dwen jang ji gae, pae jon, etc. love this place. Worth the long wait times. I lived in Busan, South Korea for a year in my early twenties so I can definitely say that this place is legit. It is also very non-Korean friendly. I think a lot of places in Korea town can be intimidating to westerners because all the signs are in Korean only but this place has English and Korean. Plus the quality of of the meat is spectacular for the price. I really don't know how they make money on it. Pro tip- don't leave uneaten meat on the grill. They'll charge you extra for that. I think it's $15. I'd also pay the $5 extra for the lettuce leaves. What I like to do, is you take the lettuce leaves put the bean paste (dwen hang on the leaf) then add grilled meat, garlic and grilled kimchi on the leaf. Then wrap it up into a compact ball with the leaf and pop that sucker in your mouth. Â The flavors are out of this world. Only way to really do Korean BBQ. So good."
3/15/2013,5 star rating,"Other than the fact that I had to wait for like 1 hour...This place is amazing. Maybe because I come from Columbus Ohio. But, still then selection of foods were great and service was awesome too. All the waiters kept on checking on our table to make sure we were doing good and asked us if we needed anything. Food tasted awesome! Pretty good price for K BBQ buffet! - what more can I say?"
8/7/2016,5 star rating,"BEST Korean I've had. If you go at night, especially on a weekend, you WILL wait. Sometimes up to two hours. It's definitely worth the wait."
12/6/2015,5 star rating,Love! The quality of their meats is excellent and their service is so quick and very attentive. Must stop every time we're down in LA.
1/18/2016,4 star rating,"Been coming to this place for over 10 years. They have remodeled the place 2 or 3 times since then. I probably have over 5 pictures on the wall during birthday parties with friends and family. Typical Korean BBQ, long wait but totally worth it for the price you pay. Don't forget to order the baby octopus, and beef tongue!"
8/24/2013,3 star rating,"Meh.... Nothing extravagant. A common kbbq, but i guess heir star has shined.Definitely Â not worth the wait!"
9/15/2012,2 star rating,"I can say that Hae Jang Chon is a popular place, but I am not sure as to why it is, compared to many other delicious KBBQ spots.First of all, the wait is ridiculous. Reservations are recommended, however they can't guarantee you will be sat on time, and if your entire group is not present at reservation check in time, you will not be seated, which will delay your meal time additionally. Secondly, the service is average. I can't stand average service. Especially when I am spending $18 for an ""all you can eat"" meal and drinking alcohol as well.Thirdly, if your child is over the age of nine you will pay $18 for their meal. This was surprising to me because my eleven year old daughter eats about a quarter of what my boyfriend or myself consume. A reasonable kids pricing should be implemented.Fourthly, I hate wasting food. Especially food I paid for. At the end of our meal the server came to the table and made Kimchi fried rice which we were all too stuffed to eat. I asked the server for a to-go box for the rice since I thought it would be good to have with eggs the next morning. She would not allow me to take it because they do not allow leftovers to be taken home. LAME.I probably won't ever return here because so far Yang San Bak is in my opinion, THE BEST Korean BBQ in Ktown. Â Best service, pricing, ambiance, and of course, FOOD!"
10/22/2013,4 star rating,"I can't even count how many times I've been here but I used to live within 5-minutes walking distance of Hae Jang Chon so yeah... enough said :)One of my friends insists on celebrating his birthday here every year. Last year, I requested ""Gangnam Style"" instead of the obligatory birthday song and they happily obliged. The birthday boy did his gangnam style dance and it was pretty funny.... one of his friends videotaped it so it's floating somewhere out there on Youtube, hehehee.Parking is $2 with validation (valet only), or you can park on 6th St. after 7 pm. There's usually plenty of parking as long as you're willing to walk 3-4 short blocks. As for the meats, I usually get the bulgogi, brisket, short ribs, tongue, and squid. No matter how I try, I never leave enough space for the kimchi fried rice at the end but I manage to stuff it in somehow :)"

3/4/2015,5 star rating,"This place is known to be the best in KTown for a reason. Not only do they have the most efficient Valet service, everything inside the restaurant is wonderful. They take care of you well, the food is always delicious, and you can be a fat pig without feeling out of place. Its spacious yet cozy, load yet comfortable. Fun spot, understandable prices, and you can't go wrong."
10/10/2012,4 star rating,"Our table was laid out with a plethora (bonus points if you remember the movie that term is in) of side dishes, place setting, and menus before we were seated! That's a freakin' fantastic set up you got there. The sides are all good. Kimchee's pretty spicy. Usually it's not spicy enough. All-you-can eat for $17.99. They have a lot of meats and seafood to choose from. Choose four at a time. They will also bring out soup, egg in hot pot, and the Korean pancake! My favorite. I had to ask 3 times to make sure they didn't forget these. We told them not to bring out the fried rice. Too much food. We ordered 2 side rices at the start of the meal.The place is cook your own, but the servers are attentive and stop by half the time to cook the meat, cut it and serve you so it doesn't burn and you can keep things moving. You can't take leftovers home, which I assume is to deter people from over ordering, so don't make your eyes bigger than your stomach. You'll waste so much food. You kind of smell afterward, but what Korean restaurant don't you smell like post meal?! They give you a little dum-dum lollipop with the check. Cute.Parking: Lot or street. Kind of busy locale."
2/26/2013,2 star rating,Next time I'll pay a little more and go to oo-kook or even go to a non-AYCE.i should've known better. I walked in and saw no Korean customers. Brisket had too much fat. All the other meats I ate were tough. Didn't enjoy this meal at all.
8/30/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing, low prices for the all you can eat and they kept them coming! Â The service was also on point always asking if you needed anything not just from your assigned waiter but any worker passing by"
3/6/2014,4 star rating,This place totally rocks. But be prepared to wait. There's always a line! They grill on a stone slab which seems to cook better than the other stainless steel grills. Their meats are always fresh and delicious. I love trying out the different meats you don't usually get at other AYCE BBQs.
1/13/2017,5 star rating,"Passed by it three times and always saw a lot of people there and have been wanting to try! When I finally went there, my friends have arrived first and were already seated, and I was a bit late. Just when I thought they were going to say no +1s, they kindly seated me and gave me utensils! We ordered a lot of beef tongue and shrimp as it is our favorite and ate for 2+ hours. Throughout the whole time, the waitresses were patient and didn't kick us out even when we sat longer than 1.5 hours, and constantly asked if we wanted more food! Finally, they serve a kimchi fried rice after the meal to which we asked to have the kimchi removed because we do not eat spicy. Although the request was weird they were nice and added other vegetables to make the fried rice taste good instead of telling us no can't do. Really great service, nice attitudes and great food. Would definitely come back for the amazing shrimp and beef tongue."
6/4/2013,3 star rating,"I think it was a Friday night when I went to this BBQ joint...to say...there was a long wait (as expected). I believe I waited about one hour (I literally walked around the area and came back and still had to wait). My boyfriend and I came here because the reviews were pretty outstanding and I understood why.Food was good! I really liked the meat, side dishes, and how they make their kimchi fried rice I think! My boyfriend can't handle spice so the rice was a no for him, but the meat was edible and good to me.The reason I am giving this a 3 stars are for the following reasons:- Music can be way too loud!! I literally had to raise my voice (almost yell) to my boyfriend to even communicate with them - boyfriend was sitting next to me too haha. - It looks a little dirty (the floor felt greasy). - We had to ask to waiter when our food is coming when we are right next to the kitchen, and he had to ask us what we ordered again because the order could have gotten ""lost""."
2/3/2015,4 star rating,"Worth the $22+ per person. I loved their food so much. But I didn't appreciate the servers. It was our first time at this place and the waiters weren't helpful. They were always in a rush. Some servers were okay. We were just unlucky to get that server who was doing things so hurriedly that she accidentally flung a piece of hot piping meat on my leg. She just said ""Are you okay?"". Her apology came 5 minutes later. I turned cold to her after that, and lo and behold, she became very attentive to our table. Anyway, we came for the food, and the selection is awesome."
9/22/2012,1 star rating,Rude manager and hostess. Lost my business. Will no longer recommend this place as I have done many times to many people.I drove all the way out from the westside around midnight and could not be sat as one person (my other friend couldn't make it out) despite many empty tables and having been a good customer in the past. Their price is great for all the decent food you get. But I never support businesses with rude management/owners.
4/21/2016,4 star rating,Worth the wait!! Love the pork Belly! Amazing service!! What else could I possibly ask for. Totally recommend the place
10/14/2012,3 star rating,"I've passed by this place before but didn't get a chance to eat here because the line was so long and we were starving. My boyfriend and I came by again after hiking in LA and was pleased to find that the line wasn't long. The big difference between this KBBQ joint and others is the fact they don't use a metal grill. They use a really hot, round stone that cooks the meat really quickly. I have no complaints about the meat quality itself but it also wasn't anything special. The side dishes were really below average for me. Everything tasted like it's been fermenting or been soaked in vinegar for way too long. So not good. My biggest gripe with this place is the HORRIBLE service. Â Our server didn't even smile or even bother talking to us really. I always had to chase down any waiter that was wandering around to get something. On top of that, the service was really slow too so it left A LOT to be desired. I don't think I'll be back since there are so many other good KBBQ restaurants in the area. 3/5"
2/21/2018,5 star rating,"Beef tongue, beef brisket are the best! Together with excellent service. Worth every bite"
2/20/2016,5 star rating,"Other than the long wait (sometimes up to 3 hours) this AYCE KBBQ joint is the best! The meats are great, the banchan is fantastic and the staff are extremely friendly. My favorite place for Korean BBQ in Los Angeles."
2/19/2016,4 star rating,"this is exactly the kind of place you wanna go to for all you can eat Korean bbq! is the decor cool? nobut is the meat and sides delicious? yes! the wait is always horrendous , we usually put our name down then go next door for a couple of drinks , get a real appetite up then come back and stuff ourselves with meat! our favourites-the marinated short rib is fantastic!the beef bulgogi is perfect, not too sweet.the spicy pork is crazy tasty- perfectly spicy., has a great kick to it.get the kim chi pancakes! get 2 of them and put them on the grill to crunch up.all of the sauces and sides are amazing , and they give you salad too . the service here is great , the servers are always friendly , very attentive, they come around and cook the food for you which is nice ."
3/13/2013,5 star rating,"I would give this place 6 stars if I could, despite what others might have said, this place is like heaven to me. Best ACYE BBQ place in town in terms of service, quality, and environment. All the waitress/waiters are very attentive and nice, the banchans are delicious, meat quality is pretty good as well. Although some people might complaint about the wait, but I definitely think it's worth it! There is only a wait for a restaurant if that restaurant is popular...and it's popular for a reason! In love with this place and the people working there!"
7/18/2016,5 star rating,"Been here once before with the guys, it was whatever. Came again tonight with the family it was great some servers were a little off but S/O my boy Steve handling business he rocked! The wait is for sure worth it ktown staple!"
4/22/2013,2 star rating,"For a first timer...i guess i don't get the whole Korean BBQ thing. Not really a fan of Kimchee, so the kimchee rice wasn't as big a deal as all the yelpers say it is. And for the most part the staff were friendly but if you have the misfortune to come in contact with Jay, he's a total douche. Kept rushing us and making big hand gestures to the other staff because we weren't moving to his pace. We waited an hour and a half to be seated i should have the luxury to eat at my own pace.The chicken was pretty good and the squid was very flavorful but everything else was pretty unremarkable. BTW its all beef, pork and dark meat and they cook it all together so if that doesn't really bother you, you'll probably be alright. On a Saturday night, there was a long line and when i asked people who were coming out how it was each one of them said OK, but this was my first time. I came here because the great reviews on yelp...so i think its safe to say it's probably all hype and I doubt I'd be coming back"
4/15/2014,5 star rating,"I was searching for a great k bbq on yelp and found this, It was really great! It's my first time having stone grill, although I'm not too sure what's the difference haha, but it's a new experience and they have a good selection of meat and side dishes! My favorite is the thin sliced pork belly and the brisket ! Too bad I'm from North Cal :( I wished I could come here once a week"
12/25/2015,5 star rating,"We just ate at this place, drove from the valley and decide to stop here. it's Christmas Day or they are always busy, but we waited about 30 minutes to be seated. I suggest maybe call them and ask for the wait time. Food was great, service was fast, ppl were nice and the place was clean, for me that's good enough for 5star."
4/11/2016,5 star rating,"Great service, great food, great price! Came here on a Saturday around 340 pm after bouldering and found street parking down the street. We waited about 40-50Min which is pretty average. They had great little side dishes and RICE PAPER! Yay. You're allowed to order 3 meats at a time and they have a good variety for the price. You can also get kimchi pancake and steamed eggs but have to choose between white rice or kimchi fried rice. If you choose kimchi fried rice, it'll come at the end, IF you finish your meats. The waiters helped cook the meats when they brought it instead of just leaving it on the table. I liked how we had the option to choose between thin or thick slices of pork belly. It's also really cool how they clean the stone grill for you in between meats. Overall, probably one of the best Korean bbq places I've been to in SoCal. I'd definitely come back if I were in the area."
11/10/2013,5 star rating,"would've -1 star because of the parking, they have valet parking at the lot which would've been nice if the service was efficient but it was a hot mess, one guy even begged the attendant: ""I JUST WANT MY CAR KEYS"" HAHAHBut I enjoyed my meal here. Lots of choices but you have to finish what you order, otherwise they're going to charge you extra. The servers were nice and our main server was very helpful and considerate. We wanted to try the octopus but we only wanted half of it, but they gave us the whole thing, and he said it's okay if we don't finish the whole thing.Will go back when I'm in town."
2/17/2015,5 star rating,One of the best Korean BBQ spots in KTown. Order the raspberry wine with your group and have a blast. The staff is friendly and everything is pretty do-it-yourself. The kimchi fried rice we had at the end was fantastic! A must have.
7/12/2014,1 star rating,"I'm obsessed with Korean food and was craving it while on vacation in LA, so I decided to give you guys a try. I had a couple friends with me and it was their FIRST time going to a Korean restaurant where you get to cook your own food. I honestly DON'T know if they'll ever do it again because the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress (who spoke English just fine) was rude, condescending and impatient. Whenever we asked for something, like, oh, I don't know- WATER she'd cut us off and get it begrudgingly.There was also a male waiter who used strong profanity while TALKING TO US. He wasn't cursing AT US, but for him to do it at all, while speaking with customers was shocking and highly unprofessional! All of our side dishes were already waiting for us when we first got to our table, but the waiters didn't bring us our bowls of rice until we realized we didn't have any HALFWAY through the meal and ASKED them for some. Oh, and our waitress brought those out begrudgingly as well and NEVER apologized.Oh, and the little metal thing they usually put under the grill to catch the oil almost over-flowed and spilled all over our table, because no one bothered to change it out.All of this horrible service really overshadowed the taste of the food, which was pretty decent.Fortunately, I've been to a lot of Korean restaurants so I know that the service is usually good, but this experience at Hae Jang Chon left my friends with a terrible first impression.I will not be returning and I will not be recommending you guys. Hire competent and friendly people at your LA Koreatown restaurant, please. Thanks."
6/1/2018,5 star rating,This is probably the best Korean BBQ I've been to. Very good quality meat with a marble grill and I give it a 9 out of 10 on their service. They come to your table and cook your meat for you! I'm pretty happy with everything I ordered. My husband and I will definitely come back!
4/9/2018,5 star rating,"I can't get enough of the beef bulgogi. The cut, the marinade it's all so perfect. Don't eat here unless you're prepared to never enjoy KBBQ anywhere else again. The wait is about 2 hours on weekend nights Â but well worth it."
11/7/2015,4 star rating,"I like their selections -- word to the wise, call to make reservations only if you're sure that your whole party can get there on time. During dinner rush, they can get stingy with the meat, but it's understandable. Overall pretty great place!"
5/30/2016,4 star rating,"Amazing food, if you are looking for some great Korean food, this is the place! We tried all the meat and they do not disappoint! They do come often do you can put your next order in :)"
7/8/2018,5 star rating,We waited over an hour for a table and it was definitely worth it. Incredible quality food and service. Best Korean BBQ I've ever had. 10/10
3/3/2013,4 star rating,"Each time I picked up my chopsticks to turn the meat over on the grill, a waiter would rush over to do it for me-- I didn't really get the chance to do it myself! So 5 stars for their service.My bf and I competed to see who would eat more (I won, of course) so we tried almost all the meats on the AYCE menu. Favorites were the bulgogi and octopus... delish! The kimchi pancake was tasty as well. Their other meats didn't quite leave an impression on me (although I scarfed them down indiscriminately anyway...)Friday night wait time ~20min, found street parking a block away."
5/28/2016,5 star rating,"Wonderful! We ate there for a birthday and were very happy! Â The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was awesome, the meat was juicy and incredibly tasty. I would highly recommend to make a reservation if you don't want to wait around forever!"
4/5/2018,4 star rating,"The bae was in town and he's never had Korean BBQ before! My only experiences with it have been in Flushing, Queens, NY where it is bomb!! but I had to try it out in L.A. since it's a thing here. I searched and searched through reviews on Yelp to decide on a place that was worth the wait and alas I found Hae Jang Chon. We came at 11pm on a Friday knowing damn well there would be a wait but still wasnt expecting to wait 2 hours especially since they close at 2. I was nervous I wouldn't have enough time to eat aka savor my food. After waiting for a little bit at a hookah spot up the block we came back to wait even more. They do frequent head counts to see who is still there after putting yourself on the list, so if you're planning on waiting elsewhere I would stay close and check in frequently so you dont get skipped! Finally we were seated and I was ready to order! They dont limit you on how much you can order at a time and they also have different options besides meat, like kimchi pancake, rice, mushrooms, Â miso soup, etc that are also unlimited. We enjoyed the thin Canadian bacon, beef brisket, unmarinated and marinated short rib, bulgogi, and spicy beef. All were delicious, good quality meat, and they do a great job of cooking the meat for you. Service was on point! Order your favorite meat last and then have the cook the kimchi fried rice with that... soooooo good. The bae tapped out pretty early, but the food was so yum, I could've eaten for days. Definitely worth the few extra dollars compared to other places for the quality. The wait is fine if you prepare for it and there's is 2$ valet parking!"
3/24/2013,5 star rating,"I've been to this place many times and it never disappoints. Well the only thing being telling myself not to over-stuff. Anyways, my friends and I've dubbed the name of this place as 'the piggy place' because of the sign. I think it's pretty cute and way better than us trying and butchering the name. It's $17 for ayce and though it may seem pricey, the options and quality of meat are worth it. I love love the beef tongue. I actually have never been able to try everything on the menu because I get too stuffed by the time I want to. The thing here that is different from other kbbq places is how they give you kim chi pancake, which is pretty good. The kim chi fried rice is even better! Even when I've filled myself with meat, I can't seem to resist not eating the rice. How they clean the grill is just so cool! It never ceases to amaze me how the radish can clean off all the burnt gunk. And the waiters do it with so much grace, haha. OH, and the sides! Ohmy, they have potato salad and the put apples in it. APPLES! WHAT. IT'S GENIUS, GENIUS I TELL YOU. so good and fresh and with a bite and the chomp noise, food makes life so great.Pros: So much variety! & great quality. On top of the ayce meat, you get steamed egg, kim chi pancake, and kim chi fried rice. Valet parking for $2, this is really good considering finding parking in ktown is such a drag. Cons: Small place = few tables + lots of customers = LONG WAIT. I would not come here with a group of 6+.This is one of the top on my list of kbbq places to take my friends who visit to."
9/20/2013,4 star rating,"Okay, I have to admit that I first chose this place among others based on their cute pig logo, but I'm glad that this place did not failed me on my decision. The first two times when I was here, everything was good and perfect, whereas my third time, the service was a bit lacking. The price is affordable, but parking can be hard. It's easier to circle into the neighborhood than to wait for the parking lot.Anyhow, the meat here look really good. The waitresses are nice and they always bring more when asked. But you only get to get three kinds each time until you're done with them. Try everything! And save room for the kimchee fried rice at the end! The waitress will take the remaining grease on the grill and stirfry some for you!"
1/2/2015,5 star rating,"Best banchan around, served upon seating (practically). The stone grill is definitely a nice touch and the servers were very efficient. All of the meat was juicy, flavorful, tasty...my personal favorite was the kalbi. $24 per person, and in terms of quality kbbq for paying that much, this beats out all the other spots in town by a landslide - including non-AYCE spots too."
2/1/2016,4 star rating,Good ayce setup. Nice that they clean the grill after going through different types of meat. Lots of food with the kimchi fried rice at the end. Good selection of banchan and takes reservations of 6 or more.
7/22/2014,5 star rating,"Had a super late dinner today with a couple of my friends . Thank god this place stays open late ! Every time I come here the service is great , not once have I been disappointed by the customer service. The meats/chicken is always delicious. The price for everything is super reasonable ! The one down side to the consumer is that this place is extremely popular and does get busy. So sometimes you need to prep for the wait. Also there is only valet parking, so if you don't trust valet you will have to find parking on the street."

5/18/2018,1 star rating,"Friends recommended this. We arrived at 7 and was told the wait is 1 hour. 1 hr and 30 minutes later we checked, they told us another 30 mins. We asked to give us a better estimate, the guy said again 30 or more minutes. We looked at the sign on waiting list, there were still at least 8 or 9 parties ahead of us. When we first checked in there was 15 parties ahead of us. We asked the guy if it's gonna be another 1 hour at least then we could wait. He accused us not trusting what he said. We wasted 3 hours."

6/24/2014,2 star rating,"Went here recently with my wife. We've always heard great things about - from the reasonable price to the amazing service - we were excited to try it out. What a letdown. Don't get me wrong, the food was great. The brisket had just the right amount of fat, the marinated galbi was tasty and the pork belly was delicious. But was it worth the two hour wait? Not in the least. My wife said it best, ""I mean its good but not two hours good."" Waiting just inside the door (on the bench) I was able to see how this place operates. The sign on the wall says something like, ""eight or more is recommended for reservation."" This is total bullshit. I saw groups of 10 or more and they still had to wait for 30 mins. Â When I told the non-English speaking host that it was just the two of us, he said, ""What? Only two?"" What? I need four or more to eat here? He made me feel like they would rather have a four or six top at a table instead of putting two people at the same sized table? Horseshit. Everyone is saying how awesome the service is. Sure they're good. They're fast and responsive but don't confuse that with them trying to hurry you out of the restaurant so they can reset the table. I never heard the words, ""Here is your check, take your time."" I normally plow through my KBBQ. Tonight, I took my sweet ass time.There are so many other places to enjoy All-U-Can-Eat in K-Town. This is not the end all, be all place. Oo-Kook is ten times better than this place. Go there instead."
1/23/2018,5 star rating,"Well worth the hour and half wait, the meat was delish, great price and the kimchi fried rice at the end was the perfect cherry on top to end the experience. I left full, smelling like meat and not upset with the bill. Â Will def visit again."
12/4/2013,2 star rating,"I brought my friend from Korea here because this place had high ratings. However she and I (& other friends) were left unsatisfied and unfull. Â  Reasons for my rating:They had a lot of dipping sauces but they didn't stand out compared to other KBBQs. Â Their rice paper which my friends and I look forward to was very hard. I had to grill it which wasn't a fun process either. Â They had a lot of meat options but each option lacked flavor. I usually love steamed eggs but this one wasn't impressive. On the menu, I didn't see nor go the change to order Galbi or Bulgogi. So I wondered if it was only available for dinner but didn't get to ask. They had a lot of side dishes which is great bu again lacked flavor except for the fried fish paste.It was $18.99 for lunch per person which is fine but I saw signs that said $16.99 so that was questionableService was expected for a Korean BBQ place. Nothing positively exciting and nothing to really complain about. However my Korean friend did tell me she thought the waiters were not very friendly.The parking is a $2 valet parking for lunch (they told me $3 for dinner time). However we parked the car ourselves and only had to pay if the parking attendant was there when we left. So that was interesting."

3/5/2013,2 star rating,"What happened???This used to be our group's ""go-to"" place for BBQ. All you can eat, great variety, good sides, excellent complimentary pancake, tasty marinades, dipping sauces, and radish wraps, and complimentary kimchi fried rice at the end. It was soooo good!But we went back last week with a big group, and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. The meats were cut poorly, and there was no flavor in the ""marinated"" meats. They also forgot to cook our fried rice. We wondered if they changed ownership or kitchen staff, because this was definitely not up to its standard in the past.The sides were still good, and the service was friendly and reasonably quick, though. Also, the octopus was very tender.We have such a history with this place that I *will* return and see if the other night was a fluke (and I'll update accordingly) ... but if you're making a one-stop shop for the best Korean BBQ, for now you might want to look elsewhere."
9/28/2012,2 star rating,Galbi wasn't very tasty. Â Pork shoulder and tongue were good. Â The banchan was pretty good.The grills don't get hot enough so its like you're boiling all your meat. Â I think there are many other better places to go to. Â Service was quite good here though.
3/26/2013,5 star rating,One of the best Korean BBQ places I've tried. This place gets super packed so its just a matter of luck getting there at the right time. And they only take reservations for parties that are 6 or more. You really can't beat the price of $16.99 for all you can eat and there's a good variety of things to choose from. The staff was very friendly and tended to us although its always busy every time I go there.
3/17/2018,1 star rating,Great food but the hostess at the front is beyond rude. She picks up the phone in the middle of you speaking to her and almost made our entire party leave because dealing with her was so frustrating. Would come back but won't now because of her horrible customer service!
1/18/2016,5 star rating,"Best Korean All You Can Eat (AYCE) BBQ place in Korea town. My husband and I always come here when guests or clients are in town and everyone who has experienced their food leave super happy. We always get the ayce. The BBQ is always tender and deliciously marinated (not too sweet and not too salty, really well balanced) and they have seafood on the menu! Â It's fresh, the meat is high in quality, the banchan and kimchi is very good; basically, you won't be disappointed. Be aware of long lines here so try getting here before or after the rush."
8/5/2015,2 star rating,"My husband and I have been here before, but it had been about 3-4 years since we have because we moved away from LA and then back recently. We ended up here for dinner around 7pm on a Tuesday night after we found out our usual KBBQ spot was closed on Tuesdays (Choi gae nae). We remembered their kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal was good so we decided to try it out again. This place is not the way we remembered it at all... the service really disappointed me. The meat quality is pretty good, but I don't think it's worth the price. It's $21.99 per person pre tax. You have a pretty wide selection of meats and it comes with dang jang ji gae (soy bean paste soup), steamed egg, kimchi pancake, and your usual banchan (side dishes). My hubby always wants some soju with his meat and I was shocked to see it was $13!! (our usual spot is ~$6-7 per bottle).Service: We got seated after about a 45 minute wait. Once we sat, we waited a good 10 minutes without anyone coming to take our order so we rang the service bell, and no one came for another good 5 minutes. I was kind of giving a stare around the restaurant trying to flag a waiter down. Finally when someone came, she brought over someone else's order of steamed egg and kimchi pancake. She saw the look of confusion on our faces, went and talked to another waiter, and then came back for what she dropped off and took to to a neighboring table (to her luck, we did not touch them before she took them away). We waited another 5 minutes for someone to take our order. We ordered beef tongue and thinly sliced pork belly. After a good 15 minutes, we get our meat, but to our surprise, the meat didn't look like tongue so we asked what it was and she said brisket. We told her we didn't order that and she had a look of annoyance and took back the meat. 10 minutes later, no beef tongue to be seen, so we ask a different waiter who came by to see if he could check on our beef tongue order. He came back a couple minutes with the meat. Food: the thinly sliced pork belly was actually pretty tasty. I am not a big fan of pork, but it didn't taste the way that the thick slices do so I really enjoyed it. The lettuce salad had wayyy too much of the dressing so I actually choked on the vinegary sauce eating it. I do like that they have the sliced radishes in addition to the rice cake slices to wrap the meat in. When we actually got our beef tongue, it was definitely leaner than our usual spot, so definitely had a higher quality of meat. By the time it was time to ask for the kimchi fried rice, I was so annoyed that I just wanted to go home so we passed on it, but I believe that it is what makes them stand out from other kbbq spots.Overall, I don't think that this place was worth the wait or crappy service. I'm usually not a big person on ambience, but the music was blasted so loud I felt like I was screaming to talk to my husband during the meal and couldn't hear what he was saying half the time. There was only 1 waiter that was actually attentive and quick. I must say that this place is not what it used to be. I don't know if the owners changed or what, but definitely am not going to be wanting to come back here again. Long live Choi gae nae! :)"
12/7/2012,5 star rating,"This is probably the best AYCE kbbq that I've been to EVER. Â Haha maybe. Â I actually don't remember every single AYCE kbbq that I've ever been too but Hae Jang Chon is definitely up there.We had a large party with a reservation. Â Nice right? Â We can make reservations. Â Unfortunately a member of our group was lagging a bit...maybe more than half an hour late. Â They were super nice about it and tried to hold our table as long as possible. Â In the end they ended up seating us anyway with our last member just a couple of minutes away.First of all, the quality of the food is so good. Â Of course it's not going to be as good as my other favorite, Kang Hodong Baekjeong, but what do you expect? Â This is AYCE and the quality of the meat is pretty darn good if you ask me. Â Plenty of ban chan and they also have free rice paper! Â WOOHOO! Â At the very end they also serve you a tofu soup which was super yummy and kimchi fried rice which they make on your grill right in front of you. Â The grill is actually like a large stone plate...which leads me to my favorite part of the night...the cleaning of the stone plate. Â It's so cool! Â They take cut of daikon and scrub it! Â  That's so resourceful instead of changing out those metal plates constantly.Lastly, as I alluded to before, their service is super friendly. Â All of the servers look like korean mothers and they were all as nice as the korean mothers I know. Â I'm just glad we had someone who spoke korean sitting at our table. Â It definitely helps (:"
11/25/2013,4 star rating,"For the price this all you can eat Korean BBQ buffet is pretty damn good (at least for this New Yorker comparing NYC Korean BBQ buffets). Â The cuts of meats and preparation are excellent. Â Definately make sure you try the thin and thick cut pork belly and beef.We arrived on a Tuesday night for dinner and there was no wait. Â Got a table rather quickly. Â We also found street parking right in front of the shopping strip right away - rather than go into the parking lot which they convert to valet parking for dinner hours. Â Kinda a bogus set up in my book. Â But the restaurant, service, and food were excellent considering it is a all you can eat buffet type dinner."
8/30/2015,4 star rating,"This place usually has an hour wait even if you get there at 10pm at night. Its seriously that popular. The place is good and it has amazing customer service as the waiters are always helping you cook your food (probably wanting you to get out of there as soon as possible, but you never feel rushed). The best part is at the end"
3/9/2016,5 star rating,"Hae Jang is the best AYCE in LA. They have amazing sides and the service is always good (maybe a little pushy sometimes). For the price I think it's the best you can get in K town without going for not all you can eat.They do have the best beef tongue out of anywhere I have tried, it's sliced really thinly. Brisket is the dependable and always delicious.Don't expect to be seated right away at night. Go to the place next door and have some drinks and wait, it's worth it!"
1/11/2014,5 star rating,"5 stars! I have this review helps :)Wait time: We checked in around 6:15 PM. We waited for about 1.5 hours. (Trust me, it's worth the wait) You ahead of time to reserve your table.Food: The meats are very tasty! I think it has something to do with the stone grill they use. Side dishes are very tasty too!Service: The servers are very attentive and friendly.Price: It's $18.99 per person. Are there cheaper ones? Yes. Is it comparable? Big fat No. Parking: Valet is $2. Street parking's also available.I will definitely come back here. I've been to quite a few AYCE kbbq restaurants and I have to say this is one of the best!"
3/26/2013,5 star rating,"All you can eat korean bbq for $17....You simply can't beat that. Food is also pretty amazing...Add the helpful and friendly staff, the $2 valet parking, and it only gets better. The only thing to look out for is to come with reservations made! This place is jam-packed and even if you do come with a reservations, be sure to have everyone arrive on time! Because once you miss the reservation, they can't guarantee your tables anymore! So far, one of my top spots in LA for KBBQ! Highly recommended!"
3/9/2014,5 star rating,K-town Los Angeles is the main area for Korean BBQ and amongs all of the very top most authentic this place Hae Jang Chon ranks at first place on my list simply because of their high quality unlimited all you can eat meats!! You around 22-25$ out of the door per person including everything!
3/8/2016,3 star rating,"Mixed Feelings about this place. Â My first experience of Korean BBQ. Â We only got Beef and Pork meats. Â I wanted to try chicken, but the party I was with advised against ordering chicken meats from these sort of places.The pork they ordered was nothing but fat... only a tiny piece at the end was meat, which is the only part I ate.The shortrib meat was good. The brisket, which i thought would be like a thin slice you see how briskets are cut, were paper-thin shavings, which just melted away on the grill.I also felt very rushed to cook, eat and get out. Â I don't know why, maybe the atmosphere. Â I didn't feel the enjoyment and relaxation of the ""going out to eat"" experience. Â There were way too many things on the table, and most of them tasted bad, especially that egg thing they brought. Â That thing tasted awful, like scrambled eggs in a bowl of hot water.I would try Korean BBQ again, but not sure if this place merits a second visit, unless I'm in the area with the same party I was with. Â But, definitely not worth the 24/person price"
5/17/2013,3 star rating,"Good things about this place: Interesting way to clean the grill. Salad is good. Hot sauce is hot, like it should be. (Some kbbq's sauces aren't as spicy). Service was nice.The 'meh' things about this place: Parking, extremely small venue, not good for parties of 5 and up ( I felt cramped up). The food is alright, were not a variety of sides that I liked. After a ""miscommunication"" with payment they hunt us down to pay for a tip.... uhh.......... yeah."
4/27/2016,5 star rating,"Wow I gotta say I love this place. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else for KBBQ. Great service, amazing food, and fair price. Good luck getting a table during the weekend but it's with the 2 hr wait . Yea 2 hr bro!! Lol. Weekdays before 7 you should be fine no problem. #Money #AYCE"
8/14/2012,3 star rating,"Oh this place? I've been here before and never think much of it. Can't believe the 1000 gushing reviews. When friends suggested it for dinner, I pondered why I was clueless about its existence... I never bothered to learn the name since I didn't desire to come back. There's a lot of meat choices on the AYCE list, more so than say Tahoe Galbi.The venue is loud and scruffy looking. End tables get the tilted portable gas burner with a ghetto placed drip tray. Watch your shoes/bags for accidental spillage. The crowd is young as expected... seems more like a popular college aged venue. Expect to wait a while for a table, especially for a large group. The service was attentive despite the pandemonium. Servers will violate your airspace as they deliver the goods to your table, so watch your head from errant elbows.Generally I'm over the AYCE experience... I'm bothered about the source of all the cheap meat. Maybe this place deserves 2.5 stars, but I can see the appeal of it."
3/30/2015,4 star rating,Food was great. Service from Alex was awesome. The only reason why I put a 4 star is because one of the worker spilled water all over the table but im not going to point fingers.
5/15/2013,5 star rating,This is my new favorite AYCE KBBQ.Order the thin Canadian pork belly. Â It just melts in your mouth.All the other meats range from good to really good.Just don't order the hot dogs. Â They are just plain hot dogs like the ones you get at the market. Â It is a waste of stomach space for more thin Canadian bacon.
10/2/2017,4 star rating,"Pretty good all you can eat spot! They give you good sides and dipping sauces. I didn't really like the kimchi though. The line is always crazy long but the meat was tasty, so it's worth the wait. Customer service isn't the best but I don't really expect too much from an all you can eat Korean BBQ place."
6/4/2016,5 star rating,The best AYCE in Ktown. Â I always bring visitors from out of town to this spot. Â Excellent service. Â Worth the hour wait. Â Skip the white rice and wait for the Kimchi fried rice.
3/19/2013,3 star rating,"Went in with my coworkers on a Wednesday night. Super busy but realized that the restaurant was tiny for an ayce.bbq place. I thought that the quality was pretty good while eating, really enjoyed it after a 2hour wait. That night I broke out in hives...only happens to me when I have bad pork or shrimp...I didn't have any shrimp so it must've been the pork. Or maybe it was something I had for lunch. Who knows.But I won't be going back for sure..Some of my friends really like this place so maybe it may be for you, if you like a cozy K-bbq restaurant."
3/1/2016,5 star rating,Love this place. Have been here many times and by far my favorite spot. Great for big groups but can be tight depending on where they seat you. Long waits on peak nights and parking can suck. But well worth it. AYCE with a big selection and good sides and sauces.
4/24/2014,5 star rating,"Tried this spot while in K town. Great Korean BBQ place in a town of Korean BBQ places. Unlike other Korean BBQ restaurants, the servers actually help you with the barbecuing. Great place for neophytes to try Korean BBQ. However, even for those who do a lot of Korean BBQ, this is a great place to go. You have to select four meats at a time. It's a way for them to limit waste from the ""hungry eye"" disorder. Since it's buffet, you can eat as much as your stomach can expand. There's a $15 fee if you don't finish, but food is super yummy, you're sure to finish!"
4/14/2015,4 star rating,"This place is super tasty. Â One of the best I've had in Korea town. Â The only problem with this place is the seating. Â If you're in a small party they don't take reservations so you'll be waiting outside for a while unless you get there around 5pm for dinner. Â This place is fully packed by 7pm, just FYI. Â  But it's well worth the wait if you're hungry."
4/21/2016,5 star rating,"I came here on a weekday for their lunch special. Â I ordered the beef short rib soup. Â It is a clear soup with glass noodles and very tender beef short ribs. Â This place is known for ayce, but I suggest you try the lunch menu which is not all you can eat. Â I will definitely be back for the lunch menu."
4/20/2016,2 star rating,"This place has been changed from excellent to below average now in terms of food quality and service. Food quality is lacking of good spirit and not fresh as before. Dined with my wife and son, comment from my wife was actually worse."
8/14/2015,5 star rating,"I thought this place would be a basic Korean bbq place, but I was wrong. It was the best Korean bbq experience I've ever had. It was really worth the wait. The service was great, didn't expect them to cook the meat for us. I tried almost every meat choices on the menu and was not disappointed by any. Shout out to the home girl Angela for making the kimchi fried rice right in front of me."
5/28/2016,5 star rating,"This is a very good Korean BBQ place. Very busy atmosphere. The staff is very nice and friendly. The meats are very moist, tender and tasty. I recommend the beef short rib. Very tasty. The location is great but there were no parking outside unless using valet ($2)."

9/24/2013,2 star rating,"-start rant- UGH. Maybe I came on a rough night, but it was by far the WORST experience I've ever had at a Korean BBQ place. The food, yes, it was great. But the service was horrid.I find it so ridiculous that they were so slow to come by my table to ask if I wanted any other meat, side dishes, etc. If they had just been slow in serving, then, whatever, I could give them even 4 stars since I liked the food. BUUUUUTTTT this is what brought them down to 2 stars: I ordered the kimichi fried rice at the end and no joke, it took so long I had to flag down a waitress and tell her that I had ordered 15 minutes ago and nothing had come out. The idiot guy waiter that I originally placed the order with, forgot to put the order in. She apologized and because of the crummy service, I didn't even enjoy the rice at the end.HJC Workers: STICK TO A CERTAIN TABLE/SECTION TO AVOID SITUATIONS LIKE THESE. You try and serve every table that presses their button and it ends up biting you in the ass. Ugh.-end rant-"
8/12/2013,5 star rating,"$18.99 for all your can eat BBQ. This is the best deal I've found in ktown so far. It might even beat out Kang Ho Dong for me in terms of quality of food to price ratio.Parking: either get really lucky for street parking or valet.Reservations: it was PACKED here on a Friday evening (like most places) so make sure to make a reservation a few days ahead.Favs: Brisket, marinated kalbi, shrimp, bbq chickenNotes: It's LOUD in here. Fun atmosphere, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want to have a conversation with the people you go with."
9/24/2013,3 star rating,"This place has meats that are neither bad nor specially delicious.I can see many non-korean people like this restaurant, and there's nothing wrong with it.But there are many other korean bbq restaurants that are similar to or better than this restaurant."
11/3/2013,4 star rating,"This place had been recommended to me by several friends and its excellent .It's all you can eat and the meat is pretty good quality (obviously not the highest quality). Because it's all you can eat and in high demand, be prepared to wait. They don't take reservations (at least I didn't recall they did on the weekends) so you might have to wait for 30-45 minutes. But if you have a large group of friends, it's worth it."
6/29/2015,5 star rating,"Awesome AYCE Korean BBQ! Had to wait a bit for a table but it was worth it. Lots of meat options to choose from, my favorites were the bulgogi and beef short rib. The kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice were also phenomenal. Service is super fast, and everything was perfect."
8/12/2010,5 star rating,"Hide yo kids, Hide yo wife, hide yo husband too because they be raping everybody!In regards to KBBQ, when Ben F speaks, I listen. Â A connoisseur of all things meaty, I read his reviews religiously and immediately bookmark it when he said this place was the bomb.com Â Conveniently my friend just came back from Taiwan and the first thing she wanted was KBBQ. Â So to knock out two birds with one stone we made reservations for 12 people for some meaty goodness. Â The service was unbelievable. Â I have to stress this because it is what made this a 5 star experience. Â Maybe it was just my night and I pretended it was my birthday, but they treated us like royalty. Â Mind you we came VERY late. Â I mean really really late...If i was a server I would have been pissed that they were taking so long and I was losing out on more customers and tips. Â (We left him a big tip for the inconvenience) Â My friends had arrived on time and were sitting at the two big tables in the back waiting for us. Â Traffic was a nightmare and made me super late. Â Then parking was another nightmare and made me even more late. Â I hurt my leg which made me even more so late.I felt bad walking right in and grubbing when there was a line going out the door of people waiting. Â They should have made a reservation. Â The food was consistently good. Â There was nothing meretricious about it. Â The food was delicious and there was plenty of it. Â No skimping necessary. Â They have quite a few to choose from and the quality was spot on. Â I felt there was more variety to choose from here compared to most places I frequent. Â Squid, BBQ pork, chicken, bulgogi, Canadian pork belly, Black Angus beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork shoulder, tongue, and the ""honeycomb"" which i think was tripe aka ""stomach lining"". Â We ended up ordering basically everything except the hot dog, which I didn't know what that was but I didn't really want to find out. Â As if the propaganda that all Asian people eat dog isn't prevalent enough. Â I liked how they cleaned the grill with shredded turnip after each turn of meat to keep the grill clean. Â The service was attentive, prompt, and impeccable. Â I think we had 2 servers that night too because we took up two tables. Â PS- Don't be greedy, save room for the kim-chi fried rice at the end. Â Save some meat at the end too so they can mix it in."

Â Kimchi side item was soooo sour, not great at all.Eat with care and if your not picky with beef go for it, didn't try any pork and i'm glad I didn't."
8/14/2012,5 star rating,"Best. Korean. All-you-can-eat. BBQ. Ever.I was so amazed by this place. I'm not from SoCal, so I don't have too many KBBQ places at home. Their bulgolgi (is that how you spell it?) was the best bulgolgi I ever had. I love the fact that they open to 2AM. My friends and I went at 12AM and still had to wait, but it's okay because it was SO worth it! Their service is awesome, the atmosphere is great, playing today's top music, and they even have a big screen TV, which was playing the game when we were there.Prices are defiintely not bad either. $17.99 for all you can eat dinner? I think YES. I'm so jealous I can't go back anytime soon because I don't live in SoCal. I think I would make a trip to LA though just to come here again... it's just TOO, too good."
8/4/2015,4 star rating,Didn't know what to expect coming here. It ended up being pretty good. Not my favorite Korean BBQ place but it's pretty authentic. There was a little bit of a wait but not horrible. Would probably not come here again but it wasnt bad.
2/13/2018,5 star rating,The best Korean BBQ place I've ever been to. If you don't believe me try to just walk-in and get a table...you'll quickly be told to wait 30-45 minutes AND it's totally worth it.
3/11/2013,4 star rating,"Pretty good Korean BBQ experience. Plus, who isn't a fan on of AYCE meat?!Beware though, your entire party better be there when they call your name to sit down or they will skip your name.Always a fan of brisket, thought their marinated beef rib was flavorful and tender, and did like the beef tongue. And they kept it coming with the sides, too. It was interesting to watch them clean the grill like everyone else is saying. Pretty ingenious. The kimchi fried rice was a nice touch at the end. Just enough to put your case of the itis over the edge just a bit more."

5/11/2010,5 star rating,"Seriously, I have not even bothered continuing my kbbq journey because this place is so good. Instead of risking trying a new spot, I keep coming back here for more. Consistency is key and this place is like a perfect straight line. All other kbbq spots seem to be nonexistent when I think of where I want to go for kbbq. My late night tricks of coming at 10pm-11pm doesnt even seem to work anywhere! Why is there still a line! I think I gave that tip away. There has never been one single complaint whenever I wanted more meat and that is a whole lot of meat. No dirty looks. No old meat. Ever get your grill cleaned like 10x without even calling for the grill to be cleaned!!??This is my fave spot. Catch me here every other week for some delicious chadol and thick pork belly!!! God, this place is great, cant wait to come back asap."
1/23/2010,5 star rating,"Remix babyyyyyyyy! (Lil Wayne voice) I fucking love that this place is opened till 2am! When you get that late night urge for some good kbbq, well now you know where to go! Â Its never too late for kbbq, unless you want to go after 2am....Its been a while since I have been here. I knew the first time I reviewed this place, I thought it could have been better. After all the service was great, but what was lacking was a more personal experience with my food. Something just drew me back here to give this place another try, another deserving review. The last time I was here, it was a big party, and god I just hate sitting in big round tables with no leg room or arm room. Call me picky, but I prefer to enjoy korean bbq with a max of 4 people on any table. Its also nice to order a bottle of soju....then as the waiter is leaving our table he turns around and stares at me like I was some under aged youngin trying to get away with a bottle of alcohol. Call me McLovin.. Did I miss the memo? DId these grills get a upgrade? Picture a marble.....................GRILL! WTF RIGHT? From that point on I thought it was pure genius. In my head I was thinking, would we ever need to do a grill change? One thing for sure is, the grill is able to handle longer periods of cooking than on a conventional grill. Picture the first order of chadol touching a freshly clean grill, the noticeable but quiet sizzle, and that aroma of smoke that lifts through the air.. I know your getting jealous and wish you were here...A quick breakdown......Chadol, pretty fatty, but all things that come fatty come mighty tasty. Marinated short ribs..yum.Pork belly...disgustingly delicious..Bulgogi....marinade was on the sweet side, damn that sugar. Other stuff on the all you can eat menu include octopus, etc etc etc The sides: salad, apple salad, some other side dishes that I can only tell you I ate from pictures, were all very good. Ask for the fried rice at the end if you still have room. Seriously, now a days, there are so many great kbbq places in K-town, its hard to choose...But again that 2am close factor and the fact that I could have a late dinner with little to no wait time would sway me to come to this place over and over again. Â The service as soon as I walked through the door was absolutely excellent. We waited about 5-10 minutes before getting seated. As my cousin and I were talking, we noticed that there was a empty table and were wondering why we we still standing there gawking at other peoples grills. The hostess later on informs us that we are not being seated in that table because it is right in front of the door and it is crazy cold and windy which could also blow off the fire on the grill. On a damn cold night like this, it was damn nice to know. Tip these waiters/waitresses well because they have to manually clean your grill with magic radish that seems to lift dirt and grime off the grills. I do have a tip for everyone. Come here during odd hours of the day or night.. If you dont, I guarantee you will be waiting a long time to be seated since this is one of the more popular kbbq spots in K-town. People seem to eat here for hours! Wait, was I talking about myself? Time seemed to fly by quickly when your having such a great time."
12/20/2008,3 star rating,"Another kbbq joint added to my list. One down, many more to go. This place was different from all the other kbbq places that I have been to. First the grill used is not your typical kbbq grill. It was more of a big stone grill with a hole on the side tilted towards the hole so that any collective fatty oils from the meats would be flowing out of the pan onto a small tray. Â Second the tables were round. They were way too small because of all the side dishes, condiments, salad, and your plate taking up all the space. I had to stack the salad and we couldn't fit our meat platter on our table! Lastly, the AYCE included squid/octopus and korean style pancakes which was something new that I was introduced to today. Rice not the usually white rice came at the end of the meal and AFTER your done eating all the meat you possibly can. Where the hell is the WHITE RICE?! Â The service was exceptional and so was the chadol (beef brisket). Only knock on the chadol was it was fatty, but still so so good. If you want to try chadol out for the first time, this would be the place to get you hooked! Good luck finding parking here at Serrano Plaza. Just valet your car because this lot looks like it always reaches max capacity + an additional 10 cars blockading the parked cars. $2.00 valet will save you the heartache of trying to find a spot somewhere else. You have to probably wait to get a table here because this place is so small. We waited 30 minutes to get a table for 5. I also learned something new today. Radish + water helps to clean a burnt grill. I thought that was interesting and it worked! The verdict at the end was a 3 star rating for Hae Jang Chon. Honestly if the service had not been exceptional, I might have gave this place a 2 stars."

5/15/2016,5 star rating,"Best Korean bbq place in Cali! Theres a Kbbq place 10 minutes from my friends and I but we drive 45 minutes to come here! The short rib, pork belly, and briskets are my favorites! Dip it in the oil and salt with rice paper omg! Drink some beers and have a few shots and its the best time ever! The best thing about this place other than the food is their fast friendly service! Usually the service at kbbq places suck, but here its very prompt and quick! And funny! Lastly, the water tastes like actual filtered water and not tap water. $24 Â for ayce and 7 bucks for a pint of beer! And definitely worth the wait if you go during primetime! Oh and the valet is only $2!"
3/31/2014,4 star rating,Food options are a great and the quality is great here. Only short coming is the wait and seems like the hostess is doing a lot so it's hard for them to pay attention to the guest waiting and the tables that are about to be finished. Also they are super popular so be prepared to wait!! Always get the kimchi fried rice at the end but make sure you save room cause it comes at the end which is a bummer but it's worth it! The servers are actually very helpful and even turn your meat for you if they feel like your not paying attention haha
3/31/2014,2 star rating,"This place is a bit overrated in my opinion...After reading reviews on how popular this place is and how long the average wait is, we decided to go early. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon around 4.30pm. There were plenty of seats inside... but we waited for 20 min before we were seated. We had to put our names down on the list they have by the counter. There were 4 other groups all waiting the same time. We were all wondering why we had to stand and wait. The guy taking reservation was rude, did not want to really explain why we had to wait. At one point I was standing in next to the counter as we rang out of space to wait, he just pushed me over so he could get around me. 20 min later, we were seated, along with the other 3 groups. For some reason the other 3 groups all got served while we waited for another 20 min. No server came to our table. Finally, I had to pressed the bell and ask for some water and ask to see if we can order some meat and steam eggs. I got an angry reply...""its being cooked!!!"" and she stormed off. Later-on she came back and took our meat orders. At this point I went outside and topped up the parking meter as its still before 6pm and you still have to pay for street parking on 6th St.Finally we got some food. its ok..... Still prefer the unhealthy chargrill taste from other places. Stone grill is a bit too healthy. Beef tongue and angus beef were nice. Bulgogi was average, a little chewy. Â The side dish selection was average. To give this place some credit... the second shift people were much better. She was actually friendly. But still, the initial 1hr in this place just runnier it... i've had better experience next door and down the street."
3/30/2014,5 star rating,I really like the kbqq here they have thin pork belly and the thick kind.... omg soo yummy!! Beware it has alot of fat hahaha... Â I am not a normal girl so I love my pork belly fats :D if you come at lunch time the wait line is not that horrible.... but if you planning to come at night time the wait can be pretty damn long.... if you have a big party call ahead to make reservations they do take reservations however they only give you 15 grace time... so make sure your party is not running on asian time if they do make 1 hour later reservation hahaha... overall I think the price is not bad and the food is wonderful!!! And service they are quite attentive for a super busy resturant. Â I live one block away so I been here multiple times and I have nothing bad to say so far ^.^
3/29/2014,5 star rating,"We got to Hae Jang Chon at around 10pm on a Saturday night. The other reviewers weren't kidding when they said the wait is long. Man, the wait was practically an hour long. Making a reservation is probably a smart thing to do. I heard you have to be early/on time otherwise they give your table away, though. We ended up waiting outside to be seated cause it got really crowded inside. There's only two benches to sit on, so you either stand or sit on the curb at the parking lot. We didn't mind at all. Anyways, the food was delicious and came out pretty quick. They offer two types of pork belly: thinly sliced pork belly and thick sliced pork belly. The thinly sliced one reminded me of the brisket.They also serve their pork in a tin foil. We didn't really know what to do, so we let the waitress put it on the grill. Another waiter walked by later and took it off the foil. Slightly confused at this point, be we rolled with it.The interior was really comforting. It felt like we were having a barbeque in a cabin in the woods. The waitress we had, I didn't get the chance to find out her name, was really nice. She asked us if we wanted to try their kimchi fried rice after our meal, and we were hesitant, but she insisted. It was pretty good. She kept refilling our salad and ban chans, too. Oh, and another unique thing this KBBQ place did. The way they cleaned the grill. They don't change their stone grills. They clean it with this.. Thinly sliced.. Vegetable? It was a first for me, and man, that was pretty amazing LOLTotal for three adults came out to around $70 or so.Valet was $2, not bad for a place in LA. Would totally come here again."
3/28/2014,4 star rating,This place was amazing !! Â I gave it a 4/5 though because of the wait time I experienced. It was all you can eat kbbq and everything had a nice taste to it! I heard all the locals come here so you should definitely try it out if you're in town. :D
3/28/2014,4 star rating,"Long wait for a party of 5 . But it is totally worth the wait ! This is my first time visiting this place from San Francisco ! Compare to SF , LA for sure have the most ""worth it "" food . Reasonable price with great amount of food . $18 per person , all you can you eat ! What ? Â That is pretty crazy , down in sf japan town , it is $25 all you can eat exclude tax and tips . But $18? I'm like ... Amazed ! There's 20 choices from the menu here and the food and service is great ! The waitress will keep coming to you and ask if we need more meat . The meat are fresh and the environment is clean ! Good for even a party or gathering . Will definitely come Â again when I visit LA again !!!"
3/27/2014,4 star rating,"I've been a long time patron of this AYCE kbbq joint. Â I've been to quite a few of these places in Koreatown and always end up coming back here. Â It's essentially a meat lovers heaven with a decent selection of meat, including: brisket, pork belly, kalbi, bulgogi, squid, intestines, etc. Â You also get a plethora of side dishes, a few of which you don't typically see at AYCE places (kimchi pancake, kimchi fried rice). Â The service is quick, especially in comparison to many other kbbq places. Â The only thing that usually turns me off about coming here is the ridiculously long wait. Â I'd suggest coming at an odd hour (between 2-5pm) to avoid 1-2 hour wait times later at night."
3/26/2014,3 star rating,"Arrived on a Tuesday night around 9:00 PM and had about a 1 hr wait.$18 a person for AYCE. Wanted the kimchi fried rice but my dining associates jumped the gun and asked for steamed rice, not realizing we lost out on our chance for that kimchi fried rice, which is pretty delicious (I've been here once before many moons ago)Started first round with brisket, short rib, and beef bulgogi.Brisket was good, with decent marbling and overall quality for AYCE.Short ribs were okay, but I didn't care for it much at all.Beef bulgogi... I did not care for the cut and quality of the meat at all.Second round: thin pork belly, beef tongue, and bbq chicken.I never get chicken at a Korean BBQ place, but admittedly it was decent. Came out juicy and with a decent flavor.Thin pork belly was good. Not much to say about it, but I enjoyed it.Beef tongue was okay. I'm usually quite a fan of tongue - and it was decent - but nothing much to write about here either.Round three: just thick pork belly. This was good and delicious, although not as thick as I'd prefer.If I came here again, I would go for the brisket, thin pork belly, thick pork belly, and try the pork shoulder.The kimchi pancake was good, and the steamed egg was a nice touch.Banchan included: thin radish, cabbage, and bean sprout kimchis (all separate)Pickled carrots and fish cake - I liked the fish cake. The carrots melted in the mouth (not sure whether I actually enjoyed it that much or not, but I'd eat it again.)Potato salad wasn't all that flavorful. Didn't dislike it, but didn't much like it either.Lightly pickled mustard greens (?) were tasty and had a spot on texture. This was my favorite banchan here besides the kimchi.Service wasn't bad, but nothing much to say here either.The star rating description pretty much sums up my feelings on this place: ""A-OK.""I think when I was here a couple years ago, it was slightly better and a couple bucks cheaper. This is the first AYCE I've been to in quite awhile, so maybe I'm just used to shelling out twice as much money for half as much food for exponentially more satisfaction.For what it is though, and for what it's worth - because maybe this is the bottom line for any Yelp review - I left decently satisfied. Just don't expect to get your mind blown here."
3/25/2014,5 star rating,great service and food! i dont mind driving from long beach to la and dealing with traffic just to come eat here.
3/25/2014,3 star rating,"Decided to stray outside my usual for Korean BBQ.This place was popping on a Thursday night! A table for 2 was well over an hour wait. Crazy! Good luck trying to find free street parking. I ended up valeting, which is only a nominal $2.Their AYCE menu is $18.99 which included tons of options: brisket, short rib (galbi), pork belly, Â bulgogi, beef tongue, chicken...even octopus and shrimp! Their meat quality was just ok in my book. The also end off with some kimchi fried rice.The unique factor about this place is that they have a stone grill which they come by periodically to clean off with radish. I haven't seen this at any other place. I prefer the other grills more because you can get your meat extra charred and crisp. Yes, I love those carcinogens.The service is pretty good and all the servers are friendly, which is rare for this type of restaurant. They will actually come by to see if you need refills, order more meat, or to cut up your meat for you. A good spot for a kBBQ newbie I'd suggest.They also open until 2am. Although this may not be a regular place for me, I know where to go when late night kBBQ cravings hit!"
3/24/2014,4 star rating,"Meat, meat, meat...what else can you ask for. I've been here several times and it never fails. Well, service was a bit slow on my last trip but I forgive them, for now. Quality meat, clean restaurant and extensive side dish options that comes with the AYCE meat."
3/23/2014,1 star rating,"I went here for lunch on a Sunday. From the beginning my experience was ruined. They were not accommodating my dietary restrictions. I cannot eat beef or pork so I asked then if I can only have chicken from the lunch menu, but the waiter kept saying I cannot without giving me any logical explanation. It took them 40 mins to get my food out. By that time, I lost my appetite. I ate a lil bit of food and I asked them if I can take the food to go. Again, they have a bizarre rule that one cannot take the rice to go because it's a company rule. I mean seriously? I cannot take the rice for which I paid for? This is not just ridiculous, but very stupid! I am never coming back here!!! Ever again!!"
3/22/2014,3 star rating,Hae Jang Chon was my #1 favorite AYCE KBBQ but this has changed due to my recent experience.The kalbi's marinade was lacking and the quality of the meat was poor. We also had the squid and it was lacking flavor as well! The beef tongue though was really tender. At the end of the meal we had the kim chi fried rice which was good. It was the best part of the meal. We were also served the bean paste soup which was terrible. It was so salty that we couldn't take more than one sip and had to reach for our waters immediately after. Service was good. Servers are really friendly and attentive as always. They raised their price! It's now $18.99 and they added shrimp to the ACYE menu.
2/4/2012,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon has earned the gold medal in my heart for all you can eat KBBQ.$16.99 gets you about 16 different types of meats, kim chi fried rice, unlimited steam eggs. kim chi pancake, and bean paste soup. Here's what I suggest when ordering:-marinated short ribs-beef brisket-marinated bulgogi(thinly sliced beeff)-pork belly-baby octopusThis place by far serves the best quality of meats for an AYCE establishment. Servers are super friendly and will help you grill if they see you having trouble or slacking. They take reservations Â for parties of 6 or more on weekends.Valet-$2"
3/21/2014,5 star rating,"If you are looking for an epic ""all you can eat Korean BBQ"" in LA this is hands down the number one spot to go to! Although they are super busy at night and took forever to seat my gf and I ( close to an hour wait sometimes), its most definitely worth the wait! I was a little frustrated my first time when I had to wait so long but once you start eating all your frustration just goes out the window. And for a place that is super packed all the time their service is very impressive! They would constantly come and check up on you just to make sure everything is going well with you and your desires. It might seem like they are rushing you but its only because they are trying to serve everyone as fast as they can, which totally makes sense. My favorite would be the beef kalbi! It is soooo good I ordered about 3 courses of them haha. And the kimchi pancakes are something you def. have to try because they are surprisingly very tasty! Also there is a lot of side foods right in the beginning so you can start eating right when you sit down! Which is a great thing because the wait makes you that much more hungry ! :) Well its quite clear that this is my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ in LA, and without a doubt i will be back! and hopefully soon !"
3/20/2014,4 star rating,"Came here on a Wed. night at about 9:30pm and we had to wait about 20-30 min. to get seated. The place is pretty small compared to other kbbq places in LA.It was about $18 per person for AYCE. Includes the usual meats like brisket, pork belly, and bulgogi (about the only meats I eat hehe) kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice.The meat was pretty good quality considering its AYCE, it wasnt superrr amazing though. the kimchi fried rice was really good though. they cook it for you at the end of your meal!What really gave this place 4 stars is their service. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. Considering all the kbbq places I've been to in LA, the waiters are usually never around and really indifferent. For this place, we never had to ring the bell or ask for our waiter once. He also did most of the cooking for us.Anyways, overall pretty good place to get AYCE! btw, parking is valet ($2)"
3/19/2014,3 star rating,"Long long waits here just to be able to sit down and eat, even when you have reservations. You gotta make sure you make reservations and your whole party arrives on time or you won't be seated. Service is alright, just gotta make sure they bring out all your food because they can forget. I had seen lots of reviews for this place and I was hoping it would be a great AYCE place but it was ok. The food itself is very average, nothing stood out. The brisket is mainly fat which can be good if that's what you're into. Bulgogi is decent and the short rib is good. The kimchi pancake was different and good, I've never had that before anywhere else. As all Korean BBQ places, it will get smelly and you will come out smelling delicious. Make sure to grab a toothpick on your way out."
3/17/2014,4 star rating,"The wait for the restaurant was two hours long (that's what the host said, but it was more like 1 1/2 hours), and it was definitely worth the wait. The quality of the meat is exceptional and plenty to choose from. A little pricey, but the food is good. Service is very prompt and the staff never miss a beat. Once I sat, I never felt neglected. I highly recommend this restaurant."
3/17/2014,1 star rating,"Two words: tummy trouble. After eating dinner here, I spent quite some time in the restroom. The one day I didn't have pepto with me womp womp..... ended up calling the night early for a birthday celebration, drowned myself in pepto for the night and loaded up in peppermint tea to sooth my tummy. Not a great way to end any night.As for the food: very average tasting (in the meat department). Nothing worth coming back for unfortunately. The brisket is WAYYYY too fatty. All the meats I tried didn't really have much flavor. From their chicken to their pork belly. One thing I did like that I hadn't had anywhere else was their kimchi pancake. That was tasty. At the end of the meal they will also make you some kimchi fried rice which is a must try if you have some room left after stuffing yourself all you can eat style.Service: Very friendly. They keep their cool well even when they are running around busy. I do wish they were a bit better at picking up the empty plates and empty bottles though. I was sitting against the wall and had a large collection of dirty, bloody plates and enough bottles of beer and soju to take to a recycling bin right after. *Do make reservations if you are planning on eating here. There seems to be a long wait no matter what time you come. If you make reservations, ensure that your whole party is there on time to be seated on time. Everyone must be there or you won't be seated.Parking: Good luck with that. We ended up having to valet. Once they brought our car around, which was during the dinner rush, they didn't even bother to let us know that our car was there. They practically left our car on and the door open for a good 5 min before I noticed that the car causing the traffic jam was mine. Valet should have mentioned or said something or I guess I should have been more alert. Over all, any place that gets me sick to my stomach unfortunately is not able to get a higher rating than a star. Won't be going back.#53/2014"
3/15/2014,5 star rating,Soooo good! Service is great and well worth the small wait ! I come only to this Korean BBQ place it's really the best.
3/15/2014,3 star rating,The food was decent except for the kimchi I had. It was a little sour and I'm a stickler when it comes to kimchi! The best Korean bbq I've ever had was in Garden Grove and it was cheaper!
8/28/2013,5 star rating,"Man!!!! Came back again and again and again. This time eating til 1:30am dang!!!!!!They just don't have something as good in NYC. Please open on the east coast, please!!!!.HAHAHA I started this review back in February and just getting around to posting it. Â Since then I have been back to this place 5 times. Â Its strong points are open late, good selection of meat, good bon chon, friendly staff, easy to find parking. Â Not too good for groups more than 10 though."
7/1/2011,5 star rating,Bomb!!!! Long wait at the normal times. Â All you can eat or single dish order menu. Fried rice at the end made with the kimchi at the table and seaweed. Really good pork cuts and kalbi. Open late can seat up o 10 people easy
1/28/2016,5 star rating,A go to for any native ktowner or out of towners. Ktown has so many AYCE kbbq places but this place is great to show to a group of friends who are trying kbbq for the first time. The staff is attentive compared to many kbbq places. They were very patient with our ordering and prompt with bringing more meat. All my friends I have taken here love it cause they think it's so authentic. It maybe on the pricier side but their selection is very large. The wait can get very long though.
10/10/2015,4 star rating,"I've been here a handful of times and I would say the food quality is pretty great but the service is a bit of a hit or miss depending on your server and I have been hung up on a few times trying to reserve... =( but other than that the food makes up for it! they have a wide range of selections, including some seafood and they do cook the food for you and they clean the hot stone with radish. Â I would recommend their brisket and sides. Â Everything is pretty fresh. The wait here without reservations is fairly long though. I've had to wait about 2 hours before. I would highly recommend this place if you are visiting K-town. =)"
4/21/2017,4 star rating,"The meat is so good! So many choices to choose from and the workers really help you out. The only disadvantage is that the place is so tiny, all the seats are crammed into each other. Very busy, but worth it!"
6/25/2011,1 star rating,"Some of the worst KBBQ I've ever had in my life and probably the most overrated yelp recemendation ever.The quality of the meat was verging on inedible. Â Each morsel of beef or chicken was extremely tough and chewy. Â Everything was cooked on a cast iron skillet with a non- functional hole for draining fat. Â In no time, all the meat was swimming in a large, disgusting pool of grease. Â The service was non existent. Â When the waitress did come back with our Â next order, she dumped both the chicken and beef bulgogi on to the skillet together and proceeded to spill raw chicken liquid into two cups of water and several side dishes. Â Gross. Â The thick chicken pieces congealed with the thin beef. Â We couldn't eat the beef for fear of cross-contamination with the uncooked chicken. Â Truly unappetizing. All you can eat was more all I could bear to eat. Â It turned out to be marginally less expensive than our favorite Korean place and obviously not worthwhile for us."
6/17/2013,4 star rating,"Disclaimer: came for AYCE $17.99 at 3pm on a Sunday, so take my review for what it's worth!Very good service, meat, and atmosphere. The waiters were friendly and attentive: all I had to do was look up and a waiter would be there to cook the remaining meat or help clean the pan. Case in point, I left some unused utensils on a chair so they would stay clean and reusable... a waiter walked by and picked them up without a word on his way to help another table. I'm no expert on KBBQ meat but my friend who eats it all the time said it was great for the price!PARKING WAS EASY AND FREE since it was a Sunday and all the street meters were off. We parked on Western Ave/4th Street and walked over."
8/23/2012,3 star rating,"My sister and friends took me for Korean BBQ in Korean Town. I've usually only have the $9.99 around Gardena area because I don't eat much and I wouldn't know what other kind of meat to order. The line to be seated Hae Hang Chon is ridiculous! And if your party is not here, you go back on the waiting list. Â This Korean BBQ cooks with a clay stove top and not open fire. This is very important for me because I like the open fire with that little bbq burnt taste. I'm not a fan of the clay stove top because it tastes like the meat is boiled. The meat quality is good but not the best! for $17.99, there are 19 different meat to choose from little small Â side dishes, different kind of dipping sauce( My favorite is the sesame oil and salt) , kimchi , steamed egg, seafood pancake , soup, and kimchi friend rice at the end which they stir fry on top of the stove for you.Out of 19 different kinds of meats, you can only order 4 different kinds at a time. My favorite was the beef brisket, chicken and pork belly. This is the reason I seldom goes for the one for more than $10 because the meat I want is already on the $9.99 menu.  Food is 3 starsAmbiance is 3 stars.Service is 4 Â 1/2 stars. Overall Experience is 3 Â 1/2 stars.Valet parking is $2"

Â i cook the food and try it. i was WOW it was good and not burn but i do miss that chard taste............. but not bad this place. oh the kool part is that they don't come and change your grill. they clean it in front of you. at the end of the meal they give you ...... grill rice lol but it was good OMG i don't know why but when they sat my group down i feel like i was in the SGV full of FOB and i was like how can this be i'm in K-town

8/25/2015,5 star rating,"I was around Koreatown and wanted to get some AYCE Korean bbq for lunch and stumbled upon this place after searching through yelp. It was $19.99 per person during lunch hours and $21.99 for dinner. Visiting from the Bay Area, that is a really good price for AYCE kbbq. Parking was fairly easy, did not have to pay $3 for valet. Right when I walked in during lunch hours on a Wednesday, I was quickly seated with my boyfriend. Just like every Korean restaurant there were a lot of side dishes and they were amazingly delicious! The fish cake was my favorite! There was also a side of salad with a light dressing. The menu was simple and had an okay amount of meat selections. For each round, there was a limit on only ordering 4 meats at a time to avoid wasting any food or there was a charge of an extra $15. The staff was very friendly and they helped us cook our food in front of us. While we were eating, they would come by very often to check on our food so that it didn't burn and told us when they were ready to eat! Personally, we mostly like to eat beef so we ordered several rounds of the bulgogi and marinated short ribs. The thin pork belly was also really good.I will definitely come back when I'm in the area."
11/28/2015,2 star rating,"We went on thanksgiving day so the place was packed and service probably more chaotic than usual. Our party arrived on time with advanced reservations. Reservations rules are: 6 persons min., Â whole party present before seated, would be dropped after 15 mins and the reservation was confirmed on the day .We weren't sat for more than 20 mins because I) no big table ii ) no 2 small combinable tables . We were given 2 small tables but need to split the party. We opted to take the smaller round table and let a couple take the other side table. The couple were seated, served, ordered, cooked their meat and started eating while our host, Jay disappeared outside checking out everyone waiting outside. By the time Jay came back about 5 mins later, he needed to process the payment of couple tables before calling the wait staff to help putting plates and condiments on our table. Eventually, he personally helped set up the table. By the time we sat down and ordered, it was over 30 mins after our reservations time. Then, the service went from no one coming to us to, asking for rice and salad multiple times before getting it, to the end, we were asked by 4 waiters whether we need more meat. I chalked it off as erratic, terrible service on a busy night, which can happen to some restaurants.I am old school when it comes to Korean bbq. I like grilling my meat on real natural, long burning charcoal. I don't mind going out of the way to find these places. Unfortunately, cooking the meat on a lukewarm stone plate is miles away from that experience. The meat varied in quality. Brisket, squid were good. Short rib, which was usually the main attraction, looked and tasted like chuck steak. I guess that is what you get at all you can eat place. I don't get why people like the kimchi fried rice which is cooked from cleaning the stone plate grime, or the soggy kimchi pancake which sticks to the pan. Btw, they never clean or swap out the stone grill in the middle, which is the first for me in Korean bbq.We asked for lettuce and was told that would cost $5 because it includes seasame leaves (which I bought a big stack at h Mart for $0.33 )but the lettuce only salad is included.Again, this can be a bad day for the restaurant. For this experience, 1 star off for the service, and 2 stars off for the food."
9/22/2011,4 star rating,"This all you can eat KBBQ was absolutely delish!The four of us foodies ordered each of the meats that were offered, with favorites being the beef brisket, squid and beef tongue. So good, we ordered each about 4x. I loved that this particular joint gives a nice variety of dipping sauces to be used for the meats, although the basic sesame seed oil w/ salt and pepper just works perfectly for all the grilled meat. I do have to say from all the condiments that the steamed egg was the worse of the bunch (eggs weren't fluffy compared to other kbbq joints around). Pair all that food with 3 bottles each of hite beer and soju and we each ate ourselves into oblivion.What was a surprise was that towards the end, the food still isn't done: kimchi fried rice is made on the grill and accompanied by a tomato based tofu soup. Mmm, mmm, mmm....and I think my stomach was about to explode at this point! The staff here is super attentive, even w/o ringing the table bell. When we needed extra pancakes or condiments, the staff was quick to get them to you. Oh, and the price? $~20/pp for dinner... c'mon now! Came here on a weeknight after work...much better than waiting up to 2 hours during a Saturday night. A definite return in my books!"
4/27/2010,4 star rating,"good AYCE korean bbq BUT for the sides!.. i think the meat quality is just slightly better at tahoe!!.. but here you get so many side dish extras such as the bean sprouts and kimchi on the marble grill.. AND ..just when you think you can't eat anymore.. they give you kimchi fried rice crisped up on the grill at the END of your meal!!!lots of selection in terms of types of meat and of course they have the run of the mill potato salad (didn't like the fruits in this), spinach, rice cake, RICE NOODLE PAPERS (IMPORTANT FOR WRAPPING MEAT), steamed egg, sesame marinated salad, and they have 4 different dipping sauces to alternate with!they also have the little ""service buttons"" so you can get their attention while your mouth is FULL.. this place would be a go-to since its cheaper and they have great sides.. but if i were craving better meat i'd make it over to tahoe =)OH and valet parking for 2 bucks!.. those drivers have sticky hands BRING SANI WIPES!"
5/13/2012,3 star rating,Good but not great. Â I like meat with more flavor and marination. Â There was an adequate number of side dishes. Â I wish the kimchi rice didn't come at the very end. Â I like to eat rice with my meat throughout my meal. Â Service could certainly use improvement. Â How about a simple water refill?!
8/25/2011,4 star rating,"So a late night KBBQ adventure led me to Hae Jang Chon. By late night, I mean around 10PM. My original plan was to head to Road to Seoul but it closes at 11PM while this place is nommmin till 2AM! I don't like getting the tail end of food for KBBQ joints. Call me OCD but you crayyy.For meats, I got the brisket, bulgogi, kalbi and beef tongue. The brisket quality is one of the better ones I've had and the bulgogi was very juicy and tender. I really also liked the sides. The potato salad and pancake were my favorites. I also like frying the kim chee on the grill and wrapping that with the lettuce salad and rice paper with my meats. OM NOM NOM!They have an interesting way of cleaning the grill. They throw this shredded, white radish strips and that magically picks up all of the black grime. How? Magic, duh. It was someone's birthday while I was there, so I got to hear 'Happy BA-SU-DEH' over and over again on the speakers. Heheh. Oh Konglish..You also get kim chee fried rice and tofu soup at the end of the meal. YUM! The service was also very efficient and one of the best I've seen at a KBBQ place. Def a fan. My friend said I came out smelling like delicious beef. I'll take that compliment anyway."
1/23/2016,5 star rating,"I had this place bookmarked for awhile and had the chance to go this past week. It's located in a small plaza with a handful of other restaurants. Parking can be tough, but there is $2 valet! The servers were accommodating and often came to our table to turn the meat. I'm pretty sure it was because we would get caught up conversing, all the while the meat was burning on the grill, lol.I would definitely come back!"
1/6/2011,3 star rating,"Foods decent but I dont think its the best AYCE.This is my conspiracy theory.Moodaepo brings out meat slow on purpose so you dont eat too much.. and as a result customers get pissed.Hae Jang Chon found a way around this by travelling around the world to Mongolia, where they found these thick tablet-like grills that cook meat soooo slowly that you will be full from the wait and thus, eat less.This also translates to better service, because when the meat is slow to cook, they dont need to rush around like chickens with their heads cut off bringing more meat or other things (water, banchan, sauces) that need faster refilling when a fast cooking grill is in use.All in all HJC found a way to cheat the system without making them look bad. Their meat quality is decent and extensive in choices, and its a medium sized restaurant.The ventilation in there is decent, but you will smell like smoke as is common in all AYCE KBBQ places. The only difference is that your clothes will also smell like cooked kimchi. Do not fret ladies and gentlement.. the smell of cooked meat and kimchi is being created as the next body spray by AXE to attract other koreans as we speak. You are just ahead of the fashion curve.As Mark Mcguire is held out of the baseball hall of fame because of steroids and Ben Johnson stripped of his gold medal in the 88 Seoul Olympics, HJC is held out of my elite rankings. Im sorry fellas, cant give 5 stars to a place that takes 2 hours to eat 3 plates of meat..."
6/23/2012,5 star rating,"Definitely my favorite AYCE Kbbq joint. It has gotten extremely popular over the last couple of years, so definitely be prepared to wait when you're there (esp on the weekends). Last weekend, I waited an hour and a half for a party of 3. They do take reservations for large parties, but even then, you probably won't be seated right away. The selection here is amazing. They have everything you could ever want for an amazing kbbq meal. I am a huge fan of their galbi (marinated short ribs), brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, and pork shoulder. The meat is always fresh and always delicious. Their banchan is very tasty as well. I love that they put the kimchi on the hot stone grill. The kimchi pancake is AMAZING. I always end up filling up on too much kimchi pancake! You also get steamed egg, rice paper, pickled radish, and 4 different dipping sauces with your meal. At the end of your meal , they make this FANTASTIC kimchi fried rice on your grill and bring you a bowl of yummy spicy soybean soup. They also serve soju and Korean beer. Hite is so delicious with Kbbq :)Like many other places in Koreatown, the parking here is valet only. You might be able to find some parking on the street, but I would just hand over my keys and let the pros handle it. Valet is $2. This place is also open till 2 am, so it's a great place to go for late-night food runs!"
10/14/2008,5 star rating,"Now Chris Kim has been to many a Korean BBQs but he'd have to say that this restaurant is the best AYCE Korean that he has been. First off, you order the special(16.99) which is the choices of chadeulbaegi(sliced beef), ssamgyupsal(uncured bacon), kalbi(marinated steak) and marinated chicken and it also comes with fried kimchee and kimchee pancakes at the beginning and bi bim bap(Korean fried rice) and tenjjang chigae(soybean soup) at the end. Panchan(side dishes): What they have here is always set so expect to see the same things every time. Now Chris Kim's Korean aint the best so he'll tell you in English what they have; Steamed egg, radish kimchee, regular kimchee, stem kimchee, mild radish kimchee with the juice( sort of like a cold soup) and the rice and radish wraps. Yeah that's about it, nothing fancy. Now to the real deal, the meat. First off, they have this big kimchee stalk on the grill and add kimchee pancakes when you get there. That fried kimchee idea is a really good one. The meat is of pretty good quality especially for an AYCE. It's actually the best quality of a AYCE hes been. So usually you order the chadeulbaegi first and cook that. Chris Kim gives a Chris Kim tip on cooking that one. Lower the heat to a medium and instead of what people usually do(fry it on both sides in which it becomes chewy), do what Chris Kim does which is stack them close and steam cook it constantly keeping it on the move and just before it's done set it on your plate. This makes the beef of a sukiyaki consistency so its more tender and juicy when you eat it. The rest of the meat is self explanatory. The kalbi is very juicy so watch out.Service: Since everyone usually gets the special anyway, the service for an AYCE is exceptional. The waiters constantly come by and give service and replenishes things( if you can stop stuffing your face and run out of items before they can get back to you). A cool thing that Chris Kim hasn't seen anywhere else is how they clean the grill. They take those shredded radishes and cleans the grill using them. People usually tip buffets less, but these guys deserve the regular tipping standard if not more for their service.Downsides: Get here early or call to reserve because if you come here when its a full house, expect to wait around 30-60 minutes for a table mind you this place is pretty small. Chris Kim says if you come with a group of more than 5, split up your group to reduce the waiting time. They charge extra for rice.So all in all the best AYCE Korean BBQ Chris Kim has been to and this place would be his #1 choice to go thus far. Don't give the servers a bad attitude because they'll give it straight back. I mean think of how you would feel if you were in their shoes."
1/21/2016,4 star rating,"This place is very good. Â Sauces are delicious, ideal stone grills, decent quality meats. Â We got the thin sliced pork belly, bulgogi, and marinated short ribs (galbi). Â I could have done without the pork belly, it was like eating a whole plate of bacon...quite heavy and greasy, not a pro move when you're playing the ayce game in my opinion. Â The rest was delicious.Use the thin rice wraps they give you to make little sandwiches. Drizzle some sweet and sour, chili sauce, some meat of your choosing and a piece of lettuce on it"
6/23/2010,4 star rating,"All you can eat Korean food for for less than $20.00....this would be a sweet find of a restaurant if this were in Orange County. From what I hear, there are many great finds for Korean food in Los Angeles, but for this OC boy...I will always wish this type of food were closer to where I live. Â =)This restaurant is located in a small strip mall in Koreatown of Los Angeles. Be warned, the only way I was able to park here on a Saturday evening is to valet you car at a cost of $2. The wait was fairly long...60 minutes, but well worth the wait!I digress....onto the review of the food.....I came here with a bunch of my Los Angeles friends who know their Korean food. The restaurant's price, value, food, quality, and taste at an AYCE restaurant is a WINNER.We feasted on everything Korean BBQ....brisket, pork, bulgogi, short ribs, chicken, bacon, etc. I was also treated to the kimchi rice for the first time....YUMS!I am an amateur when it comes to fine Korean food dining and I am looking for more reasonable Korean restaurants close to my area. Hae Jang Chon Korean BBQ Restaurant has set my bar fairly high for an AYCE Korean restaurant.Please let me know....if you find one for me. Â Four Yelp Stars for this visit! Â ;-p"
8/22/2012,4 star rating,"Probably the best AYCE Korean place in terms of cost, quality of food, and service. Taking a star off because it's extremely busy and tiny, but that it is so crowded really speaks to how good this place is.Good things:- Around $20 per person (after tax & tip) for over 15 choices of meat- Brisket, marinated short ribs, and pork belly (both thin and thick) are delicious- The stone grill is unique in that it doesn't seem as greasy (if that's possible) because it drains out into a bowl- Kimchi fried rice is AMAZING (and i HATE kimchi!)- Good variety in appetizers (and they're not stingy when they refill, either)- This could either be good or not so good, but there is an incredibly loud Korean birthday song that is played whenever it's someone's celebratory day...Not so good things:- I once ordered hot dog thinking it was some type of Korean hot dog. It was definitely an Oscar Meyer weiner- Even with reservations, it's pretty difficult to be seated right away (even on weekdays)So this probably isn't the best place if you have a large party (I'd hit up O Dae San for that) but for a smaller group, it hits the spot!"
5/28/2009,5 star rating,"I believe this was one of the first all you can eat restaurants I tried when moving down to LA, and I've yet to find a restaurant that can compare in price, taste, service, and atmosphere. The items available from their all-you-can-eat menu is extensive, and all for $16.99? It's a steal I tell you.I always opt for the thinly sliced beef and the marinated beef. As a rule of thumb, you always want to start with your un-marinated meats so your stone grill doesn't get all gunky. No worries though, the service is great and your server will come by with some sliced daikon and do an amazing clean-up job before your eyes. The kimchee pancakes that come out in the beginning are so tasty, and equally satisfying is their kimchee fried rice and dwenjang jiggae (bean soup) that comes out in the end. Come in your scrubs because you'll leave smelling like a smoky piece of meat."

3/31/2011,4 star rating,"Took my brother here when he was visiting. Made a reservation for 10 people at 6pm. We didn't arrive here till 6:30 but they still kept our reservation. However, this place really isn't very good for parties greater than 4-5. We were given 2 tables and since the tables are grounded, we had to sit apart from each other. I like that this place is also open till 2am! Will definitely come here for late night munchies. :)Service here is pretty bad. We had to ask several times for more banchan and more duk bo sam and they took forever to bring us anything. However, the food here was super yummy! They use a tilted stone grill with a hole in the bottom to collect the oil which i like -but from other restaurant, it seems this meat is just more fatty in general -both good and bad! Haha, we ordered thin pork belly, brisket, bulgogi, calbi, octopus, pork shoulder, and beef tongue. I really enjoyed the thin pork belly -but you really have to let it cook for a long time until its crispy for it to taste good! Pork shoulder was a little tough, but the beef tongue and everything else was delectable. I was pretty happy with the selection of meat here. The banchan was okay - except I really liked the potato they had, they put apples in it which is surprisingly delicious! Their salad and other banchan however, is pretty forgettable. Something special about this place - they have kimchi fried rice at the end which is yummY! they also have a soup which I thought was all right. I would definitely come here again, but with a smaller group. Overall though, I think i still like Road to Seoul better - they just have much better service, better seating arrangements, more and better tasting banchan, and I think the meat tastes about the same."
9/5/2009,5 star rating,"I've found yet another high quality Korean BBQ place that I will definitely come back to when I have the craving and bucks for it! Â I came in here for lunch after reading about the Yelp reviews, and went ahead with the $16.99 all you can eat deal. Â This is also the first KRNBBQ place that I've been to that uses a stone grill, which was an interesting experience. As with most Korean places within K-Town, the host/hostesses don't speak a whole lot of English, but their menu was sufficient enough for us to just point to what we wanted and she was able to bring it out. Â Despite not knowing much English, our hostess was extremely nice and continued to make sure our meat was cooking correctly, and that we had enough rice paper, lettuce, and appetizers.I usually order the typical bulgogi/kalbi deal when I eat Korean food, but this time decided to go with other things, which included pork belly, beef tongue, and beef brisket. ALL of these things were delicious and seemed of high quality relative to the cheaper places I've been to in K-Town. My favorite of course was the beef tongue. We also had the kimchi pancake, which was interesting, but I think I'll go with the kimchi fried rice next time I come here because it sounds delicious.Prices here are normal for high quality Korean BBQ. I paid about $46 for 2 people, which included all you can eat and 2 sodas, along with tip. I was satisfied and didn't mind one bit about the prices because my experience here was great.One more thing--parking. The lot is tiny so I suggest parking on the side streets unless you feel like shelling out a few more bucks to tip the valet guy who literally drives your car 10 ft. to the parking spot. Definitely coming back as this is now one of my top Korean BBQ spots in K-Town."
11/17/2011,2 star rating,"Yes...a 1-star review. Â But, as a seasoned LA yelper, I have to realize that these many 4-star and 5-star reviews can't be wrong! Â And indeed they aren't. Â The only problem is that they're all reviews about the AYCE option. Â Having been here for AYCE before, I would have join the mass, give a 4-star review and vow to come back. Â Coming back was a bad idea. Â  Â It was an impromptu choice as Ham Ji Park closed that day. Â None of us wanted to over gorge ourselves with endless meat so we opted for ordering by plate. Â I could sense my day was going to be ruined as soon as the waiter gave us trouble for wanting to cook our meat at the table like everyone else. Â He then came up with another rule - NO REFILL ON THE SIDE DISHES! Â Now if this was I circa 2000 eating at a Korean restaurant for the first time, I would happily oblige. Â I've known better. Â I've never been to a Korean restaurant where they flat out warn me that I would not get another serving of the side dishes. Â I've been to more dingy places where they would come and ask if we wanted more. Â While most restaurants reserve better cut of galbi for ordering a la carte, Hae Jang Chon did not. Â For $23 a plate, I expected something better but we just got the same pile of mediocre meat as any other AYCE-er. Â The portion was also a laugh. Â Seeing that we were heading down the wrong path and heading for a disastrous lunch, we asked to switch to AYCE since clearly we didn't receive anything special. Â The waitress there agreed but we eventually got a no. Â We finished up our single serving of side dishes and gerbil-portion pile of meat, paid over $100 for our meal, left, and went to eat at Kyochon next door. Â I blamed Ham Ji Park for not open that Sunday noon. Â I blamed myself for not having a backup plan. Â Then I realized I shouldn't blame myself for someone else's incompetence."

9/29/2012,3 star rating,"The traffic was brutal and it was impossible to find parking, so I had to use the valet guys. Not holding this against the restaurant, though.When we finally sat down, I looked at the stone grill and thought it was interesting. I also thought we would be eating grilled meat, not meat slowly simmering in its own juices for 10 minutes before those juices evaporate and then the meat starts developing the seared texture I like but begins getting overcooked (seared rare beef is my thing but boiled rare beef is gross). The only time this was acceptable was when we got the fatty pork belly since it is supposed to cook until it crisps like bacon anyway.We tried pretty much everything on the AYCE menu but nothing popped up at me. Whenever we tried to adjust the temperature, one of the waitresses would simply turn it back down. It was as though she was cooking for us, which I thought wasn't necessary. A lot of people described this place as 'traditional'. I guess I personally prefer a place that is less 'traditional', since 'traditional' is not always practical. When it comes to food, I value the end product more than the process used to get to it. Call me picky but I ain't a fan of the in-between."
7/4/2010,4 star rating,"I've always drove passed this spot. I knew people who dined here. Everyone except myself. Why? I don't know guess I had to find other Koreans to roll with so they can translate for me....assuming I'm Pinay! But when I was invited...there was one other Korean person there, sweet girl, she was our translator! Everyone else was other than...we were pretty much the minority table. Well anyways, I am really glad I was invited out because its been a long minute since I dined with this group of people. Thank goodness for second chances!! Â It's in a small plaza on the corner of 6th and serrano. The parking is hella small...so be prepared to valet (good luck - how do they find parking, never any parking in k-town, oh yeah they double park, my bad) or find your own space. Â The wait was I think over 30 minutes only because we were waiting for others to arrive. Â It's not really big inside. Typical Korean BBQ feel...bunch of Koreans, smoke, soju and meat! I think it was AYCE $16-17.99 per person. I just gave them $25 or so. Â We always designate one person to serve/cook the meat. Since there was two tables, one person at each got the honor!! We've cooked uh...dammit just forgot the names; let's just say beef, pork, squid and octopus...got it! Oh yeah, don't forget the BARLEY Water and their cool looking bottles!The vibe is busy and loud but over-all I had a lot of fun with my friends from the past, literally! It felt great to get out and have fun with people you care about and enjoy their company. I didn't realize how much fun I've missed! I'd definitely return with another crowd.

7/28/2009,4 star rating,"4 stars for the food, 5 stars for service.MEAT: Pork Bulgolgi, Beef Bulgolgi, Pork Belly, Brisket, Short Ribs. Â I wanted to try other stuff but my other tablemates weren't too down for squid , honey comb or anything like that. Â Bulgolgis came premixed with sliced onions, but a little too bland for my taste but the meat cut was delicious. Â Brisket was paper thin and the short ribs came without the bone and lightly marinated (not too heavy - darn it). Â Pork belly was SUPER thick and white as Matthew K mentioned, it wasn't to my liking since I try to get my pork bellies extra crispy. Â I won't be ordering Pork Belly next time.I've had a circular style KBBQ grill before but I felt that the kimchi and sprouts on this grill was totally yum here in comparison to HoneyPig in GG. Â Normally I'm not too keen on that stuff. I really liked the kimchi pancake (yes I know fillers, but it was SOOOOO good). Â  BANCHAN:They just had potato salad and green veggies with some egg but the potato salad was good. Not too dry and not too bland. Â Refilled without me asking. Â I asked the server if they had japchae but he said they were a ""different style"" of KBBQ? Â Bummed there wasn't a variety but oh well.Ricepaper wrapper was yummy, radish wrap was pretty sour for my taste. Sauces were just ""aight"" but they gave you plenty of fermented soybean sauce..mmm yum! Kimchi Fried Rice was delicious - better than at Honey pig with nice slivers of seaweed. Â SERVICE:We made reservations for a party of 12 for 7PM. Â They called us at 6:00PM and reminded us that our reservations were for 7PM and if we can't make it on time, they'd give away our table - YIKES! Â Don't do the Asian lag here folks! Â  When we got to the restaurant - and were shown our table. Â Our salad bowls, banchan, wraps and dipping sauces were all ready on our table. NICE!!!! William our server was an absolute effing doll. Â The bday girl was trashed beyond all belief and he was totally cool and accommodating with our questions. Â He was pretty amazed by her drunkiness too and almost looked like we were pulling his leg when we told him she never had Soju before, I could see him chuckle and shake his head.It was kinda cool how when your grill is dirty, they use freshly shredded radish to clean the grill. Ingenious! At first I thought he was gonna feed us that as our ""intermission"" dish.BONUS: They didn't add gratuity to the bill. Â WTHeezie? Â For that, we left a 30% tip. Â Any server (he was pretty much our dedicated server the entire time) that can deal with a bunch of drunk non-Korean speaking group of people deserves to be tipped well.CON: Â They brought out the belly first and it took forever to cook. Â The short ribs were pretty much brought out last during the first round of meats and so we got to grub on the ""cheaper stuff."" and got full by waiting around for the ""good stuff."" Â My tip would be to ask for what meat you want first. Â BTW, don't wear shorts (I came from a pool party), the grill was flying and I got some on my thighs at first until the server was sweet enough to hand me a bunch of napkins to cover my legs. Awww.. what a sweetie!"

6/13/2011,3 star rating,"I should know better than to trust Yelp when it comes to KBBQ.Half of the reviews (the KBBQ newbies) say this place is the best EVER and the other half (Ktown veterans) disagree.Of course at first you may think its amazing...all that meat and side dishes for less than $20? But then you realize that the brisket is pretty much half fat and there are more restrictions here than the TSA. Also, quality is ALWAYS sacrificed. Everything else about this place (including price, and assortment of meats, service, ambiance) is EXACTLY the same as any other place. There were 2 things I truly disliked about this place though:1. The grill. It looks like a flat mortar (basically a big flat stone bowl) that traps a WHOLE lot of oil. Other KKBQ places use the standard grill where there are a lot of openings for oil to fall, but not this.There were several moments where I felt my meat was frying...not grilling. 2. The salad. Who is cutting the salad back there? A giant? Cause seriously the big pieces of lettuce were made for giants. Would it really kill them to stop and slice the lettuce a little better?Its also kind of lame that its JUST romaine lettuce. I like it when there's a mix of green onion.P.S. The kimchi fried rice? A nice change from the all the meat..but it doesn't taste amazing."
10/25/2011,5 star rating,"The only CON about this place is the WAIT, but oh sooo worth it.This place really raises the bar for a Korean barbecue experience and should be the minimum everywhere. This place was able to satisfy my 3 male friends who were starving and complaining that the wait list was absurd. My crew arrived at 7:30pm without reservations since minimum reservation requirement is 7 people. When we got there we were told it was a 45 minute wait. 45 minutes pass and then they tell us there would be an additional 1 hour wait. My friends were getting antsy so we decided to walk over to KyoChon, which is in the same strip mall, for some Korean styled chicken wings. KyoChon saved my butt because this place was rocken some good spicy wings; need to review later. So we finally get in after a grueling 2 hours and walked out 2 hours later with plump stomachs, semi-buzzed faces, and thoughts of coming back here again.This place has it all:ACYE KBBQReasonable price starting at $16.99Cheap Valet parkingThey cook for you on a stone table top.They clean that stone table top often to the point where it looks glistening clean.The choices were abundant and all excellent. e.g. BBQ Squid, Spicy pork BBQ, marinated short rib, etc.Service is 5 star hotel grade.Non-stop banchan (although the selection is limited compared to some places)Music that isn't too loud so you can actually hear your friends.Need to try this place again with a party of 7 or more and see how they handle my reservation."

9/23/2010,1 star rating,"Overall experience at this restaurant was definitely below average....CRAP at best... I wish I could give negative stars for this place. Issue #1: We showed up around 8:15 on a Wed night...She told us the wait would be 30 min...but ended up being 1 hour and 15 min. Didn't get seated till around 9:30pm. Why cant they just be upfront and let us know that the wait would be an hour or so? Waste of time. Issue #2 : Finally seated...I was hoping the dining experience would make up for the long wait. The waitress definitely lacked any interpersonal/service skills. Took about another 20 min before she took our initial order. Each time we made a request, it took an avg of 20-30 min before we ever got any of our simple requests (i.e. rice, additional meat, etc). Towards the very end..she finally asks ""Do you need anything else?"" WTF? She sucked at being a server. Issue #3: The meats n' side dishes were not that great. I've definitely had better selections and better marinated meats. K-town is full of MUCH BETTER Korean bbq restaurants. Issue #4: It took 20-25 min for them to bring the bill and then another 20-25 min for them to Â run our cards. After being fed-up, we just went up to the counter and saw our cards just sitting there. Again...WTF??? Issue #5: After being annoyed with the entire experience at this ""restaurant"", I didn't leave a tip. Got in my ride with my friends and two servers came out knocking on my car window asking why the tip was zero? ARE YOU F*CK*NG KIDDING ME????? Pissed me off more that they had the nerve to come out and ask why there was no tip. REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE. Never stepping foot into this place again.Thanks Yelp for letting me vent... =)"

6/29/2013,5 star rating,"By far the best kbbq place I have been to. My cousin in law took us here for a late night food run. I thought we were just getting fast food, next thing I know we're on the freeway en route to K-town!! This place is open late (until 2am I think??) and is great if you want delicious tasting kbbq! The first time we went it was packed! And all times I've been since then it has also been busy. We had a big group too so we had to wait for a little bit. The wait was usually about twenty minutes for us. I know people usually complain about the service at places like these, but the service here is pretty good even when they're super busy. All the servers are really nice and honestly we've been there enough times that they knew us by name. And they're very accommodating. We had a big group but they pushed a smaller table up to a table with a cooktop and gave us a portable stove so we would have more cooking area. Â As for ambiance, it gets pretty deng loud in here, with the sounds of cooking, chatting, and the music they blast (usually popular top 40s type songs, not kpop). The restaurant itself has pretty cool looking decor if you ever care to look up from the addicting food. Naturally, be prepared to smell like kbbq after you leave (but that's all part of the experience of course) Onto the food!! Well what can I say this place was mouth watering good. So good that we've gone back so many times. I feel like the thing that makes this place different (in a good way) is that they don't have grill tops for you to cook on, it's a stone/marble type thing. I think it cooks the meat differently and makes it so much better! Also when it gets to the point where it's covered in burnt meat, they take shredded radish and wipe it off for you (they do this often too, so your meat always tastes its best). Their miso dip is perfect to match with any meat you order, we always find ourselves asking for more. Either way, whenever I come home to visit my family we always find ourselves going here at least once or twice during my visit. It's definitely a delicious family tradition!"

Â they only have valet parking when we arrived but we were about to find street parking (-1 star because it took 10m).arrived at 6:00pm on Wed and place was not busy. Â within 20m place totally filled up and had 12 customers waiting outside 10m later. Â most impressive part was 3 additional waiters showed up at 6:30, and additional 3 showed up at 7:00pm. Â management here perfectly timed the additional 6 staff members to account for the rush of customers, most impressive. Â every staff member smiled and knew their roles well. Â they were quick, very professional and each helped each other. Â very seldom do I encounter such a well run restaurant that can properly handle such a stress test.in the end, food was quick, well presented, and tested great. Â they did not charge us for the extra salad (we ordered 5 salads and the two of us) and the service was impeccable for being totally packed. Â very impressed with the management.-1 star for the difficult parking"
3/2/2018,4 star rating,"Food was absolutely delicious but the hostess at the front was so rude that I can't give this place five stars. I get that they're always overrun with customers and dealing with so many people waiting outside can get exhausting, but that's no excuse to talk to people in the way we were talked to this past Tuesday night. From the second we walked in and asked where we could put our name down to the moment we were seated, she was just absolutely rude to us. I hope the management sees this review and understands that it's not only about having good food."
8/9/2015,5 star rating,"The restaurant is a bit small and long lines, but it's definitely worth it. I think this was the best kbbq restaurant in LA! The meat quality was pretty good and the service was amazing! They checked in on us so often and I liked how they made kimchi fried rice in front of us after our meal. It was a very enjoyable dining experience and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family who wants to eat Korean food."

7/20/2014,5 star rating,"I feel like Hae Jang Chon is still my favorite Korean bbq restaurant. I mean they're all so good so I would never mind eating at any of them! But some of the reasons Hae Jang Chon can't be beat:-it's like $17 for a meat-filled meal that you will hate yourself for after-the kimchi fried rice at the end, which NO ONE ever has room for, but we always manage to finish it because it's yummy-the kimchi pancake!! I love pajeon-the variety of dipping sauces, mmmm! I LOVE the sour-ish one with pickled jalapenos, and all the spicy ones rock, and the salt with sesame oil is just so delicious with meat-the salad is spot on, well-dressed and tasty and fresh-open until 2 am-the boneless short rib is SOOOO GOOD-the pork belly is awesome-the bulgogi is so tasty-all the meats rock-one time my mom made me order shrimp because she doesn't really like red meat and likes seafood more, but why mom?? why would you get shrimp it takes like forever to cook and it's really not that good what are you doing with yourself-even the banchan is so good! When i'm waiting for the meat to come out or to cook, I feast on the fish cake and the green one. I don't even like green vegetables that much but it's just pickled or cooked or somethingLOVE Hae Jang Chon! Someone suggest to me a better Korean BBQ place and I will go check it out because nothing has dethroned Hae Jang Chon so far in my book"

2/3/2015,3 star rating,"First and last time I'll be visiting this over priced, minimal menu and restaurant. you can't even eat in peace without having every single waiter come to your table to flip your meat. just let me be."
5/31/2013,4 star rating,"A good AYCE korean BBQ place. Â I especially liked how they make you Kim chi fried rice at the very end of the meal, which was a very nice touch! However, Â Just like any other restaurants in K-town, I'm not a fan of the parking. Â You might have to find your own street parking for pay the meter. Also, The service wasn't that great. Â Maybe because I came during the daytime when there was only 2 servers, so I guess that is understandable. Â I just wished they were more assertive with filling my water or my side dishes. Overall, the food was good!"
2/2/2014,5 star rating,"Very clean, spacious, and well lit kbbq joint. My first time was on my 21st birthday this past weekend and I couldn't have been happier (why didn't I order soju though?)! I came here based on Yelp reviews and friend recommendations. This was my first time experience kbbq on a stone grill (the meat tastes better, imo) with servers that cook your food for you! The cooking part was a little awkward for me because I was always the person in charge of flipping and cutting the meat. There were multiple instances where the scissors were taken away from me. The server would then proceed to cut the meat like a boss, making me look like a novice.My favorites were the beef tongue, pork belly, and...kalbi? Beef tongue and pork belly are always my favorite and the meat here was pretty standard, so I enjoyed it regardless. The big surprise is that I actually liked the kalbi. I never ever get it at kbbq because I find it too heavy or chewy. The kalbi here was lighter and tender and so juicy, I was pleasantly surprised!Don't get me started on the side dishes! I've never seen so many included side dishes in my hometown so this was definitely a plus. You get the regular kimchi, radish, beansprout, soy radish, cooked veggies, mash, rice paper for wrapping, radish for wrapping, salad, and 3 types of dip/sauces. The salad was pretty good but cannot beat my favorite Tofu Hut salad. I still gobbled it up though. The rice paper is thicker than I'm used to but still worked well with the meat.I don't know of LA places usually have tripe or not, but HJC did not. I was a little bummed but no one else eats tripe so I wasn't too surprised. The servers did this cool thing to clean the grill where they dumped some white shavings (potato? radish?) and scraped the stone clean! All the nastiness went through a hole so you wouldn't have to consume burnt materials and excess fat.I love that steamed egg comes with AYCE (: This is new to me as well! The kimchi fried rice as the end most definitely hit the spot. It's very smart of them because people end up eating less meat to save room for the rice, which costs less. I don't mind at all because it just tastes that good! Then again, kimchi fried rice always tastes like that haha. Having someone make it on a stone grill in front of you makes it seem even better.The main thing that got me smiling was how little it costs for the attentive service and good food. I was shocked when the bill came! Definitely coming back next time I'm in LA.Note: Reservations are for parties of 6+."
2/1/2014,4 star rating,"Great service, tons of meat options, don't forget the steamed egg or soybean paste soup or tofu soup that comes with the AYCE, and definitely don't miss out on the awesome fried rice concoction they make at the end of the meal, hits the spot every time! Only con is the crazy wait time always! Either way, one of the better quality and better service AYCE establishments that's worth the wait."
1/31/2014,4 star rating,"In a city where there is a ton of great Korean BBQ, this wasn't too shabby. Took a star off for the less than mediocre steamed egg side and another star off for the funky tripe. Don't get me wrong, tripe is a funky meat, but I was hoping there would be a marinade to mask some of the funk. Not so. Added a star though for the yummy shiso leaf and the thin sliced pickled daikon to wrap the meaty goodness. Overall, good spot in the city."
1/29/2014,5 star rating,This place is definitely one of the better KBBQ's I've been to. I went on a Thursday night with some friends and there was a pretty long wait for a table. The environment inside looked very nice but also very busy. The service is a little rushed but they do pay attention to the customer as best as they can and you can't expect much more from a place that is this popular and that busy at the time. This place was on the cheaper side compared to the other Korean Barbeque places I've been to and it's definitely worth the money for the food you get. Parking is a bit of a hassle but if you get lucky there is no problem.
1/29/2014,4 star rating,"Are you really hungry for a lot of meat and are you looking for a quintessential eating experience in Los Angeles? Do you have $20+? Well, if you are looking for a lot of this meat and this experience in Los Angeles, this place is one option. This city has a really large Korean population and this place is probably one of the most popular Korean barbecue restaurants in Los Angeles, and was recommended by a few people who grew up in this city. This place usually has a long waiting time, especially on Friday nights after 10 PM, (1.5+ hours) but lunch time in the afternoon during a Saturday is a slightly better option (10-30 minutes). Street parking will be really hard to find but we got lucky. We came to this place on a Saturday afternoon. The all you can eat barbecue meat special has a huge variety of beef, pork and seafood options. It is about $20 and you will get your stomach really full. Portions are excellent. My personal favorites were the beef bulgogi, short rib, brisket, the pork belly and the barbecue squid. I really liked the flavor and the juicy tenderness of the meats and the texture of the squid was great. Getting some of those meats with rice made them tastier. The Kimchi Pancake was excellent and was a great complement to the meats. I really like the texture, it was not overly crispy and the flavor was good. The egg soup was also a great complement. It was also great that they provided salad so you can get your dosage of vegetables to try to balance out the meat portions. The banchan side dishes, such as the kimchi and pickled radishes were not bad and also were great garnishes for the barbecue meats. Don't expect really good service, but I could tell that the servers try fairly hard to make your eating experience enjoyable. Overall, I thought I had some of the tastiest Korean barbecue meats and seafood in Los Angeles so far. After eating at this place, I did not want to eat Korean barbecue meats for a long time and I didn't eat dinner until really late. That was how good it was. I would not come back here often, unless I have a really good healthy diet with more fresh vegetables and an intense exercise routine before and after."
1/27/2014,5 star rating,"Hands down, one of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ joints in LA."
1/27/2014,4 star rating,"I feel like I've been here before, but I'm not quite sure. This place had good reviews and I liked the menu they had for the price. I can't eat marinated meat anymore since I found out I have Celiac disease :( so I need to have Â a place that has a good amount of non marinated meat. We waited for about an hour. It was super busy, even on a Sunday night. There were quite a few of the side dishes and most were pretty good. The meat I would say as of medium quality, but it wasn't amazing. The service was fast and fairly friendly. We also had a vegan with us and they accommodated with the bibimbap dish, which was really nice. So, one person with an allergy, and another with a pretty strict diet and we were both pretty satisfied.Would I recommend this place? Yeah I think so. Would I come back again? Possibly, but honestly I still feel Road To Seoul has still been the best place for me."
1/26/2014,4 star rating,"Arrived around 11pm with a party of 7 and we were seated pretty quickly (~10 minutes). Our table was pretty small for a party of 7, but the servers were very attentive and made sure there was a tray setup to the side for us to put the meat and banchan on during the course of the meal.The selection of meat was pretty good, though not as good as I would have liked for $19. The brisket had good flavor to it, though parts were excessively fatty and difficult to chew. The pork belly was also fatty (to be expected) but had excellent flavor. The bulgolgi was not overly marinated and the flavor was subtle enough where it didn't dropkick you in the mouth with saltiness. The beef tongue was probably the best meat out of the bunch though, being super thinly sliced and full of flavor. The shrimp was mediocre, and could be skipped over.Overall, I would return here again as I did enjoy both the meats and the banchan. Make sure to bring cash if you come at night though, since the parking is valet only."
1/25/2014,4 star rating,"Six of us celebrated my birthday here at the recommendation of a colleague. Enjoyed the meal and liked that the staff helped grill and cut our selections. Recommend the BBQ pork, chicken, beef tongue. Thought the brisket was too fatty and bulgogi tough. Liked the fact we could get the AYCE kimchee pancakes, steamed egg and kimchee fried rice. Definitely go if in K-Town but also think Manna in downtown LA is great for AYCE KBBQ ."
1/25/2014,1 star rating,"i normally dont write reviews but this was a must. when we arrived the servers seemed fine until i started pressing the button for someone to take my order. the server came back and told me to never press the button again because the manager was getting mad at him. SO I CAN'T PRESS A BUTTON TO ASK FOR SERVICE WHEN NO ONE WOULD SERVE ME WHEN I RAISE MY HAND? To make matters worse, when the server came back to take my credit card slip, he had to look at how much tip i gave him. WHAT IS THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE? good food but would never come back for a service like this"
5/19/2009,4 star rating,"I *heart* Korean BBQ! Â The only thing I love more are carbs. Â Seriously, I'm a major carb whore. Â Pasta, rice, you name it, I'll eat it!Like half the restaurants in K-town, for $16.99 you can get all you can eat Korean BBQ. Â The meat is a little on the fatty side, but yummy. Â What sets this place apart from all the other AYCE places is the selection. Â They offer cuttlefish and squid in addition to chicken, short rib, brisket and pork belly. Â It also comes with kimchi pancakes and kimchi fried rice. Â Both of which were soooooooooooo good. Â I really wish they would make the fried rice in the beginning so you could eat it with the meat.The waiters also clean your grill with radishes. Â It's really mesmerizing. Â They dump shredded radishes onto the grill and move them around with spatulas. Â Magically the radishes start taking on a brownish color and looks like noodles by the time the grill is clean. Â One of my friends was tempted to eat it but the waiter promised it would taste gross.Try this place if you're looking for more than a quick meat fix. Â Save room for the carbs! Â Also, it's a good idea to go early. Â I went there at 6 and there was no wait, but by 6:30 there was a pretty long wait."
10/10/2011,4 star rating,All I gotta say is that we definitely need one of these places in SF.The variety of meats they offer..The great prices they offer..The way they clean the grilling plate in between..I will definitely drop by this place again when I'm back in LA
5/25/2015,5 star rating,Found a new AYCE kbbq spot for us girls to go to! Meats are deelish and of quality! Service was awesome! Gets super busy! $21.99 for dinner and weekends. $19.99 for lunch and weekdays. Our faves are the marinated short ribs and Canadian thinly sliced bacon!
2/26/2012,5 star rating,"CUSTOMER SERVICE: Yes this Kbbq place actually has that. They have really awesome customer service if I may add. Your side dished are set up before you get sat. They make sure that you never run low on your side dishes. People actually ask to see how you are doing. They clean your grill when they see that it's getting a bit dirty. All of this service and I do not need to track down my waiter. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!PRICE: A little bit pricier but totally worth it. About $20 after tax.FOOD: I love their bulgogi. They have one of the best ever. Brisket is not bad either. Sides are dericious. They have my favorite odeng (fish cakes) sorry my korean friends if I have butchered this name, I tried. Lots of greens.AMBIANCE: Very casual fun environment. Good for small groups.LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I always come here for my kbbq cravings. The best especially for non-koreans. Â PS they even cook you some kimchi fried rice at the end."

1/8/2013,4 star rating,"They always seem to be busy when I visit so expect slow service (yet friendly), but delicious food! I'm obsessed with their thin pork belly and kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal! I purposefully don't stuff my face with so much meat so I can eat the fried rice. It is loaded with kimchi and nori (dried seaweed). So flavorful! mm mmm mm! My other favorite is one of their banchan (side dishes) that is the green veggie. If anyone knows what kind of vegetable it is, please let me know! DELICIOUS!Parking: limited. I try to visit when they open at 11am so I can self park. When I can't come early, they charge $2 for parking....SOMETIMES. I was never charged until my last visit to this shopping plaza. Confusing and maybe this guy was pocketing the money? Who knows.Cost: Â $18 for all you can eat! Â So much food for such a good price! You get Korean miso bean paste soup, Kimchi pancake (crispy!), egg soup and the fried rice included in the AYCE."
7/15/2011,4 star rating,"Oh hey, one of my new favorite all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ joints. Let's just sum up this place in a nutshell: it's all you can eat..duh (bulgogi, brisket, pork belly, beef tongue, chicken, etc). Don't expect the finest quality, but it's definitely a ""bang for your buck"" (AKA $16.99 per person). I don't think the quality is as good as Road To Seoul, but it's MUCH better than Manna (ew) and O Dae San (...barf). It's tastes really delicious too, especially when you're hungry and you just wanna stuff yourself sily. OH! And the waiters are super friendly and nice. I don't know what they're saying half the time, but they're always smiling....for some weird reason."

We came in a party of 11, i got here early and i asked them to save me a table for 12 I'm not really sure on how much people will show up and with the FLAKE rate in LA you'll never know but i know i have some friends who knows how to keep their word. We all had the AYCE KBBQ and odered some alcohol too. All i can say is that most of their meats areawesome!!! I ordered the intestine its just too chewy its worst than eating a rubber eraser. Â But most of the stuffs are good. I like their kimchi pancake too.One thing i hate about this place is that the servers pretend that they remember every order and they don't write anything. FUCK that you have to keep buzzing them and reminding them your order especially when they get busy. Â I will be back with a smaller group and more alcohol."

12/11/2009,5 star rating,"Love love LOVE Hae Jang Chon. Â LOVE that pig.Formerly a regular Kbbq restaurant with meats ordered a la carte, they decided to step it up and become an AYCE to compete with other establishments in the area. Â This was by far one of their best decisions ever, and they now have a strong lead against other Kbbq restaurants.Hae Jang Chon does an excellent job of setting itself apart from most Korean BBQ restaurants, starting with the kimchi fried rice and kimchi pajun. Â Most restaurants give you meat, side dishes, salad, and dduk (rice cake wrap,) and call it a day. Â Hae Jang Chon knows that even after eating a whole cow and then some, you still have room for a sizzling heap of kimchi fried rice. Â Call me greedy, but I want what I pay for. Â And if they give me just that and then some, I am a happy camper. Â Hand in hand with the food quantity, the food quality is superb. Â The meats are thick and portions are generous. Â These aren't day-old meats - they are fresh, and the bright red colors of the meat speak for themselves. Â Service is fast and friendly. Â Be sure to make use of that little button on the table. Â Best invention since sliced bread.You also get kind of a Benihana style show with your meal. Â After cooking several rounds of meat on your stone pan, the server comes by with a bowl of radishes to clean off the gunk. Â Pretty cool to watch and always entertaining to see the radishes remove the gunk so fast. Â Food - A+Service - A+Ambience - A+Price - A+Yep."
9/2/2011,2 star rating,"===================Act 1, Scene 1====================== Three of us enter into Hae Jang Chon and wait near the doorway as the young girl with bushy eyebrows at the register sees us come in. Three-quarters of the restaurant remains empty and two servers are just idling around. We wait patiently as the girl with bushy eyebrows (""GWBE"") continues to help a party paying their bill and yet doesn't say one word to us. GWBE finishes helping the party and begins to count all the money in the register. Several excruciating minutes pass. ME: ""Excuse me..."" GWBE: ""I'll be with you in a minute."" ME: ""Okay."" Several more excruciating minutes pass totaling in an unreasonable amount of time elapsed. ME: ""Excuse me. Do you think we could just seat ourselves? We've been standing here for a really long time."" GWBE: ""Oh, really? Oh, okay, you can just sit at that table over there."" End scene. WTF! What kind of response is ""Oh, really?"" She obviously saw us standing there and the other servers saw us standing there as well. There were no apologies or anything. I almost felt compelled to yank on her bushy eyebrows. The service throughout the meal was mediocre at best. The food is decent here, but the service is atrocious."
6/18/2013,4 star rating,They charge you extra for rice while you eat the meat and for vegetables to wrap your saam in. BUT other than that the meat was quite good. The marinated kalbi was really salty but the non marinated kalbi was pretty good. The best was the chadol Lord blessed it. It really was the best chadol I've had in a long time. They give you kimchi fried rice on the pan where you fry the meat after and kimchi pancakes... they were pretty good. I enjoyed the food and service. They're open until 2 AM too so it's a good place for late night hang out.
11/3/2013,5 star rating,This is my favorite Korean BBQ spot in LA.. The food is amazing the service is great the vibe is super chill they always have good music playin.. The brisket and bbq beef are so good and the fried rice at the end is the best part.. If ur ever in the area deff come give this place a try!!
9/28/2012,3 star rating,"This restaurant has been on my bookmark list forever and I finally had a chance to stop by. Â Unfortunately, I brought the wrong friend with me! Â She ate like 7 pieces of meat and decided she was full, which ruined my appetite because I hate to be the only person eating at the table. $16.99 for all you can eat korean bbq isn't bad and their items are pretty fresh as well. Â However, I feel like they should have more seafood items in the menu. Â Perhaps, give the customers options to pick between regular korean bbq for $16.99 or upgrade to a korean bbq&seafood for slightly higher pricing. Â The flavor wasn't exactly the best but still pretty good for an all-you-can-eat place. Â I still prefer the korean bbq short rib's flavor at my favorite Young Dong Tofu in Arcadia.Even though I thought it was pretty decent but I probably won't be coming back here again due to the the crazy traffic around this area, lack of parking, and lack of seafood items. Â It's time to try other all-you-can-eat korean bbq that have been in my bookmarks for so long. Â Who knows, one of these days I will decide to stop by this restaurant again if I can't find another good korean bbq place."
1/22/2008,3 star rating,"Pretty good Korean BBQ at a great price - 17 bucks!The place stays busy so the side dishes are fresh and the meat is pretty good, and endless.The best part of the meal is the fried rice made on the stone pan that the meat was grilled on ... yummy.Not so good is the soup that comes with it - more like a diluted, luke-warm broth. Order a stew instead.This is a good place if you need a Kalbi fix and don't want to spend $50 doing so.Oh, don't bother trying to read the sign - not in English - just look for the cartoon pig."

8/22/2014,4 star rating,"We arrived here just before 7pm on a thursday and the wait was just starting up. I think we just missed the wave! As we were waiting for full party to arrive (they do not seat incomplete parties) I noticed more and more people arriving. We had 4 adults plus a toddler. Probably waited only about 20 minutes.Ambiance is casual, slightly modern design with a flat screen tv up on the wall. sound level is lively! --perfect to drown out a toddler who likes to call out in a loud voice from time to time.When we sat down all the sides and sauces were there on the table to greet us. 4 dipping sauces--sesame oil with a salty seasoning, a chili paste?, soy sauce with some pickled veggies?, and a chili sauce that looked like sambal olek to me. There was also a fresh green salad tossed in a vinegarette. Starving, we started eating the sides right away. I really liked the spicy fish cake side. From looking at other poster's pics, i noticed we did not get the garlic and jalapeÃ±os!Next time I will be sure to ask for that. i think the roasted garlic would be delicious with the meat.We ordered the AYCE. question--does anybody NOT order the AYCE? I was really impressed with all the meat choices they have.Our friends had been there before so they started us off right. We got thebeef brisket, pork belly (thin sliced), bulgogi,chicken, calbi,kim chi pancakes (yum) pork shoulder, beef tongue, baby octopus, thick cut pork belly, honeycomb tripe. I know i'm missing some because the bill had 15 items. My favorites were the calbi (short rib) and the octopus. i liked to wrap the meat in the rice paper noodle and dip dip away! Other reviews mention soup?? We did not get any. hmmm...We did order the steam egg and kimchi fried rice which comes at the end.Like resurfacing the ice during hockey intermissions the servers will use scrapers, water and shredded radish to clean off the stone if needed. We had ours done twice. Wonder if that means we ate a lot? I think we did pretty well. We were stuffed at the end! No leftover meat to be charged 15$ for but when i asked one of the servers if it was 15$ per person or for the table he said they never enforce it. Service was pretty attentive! and friendly! One server was really nice to my 2 year old, talked to her, said hi, etc. which any parent of a toddler knows its nice to have a distraction if only for a few bites of uninterrupted calbi! :) Someone was always stopping by to ask if we wanted to order more meat which i guess some could see as a rushing tactic but was fine by me. They did forget some things we ordered somewhere around round 3 or 4 but no problem since they stopped by so much if we didn't get it we'd just order it again.The only thing that was disappointing was the kim chi fried rice. Now i LOVE fried rice and i love kim chi but this fried rice was VERY heavy on the kim chi and tasted so sour ! my korean friend commented that it must be an older kim chi so maybe that's why it had more ""funk"" to it. Different tasting than the kim chi on the table paired with delicious sprouts of which we ate 2 plates! Also the seaweed in it gave it a really fishy taste. It was just too vinegary and fishy. Too bad because I love kim chi and korean seaweed usually. What i think would be really scrumptious is if the stone was super hot and created a crispy crust on the rice, like bibimbap. Our bill for 4 was a little over 100$ not too shabby! Especially since we ordered 2 large beers to share. We would definitely revisit."
4/25/2016,4 star rating,Good food at a good price. I won't go into each meat. You know what you like. It's all good.It sure gets crowded. You can end up waiting for 2 hours to be seated on a Friday or Saturday evening.Stays open 'til 2AM. That's a huge plus.Good service.
3/27/2011,5 star rating,Oh this place is sooo good! It's KBBQ on a cast iron pot instead of the grill. It has a little hole that all the fat drains down out of. I've never had grilled kimchee until this place either. And those kimchee pancakes were so darn good I wanted more! The meat quality was good.Service was excellent! A ring of the bell and they are there in seconds. You request something and you'll have that in minutes.You don't leave the place smelling like smoke like other kbbq places which can be a plus.I totally forgot to get the fried rice at the end but there will defiantly be a next time!
4/7/2012,5 star rating,"They upped their price from 16.99 to 17.99! This means that with tax and tip, it's now $23 instead of $21 per person :) hope this saves you all time in figuring out how to split the bill!See the old review for reviews on the place :) Oh, they also don't take reservations unless it's 6-8 people minimum!"
3/28/2010,5 star rating,"Whenever I get a hankering for KBBQ, I head over here. Just a warning, if you are into the marinade stuff, go somewhere else. I've had better. BUT if you want unmarinated delicious meat which is actually not the cheap stuff at most AYCE, go to HaeJangChon.For 16.99 you get an unbeatable selection with all the bells and whistles. Of course they give you the steamed egg, the salad, the rice paper, the daikon wrap, and all the side dishes. They also give you 4 different types of sauce to dip into to your hearts content. On the stone plate/grill kimichi and spicy beansprouts are gradually grilled while kimichi pancakes stay warm on top of them. Next to them, your choice of way too many different types of meat cook to perfection as fat rolls down to the bottom and out a hole to be collected. Once you are done with the meat, they'll use daikon to clean off the plate/grill and prepare your kimchi fried rice. . . just as you thought you were about to burst! While you chow down on the rice, they'll bring you dwen jahng jji gae (a korean soup sort of like miso with a spicy kick and more intense flavor)What meats to get? Pork belly- You are obligated to get one of these thick slices of bacon. It's very fatty so make sure you let it swim liberally in the spicy vinegary sauce with the daikon. Cha dole bay geh- it's a thinly sliced version of the bacon, but I think it might be beef instead of pork, don't quote me on it! It's sort of like the yoshinoya beef. Cheap, fatty, but pretty delicious. Unmarinated galbi-This is easily my fav here. The rib meat is so nicely marbled that it won't stick to the plate/grill, and it tastes naturally buttered! The perfect texture to eat by itself, or to wrap in a rice paper wrap with salad. This is where the money's at! Whatever you get, you will enjoy. Just try to come early because even on week days they get crazy long waits for dinner."
12/4/2012,4 star rating,"My friend and I came here on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving for dinner. I used to come here a lot and could not remember the name!! I was so mad I hadn't yelped this place before! Maybe I was traumatized when I brought a ghetto fabulous friend who had no manners! She took off her shoes during dinner and got mad when the chicks next to us kept looking at her feet so she wanted to start a fight. UGH. I was so embarrased and wanted to just walk out and leave her there. But I digress. Anyway, after much searching and driving we found the place...yay! My memory served me correct after commenting to my friend that, ""I think there's a Shiseido next to it"". We. Were. Starving!!! That stone plate could not heat up fast enough. We ordered thick pork belly, bbq chicken, short ribs, and bulgogi in round 1. I guess our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we kept ordering and in the end we had so much meat left and were told we would be charged extra. Yikes. We tried scarfing those suckers down to the point of nausea. I can laugh about it now but I was tired, cold, but full. It's definitely one of the cheaper choices of AYCE KBBQ. My only complaint is, maybe I'm still a novice but I really don't know what the condiments are and how to use them. I just eat the salad, potato salad and ask for steamed rice....which means I don't get the kimchi rice in the end. It has its share of hipster crowd and I've seen families and people on dates. It's a pretty cool spot. Street parking sucks though so it's pretty much valet only."
5/5/2012,5 star rating,"ONE OF THE BEST KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANTS EVER!!! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, BRISKET IS TOO BOMB, SHORT RIBS IS BOMB DOT COM!!! also, the water taste great. They get you a table at least 30 minutes or less. but really pricey though. $17.99 all you can eat but every food that goes down into your mouth is worth every bite of it. I'll be going back again but probably another 3 months or so. SHORT RIBS & BRISKET FOR THE WIN!!! OHH AND...F**K You FURUSATO, J KBBQ, CASTLE BBQ & MAE DANG SAI!!! HAE JANG CHON IS THE SHIZZZNIT!!!"
4/13/2013,5 star rating,"Of all the KBBQ restaurant, Hae Jang Chon is excellent. It is well ventilated, the meat selection are broad, and the service is exceptional. In addition, the side dishes are better, with fish cakes and broccoli. The method to which they clean their grills is unorthodox yet efficient. There's no $9.99 for just brisket, which is like the only meat I really enjoy eating, but nonetheless, 2 thumbs up."
8/15/2012,5 star rating,"5 stars for a Korean bbq joint. This place is my favorite. Not only is it cheap and AYCE, but you get a good assortment of sides including salad, kimchi, other banchan, steamed egg, and kimchi pancake. They also have rice papers if you dig it. At the end of your meal they come and make kimchi fried rice with your leftovers. I've never actually gotten to this part because I stuff myself with meat (twss) before I quit, thus leaving no room for measly carbs. Parking is valet only and it's just $2. Very convenient. They're pretty quick about it too. Just budget a longer wait if you're there during prime time and weekends. Up to an hour is not out of the ordinary."
9/26/2012,3 star rating,"Came here for the first time years ago, didn't realize that this was the same place until i showed up for dinner. There was never a wait when I came before, I guess its that LA times article that boosted their business. First off, the wait. On a saturday night, we showed up around 630, waited for almost 2 hours for a party of 2 (probably would have only taken 1 hour at Road to Seoul). There is definitely something odd about the 49 person occupancy, thus, almost half the restaurant is empty. Guessing they were either fined by the fire marshall or something. The patio is ""under construction,"" no, its not, i remember it use to be open...it was the ""outdoor"" smoking section, clever until they got caught bc technically, its indoors. its 17.99 per person, the hostess at the register wasnt too friendly, but the wait staff was. good selection of meats, fresh, delicious. but in all honesty, i dont think i'd wait 2 hours again just to eat for 1 hour"
6/15/2010,5 star rating,"it's been so long since i've been to an all you can eat (ayce) bbq place, that once i started eating, i realized that i can't eat as much as i could before!! but i feel that i ate $17-worth of meat.first thing first, i did NOT touch any of the sides so i won't be full. we ordered the beef brisket(super thinly sliced frozen coiled meat), marinated beef short ribs (nice marbled thick tender meat), pork belly (semi-thin frozen coiled meat), and beef tongue ( thinly sliced frozen meat). despite most of them being frozen, they were all good quality meats, all white & red colored- meaning they are FRESH, and the grill it uses for these meats is this thick black stone, so it can keep the temperature HOT and the meats grilled to perfection in no time. we had piles & piles of meat on our plate, and i was so busy grilling & eating.the people working there were very attentive. every time our grill emptied, someone came right away to ask if we wanted more meat. woooo! haha. at one point we wanted more tea, but ppl were busy so we rang our little digital bell, and someone came right away. seemed like every one else was pressing their bells at their tables too, so it's not one of those places where pressing that buzzer is any way offensive to the waiters.we ate some of the sides later once we started getting full, and didn't finish most of them. i left the place full & happy. i definitely recommend the short ribs!"
9/5/2015,4 star rating,good all you can eat korean bbq located in koreatown. the food is good and most are marinated. service is good too. the price point was not bad. $20 each person.
2/23/2010,4 star rating,"Neat. Clean. Great Service.After abandoning the mess that was the street food fair we ventured here. I can't get into details because I was gone offf the Hite and Soju. I liked everything but the bulgogi . It Â wasn't marinated enough for me. Fresh salad, rice cakes and sesame tofu. We didn't leave room for the friend rice."
4/14/2010,4 star rating,"Their service + cleanliness is super top notch - we had about 3-4 servers tend to our huge group of 13 people.16.99 for AYCE KBBQ which includes a huge gamut of meats to choose from - beef brisket, tongue, chicken, hot dog (yes...), octopus, squid, pork brisket, kalbi... just to name a few --- either marinated or not. They even have tortillas if you want to make your own kbbq taco. Also they make kimchi fried rice for you! A good assortment of banchans, but none that I particularly liked. They do give you pancakes! I really liked their salad too and they give you an egg custard. Also - two different types of wrappers - the veggie + rice one. Servers came by periodically to check up on us and replace the griddle. They even helped us cook from time to time. Just overall a great experience for a large gathering. BTW, this place starts filling up at 5pm so if you can get there before then... you'll definitely have the best service ever!"
4/11/2015,4 star rating,"went there with my family and we throughly enjoyed it...the service was really good...our waitress was on the ball...anytime we asked for anything we got it promptly (which is usually lacking in a lot of K BBQ places)...the meats are good and well marinated...the sides are yummy (not much of a variety but good enough)...i loved that they charged half for my 5 yr old niece...a lot of places charge full price for any kid over 2 (i mean really, they're not going to eat like we at)...the place is super small and packed (for good reason)...be warned, if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait...there is some street parking but i suggest the valet (its $2 or $3)...we definitely had our fill of Korean BBQ...definitely recommend this place...oh and i love the stone grill...i think the meats taste better..."
8/10/2014,4 star rating,"this place is consistently good, with consistently good service. idk why i still prefer road to seoul. the staff is quite pleasant and really manage to keep their cool in spite of having to race from table to table at 100 mph. you emerge from this place full, garlicy, content, and bemused at the hordes of people still waiting outside. price point not horrible at 18.99 pp. le fin."
11/13/2012,5 star rating,"BEST ACYE KBBQ, EVER! (Sorry, Hwang's, I feel like I'm cheating on you...)Heard a lot of hype from friends and finally had the chance to come here on a Friday night. And it lives up to the hype. Got in around 11:30pm as a party of 2, and waited for almost an hour (good thing we were waiting in the car and watching Top Gun so the wait wasn't too bad). The host, Daniel, Â was on top of everything! He's very efficient in seating guests and figuring out which party goes next. The waiter took our orders fairly quickly and our food came out as we requested, smaller portion of everything (so we could try everything!). The meat was juicy and well marinated and the rice paper was big enough to make wraps (woot!). The waiters were very friendly and constantly came by to help us cook the meat and check up on us.The only thing I would recommend (seems like other Yelpers have the same idea) is to have the kimchi fried rice WITH the meat. Oh Yums.Great food, great price, with friendly and efficient service. You can't get better than this.P.s: valet service outside when the parking lot gets too crowded."
3/4/2010,4 star rating,"When I'm looking for some easy meat in the middle of the night, I come to Ktown. Â When I fail, I go to Hae Jang Chon. Â Why?1. They're open until TWO AM in the morning. Â No other table top kbbq place opens this late.2. They're hygenic. Â Poor waiters come after every serving of meat to scrape everything off your grill with a form of white radish. Â Once, we saw that she missed a spot, so we used some leftover spicy radish to clean off the grease - and boom - waitress comes back and cleans the entire grill.3. They're the Marco Polos of Ktown. Â The workers here actually speak decent English and try to help you eat the Korean way. Â Come one, come all, you gringos.4. Â They serve hot dogs. Â Now that's f*ing authentic. Â Show me an asian who doesn't like hot dogs! Â They don't exist!Just a tip - the chado is just a-ok and the unmarinated ribs don't taste as tender as it should, for something with that much fat in it. Â The marinated beef is also hit and miss. Â If you want consistently good meat, aim for the marinated ribs."
4/12/2011,4 star rating,The staff is so awesome here. They sometimes seem understaffed but GIVEN this limitation it's amazing. Plus their hours rock since they're open till 2AM.Meat is good since the tongue and brisket rock. The pork belly and bulgogi are meeehh but that might just be my personal preference.$22/person inc t/t for AYCE meat buffet.
5/20/2010,4 star rating,"Do we really need another review on this joint?Probably not. I skimmed the spew from my friends, 'favorites,' etc... and found that they covered most of the angles.Of course, me being a curious monkey and a bit of a glutton for meat punishment, one can only truly learn by doing (and gorging!) ;OPSo, what did i conclude after this meaty feast?1. THE MEAT--definitely above average quality for an AYCE but i'm not sure it's the BEST i've had for AYCE. Though i must say the Chadolbegi (brisket), Kalbi, Bulgogi, and Pork Belly (got the thick slice, not the thin one--our server recommended the thick one) were all quite tasty.2. THE BANCHAN-yea, not the best. Only got about 4 items and none were that deelish (aka the potato salad and spinach in particular), though the Banchan-esque 'extras' were a welcome addition (such as kimchi jun pancakes and steamed egg, and the Kimchi Fried Rice/Miso Soup combo which followed at the end of the meal--MAKE ROOM FOR IT NO MATTER HOW STUFFED YOU PIGGIES ALL ARE!)***Oh, and one TIP--if you'd like a tiny bit of green in your meal (other than the AYCE side salad they give you), then i recommend to order up a side of the lettuce/leaf wraps. Sure it will cost u an additional 5 bucks but it's well worth it (our server offered bottomless lettuce/leaf plates but as we only finished one, we didn't make use of that and actually i'm not sure that's their standard policy to provide AYCE lettuce/leafs for 5 bucks flat)...3. THE SERVICE--Our lovely server Ms. Clara K. was really smiley and friendly, and very instructive/suggestive with the dishes. She even warned us about the Kimchi Fried Rice/Miso to follow at the end of the meal, and was very attentive with the 'more meat? more meat?' inquiries. Alas, we were kinda wimpy with the meat orders, even joking that we must be the kind of table which turns a profit for the joint due to our eyes being bigger than our stomachs. She diplomatically chuckled, 'well, i'd say you guys are about average in what you ordered and ate.'Additional props to the host for hooking us up with seats in less than the 10-15 minute wait she had promised us, though we did have to sit in the smoking section on the patio to get these seats.4. THE SCENEManna (on Olympic) it is not. No ginormous parties of 30 or more celebrating b-day parties with raucous 'champagne' spewing and obnoxious 'Happy Bars-Day' K-Pop blaring every 20 mins or so. Well, we did hear one 'Happy Bars-Day' montage but it was in and out after about a minute and no alcohol trajectories sprayed our way, cuz there wuz none. Â If you are the kinda peep who is disappointed by this more chill enviro you get over at HJC, then i say, 'Get Thee to a Manna-ry!'DONE."
9/30/2011,4 star rating,"After spending an exhausting afternoon furniture shopping along Wilshire and Western, the fella rewarded my fatigue sofa testing self with ACYE Korean BBQ. Being that this was our second Hae Jang Chon dining experience, we knew what were the must haves. For $16.99/person, we indulged in tender deliciousness! Our personal favorites are the: bulgogi, Black Angus brisket, and Canadian fresh pork belly (thick slice), and the Korean pancakes. All items are very fresh, tender, and well-marinated (bulgogi.) The only downside, similar to other AYCE Korean BBQ joints, is that you can tell that the quality of the meat slightly downgrades as you accumulate your rounds. Maybe like all foods, the meat didn't taste as amazing since we were getting fuller with each round, but we both agreed that we noticed a diminish to taste between round 1 and 2. Even with the diminish, the food was still delicious! The only downside to our linner was the soup. Maybe it was just an off day, but I was not too crazy about the soy bean paste soup. It was extremely salty! One interesting difference that I notice at Hae Jang Chon is that rather than changing your tilted grilling plate, the servers come by half way through your meal and clean off the burnt stains with water and radish. Nifty trick! Overall, this place is one of the tastier AYCE joints...just as long as you don't drink the soy bean paste soup."
12/19/2010,4 star rating,"I had to wait about 2 hours before I finally got a chance to eat here. This place is pretty busy, given it is an all-you-can-eat korean bbq. Their customer service is supreme. They always come back around to make sure you never run out of food on your table. They had several variety of side dishes, and the kimchi was decent. Their kim chi fried rice, 2 thumbs up. Way UP!! A must try. OH! And if it's your birthday, they go ALL OUT! Disco lights, birthday song, everything. It's pretty hilarious, but nonetheless, you're bound to have a good time here if you come with your friends.TIPS: It's an ALL YOU CAN EAT! GOT IT?!"
4/2/2010,4 star rating,"This used to be my favorite allyoucaneat Korean BBQ place.Their meat quality is good, and I like the rice paper (dduk bo ssam) that you can wrap your meat with. I also like their salad, which is a big thing for me, and the jalapeno soysauce dip with mustard. Only thing is I personally don't like the thick pork belly that most people go there for so yea, if you like 'chun gyup sal', some special part of the pok belly, you should def try this place out :)"
5/21/2012,5 star rating,"Amazing.After attending the last Clippers game of the season (we lost), I was craving for some KBBQ. It was 11pm and after going to 3 different KBBQ places that stopped accepting customers an hour before they close, we ended up here. There was still a 30 minute wait but boy was it worth it.When we were seated, our plates and our side dishes were already set up. We first ordered some pork shoulder, angus brisket, and BBQ Pork. The food came and was quickly placed on the stone grill. They were all delicious. Then our fluffy egg and kimchi pancake came out and they were delicious. The thing that blew me away is the service. They cleaned our grill at least 4 times and checked up on us whenever they could. I'm glad we bumped into this place and would come back here if we ever have the chance."
3/21/2010,5 star rating,"We have been to many Korean BBQ joints in Los Angeles and this is the only place that made me want to go home and write about in Yelp. It's a good thing..... as we left this place happy and very satisfied. I have nothing against ChoSun Galbee, Parks BBQ, Shik Do Rak, Soot Bull Jeep and even Manna's AYCE, but truly this place is a good example of quality, good service and value. For $16.99 per person, you have can choose from the usual beef brisket, short ribs (marinated or unmarinated), thin or thick pork belly, BBQ chix, beef bulgogi, spicy BBQ pork, pork shoulder and hotdog. You can even choose to have the beef honeycomb and even squid if you have the tastes for such. And of course, the spread consist of the typical banchan plus kimchi pancake, rice paper wrap, steamed egg and a choice of regular steamed white rice or kimchi fried rice. My favorite and the most tastiest for me was the unmarinated short rib, Yum, yum, yum!!! The short rib had really nice marbling and wow, that rich beef taste just made want to have more, more, more..... the marinated short rib was good though it can use a bit more flavor in the marinated, but boy was the meat tender! The brisket was tasty and this time we tried the THIN pork belly which came sliced & rolled just like the beef brisket. None of this meat needed any dipping in their soy, garlic and vinegar dip -- that is how good of a quality they are... all you taste is the natural flavor of the meat and of course, it its own fat. Speaking of their soy, garlic & vinegar dip, their version came with what I think pickled little pieces of daikon which made the dip better than others I've had from other Korean BBQ joints. The kimchi pancake was great heated on the stone grill especially crispy and their kimchi fried rice is even better with a nice addition of the sesame oil . It reminded me of the rice served with bibimpap after it has been sitting in that hot stone bowl. The bean paste soup was nice as it was balanced and not overwhelmingly spicy. It definitely was a nice finish to the meal. The service was fast and efficient. The wait staff was very polite and spoke English. I have no complaints. I saw one waitress cover up a customers jacket which was hanging over a chair so that his jacket will be filled with grease splatters from the tabletop stone grill. Now, how many restaurants do you see that type of service.. I am definitely impressed. Overall, my hubby and I are very happy with Hae Jang Chon and, we will be coming back for sure with family and friends. The quality of their food is definitely higher than most AYCE BBQ joints and even higher-end Korean BBQ joints. The service is everything a picky customer can ask for and the value is just incredible. This is one of our great finds!"
7/5/2011,1 star rating,"This place does NOT represent the best of LA's Korean BBQ whatsoever!Now before you assume that I don't know what I'm talking about, I eat out at Korean places with my Korean boyfriend all the time. Since moving to LA, we have been to numerous kalbi/BBQ places and have found some to be fantastic, some okay, and this one: NOT OKAY. This review is based on comparisons to at least eight other kalbi places around the Koreatown area.- Ambiance: Very American-ized, the waiters speak English to you before they speak Korean. I have learned the main phrases in Korean and when we go out to eat at these places, I am fully prepared to speak in Korean because those are the best places. They know true Korean food. Hae Jang Chon does not.- Waitstaff: Very slow and unresponding. We had to request our side dishes to be brought out, and even though we are TWO people and therefore paying for TWO AYCE's, they would only bring one steamed egg, pancake, and soup. WTF? Also, when we got our first order of meat, the waiter came out, said nothing, tossed ONE beef brisket on the skillet and walked away to assist another family. Said absolutely nothing. We felt very unwelcome and the meat took over 15 minutes to come out whenever we requested more. We were out of water for about 10 minutes and when we flagged down a waitress to bring us some more, she brings out a pitcher and sets it on the other side of the table where we can't reach it and walks away. We came in at about 5pm where the place was not busy yet so there is no excuse for this poor service. Nobody came to assist us when we needed it, nobody came to bring us our check.- Food: This is the greatest downfall yet. The soup was cheap (says my 100% Korean bf), and we both agreed the Kalbi was terrible. We've had MUCH more flavorful and less fatty pieces at other places! We both had to spit out a few pieces because it was SO full of fat - it was really gross. That is called CHEAP, low-quality kalbi. They also only brought out half a serving at a time. The bulgogi was more like bul-GROSS-gi. The flavor was unappetizing. The only thing I thought that was actually edible here was the beef brisket. But you don't go out and pay $16.99 for a beef brisket meal! You want the full circle. The potato salad side dish, like many other Yelpers on here agree, was also yuck compared to a ton of other great places around here. The cooking plate was also inefficient - the oil doesn't drain out enough and you're cooking your food in a vat of fatty oil.What a disappointing experience! We usually go out to Koreatown 2 or 3 nights a week and try new places because its fun and the food is most always good. We will never be back here because honestly, Castle BBQ is better than this (and that was one low on our list in the first place). The only thing we enjoyed during our meal was watching the hot dog eating contest on TV."

3/6/2012,4 star rating,"Came on a Tuesday night for the Dad's bday dinner. I was NOT expecting to have to wait 2 hours for a table. Which I did end up having to do. Which was pretty ridiculous because they server kept reassuring me that it would only be a 45 minute wait the whole time. I mean, if I knew it was gonna be a 2 hour wait I would have probably took the pops down the street to a $10 place which would NOT have been as packed and we would have at least got the KBBQ fix we were looking for, you know?Anyway, the food and service here though really deserve the full 5 stars. I absolutely LOVELOVELOVE the Kimchi Fried Rice, and I love how many items comes with this AYCE. Not to mention the quality of the meats ! ANDDDD your meal comes with unlimited rice paper and radish sheets !! Yummm ! I honestly think this place is WAYY better than Road to Seoul. It doesn't look as dingy here, and the service is so much better. I'm pretty cheap, yet I would gladly dish out the extra cash just to indulge at HJC. Trust me, you are never disappointed here ! (Foodwise anyway !)"
9/30/2009,4 star rating,"This is my go-to place when I want to eat KBBQ past 10pm. Not that it's healthy to do so, but sometimes your cravings get the best of you. Like most BBQ places in Ktown, it's 16.99 for AYCE. The meat is decent and there are A LOT of side dishes. They have a lot more meat options than Manna or Tahoe, but honestly, if you gotta be looking for questionable if you want more than the standard brisket, pork, ribs, chicken, or belly. WHAT IS A BEEF HONEYCOMB?! They do have BBQ squid which I have NEVER seen at other KBBQ places. The thing I like about this place over more popular places such as Manna or Tahoe is that after you're done eating, a server will cook you Kim-Chi fried rice on your grill to top off your meal. It's the little things that count :)On the other hand, service CAN be a little negligible unless you ring the buzzer and the staff tend not to be as attentive even when you do. Still the service does what it needs to do: bring you meat, refill your drinks, clean your grill, and cook you fried rice....when you ask of course. Parking is a little difficult to manage. Like most of Ktown, it's street parking or valet. Fortunately valet is only $2, which isn't so bad for the service. I've been here multiple times now, and when have a late night Korean BBQ craving, I'm throwing it down, this is the place to be."
10/24/2011,4 star rating,"Yum, so much selection for the types of meat!! Â I think they have like 8 different types of meat?? Â My favorite was the bbq pork, or the tongue. Â The meat is good quality and the price is great. Â I thought the fried rice was yum, too. Â The atmosphere is pretty good - plenty of hoods to vent the smoke, everything is clean and nicely decorated. Â Service is typical, by which I mean they come promptly when you ring them, but that's it - fine by me! Â They come and dump all the meat on the grill at once which is kind of lame since for me KBBQ is more like a continual feed rather than a gorge and wait kind of thing.. Â other than that, i thought the pancake and other side dishes were good and more than plentiful.I'd definitely come back here and recommend this place, but I'd recommend making reservations and trying to come early on a weekday, 'cause it gets busy fast!"
3/18/2018,5 star rating,My favorite kbbq spot in the Los Angeles area. The bulgogi and beef short rib are my favorite items along with the kimchi fried rice : p Â also the service is prompt and polite. Big Thumbs up
6/4/2013,5 star rating,"Dang it's been a while since I've had AYCE. The price itself is not bad at all. So they seat you, and the table is already set. There's those sheets of dduks and all the sauces you could possibly want. Also, there's a bowl of salad. The person will come around, take your first order, and come back with the meat. As you're eating, when it gets low, they ask what you want next so they bring it promptly and you're constantly eating. They'll come around and give you more dduk as well.Also, when you're done eating, ask for them to cook the rice on the pan for you. They'll give you a soy bean paste stew and make kimchi bokeum bab for you on the pan. Also it's really cool how they clean it! They use radish! Never knew you could even do that lol."

Â I rather drop my usual $50 a person at Soowon or Genwa than deal with this dreadful service. Â Call me snotty, I don't care! Â I was hungry and cranky!We get here at 7pm and put our names down.

Â we had 5 reservations that came late. it'll be another 30-60 minutes"" Uh...are you serious? why didn't you say this before? how do you fail to mention there are FIVE reservations ahead of me when I checked in? Â And how do you have the audacity to tell me that my wait is actually double what you told me when I got in. Â I ended up going to Tahoe instead and waited another 30 minutes.

You could walk out satisfied.Love love the banchan, the kimchi and beansprouts were good and spicy! Service was alright! Better than most AYCE places :)Price-wise it is pricier than most AYCE places, $16.99 but can you really find kbbq places open till 2? And plus you pay for quality and service."
12/19/2013,1 star rating,I would give this business zero stars if could. Just because of service. My girlfriend and I planned a trip to Cali. When planning we saw that Hae Jang Chon had great reviews so decided to make a reservation. We were planning to meet old friends and have a great time over Korean BBQ. This reservation was made about a week before we came. Today my girl friend decided to call to reconfirm the reservation made for dinner the next day... However they tell her that they had never made a reservation for her and continually asks her to tell them when she had made it and check her call history and call back. Seriously do not know how they would be able to track all that but ... We gave them the benefit of the doubt. Called back and provided them the exact date and time we had made the reservation. My girlfriend originally requested a table for ten ... But only 7 of her friends confirmed. So she asks if they are willing to make a reservation for 7. They respond ... Has to be 8 or more to make a reservation. She explains that we haven't been to LA in five years and this was like a reunion / get together with old friends we had left behind dinner... But still they would not accept. Hating to see her upset and freaking out that her event was going to be ruined... I stepped in to make the call.I call and immediately ask for the manager. The obnoxiously rude host barks he's not here. Then I ask when will he be in? In his rudeness he manages to mutter the words seven. So I thank him and tell him I'll call back at seven. Night goes on... And I decide to call them around 8. The host picks up the phone and consistently yells hello hello hello and then hangs up. I call again and this time speaking louder ... And finally get to talk to him. I ask about him recollecting a reservation that was made and when I was about to explain to him that I wanted to speak to a manager to further explain... He hangs up! Thanks Hae Jang Chon for a great time. Would they have treated Barack Obama the same way if he had called to make a reservation? I think so. Love the five star treatment ... Wish you all the best of luck.
12/19/2013,2 star rating,"Eh - there are other better Kbbq's, but this one can be awesome - since it's open til hellva late and it's a AYCE. Normally I'm here during lunch time - and it gets pretty packed, why? It's not particularly the best, nor is it cheaper than most KBBQ. Overall meh. The thing is that they're a bit pricey and the quality of meats are meh. There's a bunch of different items you can order, plus they're supposed to give you soup/egg and fried rice at the end. Maybe since we weren't Korean they didn't automatically make us fried rice. We had to ask for it.Eh, all good, I just won't be back. It's in the same plaza as Kyocho, Cafes, Bars, etc. and similar Ktown plazas that have valet. There is parking on the streets and nearby residential areas. It never hurts to look for free :)"
12/18/2013,4 star rating,"Came here for lunch this past Saturday with NH. You can either pay valet to park in their lot or find street parking (which is what I did). There was no line when we got there so we were seated right away. We did AYCE KBBQ for $18.99/person (minimum two people). It's a bit pricey, especially considering that they don't offer a lunch discount like other AYCE places. They have 20 items (or so they say, I counted 16) but you can only order up to 4 items at one time. You are not allowed to take any leftover food (including fried rice), and if you have leftover meat there will be a charge of $15 (not sure how strict they are on that).We got their Black Angus Beef Brisket, Choice Beef Short Rib (Marinated), Canadian Fresh Pork Belly (Thick Sliced), and Beef Tongue. I didn't have any of the beef tongue (that weirds me out), but I had plenty of the other three meats. My personal favourite was the beef brisket, but the marinated short rib was pretty good. NH really loved that one and said the next time she comes she's only going to get the short rib :P Both of us were not fans of the pork belly. Gardenia H. said she's only had the thin sliced ones and those are pretty good, so I guess our mistake was in getting the thick sliced ones. But the ones my mum makes at home are so good :(I liked that they gave you four dipping sauces for the meat:-- Korean Pickle Soy Sauce: The menu said it was best for the brisket, and they weren't kidding! It made the brisket even more delicious :) I think it paired with the other meats well too.-- Sesame Oil Sauce: Best with pork bellies. Too bad we didn't like our pork belly. My second favourite sauce out of the four.-- Bean Paste Sauce: Best with pork bellies. Meh since our pork bellies were meh.-- Chile Sauce: Didn't even try this one since I have a low spicy tolerance -_- But NH liked it!THe AYCE meal comes with kimchi pancake, steamed egg, bean paste soup, and your choice of either kimchi fried rice (have to wait until the end) or steamed rice. I really liked the kimchi pancake here--they grill it with the meat and it tastes so good! I didn't try any of the steamed egg and we oddly didn't get any bean paste soup, but we didn't complain because we had too many things to eat as is! We opted to wait until the end for kimchi fried rice since other Yelpers seemed to really like it, but it turned out to be a disappointment. Maybe I was a victim of my own expectations, or maybe it was because we were full at that time, or maybe it was because the kimchi fried rice just wasn't good... but we did not like it at all. We both took one spoonful each and stopped.I did appreciate how the servers would cook our meat for us. I'm so used to having to do it myself that I felt really spoiled :) The staff here were very nice and friendly and always kept an eye on our side dishes to see if they needed any refills. Very nice!"
12/18/2013,2 star rating,"I really don't get how this place has a 4 star with these many reviews. As you guys know there are so many korean bbq restaurants in k-town. If you guys want to find a good korean bbq restaurant, you guys should be trying ones that koreans go. the price and the food are very average. Selection of meats and food are very limited compared to other joints in koreatown. Only thing that's good here is the service. I'd rather go elsewhere and spend my money for korean bbq."
12/18/2013,5 star rating,"I'm going to write a review about this place, but it almost seems like I'm just doing it to increase the review count so people know how good this place is. Â I'm so glad to have made it out to K-Town for K-BBQ after SO MANY dinners in Westminster. Â The meat was great and the sides were surprisingly better. Â The fish cake was delightfully spicy. Â The spinach still had great texture. Â I think the oil was more flavorful than I'm used to. Â On the down side, the egg pot was watery. Â Moon BBQ's egg pot is the best I've had so far. Â I'm also confused by the Kimchee fried rice. Â All the pics I've seen on Â yelp show half of the grill covered in rice. Â When we went it was maybe about 2 cups. Â I guess it doesn't matter since at that point we were so full we could only pick at it. Â HOWEVER... the kimchee fried rice was.... not... good.. :'( Â I was severely disappointed. Â Way too salty, way to strong of seaweed flavor, even too much Kimchee. Â End of the meal people... it needs to be lighter. Â Not sure if we got a bad mix or something, but it made me sad. Â Also, why can't we get it early on in the meal?!?! Â They clean off the grill for the rice anyway. Â On the plus side they do it right at the table and its fun to watch.Parking and traffic is a nightmare. Â We parked on 6th on the street, I'd stay away from the actual parking lot. Guess I did have alot to say! Â Oops."
12/16/2013,4 star rating,"We had dinner here for the 1st time on Friday evening of Thanksgiving weekend based on our buddy's recommendation. I called and made reservations for a party of 12 for 7pm earlier that day. When we arrived there on time, I was told my name was not on the list. The guy kind of brushed me off and I asked him to check again, told him when I called and who I spoke with. Again he said I'm not on their list and said he can add it to an ongoing list. It was really frustrating. It was cold out, packed like crazy and our party was all present.We then talked to the female hostess. She ended up checking another list where she found my name. Apparently my reservation was placed for Sat vs. Friday. She then told us that they'll place us for the next big tables. We ended waiting about an hour until we were seated and was split up into 2 round tables. It's about $20 for AYCE. The sides, salad, sauces and tofu/bean curd soups were tasty and here you cook on clay griddle pans instead of your typical metal ones. Service was quick and efficient. The variety and quality of meat is great and you get fried rice at the end.Arrive early, parking lot gets packed. You can park on the streets and there is valet available in the front."
12/16/2013,5 star rating,"I hope the restaurant would consider for opening a new restaurant in San Jose area. Everything was pretty yum, and the price was amazing. They used radish to clean the stone pot was impressed! Beef tongue and short rib were delicious! Complimentary small dishes and dip sauces made a hit! Waiters and waitresses were attentive!"
12/15/2013,4 star rating,"I give Hae Jang Chon 4/5 stars but solely because I got sick from it last time, I think we undercooked the meat though. I've eaten here multiple times and it has been great. I especially love the brisket, bulgogi, and kimchi pancake. The service is great, they'll come and cook the food for you if they see you're not doing it. The side dishes are also super delicious. My favorite thing about this place is the dipping sauces they give you. Pair those with rice paper and the salad the give you and you have a delicious AYCE meal. Prices here are about the same as other KBBQ places, ~$20."
12/12/2013,4 star rating,Best Korean BBQ in town. Staff is so busy they forget to smile :)
12/11/2013,4 star rating,"BBQ on clay slabs instead of metal. Â The best when it comes to side dishes. Â Definitely a great place to go to eat but beware, when night time comes, good luck getting a seat if ya'll didn't reserve one. Â Prepare for long lines, but at day times it's easy to get a table.One thing I do miss with a metal bbq is that I could burn some of the meat. Â Toasty meat."
3/6/2010,2 star rating,"I've had bomb Korean barbecue before, and it wasn't this place.$2 valet parking in the lot in front of the plaza which was a huge plus on a busy Friday night. We waited about half an hour for a table, which wasn't too bad. It's just that there's no where to stand or sit...very very, tight and cramp. I didn't like barbecuing on the hot stone AT ALL...there's no circulation and will stop sizzling the meat when it gets too saucy. The pickled sides weren't that great and not a lot of choices. Although, I did enjoy wrapping the short-ribs in the circle-shaped radish wraps (dunno what they're called) Don't order the brisket, it's flavorless and not marinated which is a JIP. The short-ribs are the best between the brisket and bulgogi. Our waitress didn't pay much attention to us and my friend had to remind her 5 times to bring out the kim-chi fried rice (which was alright). I wouldn't recommend this place because I've seriously had better Korean barbecue."
3/31/2008,5 star rating,"Better than Tahoe, better than Manna, better than Castle BBQ.This place is seriously underrated. Â The pork belly here is very delicious, and the beef rib, phenomenal. Â Can't really go wrong with this place, as they provide great side dishes, and plenty of duk-bo-sam and veggies throughout your meal. Â They're actually pretty prompt, too. Â The radish soup is light and refreshing and a nice complement to the meat. Â The mixed rice at the end is common at some other restaurants (I think Castle BBQ on Western and Maplewood has the best mixed rice); however, it's pretty darn good at Haejangchon as well!For $16.99+tax, I'd say this place is worth every buck. Â But if you're on a diet, please stay at home. Â Once you try their food, you'll be hooked and keep ordering more!"
10/9/2011,5 star rating,"I'm Korean and I haven't eaten in Ktown in over a year because I was studying abroad in Korea and other parts of Asia. All I can say is: THIS PLACE IS BOMB DIGGITY!It is a little small (we had to wait almost an hour for a party of 12), but the price of the food was so worth it. The food was so worth it. The service was so worth it! Seriously. The ladies were so nice trying to fit us all (since our party was so huge), and they didn't delay at all in bringing out our food. We at a lot of beef brisket, pork belly, and marinaded ribs. The meat was so good, and they even cooked it for us. I'm not sure if that's protocol at this restaurant, but they took really good care of us. After we were done with the meat, we had the kimchi fried rice. OMG SO GOOD. I don't even like kimchi fried rice that much, but this was really yummy. I think we all wanted to die from food coma after we were done. We only stayed about 1.5 hours, but we did work!I found street parking, but I know I got lucky. Valet is only $2, so not too shabby (but they close at 11pm, so you shouldn't valet if you're gonna stay too late)."
1/4/2012,1 star rating,"With 900+ reviews & 4-stat rating, this place must be great....not for me. I will not come here again nor would I recommend this place to anyone who's never been here. To start, the parking. You can park for free at the lot EXCEPT if you plan to get here, then it's $2. Going to any of the other stores or restaurant, free. Service...Granted my fiancÃ© & I haven't eaten at a kbbq so naturally we both didn't really know what to do, how to order. I tell the guy it's our 1st time here & with a blank face & lack of response, I understood that that meant I need to look around at others, read the menu, & figure it myself. If there is anything you want, more water, more sides, more meat, anything, you have to flag them over. That's fine except they don't ever look your way to see if they need to help anyone. The food...this is the only area where I would give it a 2-3. The bulgogi was the only thing that was tasty. We ordered pork belly, ribs, & beef tongue. Their bean paste soup was good too. With 2 people eating, I figure one of us could get steamed rice while the other gets their famed kimchi rice. Not so, we had to choose the same for both. We choose the kimchi fried rice to try and.........it never came. We waited & waited & waited. & nothing. We finally just asked for our check. My last note to anyone reading this 1star review is that we came at the least busiest time. A little after 3pm. There were maybe 4 other people dining. I can't imagine how much worse the service would have been had they been busy. If service is going to be that terrible, then the food had better been damn good. But since it wasn't, this place gets a 1-star & a big STAY AWAY if you don't know what you're doing & are too timid to ask."
6/26/2012,5 star rating,"The AYCE KBBQ joints in LA put the ones up in SF to shame. Â And Hae Jang Chon is just another example of an excellent KBBQ joint that knows what it's doing. Â And they do it so well.It's $17.99 for AYCE KBBQ. Â You get 19 different items, including brisket (the best cut, in my opinion), kalbi, pork belly, bulgogi, hot dog (lol), squid, and a bunch of other cuts of meat that I can't remember. Â The cooking platform is a large round stone, which the wait staff nicely cleans up after every few rounds. Â They come by with a giant bunch of thinly sliced daikon, and they use the daikon and vinegar to clean the platform. Pretty cool! Â In addition to the delicious meats, you also get many, many sides, like in all good Korean restaurants. Â These include the steamed egg, spinach, bean curd/tofu, potato salad, and more! Â At the end of your meal, they also cook kimchi fried rice on that stone platform - you should wait for it to cook a while and then eat it when it's crispy on the bottom. Â Mmm mmm! This place is SO legit, I loved it. Â I did notice that the wait can be kind of long during the weekend, but if you're a large party of 6+, then you can make a reservation and cut down your wait time. Â Do that. Â But even if you don't go in a group, it's well worth the wait."
5/27/2013,4 star rating,My best tip for anyone eating here for the first time is to save room for the kimchi fried rice! Â Don't make the same mistake I did and fill up on delicious pork belly and beef brisket and then make yourself sick trying to eat the kimchi fried rice. Â Next time I might need to skip the meat and just have the rice. It is so good.
3/26/2009,5 star rating,"Parking - crowded but there's valetWait - pretty long - about 30 minutes to an hour, depending on party size and day/time you go. It seems extra long because you can SMELL the food but you can't eat it!Side dishes - great. Love the brocoli, kimchee, bean sprouts, PANCAKES, YUMMeat is cooked on a huge round stone, takes a little longer to cook but a lot less char on your meat/veggies.Waiters come around frequent to refill things and help out with meat. The chadol is good, so is the pork belly and galbi. YUM....Your meal ends with kimchee fried rice which is deeeelicious...if you still have room in your tummy.. All for $16.99/person. Been here twice in a month. Will come again. Yum."
12/18/2009,3 star rating,"So initially I had come here about 2 months before for a friends party and I loved it. I guess the company made it better than what it probably is. Well just yesterday I decided to make a family thing and brought my family. WHAT A MISTAKE. I think it was probably due to both. But my experience was less than stellar.Waiter service was poor. Even with the buzzers. I think I asked for my sister-in-laws wine 3 times before they brought it. Ended up drinking it myself. The second portable stove thing was pretty useless. barely heated anything. I also noticed how the walls were dirty with sooth. I thought it was the shadows of how the paint was splattered on. NO! it was all dirt! AND they just but in if they need to do something, no excuse me they just move in and stick their butts infront of you.The place is open til 2 am. Food is ok, Can be a bit too fatty and not enough meat on the pork Shoulders (bacon), Parking is horrible around this area, Service is slow and have to ask several times for things."
4/20/2010,5 star rating,"This is probably my fav restaurant in ktown. We recently came here again for my dad's birthday with a party of 12. They were very attentive and had multiple staff waiting on us. When we ordered more kimchi pancakes they gave us 2 orders extra without charging us and gave us as much banchan as we needed. The price is amazing for the all food you eat $16.99 and u get meat, kimchi fried rice, soybean (dwenjang chigae) soup, kimchi pancakes, and fried kimchi- extra fermented just the way i like it. It could get busy here so just be careful on the weekends."
10/28/2011,5 star rating,"My new favorite korean bbq place :) Â $17/person for ayce with 19 different meats. yes 19 !! :)They use a stone grill so it takes a while to cook but the good thing is that the food rarely burns. Â They also use daikon to clean it (reallly cool watching it )often. Â There's also a hole on the side so all the fat falls through it. Â other krn bbq places, the fat and oil just stays on the grill so it's pretty gross.My favorite side dishes are the tofu, the green veggies, and the potato salad.the kimchi pancake is really good so make sure you get it, i like leaving it on the grill and flipping it over to get it exgtra crispy.the brisket here is so fresh compared to most places i've been too and the kalbi short rib is my favorite meat. Â there's no bones on it eitherr so its just juicy succulent goodness : DI tend to eat at weird hours at most restaurants so i never have to wait. Â we came here at 3 in the afternoon and there was absolutely no wait and great service :)"
1/6/2012,5 star rating,"yummy yummy in my tummy!This is probably one of the best AYCE korean bbq place in ktown. Service is great even though the place is crazed with tons of people. There was a long line out the door the night I went. I had to wait about an hour. When we finally got seated, we were served side dishes and water promptly. I didn't want to stuff myself immediately with the side dishes (although I was tempted to) so that I could save my appetite for the MEAT. Make sure you don't get too excited from the all you can eat korean bbq, it can be overwhelming, make sure to take your time, you have plenty of time I'm sure- and the meat isn't going anywhere, it's all you can eat for crying out loud. Aside from all that, they have all the right condiments- they give you rice paper, three sauces, and refills on Â the sidedishes. After you're done, they make you fried rice with the leftover meat.I would highly recommend.. fair price, amazing food, all you can eat.. enough said."
10/8/2012,3 star rating,"What can I say about Hae Jang Chon that hasn't been said already? With four stars and 1000+ reviews, there's not a whole lot left to say.They have do have delicious AYCE Korean BBQ for about $16 a person, and their portions are huge! My only regret was that I wasn't able to sample all the different types of meats because my stomach just couldn't handle any more food. We tried the pork belly, bulgogi, pork shoulder, and one other beef that I forget the name of. There was no shortage of side dishes, and even though we couldn't finish them, it was fun to try the different sides - potato salad, kimchi, rice papers, steamed egg (which was way too salty - tasted like a salt lick), and little veggies. I was really excited once I realized that you could get white rice - I love Japanese yakiniku, and it's not the same without a warm bowl of hot steamed rice. We got here at 12:30am and still waited about half an hour before we were seated. We lucked out and got parking out front, which was a pleasant surprise. I was so hungry by the time we started eating that I thought we could make a good dent in the AYCE menu, but unfortunately, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. All the meat was tender and tasty, but I would have enjoyed it even more if the portions they brought out were about half what they were, since there were a ton more meats on the menu and I wanted to try them all!"
10/10/2015,4 star rating,"Man, what a line. That was absolutely ridiculous. It's not their fault obviously haha but I'm never waiting in that line again. I didn't feel their KBBQ was much different from any other place I've been thus the wait was not worth it. I know the stone grill is cool but still, not worth the 1.5 hour wait. Overall the service was GREAT everyone was nice. But the food was like any other KBBQ place. Slightly disappointed I waited SO long."
5/26/2012,5 star rating,"Only 5 Stars for the BEST!!!This has to be one of my favorite experiences of AYCE KBBQ in my life! Â We spent a whole day at Magic Mountain playing and on the way back we were looking for some good eats. Â We were heading toward Wako's until our friend Dustin suggested Hae Jang Chon. Â Man was that the greatest move... Here's a list of reasons why!!!1) There's a happy pig face in front of Hae Jang Chon!!! Â That means they should do pork well and they do!!! Â Some of the best sam-gyub-sal I've ever had! Â 2) The large stone cooking plate!!! Â I've only experienced this at a couple of other places. Â Seriously, why doesn't every AYCE KBBQ place use this. Â It cooks evenly throughout the stone plate. Â It doesn't over cook. Â Everything comes out magnificent!3) You don't have to change the stone cooking plate. Â They freakin use radish to suck up the oil. Â It's freakin genius man! Â 4) The gaeran-chim is bomb! Â  Â 5) The service is exceptional! Â They're is always someone over your table taking care of your stuff... 6) The kimchee bokumbap at the end!!! Â Goddamn! Â You're so stuffed, but the kimchee bokumbap is so delicious... your stomach freakin plays tetris with all the food to fit everything else... 7) THERE'S A HAPPY PIG PICTURE IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT!!! Â That's my kinda of advertisement! Â Just give me pictures of happy pigs, crazy chickens, and fat cows! Â I'm sold!!! Â The only downer about this joint is that the restaurant is small... you gotta make reservations or wait until Jesus returns to eat at this banqueting table!"
3/24/2013,5 star rating,If you are looking for a cheap AYCE korean bbq location this is the place. They offer a good variety of meats along with the sides. I really liked it when the servers would come over to check in on us and help us cook our meat. The service was very attentive and they kept our waters filled. If you plan on coming here make sure all your party is here or they wont seat you. I am from the Bayarea and wish we had more AYCE places like this one.
7/19/2014,1 star rating,"Terrible experience here, and I've been to about a hundred Kbbq places . The Bulgogi was dry and had no flavor, like was it even marinated? The egg was really watery , and they even messed up my order. I ordered a la carte and they kept on insisting that there was a minimum of 2 orders . They never told me that and when they pulled out the menu it didn't even say it there. After all the excuses and them insisting I pay what I didn't even order (which was more than double the price of what I got) I finally asked to speak to the manager and then they gave me the check I deserves. GOD."

Â Even the boy, who HATES waiting for anything, was grudgingly satisfied by the delicious bbq! Â The meat was succulent, the kimchi fried rice- divine, and even the banchans were fabulous!Wasn't too thrilled about the SAMGYUPSAL though. Â So... I guess just stay away from the pork belly? Â Everything else was AMAZING. Â Seriously.The staff, despite being inundated with requests from patrons [our table], were really courteous and checked back on us often."
3/20/2011,5 star rating,"For quality ACYE Korean BBQ ($16.99/person), I highly recommend this place. Â Quality of meat and service is superb and you have an awesome selection to choose from. Â A few of my favorites are beef tongue (thinly sliced), marinated rib meat, pork belly and of course bulgogi. Tip: 1 - Make sure you save enough room for the kimchi fried rice they make in the end with any leftover meat. Â Delicious!2 - there is valet parking or street metered parking if you are lucky to find."
2/26/2012,3 star rating,"i really enjoyed HJC, but first, 3 stars because i was expecting to be knocked off my feet after reading the reviews here. I really don't have any true complaints, but if i wasn't familiar with Korean cuisine I would've been completely LOST. (I'll take a moment to point out that i am in no way Asian, nor do i look even remotely Asian, so assuming that I know about all the little idiosyncrasies relevant to Korean dining and service - which i do but that's beside the point- is just silly). Now, a few highlights:- If you want to pig out AYCE style, this place is amazing for that. (cheap!) As long as you have some skills with a bbq (you will get little to NO help here) you'll be fine. Come hungry...- Everyone complains about the wait; I went on a weekday at 6 and it was fine.- Despite the fact that their logo is a cute little pig, you can get more than just pork. (that's not how it works in Korea, lol).- All the meats were decent enough (again, not the best I've had), but the pork shoulder left a lot to be desired.- Banchan was alright... But I guess that's not why you go to HJC. - Service was what I expected. Not exactly non-existent, but not attentive either. But that's part of the fun in Korean dining right?? - I was really hoping they'd serve shikhae, but either they don't do that or I didn't stick around long enough.- Five bucks for lettuce??? really? c'mon.If i've left anything out.... see one of the other 1000 reviews."
1/23/2016,3 star rating,This place has some really good Korean barbecue it is not at the top of the chain but it's pretty alright.

No limit on galbi. Pork Belly has more fat than meat... but... one nice thing about this place is that there are NO ""sets."" You have just 1 list of types of meat/ marinated meats and miscellaneous items, like kimchi pancakes, that are available. Side dishes were nice and tasty.

I highly recommend it here for the meat selections and banchan, great service (except for two things), and how everything is ran here. Compared to many other kbbq places though, the service here is PHENOMENAL. Â Our meat got a lot of tdlr. Never burnt. I love the warm environment. It was also very nice how quick and neat the waiter was with cleaning our um stone-plate-thing with thin cuts of radish between some meat orders.Service Suggestions:~Please make eye contact to other people other than the one person who is ordering or people who are male. Also, don't be hesitant about asking confirmation from other people. Â It feels offensive when I'm ready to order for the group, and the waiter expects the ""man"" to decide everything. Â I follow some vloggers in korea and they've mentioned how people do tend to think that the man of the group is well... ""in charge,"" so to speak when it comes to quite a few things... but.... please for the dear love of gawd ... or kbbq, please don't go into auto mode and only look to manly men customers to decide things.~oh yea. Don't forget the ""CONE tortillas."" Got a good laugh over that. Don't worry about it though, they don't have ""CONE tortillas."" I don't feel like I'm missing out over these mysterious ""CONE tortillas"" though. Thank gawd for yummie meat and a (mostly) great service to distract me."
5/19/2015,4 star rating,I love this place. It is a great AYCE KBBQ that offers kimchi fried rice towards the end of your meal (like Honey Pig).
1/8/2015,1 star rating,"Their quality of meat sucks, Â not as good as before. Went to early dinner last week to have ayce, and noticed that the meat quality went down too much for the price of 21.99. Although Â they advertise they use black angus, they start serving only low quality of meat right after first order of the meat. Â They fool customers, won't go there anymore."
2/19/2013,5 star rating,"I got recommended this restaurant by my sister and we took the risk of waiting an hour for two tables of 4. I'm glad that I waited and got to experience this Korean BBQ restaurant. The environment seems very traditional Korean and home-like. The service here is amazing. All the waiters here are so friendly and mother-like. They like to take care of all their customers by helping cook the meat if necessary, and cleaning the grills frequently. We got asked, ""Would you like more meat?"" nearly 20 times within the hour we were there. A great thing about this restaurant is that they use the stone grills instead of the metal ones. One of the benefits here is that they give you Kim Chi pancakes before the meal and Kim Chi Fried Rice after you are done. The pancakes were crispy and packed with flavor. The Kim Chi fried rice was really good at the end, but I don't know why they can't serve it with the meats. The only bad thing about my first visit here was that the brisket we got was 80% fat and it filled me up quickly. Our friends at another table got the brisket and their's was about 90% meat so I don't know what happened."
2/14/2013,3 star rating,"How it works:-The niche about this place is you cook your meat on a stone grill. Â A flame is placed on the bottom of the grill and supposedly it changes the taste of the meat (less char, less gas fumes, etc).PROS:-Cheap, $17 for AYCE-Lots of selection of meats-Kim-Chi fried rice at the end tasted exceptional. Â -Fish pancake is free w/ your meal. Â Tasted whatever though.-The only meats I enjoyed were the tripe & beef tongue. Â Everything else was pretty standard. Â The brisket was definitely below-average.CONS:-PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY - Â  The grill takes FOREVER to heat up! Â The first 20-30 minutes of eating the grill isn't' even hot (you can place your hand on it w/o risk of burning your hand). Â Have you tried cooking brisket on a luke-warm grill? Â The brisket comes out soggy & wet. Â It's disgusting. Â I'd say... after 30 minutes when the grill gets scorching hot is when you can get a good burn in your meat. Â But.. after 30 minutes I was already full. Â  I wish they pre-heated this thing or something.-Huge wait times. Â Waited an hour for a party of 6 at 8PM-Parking sucks. Â We couldn't find parking and had to pay $2 Â for valet."
1/1/2011,2 star rating,"So I've eaten here 3 times now.The meat is ""ok"". Â Nothing special and definitely nothing comparable to most other places in k-town.The restaurant is decently clean and the service is pretty good.But the grill here is so thick that it takes forever to cook. Â Like literally, twice as long as other korean bbq places. Â After a while it gets kinda frustrating."
1/5/2010,5 star rating,"This is definitely the BEST KOREAN BBQ all you can eat I have ever had !!!The meat here is so tender and tasty. The side dishes are also great. All you can eat for $16.99 might seems a little pricey but you'll be satisfied with the amount of food you can get.It might get a little crowded over the weekend, we had to wait 1hr and half last time on Friday night. Nonetheless, this is my favorite place of all time when I'm craving for meat :D"
4/6/2011,5 star rating,"I went here twice in a row because it was so good! For AYCE the quality is damn good! The best is the thin beef brisket, unmarinated short ribs, and the thick bacon. But I also likes the small octopus and the squid too. The big plus about this place is that they make kimchi fried rice for you at the end on the hot plate! It was soooo tasty! If you can't handle eating fat, this is not your place to be because there are tons of it! Definitely not healthy at all, but oh sooooooooooo good! I love how they close at 2am! note: make sure you wear clothes that you don't care about because this place is down right grimey as hell! two thumbs up!"
11/27/2006,4 star rating,"There are three or four Korean BBQ places tucked in next to each other on 6th St. at Serena. I haven't tried them all, but Haejangchon Dolgooi is one of the ones that doesn't bother putting the English spelling of its name on the sign outside. The dining area is suffused with strong flavorful smells, so if it's too stuffy for you ask for a seat outside. The food is excellent, especially the kimchi pancakes. In true Korean style they bring you about a thousand tiny side dishes, half of which, if you're like me, are nice to look at but you'll probably never get to because a person can only eat so much. And they cook the meat, mushrooms, onions, etc. right at your table, which is always fun. Not just one server per station -- the entire wait staff rotates around flipping and slicing your food for you.No sharing of meals here, except at the counter, so if you bring a date plan on ordering one of the huge platters for 2, which run about $44 or so -- but include a bottle of soju, making the price that much more reasonable for drinkers keeping an eye on their wallets."
11/27/2015,3 star rating,"Perhaps it was an off day but I did not particularly find any of the meats offered here enjoyable. Each and every choice we made seemed to be lacking in depth of flavor. The brisket was bland. The beef bulgogi had no marinated flavor. The thin cut pork belly had small pieces of inedible bone in them, while the thick cut pork belly was majority fat. The beef tongue was adequate and the kimchi fried rice to end the meal was pleasant. What makes this place special is the almost skillet-like cooking pan that you cook the meat on, allowing for an even cook throughout. Besides the meat, the condiments were quite good. I especially liked the Korean mashed potatoes which contained a few chunks of Apple to add to the layers of flavor. Aside from the food, the service and decor of the place is what saves it from being a total mess. The servers are constantly alert and bring meats in quick succession, while also maintaining a healthy amount of sauces in each persons dish. The restaurant is lined with wooden floors which add the rustic charm to the place. All in all, the food was subpar, but the service and decor were top notch. 3 stars."
1/17/2018,5 star rating,Plane and simple.... beat Korean BBQ in Los Angeles good luck parking tho but it's always worth it oh and there is usually a wait so go when your hungry because by the time you eat you will be starving
10/12/2010,4 star rating,"I love me a meat fest at ungodly hours of the night. Even with some of the ""goggles"" on, I'm not impaired enough to get into a crappy meal to just sop it all down. Not any food will do to night cap- has to be something good. Service is good here and makes me so happy. When all I want is to eat to maximum consumption and go home, I don't want to hussle to try to get things from them. One note- I ask them to make my kimchee rice first with a little tip....mix in the meats and it's love. Oh, Korean angel-Descends down plates of heavenMeat and spicy goods. It brings me to peaceful sleepbut gives smelly morning burp."
2/23/2016,4 star rating,I went with a friend on a busy night. Had to wait about 40 minutes before sitting down. But as soon as we sat down the meat started coming. It was my first time here so I just asked the waiter to bring out the most popular. Everything was bomb especially the brisket. I would've given it 5 stars but they brought the check out before we were even done finishing all the meat. Other than that great all you can eat spot.
2/23/2016,4 star rating,"Hands down the best KBBQ place in LA. Â Definitely be prepared to wait a while - I've been multiple times and never waited less than 45 min. Â However, definitely worth the wait. Â $21 all you can eat KBBQ is pretty much the best thing ever, and especially good for big groups. Â Lots of meat variety (and even vegetarian options!). Â Waitstaff is always super friendly, attentive, and on point. Â Also doesn't hurt that it's a 5 min walk from my house!"
8/5/2013,5 star rating,Thank goodness for valet. Â The parking lot is tiny.Before we even turn into the lot we see a bunch of people outside waiting. Â Once we get inside we realize the place isn't too big but it is crowded. Â Our wait ended up being about an hour but it was a Saturday night so it was to be expected. Â They have plenty meat options. Â We only went with a group of four so we didn't get to try everything. Â The meat were all really good and it was pretty cool they clean the plate with radish. Â I've never seen that before. Â The kimchi fried rice at the end was the best. Â It really is your own creation since it's whatever you have left over. Â Come here if you get a chance but do be warn you will need to wait.
9/14/2011,5 star rating,"I went here with a party of 27....twenty freakin seven people! Have you ever heard of an Asian restaurant taking a reservation for 27 people? Especially a restaurant as popular as Hae Jang Chon. They gave us the whole little ""outdoor"" area for our friends' birthday. Â This is the best Korean bbq place I've ever been to! Food? Good. Service? Good. Price? GOOOD!For $17.99/person, you get AYCE from a very extensive list of meats, soups, side dishes, and they even turn your leftovers into fried rice with a side of soup! We ate so many different types of meat...from brisket to short rib to beef tongue. Keep in mind though that you can only order 4 types of meat at a time (even though you'll want to try everything!). Since it was a birthday event, our group of friends were so rowdy, ordering bottles after bottles of soju and beer. Â We stayed for hours, and yet the waitresses remained friendly and helpful the entire time. Â We had a very good experience and will definitely be back - hopefully in smaller groups this time! :)"
5/18/2009,3 star rating,"$16.99 for all you can eat Korean BBQ is a pretty good deal. Food: The pork belly, beef brisket and short rib were great! Â Squid and cuttlefish were good too. They brought us kim-chi fried rice plus hot & sour tofu soup at the end. But that was hard to enjoy given that we already stuffed ourselves full of meat. The menu says that our meal includes kim-chi pancake as well, but they never brought that to us (not that we could've eaten any more) Their selection of side dishes is more limited than other places. Here, you get only radish, pickles, mashed potatoes, and salad. Oh, and rice paper wraps of course.Service: Good, conditional on what you'd expect from these kinds of restaurants. The waitresses didn't say a word to us, but they brought us food and water promptly. The round table setup was inconvenient and really bothered me. You cook your meat on a circular grill in the center, around which is a 1-foot ring of table space to put all the side dishes, plate of raw meat, and your own plates. There were two of us and we often had to reach around the grill or pass around bowls to get something. Depending on how you set up your table, it's hard for both to either have access to raw meat plate, or all the side dishes. So be sure to ask for a square table at the edge of the room!Valet is $2."
7/19/2011,1 star rating,"Completely overrated. I left disappointed and duped.I never really had to wait long to be seated, but that was probably the best part of my visit here. The banchan wasn't bad, but it definitely could've used an upgrade in the flavor department. The oden was bland, but at least the salad was all right. The pancake was awful; it was extremely flavorless and boring.Service here also wasn't the greatest. When my friend and I paid the bill ($20 each), I expected the waiter to come back and give us the change. Never happened. There was a moment when a waitress went up to the counter to get something. I thought she was going up to get our change until I realized she was reaching into her purse to get a cigarette. Sigh.I highly advise not to get the brisket here. I've never seen brisket with so much fat. The brisket was disproportionally white in comparison to the amount of red meat in it. Flavorless, greasy, and disgusting.Granted, the thick pork belly was pretty good. They were tender and crispy when fully grilled. The short ribs were disappointing; there wasn't enough marinade. The bulgogi was surprisingly pretty good, and this is coming from someone who normally hates bulgogi.So if I'm praising a couple of meats and some salad, why am I giving this place 1 star instead of 2? It's because I felt incredibly nauseous after eating here. I'm wary of eating all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ after trying out this place. I think I'll stick to buying meat from Korean supermarkets and marinating and grilling it myself. It's normally cheaper and tastes way better, and it doesn't require that much culinary skill."
8/3/2013,5 star rating,"My fave AYCE kbbq. i love how they are good at keeping tabs on you, without you even having to press the call button. real good sides, good quality of the meat. and I really love the stone plate that everything cooks on. i like how they'll clean it off with the radishes when it gets to dirty from the meat juices. Tip, call in for a reservation cause it gets packed!"
9/21/2009,5 star rating,"You can't beat the meat here! Â I've never ever consumed so much meat at one sitting, holy meatiness! Â Met up with my Korean-familia (my bff's family), and we rocked this place out! Â You start out with the panch'ans (small dishes), and a great butter lettuce salad. Â Low and behold the meat is served raw, sliced uber thin, and you grill it yourself on the hot stone that's in the center of your table. Â We had brisket, tongue, chicken, and the thickest bacon I've ever experienced in my life. O M G!Then after we were done gorging ourselves...there's MORE!They come and clean off the hot stone for you and make you a delicious fried rice post meal. Â Now I understand why there's a pig on the front of the restaurant. Â Oink!"
12/7/2009,5 star rating,"IMHO Best all-you-can-eat-and-cook-yourself Korean bbq in socal for the variety, taste, uniqueness, general quality, and value. Â  Now, go eat at Manna so you don't overcrowd this joint."
2/28/2010,5 star rating,"Mmmm Korean BBQ, one of my favorites. When my friends and I meet up again and have mini-reunions we always go to Korean BBQ, it easily accommodates people and around $20 for AYCE. I've been to a lot of AYCE places in K-town, but this is hands down the best. The service is AMAZING, they're so attentive and they help you do everything! We had this cute older lady that wouldn't let us cook our own meat, she was so precious (I just wanted to put her in my pocket and take her home)The meat quality was amazing too and there are choices galore! This can be a hard place to find if you're looking for the restaurant name while you drive, so just look for the cute little pig. Btw, parking is lame at night, its forced valet but its not too expensive. Still lame though."
3/18/2011,4 star rating,"*Came for lunch, so i got a chance to beat the dinner crowd, phew*Dam...Hae Jang Chon is by far, the best place i've been to in LA. Road to Seoul has officially been de-throned as my go-to AYCE KBBQ place. But alas, I have tried Star BBQ in garden grove Â (yelp.com/biz/byul-daepo-â¦) not more than 2 days ago, and Star BBQ is still the winner in my heart, so that is why HJC gets a 4 star rating. But dammit, this place far from terrible, and streets ahead of any other AYCE KBBQ in LA.The Skinny:Quality of the meat is so very good. Â Nothing tasted bland and having it cooked on the huge stone grill was a treat (consistently hot, and everything tasted just that much better). Â Service was helpful and responsive. That alone sets Hae Jang Chon above the other ayce kbbq places in the area. Quality service, quality meat, i'm definitely coming back. I can't go anywhere else in LA. The FUD:Their marinated short ribs were to die for. Thin sliced pork belly? oh double that order PLEASE. Their brisket was really flavorful, and i dont tend to eat a lot of brisket. The bulgogi and thick-cut pork belly was the only thing that really disappointed me, but i ordered more short ribs to make up for it (and it did :D). The banchans was good, especially the kimchi (powerful stuff. None of that weak sauce ish). didnt finish much of it, cuz lets be honest here, who goes to kbbq for the banchan? Overall, the food was outstanding, and they even have four different types of dipping sauces to compliment each dish. so good. And dont worry about eating too much, they got pepto bismol if you request for some. I'm not kidding.The Service: It was slow at the beginning, i almost thought they forgot about us after we were being seated. it was a real wtf moment. All this hype on yelp and i was almost disappointed. ALMOST. once they got to us, they dont eff around. BAM, banchan. BAM, stone grill. BAM BAM bean sprouts + kim chi cooking on the stone grill. KA-POW, brisket ready. Dam they were good. Because the service turned out amazing, our experience turned out amazing as well. *oh, this is the kbbq place i've encountered that charges you for leftover meat, so...indulge wisely!*I did not get a chance to try their kim chi fried rice though, which is a dam shame. But what can i say, i love them short ribs."
12/23/2011,4 star rating,"Affectionately referred to as ""The Piggy Barbecue Place,"" I can't look at korean bbq the same anymore. This place will always be the gold standard for me. For $20.00 you get a great variety of good quality meats: Pork belly (thick cut and thin cut), black angus brisket, short ribs, pork shoulder, beef tongue, Bbq beef, bbq squid, bbq chicken, intestines, tripe and hot dogs. Unlike other barbecue places, Hae Jang Chon uses a large stone grill to as opposed to a charcoal barbecue for grilling. The stone grill has a spout to drain out the oil into a tray. Â Once you order a different set of meat, the waiters are very attentive to clean off the stone grill with grated radish (who knew it sucked up all the oil?!). The service is pretty good and they end your meal with bean paste stew and kimchi fried rice so save room :) It can get fairly busy here so I suggest going on off times (late lunch or super early dinner). Otherwise prepare to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour."
1/3/2012,5 star rating,"My favorite kbbq place to go if I'm in LA. HANDS DOWN!The meat comes in FRESH... in a prius. Arrived with a group of buddies who were heading to the LA convention center for some car reveals we were waiting for for years.These servers are KIND TO NON-KOREANS! Hell yea!~ You don't get in the OC very much Â unless you go to Cham or Gen KBBQ.Beef tongue here is the best I've had. Bulgolgi is alright, shortrib is awesome, brisket is great and so are the intestines.They do give out free kimchi-fried rice at the end. Youl'll have to say how many people.Special note: Go during lunch hours. NO WAIT!"
9/21/2017,5 star rating,"In L.A. you have ton of options for Korean BBQ that won't have a long wait, but there is a good reason people are willing to wait 1-2 hours to get in. I was introduced to this place by a friend, and it has been my favorite spot ever since. First of all for a busy BBQ place, they are pretty clean, a lot of busier bbq joints in LA can be super grimy, but of all the times I've been here that's never been the case. Another plus is that they have stone rather than open flame (It is way healthier for you!!!!) But even if you don't care about that, their meat selection is really awesome, and has good quality. For dinner it is $25 all you can eat per person and it never disappoints. They also come around and do some of the cooking for you, as well as cutting the meat, etc. It is awesome because if you're with friends, and are drinking, it is exactly what you need. Â They have great selection of sides and drinks that you would expect to order at Korean BBQ. And their kimchi pancakes are delicious! It's a great place for groups. I wouldn't suggest coming here while you're starving because the wait can be between 1-2 hours, so while waiting you can go walking around and maybe start drinking at some of the places around Hae Jang until you pass the time. The customer service is great for how busy they get, they make sure to always come around and ask if you need anything even at their busiest times. The wait is extremely long but i think the overall experience is worth it, especially for the price."
3/11/2014,5 star rating,I love this place it's my favorite Korean BBQ! The all you can eat Korean BBQ is the best I've tried so far! I love the kimchi pancakes and the beef brisket! The venues inside is a little small but has a warm and welcoming environment! The staff are friendly and serve you fast and accurately! So far I've tried the beef brisket pork belly bbq chicken the squid and it's all yummy! Not to mention they sell HYte which is a pretty good Korean beer! Â This restaurant is a nice place to take friends family or even a date! I must say it gets pretty busy!
2/6/2015,2 star rating,"When researching this restaurant on Yelp, you're gonna be tempted to avoid the three star reviews like I did, because there's no way that a place with such long lines could be gross, right? Wrong.We came here after Super Bowl and got lucky, only a thirty minute wait. At first things were going well, sure I was slightly put off by the fact that if you don't finish ALL your food they will charge $15 extra dollars, nor is $24 (after tax) per person that cheap, but ok. The banchan was pretty good, especially the fish cake. Steamed egg was bland. Service was rushed and rough around the edges. Again, fine with all that. What I'm not fine with is the thick black long hair that was tangled inside in a piece of meat that almost went into my boyfriends mouth. The way it was handled was even worse, they barely gave us a discount and expected us to keep eating. I've had a lot of Korean BBQ and this place isn't the best quality nor does it have the best service. The kimchi fried rice is aiight, but it has no egg and you have to add your own meat if you remember to save it for the end. Y'all are being dooped. Go a couple doors down for the best Korean fried chicken you've ever had, or go to a real, traditional BBQ place on 8th. Good luck."
9/20/2015,3 star rating,"Food is good. However, service is bad. We had to ask for napkins and water 3 times but never arrived. Servers also seem irritated and tired already. The place is busy and HOT."
1/29/2010,4 star rating,"Definitely my go-to place for AYCE Korean BBQ! Â I love the fact that they have stone griddles instead of the grated ones, which saves all the delicious marinade that they douse onto their galbi and bulgogi.It's always crowded starting around 8pm, so make sure you either come early or make reservations. Â Or you could just wait out there and whet your hunger by taking in all those delicious cooking smells wafting from the doorway.You start your meal off with a variety of appetizers, of which my favorite is the spicy bean curd and vinegar pickled radish. Â The server comes by moments after you are seated with a generous helping of the best kimchi I have ever had, hands down, and places it on the griddle alongside bean sprouts, and tops it off with a kimchi pancake. Â Then you get to order.I always ALWAYS order the marinated galbi and bulgogi. Â Although everything on the menu is good, these two particular items are stellar! Â I also enjoyed eating the pork belly (thin) and barbeque chicken. Â If you ordered AYCE, definitely keep it coming until you're full! Â And if you run out of kimchi and bean sprouts, all you need to do is ask for an extra serving and they bring it right to you, no questions asked. :) Â I got several helpings, myself.At the end of the meal, when you think you can eat no more, they bring out kimchi fried rice, which they mix right in front of you. Â Here's a little secret: what I do is order an extra helping of bulgogi and ask them to cook it, then chop and mix it into the fried rice at the end. Â It makes it even more delicious, if that was possible!All in all, for $16.99, it's one of the most worth-your-money AYCE places around, let alone Korean BBQ. Â I try to make it out here at least once a month, if not more!"
11/3/2011,4 star rating,"Probably my most frequented ayce korean bbq place. It is one of my favorites because of the great service. The meat is pretty standard, not particularly special but they do have a good selection. Also, the grill is different from other kbbq places.What probably stands out the most is the soup and kimchi fried rice. However this is only available at the end and usually I am too full to really enjoy them. This place is usually very crowded and since I've only been here in large groups before, it takes a really long time to be seated. Valet only has limited availability too while parking in surrounding areas is very difficult.They play the happy birthday song a lot."
11/15/2015,5 star rating,"Saw the high ratings for this restaurant and thought I would give it a try for my girlfriend & her husbands birthday. They did not disappoint. While there was a wait, they did not disappoint. Our waiter was friendly and very attentive. The meat was fresh and very tasty, especially the marinated meats. The kim chee fried rice was good, but I was too full from the main meal. I would definitely recommend this place"
5/3/2013,5 star rating,"We came on a Sunday around 5:30 -- just before the rush! Lucky! We didn't have to wait too long, but by the time we were done, there was a pretty long wait. I've been here another time before, and we had an 7:30 PM reservation, but didn't get seated til 9 and our group had to be split up. $2 valet unless you can find street parking somewhere. $18.99 AYCE (went up $2 in the last couple years)The cuts of meat here are of pretty good quality (in comparison to the last few places I've been...honestly not an expert at meat cuts and quality) For our brisket, they asked us if we wanted thin or thick sliced -- how cool! And they come out with a big serving so you dont have to keep asking and waiting. Yum!"
8/10/2009,4 star rating,"This place has the best customer service of any korean bbq place that I've ever been to! Our waitress was always around and our wait time was very minimal.We decided to eat here because we arrived late to the Korean BBQ cookoff and every booth had massive lines. And for $17, I'm glad we did! This all you can eat was good, but not great because the quality of some of the meats was not very good. We ordered beef tongue, bulgogi, bbq squid, and galbi. The beef tongue was very good, nice and chewy. The bulgogi's marinade was a little too sweet for me, so I had to dunk it some of the jalapeno-radish-soy sauce to even out the flavor. I didn't try the bbq squid, but my bf and buddy seemed to like it. (It arrived as a whole squid, so you have to do the cutting yourself). The galbi was the weakest part of the meal because some of the pieces were either very tough or very dry. And it wasn't like we left it on the grill too long either. The meal came with an abundance of sides: different types of kimchi, steamed eggs, lettuces, radish slices and rice paper for wrapping the meats, whole cloves of garlic and four different kinds of dipping sauces. Overall, it's a pretty good place to eat if you're looking for an all you can eat. But if you're looking for better quality meats, then you should eat elsewhere."
12/27/2016,4 star rating,"Delicious, authentic Korean BBQ! Expect a wait, but worth it. Everything we ate was delicious - I don't think you could go wrong. One star off for lack of chop chae and other traditional items in the lunch buffet."
11/10/2012,4 star rating,Came here again this past weekend. Â Wait was ridiculous - even on a Friday at 11:30. Â My party waited for about half an hour before we got seated. Â I guess this is the time people start going out in Ktown? Â Simple bottom line: Â Get the pork shoulder. Â Save room for the buttery and fragrant kimchi fried rice.
10/7/2012,4 star rating,"Came here last weekend for AYCE dinner shortly after 6 p.m. Â The wait was short - ten minutes max, pretty good for our larger party of 5. Â And before I knew it, we were sitting down in front of the stone grill and meat was coming out. Â We ordered the brisket (multiple times), the short ribs, the pork belly (multiple times), pork shoulder, beef tongue, and honeycomb for the grill. Â I liked it all, but the pork shoulder was probably my favorite. Â Maybe it was that I didn't expect it to be so tender and juicy. Â What's great about HJC is that you can also order lots of other dishes in addition to bbq, so we got kimchi pancake (not that great, but tastes better once you grill it), the steamed egg, and bean paste soup. Â The variety of banchan is also decent, too, including fish cake (my must-eat), kimchi, cold spinach, and potato salad. Â And you can digest your bbq meats wrapped with the marinated daikon slices or the rice sheets. Â All in all, it's quite delicious. Â The way that staff clean the grill is interesting. Â They bring out water and daikon slivers, grating and scraping off all the burnt residue with that combination. Â Finally, they top off the meal by making kimchi fried rice right in front of you. Â My only regret is that I was already way too stuffed by the end of the meal to actually enjoy any of the rice, but I assure you it tasted delicious and probably would have been even better if I didn't feel like I was about to vom.Service: Â So the only reason why I take away points is because the service leaves something to be desired. Â I was with Korean speakers, and even then we had to request some things multiple times and the wait time was a bit long for some of the non-meat dishes. Â Still, the staff was generally friendly.Bottom line: Â I know I begin a lot of reviews with ""I'm not a [whatever food] expert..."" and the same is true for Korean bbq, but I am a fan of HJC. Â It's worth a visit or two, and you'll leave overly stuffed and satisfied."
2/11/2014,4 star rating,"Wow! This place is honestly one of the best KBBQ place I ever been to! The kogi (meat) here is so so so so good! I ordered some brisket, kalbi, and samgyeopsal (pork belly) and they were all the bomb.com! I love samgyeopsal with a burning passion and this place is on point with it. Side dishes were good! And that kimchi bokkeum bap (kimchi fried rice) at the end was a great way to end your meal.Thank goodness it's open to 2 in the morning. I only wish there was Wi-Fi so I can post this place on my Instagram and Facebook account and recommend this place faster.This place was worth going through the 405 AND BACK."
6/8/2014,4 star rating,"Wow!I have not often had Korean food of any kind- mainly a few nice meals on Telegraph in Oakland which were a while back.Holy beef honeycomb- this place is wonderful! We tried to get a rezzie but I did not think to call before it was too late so they recommended just getting there as a walkin.. This was relatively painless as we did not wait long and this was only as part of our party was more distant do we waited for him.Staff were great and helpful with our questions.It helped that one of our dear family friends speaks Korean as the staff have varied skills in English.It was my son's going away to the Navy dinner. A perfect celebration.Beef brisket, tripe/honeycomb, tongue, spicy fish, great tangy sides, rice wine and Hite beer rounded out the meal.Big crowd assembled and the place resembles the push at a Vegas hotspot like Hyde except the patrons were not dressed up like those on the prowl: rather everyone was dressed in their best slow food-savoring outfits- casual.It is a great place- fun music, simple decor, and so delicious.Eat all your meat, my little ones, for you get charged for leaving meat untouched... And no taking leftovers home.We fortunately thought to bring 26, 27, and 32 year old strapping male appetites with us so nothing went to waste.Valet parking is available.Easy to find- easy to return to!!"
9/22/2011,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I were crazy craving for KBBQ one week and we thought about venturing off to DTLA one day just for KBBQ. We went after work on a Friday, and once we got there (parking is valet, $2) we put our name on the list and walked around the area.We came back and were told our table was given to someone else =( but they were going to give us the next available table. So I guess people should really stick around, despite the 45 min-1 hour wait... we came back in 40 minutes! So tables could be available either before or after. It really a a busy and crowded place so I understand why they have their rules.In any case, we were seated shortly and we decided to have brisket, beef tongue, bulgogi and kalbi as our first 4 meats. Before grilling, we sampled the banchan and out of of all them, the salad, kimchi pancake and potato salad were our favorites. The brisket and tongue were soooooo delicious. My boyfriend and I were so shocked of the true beauty of flavors in these two meats. However, the bulgogi and kalbi begged to differ... maybe because it was a stone grill.... I think the bulgogi and kalbi would have been perfect if they were a bit charred up.The service was great. Our waitress who was always smiling always came by to check up on us, helped us cook, and clean up our grill. She also made us kimchi fried rice... a lot of people here seem to like it but it was too sour and kim chi for us. We wish we had regular rice, lol.Overall, a great place with good food and good service. Pricing for AYCE KBBQ is $16.99, and it is open til 2am!!! I would have given it a perfect 5 stars, but the bulgogi and kalbi were just okay.... but the brisket and beef tongue were tooo delicious that it makes up for the other two. Parking can be a hassle and the wait can be crazy... but the food does make up for it."
10/13/2013,4 star rating,I really enjoyed my dinner here. I came with 7 friends and was able to make a reservation because I was a part of a large party. They seated us a little late but not terribly. They scrambled tables around for us so they were trying. Service was quite good. The early dishes were good. I always love the small side dishes. Their steamed egg and kimchi pancakes are truly phenomenal. It's worth coming here just for those. The meats were tasty and came in huge quantities. We couldn't even get through all the various types of meats they offered. We tried the beef tongue which was good. They also had stomach and intestines which we didn't try. Their kimchi fried rice at the end was great too. They added additional veggies and seaweed.
10/13/2013,4 star rating,"It's great for all you can eat. Â Exactly what you would expect for all you can eat. Â The owners do want to get you to order, eat and get out since there is a huge line-up outside. Â The fried rice at the end was a treat even though I was stuffed, but couldn't pass it up. Â The price was super cheap and the food was tasty, just expect to be rushed out...."
10/13/2013,1 star rating,"I was really disappointed in this place last week. I am currently expecting and the day i went there for lunch was after a rescheduled appointment. And i was feeling a little sick, so i decided to go for their lunch menu and have a nice hot soup. My friend and my boyfriend both ordered spicy pork soup and were half done with theirs. I ordered beef soup and when i was done with 1/3 of it, i found a cockroach floating right in my soup. I immediately ran for the bathroom. Meanwhile when my bf confronted the waiter he did not apologize and just said 'ok, ok! I took that one off the check!' Like all we wanted is. 5.99$ free soup!!!! It was so disgusting!!! I always see lines of people waiting outside. Been there a customer for many times. And i am soo disappointed! I have no idea how they got an A on health department sheet thingy. If they get an A with roaches, what can we expect from B establishments? I actually regret not calling the health department right away. I still have the image of the roach in front of my eyes! Dont go there!"

Â I think they start the Valet around 1 or 2pm.They won't seat you if all of the ppl in your party is not there. My favorite meats I always get is brisket and marinated short ribs! Soooooo good! Â I have a 3 year old Daughter so she eats hot dogs which they do have.For the most part, they are pretty attentive but once or twice I had to push the button to ring the bell at my table to get there attention but they come running fast.I always eat wayyyyyy too much to even order their Kimchi Fried Rice that they make at your table at the end of your meal. I mean....it's AYCE soooo who has room for Kimchi Fried Rice after all that protein you been stuffing in your mouth? !?! Â The Kimchi Fried Rice is included in the price so next time. ..I'll try to leave a little bit more room. One time I wanted to try it so bad so I asked them to make just a small portion which they did and it was really good! Â But it's just too much carbs to eat after you're already stuffed!Hands down... I'm hooked on this place!Just a tip. ..it's best to come early! Â I came on a Friday night at 8ish and waited almost an hour cuz the line was out the door! Â I waited cuz it's worth it but never coming back on a Friday night again! :-)"
10/12/2013,1 star rating,"The worst Korean BBQ restaurant I have been to! First, the meat was of very poor quality. This was evident from the smell, texture, and the stomach pain I went through shortly after my meal. Second, the meat had no flavor! They don't marinate their meat! It tasted very bland. Lastly, the service was even worse than the food. We got a very rude waitress, which left me no choice but to complain to the manager. I'm never going back to this place. Please save yourself the stomach ache and avoid this place."

Â The food and service here was really good. Â There are multiple waiters that bring you food quickly and even help you cook the food. Â The food itself was great! Â I love all the sauces that they give you to dip the meats in. Â At the end, they make you kimchi rice which was super spicy. Â I would have liked the rice in the beginning because I like eating meat w/ rice. Â Overall, I will come back. Â But, I'm going to try to come during an off-time in the future so I don't have to wait so long."
10/9/2013,2 star rating,"This place used to be my favorite KBBQ spot about 4 or 5 years ago. Since then they have been explored and became famous. During my visits there in the last two years, I feel that their service and food quality have been declining.By the way I was just there again last night (it will probably be my last time too). Last night the waiter mixed up beef tongue and brisket together on the grill! My friend is the one who ordered and eats beef tongue, and I can't eat it. Â So now, I can't tell the difference between brisket and tongue.Also, they don't have bean sprouts and kimchi cooking on the grill anymore. And the don't offer to clean your grill anymore!"
10/8/2013,3 star rating,"The wait here is LONG. So plan accordingly! Yes, it's good cheap AYCE but I have nothing to really rave about. I was too full at the end of our meal to order this... but the kimchi fried rice looked tasty at the table next to us."
10/7/2013,5 star rating,"So good that you just can't stop! Have you ever eaten SO MUCH that you threw up? Well, folks, it sure is possible! And I am living proof of that. When it comes to the KBBQ at Hae Jong Chon, I lose all sense of control and will eat until I have food stuffed up to my pharynx. No matter how full I get and despite my tummy crying for me to stop, I can't resist the urge to continually consume, devour, gorge. I make myself last until the very last and absolute BEST part: the kimchi fried rice grilled at the end. Hae Jong Chon is by far and hands down my favorite AYCE KBBQ restaurant. And will be my first stop when I come back to California next weekend! Seriously, CAN'T WAIT!"
12/5/2010,5 star rating,"Road to Seoul, we have been good friends, very very good friends for many years, but I have to sincerely depart as I've moved onto bigger and better in the name of Hae Jang Chon!!Being kicking-and-screaming-like-an-angry-child hungry through the two hour wait on a Saturday night should have been discouraging enough to make me want to ditch and go to next door to Kyochon, where you can get the best chicken wings in the whole wide world, butttt let me tell you, IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!Hae Jang Chon is foodgasm galore with their 238943 choices in meats, but what makes it go above and beyond is the kimchi and seaweed fried rice the server grills up at the end of your meal. Even if you are about-to-burst-and-die and painstakingly full, there is somehow that pocket just for the fried rice.I am normally repulsed to Korean bean curd soup, but theirs is so phenomenal, I practically licked devoured and licked the bowl. I kid you not. Oh, and their kimchi pancake is also bombass diggity!It should be a sin not to go here, so do Â yourself a favor, and go to Hae Jang Chon!"

10/7/2013,1 star rating,"This was our first time trying Korean BBQ, and the experience has been horrible. No one greeted us, just asked how many were eating and pointed to the table right next to the main door, the gas was blowing on our face, nobody explained anything to us about the one menu they gave my friend and left. One server just dumped plates of spices or something, which we had no idea what they were. We rang the bell to order drinks and discuss about the menu and the options and in the middle of discussion with the waitress just left and went to do something else. The ordered meat was just dumped on the other side of the table, again the server did not explain anything how long certain foods we ordered would take to cook etc. Later on we noticed a long black hair on top of the what appeared to be a potato salad (?), I handed it to the waitress girl and she asked if we wanted another one, we declined. Little later on I found another black curly hair in my food as I was chewing on my octopus, this time the waitress took the hair to her manager. He came and apologized and said ""it happens"" and offered to buy us drinks. We were SO done eating and wanted to get out of there that free drinks at that point were pointless. The manager gave us $8 employee discount. I will never go back, nor will I ever recommend this restaurant to anyone!! I will try to post a picture."
10/5/2013,5 star rating,"this place is sooooo yummmy. They have the stone grills, very different from other kbbq places. Taeyang was here before and that is the main reason why I keep coming back :) there are a lot of seats so the wait time is not as long as the other kbbqs in the area. I would say this place is more americanized than the others. When you look around, there is diversity; not like the other kbbq spots where you spot koreans left and right. There is also ample parking in the lot right out in front!"
10/5/2013,4 star rating,"What: Date Night DinnerEats: AYCE KBBQ meats: 1 order of brisket, 2 orders of marinated short rib, and 1 order of bulgogi) + kimchi pancakes + steamed eggs + sidesTakes: First time eating Kbbq in K-town! After missing last call by 5 mins at my local default kbbq place, we were recommended to drive to k-town to try this place! Recommendation definitely well noted! Of the meats we ordered, hands down MARINATED SHORT RIB fills the void in my stomach! YUM--it's the marinade that makes it and the short ribs were so tender; it's def. some mouth watering goodness right there! Brisket and bulgogi were on point too, but they weren't on the same level for us as the short rib. Kimchi pancakes had a kick; I've never been served these at a kbbq restaurant! Steamed eggs and sides rounded up the delicious meal.Down side: They ran out of tortillas to make the tacos. Granted we did come at a little passed midnight, but still, what a bummer! I really wanted to try them!First timers: Be sure to read the excerpt on the menu (They have a lot of additions you don't necessarily get at other places, so read what you can get to get your money's worth!)Ambiance: Large restaurant, yet even with a lot of tables/people, it didn't feel claustrophobic at all! Decor is modern and tasteful.Parking: Shared private lot. We missed the valet service (closes at 11pm). Bottom line: Go here for your K-town AYCE KBBQ fix! Highly Recommended."

Â here's how my ideal kbbq meal looks like: - brisket (lean meat here, yummm. not super fatty like other places) Â  - pork belly (kindaaaa contradicts my brisket up there... lols however i'd still say it's a bit leaner here than other places as well... mmMmm i can't understand ppl who don't love samgyupsal... what's wrong with you alllll?!) - this place also offers thick and thin slices of pork belly, but i always prefer the thick cut :P- squid (recently tried this one), super yummy, great marinating sauce :O - kimchi! adds a little spice to my meal cuz you all know how i like things spicy! ;) - sojuuuuu! (take a shot and then chase the alcohol away with a nice thick slice of meat ;) - rice wine :) hehehe only when my other girlies are here though, cuz we all love ourselves a nice cup ...or two of makgeolli- kimchi fried rice (be sure to save room for this deliciousness at the end of your meal!) the next time your carnivorous cravings kick in, be sure to check this place out!"
10/1/2013,5 star rating,"I'm a regular when it comes to kbbq in k-town, and this place is hands down my favorite. Price for all day is $18.99, worth it. They have the best variety of bbq-able foods, their brisket is just perfect. Other than always getting at least 3-4 plates of that, we usually get pork belly, kalbi, bulgogi, and finally tried squid the other day (deliciously marinated, best squid I've ever eaten at a kbbq place). I actually have never had trouble finding parking, always lucky to find street parking and even when my friends or I park inside, it's only $2! Service here is really great, they refil side dishes and brings over the steamed eggs and kimchi pancakes without you ever asking, always prompt with taking more orders and cleaning the stone grill constantly before your new plate of meat arrives. And to top it all off, delicious kimchi fried rice. Come hungry, leave hungry for more."
10/1/2013,5 star rating,SO GOOD. Their meat selection was great! The waiters help you cook your food from time to time and they're always around to check if something is cooking on your pan! Wonderful service & extraordinarily delicious food. 10/10 would eat here again!
9/30/2013,5 star rating,"as far as Korean bbq this is almost as good as it gets. We went for the all you can eat set up and it was very good. We did the short rib, brisket, tongue, octopus and shrimp... we were stuffed. All good. The short rib as usually was great. I did miss not having charcoal at the table side set up. The short waitress hustled and had us served asap she was very nice and the service was great. It was packed and for good reason. Fresh meat and fresh seafood at a killer price."
9/29/2013,4 star rating,"3 of us came here for dinner on Tues night@7pm after a 20mins wait (only). We had a great server who gave us small portions of other items to try after we were quite full up eating the beef brisket, bulgogi+pork belly-all tasty. Didn't like the marinade on the short ribs. Loved the squid and octopus. Nothing beats bbq squid-had TWO rounds of it!! The fried rice comes at the end of your meal and it means you can't order any more meat after that- it was delicious and you can mix it with the leftover meats you still have on the table. Finished almost all of it!! Extra star is for the fact that it's less than 10mins' walk from my apt!"
9/29/2013,4 star rating,"Every time I think of coming here, it's always so packed to the point that we decide it isn't worth it to try the place. The place seems like one of the top spots in Ktown for KBBQ. There probably are better joints out there, but I think this place is now one of my favorites!Wait: Over an hour long wait on a Friday nightParking: So it's really hard to find parking on the streets, you'd probably have to spend 20 min or more trying to find a decent spot close by, especially around dinner time on a weekend, since everyone took the good spots already. Â I recommend just doing valet parking for $2 and not wasting your time finding a free spot elsewhere.Food: AYCE. They offer a good selection of meat and sides. Their egg soup and their kimchi fried rice have to be my favorite! Â Didn't really like the kimchi pancake though because it was a bit too greasy and oily for my taste. Also, it's interesting how they clean their grills here because they don't replace the grills. Instead they use radish and scraper to remove the black debris from the burnt meats.Service: On top of it! They are very responsive whenever you ring the bell. Â However, when we decided order kimchi fried rice, the lady didn't tell us that we couldn't order any more meat after that since they cook the rice on the grill. One of the other servers was kind enough to offer us more meat and apologized for not being told of this policy.Would I come here again? Yes, but maybe on a not so packed day."

After waiting for about 10 minutes we were brought to our table and the sides were great! The waiter brought our meat and drinks out immediately and was always available when we needed something else. We never had to wait to ask for more food and all of the meat was amazing. My favorite was the (incredibly) spicy pork and the short rib. The steamed egg was also delicious.

4/9/2011,1 star rating,"This is not a review of the food. I hear the food is great. I would review the food if not for the extreme disorganization of the restaurant's management. Friday night, I made an RSVP for 8 people at 8pm and arrived promptly with my party. The host says it'll be an extra half hour wait. Â Ok, I was prepared for this. Â Forty minutes go by, and I ask again if our tables are ready, and he says, oh it'll be another half hour. I'm like, WHAT??? I HAVE A RESERVATION! So the Krage came out, (Korean Rage) and I start jumping all over the place, with about 20 people behind me trying to check on their reservations. Why didn't you tell me that you didn't have a table? Etc. etc. etc. I storm out with my party and go to Park's BBQ instead.Moral of the story is, this place doesn't honor reservations. Â It's a free for all at the host stand. If you like your melee with a touch of Battle Royal, have at it. RESERVATIONS FAIL."
10/2/2011,4 star rating,"People in LA are spoiled. There's so many places to get good korean BBQ. But with so many options it's hard to find one that really sticks out. For me Hae Jang Chon is the place to go. For $16.99 all you can eat, you can't beat that deal. There's a pretty good variety of meats to choose from even some squid and baby octopus, The quality of the meat isn't the best I have but it was pretty good and what I would expect from a all you can eat menu. The service is excellent. Very attentive, the staff came every few minutes to check up on us, clean our grill, and bring us whatever we needed. The vibe of the place is pretty cool, they place good music and it's a fun place to hang out in groups. Pretty loud so I wouldn't recommend coming here for a intimate date. There was a huge line, so I recommend coming early before 6:30Overall I think this is a great place and I highly recommend it for all you can eat Korean BBQ.."

Â We are eternally grateful that things worked out this way. Â If I'm in town, and I don't get to frequent this place, I always leave with a feeling of remorse. Â Parking is tight here. Â We have a routine down pat: Â drive around 10 times looking for a spot until you get pissed off and than cave in to pay for the $5 valet parking right in front of the restaurant. Â  Â They have a lot of options available for AYCE. Â When you walk in, there is a huge board hung from the ceiling - octopus, thin cut pork belly, kalbi, seasoned lettuce, banchan - it's all so good that I need someone to wipe my chin while I write this review. Â We have yet to come across another AYCE KBBQ that beats this place. Â The icing on the cake is that they make kimchi fried rice for you once you are done eating your 6 month supply of scrumptious meat."
7/16/2013,4 star rating,"Super packed and popular KBBQ place, and with good reason! Â All things here are good quality, be it the side dishes, the fried rice, or the meat itself... but I didn't find anything that makes this place phenomenal over my top KBBQ picks in Ktown (that being Kang Ho Dong, OoKook and Road to Seoul).What IS cool about this place, is the fried rice that make in midst of the korean bbq around the grill.

7/16/2012,1 star rating,"I came here on a Saturday night with a couple friends and there were at least 50 people waiting in line ahead of us. Â We left to a leas crowded place down the street. Thinking it must be good, I came back alone today at 11:45am on a Monday. Because I am here alone, they will not let me order KBBQ, my options are kimchi soup, BBQ chicken or bulgogi, all cooked in the kitchen behind me. Â Because I just valet my car, I guess I'm stuck eating here. I specifically looked on their menu to make sure they did not list this stupid rule (I could understand if they're busy but I'm literally one of 3 parties here and I'm also seated on a table with a grill). Â Maybe they think this studly meatball is going to eat their entire stash of galbi? Bulgogi lunch: the bulgogi is shredded into dog food quality shreds, that taste like they were boiled in broth. Â The banchan dishes are mediocre at best. Â The kimchi soup is wayyyy too salty. Â The rice paper wraps are stale (i.e., brittle, break apart easy, and dry on the edges)."

Yes, definitely give it a go!"
1/1/2012,4 star rating,"This is the most reviewed AYCE kbbq restaurant in ktown on Yelp (I did my homework)... so I picked this one over the other dozen options available. I called them at about 1:30 (30 minute wait at that time) and by 2pm when we got there, there was no wait at all.You're allowed to choose up to 4 different meats at a time, with a seafood pancake, steamed egg, banchan, and kimchi fried rice at the end. There wasn't a single part of the meal that I didn't enjoy - everything was delicious, well marinated, and service was fast. I liked the thick sliced pork belly, bulgogi, boneless short ribs, brisket, squid, and BBQ chicken - we had some of those twice.We ended up getting 10 meats for a table of two - well worth our $20.00 per person with tax and tip. It's valet parking only... even if you see a spot in the lot. I literally parked into a space, learned that it was valet parking only, gave my key to the valet, and watched as he parked my SUV backwards into the EXACT same spot, for $2.00. Pretty dumb. Â Will definitely be back - yum!"
4/15/2013,4 star rating,I didn't wait to long. I was in a party of two and we went around 3pm. This place didn't use the grill like at other AYCE KBBQ I've been to. It was nice to grill on a pot! We ate so much and every piece of meat was great. WE tried octopus and the waiter was kind enough to help us cook it and determine when it was cooked to eat. THe wait staff was very friendly and attentive. I was really happy with everything and the ambiance. I will come here again!
8/31/2015,5 star rating,"Brought my coworker and her family who have been wanting to try KBBQ for a while, and I am so glad I took them here. We came here Â around 11:30am on a Saturday, which was way too early for KBBQ, but hey, we beat the long line that I ALWAYS see here. Meat quality was really good, and they have a large range of selection. Kalbi (marinated ribs) were by far the best one we've tried. It was so soft and juicy.... would def go back for that. I love how they include kimchi jun (pancakes) to their list of AYCE. Highly recommend this joint if you were willing to pay more for better service/quality."
5/23/2008,3 star rating,"Located in a packed little plaza, it's a good thing this place has valet because otherwise you wouldn't find a spot. We were a party of 11 and the staff helped us pull some tables together to accommodate our group. Like other KBBQ's the grills are built into the tables though, and those tables don't move, so they brought out a portable grill to place on the other table.We all ordered the AYCE. A mound of kimchi is dropped on the grill and the sizzling begins. This place had a couple of things I'd never tried at other KBBQ joints like the kimchi pankcake and the kimchi fried rice - which I'll get to in a little bit. The pancake was pretty good. I don't think the panchan was that plentiful. They bring out each meat individually like other joints but they actually do a lot of the cooking themselves. They'll place the meat on the stone grill and then come back to turn it and stir around. In between every meat they'll place some sliced up radish on the grill to clean off all the fat and burned bits that the previous meat left. Pretty cool show.The meat in general is much thicker than what I've ever had at a KBBQ. The beef brisket was average. The pork belly, I did not enjoy. It was SO FATTY! I mean fat is usually good because fat equals flavor, but I didn't like it all that much. Then came the kalbi. I enjoyed this meat most of all. Freakin' duh, right? It was again, much thicker than what I've had before and wasn't as potent as I had expected. I kept comparing it to the last place I went to and it didn't really make an impression. By the end of the kalbi everyone was full and satisfied...except me. So when the guy came to ask if we wanted more of anything everyone gave a unanimous ""nooooooooo thank you"" with big smiles on their faces while my ""yes, more kalbi please"" got drowned out. Forget it. Seeing as how we would have no more meat, it was on to the last part of the meal - the kimchi friend rice and the soup.The server comes to the table, cuts up the kimchi and makes the fried rice in front of you. The soup is laid in the middle of the grill while the rice cooks around it. The kimchi fried rice was SOOO GOOD! I hogged that stuff. I mean everyone said no to the meat because they were full right? So then step off!!! This was mine! (There was plenty). I filled up on the rice. Overall - good experience, great service, nice atmosphere, but I like a stronger flavor in my meat."

5/25/2015,4 star rating,"I don't like Korean BBQ or Korea food at all, but this place deserves the four stars. The line can get a little long sometimes (we waited 1.5hrs), but workers are extremely attentive and kind. They work hard and it shows. I love watching the teamwork demonstrated at this place. Food is of good quality and more a classy crowd comes here as opposed to other Korean BBQ's I've been to. My friends love it and they are regulars so I guess it is worth coming to! I just don't like how I smell like it right after though :p"
5/25/2015,4 star rating,"The day after consumption.All the meats are undeniably delicious. They're tender and not overly marinated( e.g HoneyPig). They provided with five-six banchans( kimchi, beansprouts, fishcake, radish,etc) I love the sauces: soybean paste, chilli paste, sesame oil,and something similar to a sweet lighter soy sauce version. They also have salad with light dressing as well. All you can eat for $22 with quality meats... Who can beat that?** but make sure you finish what you order or they'll charge you $15 for leftover meats.Now for the downsides:1) the wait was literally 1.5-2 hours long.2) your legs/feet will disown you for standing that long so I suggest going somewhere and come back, but make sure to check in with the host when you come back to make sure they didn't miss your name.3) this is probably the most negative pointer...When I woke up this morning, I felt like I'm having a hangover. My head was mildly pounding, I felt so bloated and my throat was clogged up. Â I honestly know my body, when I consume too much salt and MSG, that's what it does... REBEL.Verdict: I'm definitely down to come back, but I really have to be on a really good diet for 3months straight then treat myself. Lol"
10/21/2012,4 star rating,"It's kind of worth waiting 2 hours for amazing KBBQ. My friend, who comes here often, suggests coming very late or for lunch to avoid a long wait! There is a tea place a few doors down, so you can get tea to help you endure the wait. For $16.99 there are so many choices of meat! We started off with plates and plates of brisket, then moved onto short ribs (avoid since the bone is left in), beef tongue, squid, and ended with bulgogi that I ordered but could not even finish since I was so full. I love the steamed egg and the kimchi fried rice that they give you at the end. I thought that was the end of the meal, but the waitress gave us soup! I did not make room in my stomach for this...need to plan ahead next time. Parking is valet only and you get to watch the parking attendants tetris in all the cars in the lot."
7/7/2015,5 star rating,"My favorite korean bbq for last 10 years. Â I come over here at least once a month. It is granite stone type of grill, which i prefer over gas or charocles type. Some of stones are due for replacement, Â but i find more pluses then minuses in this place. Overall my best choice. Get ready to spend about 30-60 minutes waiting for table."
5/14/2009,5 star rating,"AMAZING.If you thought picnic garden was a steal for all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ than you are gravely mistaken. Don't get me wrong, what you don't know isn't necessarily your fault. I thought picnic garden was pretty darn good for the amount you pay and the meat you get until I went to Hae Jang Chon.Picnic garden is dead to me. Hae Jang Chon triple laps any Korean BBQ place I've been to. For 16.99 ($20 with beer) you get unlimited selection from their quality meats and excellent service. The meat is brought out after you order it from the menu. There are no limits and everything is cooked on a stone rather than a grill. The meat still gets grilled, but all the fat is leaked through the side and into a container (nice!). Also, instead of replacing the stone when it gets charred, the waiters clean the stone with shredded dakon radish. The dakon absorbs and cleans the stone perfectly. Just Ingenious! This prevents the spread of the nasty burnt taste onto the meat. Oh and after you're stuffed like a sausage from the copious amounts of meat, you can order the fried rice that comes with your meal! They bring out all the ingredients and create your fried rice right on the stone! The fried rice is very reminiscent to bibimbop. SO WONDERFUL and WORTH IT."
9/6/2010,3 star rating,"I recently have gone back to this place a few times since writing my original review.I have decided to knock it down a star (really to 3.5 stars) due to the service issues I've had that differed from my original experience here. The food quality remains the same, but twice now I have gone when it hasn't been as busy in the restaurant and the service quality went down...oddly you would think it would be worse if it were busy! But no...when it is not as packed, they are LESS attentive. This last time I went, it took a long time for the meat to come out and even though I rang the service bell twice, we had to flag down the server for refills.When it is packed in this place, they walk around more and make sure to refill items and help grill the meat. Maybe because they want you to get in and out faster?My recommendation? Go when it's busy for good service, BUT make a reservation before you get there so you don't have to wait long for a table.."
4/24/2010,4 star rating,"I usually don't go to AYCE Korean BBQ places because I have a favorite place for Korean BBQ, which is not AYCE. I happened to see someones review on this when I was on Yelp by chance, and after seeing photos and such I decided to try it out.The three of us arrived around 7pm. There is valet which is 2 dollars. The resturaunt was full with a few people waiting, and we were told it would be anywhere from 30 mins to maybe an hour because they had to seat people who came in for reservations first. We ended up waiting about 20 mins. I highly recommend you get a reservation if you plan on hitting this place up on a Friday night or Saturday during peak hours. We left around 8:45 and the line was out the door and cars lined up for valet. I can't even imagine how long the people who didn't have reservations waited.....Ok on with the food. We were all pleasantly surprised! The meat was pretty good for AYCE. We ended up trying the thin brisket, thick pork belly, marinated short ribs and BBQ squid. The meal comes with so much food! Kimchee pancakes, Â salad, soup, egg dish, kimchee fried rice at the end. We were all incredibly stuffed to the brim when we finished. As another yelper mentioned, what was really surprising was the EXCELLENT service! This is pretty rare in a Korean resturaunt. They came around frequently to check meats, refilled things quickly and were very friendly. My sister pointed out that another nice thing was that most of the servers seemed to speak English well so for non-Koreans it would be easier to ask questions and such. She even said she thinks she prefers this place to our favorite Korean BBQ place and Honey Pig which specializes in pork belly.The price is very reasonable. It is 16.99 per person for dinner and considering all the great things you get with the meal it's a good deal. We will all definately be coming here again. A solid 4 1/2 stars I would say."
6/2/2011,5 star rating,AYCE Korean BBQ rocks no matter where you get it - but here it's especially good because the side dishes are especially awesome. Â They gave us the potato/apple salad and you don't see that everyday! The also gave the rice paper and radish and 4 dipping sauces for the meat. OOOOOoo and an added bonus was the chilled barley tea. Mmm.The kimchi fried rice at the end is a cool concept but I didn't even get to try it because I was soooo full.The decor is nice. Â Cool round stone grill.
8/17/2011,4 star rating,"Came here for the first time on a Friday night with some of my friends bc we were craving some KBBQ & we decided to order the $16.99 AYCE with the briskets, bulgolgi, & beef tongue. The meat quality was excellent & the side dishes were absolutely delicious ! The waiters & waitresses were all very attentive, constantly cleaning up our grills right when we finished cooking our batches of meat & refilling our side dishes as needed. Lovedd the music they played here. Me & my friends could not stop singing along to the songs haha.Oh & did I mention there's steamed egg + kimchi fried rice at the end?! Fell in love with this KBBQ the moment we were seated. I hearby dub ""Hae Jang Chon"" as my new, favorite KBBQ restaurant to dine in at. Definitely coming back. 'Till next time. Â :)"
4/2/2012,4 star rating,"Mmmm YUMMMM!! Literally the highlight of my week. My first two attempts to feast here were futile as each time the wait was nearly two hours, but lucky for me third time really was the charm. Prior to coming here, my fave AYCE kbbq place was Road to Seoul, but I believe Hae Jang Chon has taken the throne. Alright, lemme break it down.1) This place is CLEAN! Any asian eatery should automatically get one added star for cleanliness. The restaurant is small (I now know why the average wait is 2 hrs), but it's clean and AIRY so you don't smell like smoked galbi immediately. 2) Service and presentation were good!! Each time meat was brought out to us, a server cooked it for us and always scraped the griddle clean before it charcoalized. 3) The food was tasty and flavorful. Beef brisket was a little fatty, but tolerable, and definitely much better than other places. Once the meat is cooked you can just rip off the fat or wrap it in banchan and pretend it's not there.The bulgolgi was okay, but I prefer the brisket over it. Bbq short ribs were good also. I'm not a fan of all the pork, but we ordered pork belly as well and it was good.They cook you kimchi fried rice and bring you soup after you're all finished eating (this logic baffles me), so make sure you save room.Overall, this place is tasty, satisfying, and clean. For price, I'd say it's one of the best AYCE in K-town."
6/17/2012,4 star rating,"I've been wanting to come to this place for so long, but the line is always extremely long. They also will not let you put your name down on the wait list until the entire party is there so make sure everyone is prompt!The table was a little too small for our party size, but I can over look that with the fact that the AYCE meat was very good quality. The benefit to having a smaller size AYCE place (compared to places like road to seoul) is that their service is super fast! They bring your meat out so quickly and our banchan needs were kept contempt. The only drawback to this place is that they don't have intestines, but I can overlook that minor detail."
4/11/2013,5 star rating,"Bomb korean food found in KTown. Decent prices, but delicious korean bbq! I'm amazed when they clean the stone grill with raddish! I definitely recommend to come here :) Pretty great service and a delicious place to get your kbbq fill!"
4/9/2015,4 star rating,jus loved their meats n sides.hot stone better than direct stove .service is fast to served the sides when its out.the meat taste so good compare to other restauratns
9/8/2010,5 star rating,"Devastated and horrified that my boyfriend hadn't had Korean barbecue yet, I Yelped around to find a good place in my neighborhood. With K-Town so close by, I knew I had tons of options, but settled on this choice mostly because of the previous reviews, and because I had to be sure they served the rice noodles. They're that important to my KBBQ experience, okay. Pros:- $17 All You Can Eat (AYCE) includes tons of meat choices including seafood- Salad side dish is delicious and plentiful- Stone grill!!!! Seriously, so worth it! The fat from the meats drains off cleanly into a small dish on the side, and gives the food a more ""clean"" taste.- Friendly service even to non-Koreans- Staff will clean the grill several times during your meal- The second time I asked for more rice noodle things, she brought me... like a huge bowl. It was epic.- Decor is really nice. It feels very open and way nicer inside than all other KBBQ joints I've seen.Cons:- Parking SUCKS. They have a valet probably for a fee. Parked down the street by the church.- The kimchi here is VERY sour, more than I'm used to- Wait to be seated can get long, as well as service when it's busy.Tips:- Put the Kimchi and sprouts on the grill. It's better that way.- Save room for the KIMCHI FRIED RICE! They'll toss everything together at the end to make rice for you, so save room!- When you ask for water, they will actually serve you an iced tea (not the American Snapple kind of shit), so if you want legit water, you might have to ask for tap or a bottle- Hit the button for service to ask for meat before you finish so you're a neverending train of meat-eating glory."
7/26/2011,4 star rating,"There is a reason why all Korean BBQ places are rated 4 or higher almost always: give me endless amounts of meat that is flavored to perfection and put right in front of me, and I will eat it in a heartbeat. Now, this place is tough to review since there are so many factors, so I'll rate it by service and quality of food.Service: One star for wait time, four star once you sit down. Four of us went on a Friday night, unbeknownst to the ridiculous wait time. Getting there is already sometimes an issue on the weekdays since traffic is not the kindest on the 10, but we got there around 8ish, and the wait was 1 hour and 40 minutes!! The only reason I was able to survive was by eating some Kyo Chon wings while we were eating. Yes, nothing better than stuffing your face with meat before you go to all you can eat Korean BBQ. So, since we were already out there, we waited. Once we were in, service was good. I'm also obsessed with Korean restaurants and the little buttons you get to press when you need something.Food: Five Stars. Although I am completely biased having gone in smelling meat, craving meat, and yearning to stuff anything I saw on the table into my mouth. Banchan was amazing and so were the pancakes. We did make the mistake of eating the kimchi and bean sprouts they put on our stovetop. You really cant' judge us because we were so darn hungry. But keep in mind, don't do that if you go - it's supposed to be for kim chi fried rice that is supposed to be amazing. I'll have to leave that for the next time I go. $17 for AYCE and we got a pretty solid amount of food - loads and loads of bulgogi, short ribs, beef tongue, squid, pork belly. I was beyond stuffed by the time we were done. Also, they have a pretty good bean paste soup that goes well with rice (otherwise it's a bit too salty).Now if you do the math, sort of, my review comes to four stars. Delicious if you're willing to wait. Or just be smart and make a reservation. Some side notes:+ I really liked the stovetop for this place - it's different than most Korean BBQ places where they change out the stove top and there are holes in it. Instead, after each order of meat, they clean it with diced radishes. It's pretty genius, and really entertaining to watch. I have no idea why.+ Don't wear clothes that you want to wear again before you do your laundry. You will come home smelling like meat. Your car will smell like meat. And your dog will love you for it.+ LATE NIGHT - it closes at 2 am!+ Valet is $2. Pretty sweet."
8/23/2017,4 star rating,I had the pleasure of dining at Hae Jang Chon last night. Although I am a lovely Caucasian woman I put all fear aside and stepped into this fine establishment to try the delightful all you can eat Korean BBQ. Upon entering the restaurant I parked my fiat with a nice man outside. I had to wait over an hour for a seat and I grew very impatient because I do not like to wait for anything. I put my pride aside and continued to wait. Once seated I was able to try many tasty side dishes including potato salad. It was lovely and almost tasted as good as my aunt Helen's potato salad. I loved the beef short rib it was delicious and the brisket was my favorite. I ordered a Diet Coke cause I like to watch my calorie intake. I was disappointed with the bulgogi as it looked like something I feed my cat. Flavor was okay. I would give 5 stars but having to wait over an hour is ridiculous. As a successful Caucasian woman having to wait that long is a waste of time. Since the place is so popular they should consider opening a bigger restaurant.
2/26/2014,3 star rating,"Ya know, every time I've dined here it's been on new dates. For some reason when guys find out I enjoy asian foods, or Korean cuisine, they seem to wanna eat here of all places. It's the worst date food, ever! The female counterparts hair will reek of BBQ when you lean in to kiss, not to mention kimchi breath. Ugh. Boys, learn to pick better first/second/third date spots. Also, don't know if I've been more pre-occupied attempting to dissect them boys rather than the food, but the food itself never stood out to be anything more memorable than the cheaper joints I frequent."
4/11/2011,5 star rating,"Look, let's be real. Â I'm not Korean. Â Hell, I'm not even Asian. Â But I love Korean BBQ! Â And so let's keep it real... Some Korean BBQ joints treat non-Koreans like pesky step-children they never wanted, but have to put up with. Â NOT HERE! Â Last night was my third time eating here. Â Our waitress was a nice lady named Jina. Â She was attentive, sweet and even had a cute little sense of humor! Â Her counterpart was also a pretty nice guy. Â We never had to wait for anything, and she patiently answered any questions we had. As you know with Korean BBQ, the grill smoke can get crazy! Â But their ventillation is actually pretty decent, even though I still smell like BBQ a day later. Â Thecuts of meat are good, the restaurant is clean, and service is great. Â It gets super crowded, so make reservations if possible. Â Last night - a Sunday - the place was full at midnight! Â We were a party of 7, and ended up getting seated after 25 minutes of waiting. The valet and the parking lot can be a pain in the butt too, so arrive with a little bit of patience. Â :-)"
1/18/2018,1 star rating,"Will never come back to this Korean BBQ. Very bad experience! Went here in a party of seven and we are seated in a small round table and servers insisted us to sit there even though we've complained that we are uncomfortable like sardines! eventually they transferred us to a rectangular table, that's good! but when you order side dishes like egg soup, they will only serve two at a time because that is their policy??? We are only asking for three and they cannot grant that because of policy? What a service! Also, I noticed that they seem to rush you putting in the meat themselves and put aside the ones you are still cooking just to speedup your eating, but that is maybe just on me. Good luck coming here and hopefully you will not be disappointed. My suggestion is since you are around K town already, go somewhere else. Paying $24.99 each person here is not worth it. Goodluck!"
12/9/2017,1 star rating,Make sure not to go to this place alone. I walked in to have lunch during work and a young man at the register asked me to pay for 2 people. They do not serve a single person unless you pay for 2 people. I found that to be ridiculous and walked out.
1/14/2013,4 star rating,"Went here for the AYCE lunch during a random weekday and we were seated quickly! Â Also it wasn't crowded at all so even parking was easy to find and it was free.

Â Go and experience good Korean bbq for yourself!"
10/12/2014,2 star rating,As far as KBBQ go this spot is on the low end in quality and taste. There are definitely better choices in the area. The bulgogi was bitter with a strong onion taste. The spicy pork was more sweet than spicy. The marinated short rib was the only thing on point. The banchan mediocre. Don't believe the hype.
4/1/2013,4 star rating,Service was prompt. Â Ambience is hip and food by far the best compared to other Korean places I've been too.
12/28/2012,5 star rating,"1.5 hour wait, then eat til you throw up. Quality of meats are awesome, If you get a grill that's uneven it can be a pain sometimes. I like that the waitresses come by to move things around for you. I always get tongue and brisket. Then there was the kimchi fried rice, which I skipped this last time. DELICIOUS!"
1/13/2016,4 star rating,"Great spot for good and very cost effective all you can eat Korean BBQ.The set up of the plates and sauces is excellent. Very convenient to use, and tasty sauces. Meats are over all very good, and the ban chan plates are very good too.The only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star rating is it seems that the quality of the non-marinated Galbi (my favorite order at Hae), has been taken down a notch lately. It is less tasty now and more chewy than before. I would have paid a little more for the previous meat quality.Regardless, this is a very good Korean BBQ spot, particularly if your timing is off hours. They do get busy at lunch and dinner regular times."
1/4/2012,4 star rating,"Decent AYCE BBQ for $16.99. Nothing really stands out, but it gets its job done on supplying ""good enough"" meat to hungry carnivores. I favor this restaurant for its location. I really like the plaza it is in, so my friends and I always find ourselves heading to Hae Jang Chon when we crave KBBQ. Only to realize that the wait, even during a weekday, is an hour at the LEAST. Â It's probably one of the most popular BBQ joints amongst non-Koreans and it is nearly impossible to be seated.A good place to go if you are seeking a bit run-down, bar-like ambience. Not for families."
11/1/2010,5 star rating,"All you meat lovers out there, shout $16.99! Â yea! Â let me hear you say $16.99! Â yea! Â say unlimited! Â yea! Â  Side dishes are below average but no one is here for the side dishes. Â For the meat, don't go for bulgogi and samgyupsal. Â Go for the unmarinated galbi (sang galbi) and chadol. Â  They use descent quality meat so grill away your life here. Â Hae Jang Chon also uses hot stone grill and has excellent service (they are very attentive and comes often to ask for any refils--meat, sauce, dduk).They also put kongnamuel and kimchi on the grill which makes beautiful side dishes to your meal. So all you meatatarians out there, put your hands up in the air and shout $16.99 and stop a cab to get your meat thirsty soul into Hae Jang Chon."

NOT good..almost ruined the rest of the night, as it scared most of our party.4) waits can be long here, but we got lucky on a friday night with only a 10 min wait)5) parking. thanks to yelp for another great grub spot! can't wait to come again, but this time, i'll come in pregnancy pants and bring advil to relieve the post-eating pain."

Â I actually enjoy the non-marinated galbi. Â The meat they had available were good and pretty good quality, just the galbi marinade was a bit too sweet for my taste. Â The sides - I was disappointed to see that they only had 3 small sides for you to eat. Â I'm used to seeing like 10 different ones.The sesame dipping sauce - YUM!!!The fried rice - I didn't enjoy too much. Â It had a tangy taste.The soup at the end wasn't very enjoyable to me eitherAlso, their kim chi was very sour and tangy, not what i'm used to.It's pretty cheap, 16.99 AYCE dinner compared to other places.

12/17/2011,2 star rating,"Wow. I know I haven't been here in a while, but this used to be my KBBQ on the reg and maybe it was a good thing to stay away for so long.I hyped this place up for my friends who have never been here because I always had an amazing time here. Funny how one time screws it all up. We were treated like crap by the manager because one of use didn't want to do KBBQ. They didn't tell us this when we got there. They just asked if we were going to BBQ, which we were... except for one of us. Our main server was a really nice guy. He was cool about it. Then ANOTHER server came by and was iffy about it and brought the manager, who in turn was a dick about it. Look, I get it. I get people cheat the system when they can, but saying you have to be vegetarian to be exempted because they can't ""watch"" you in case you cheat just sounds assy. You know they set up the table before you sit with all banchan and we're feeling guilty and shitty because the manager was talking down to us about ""how Korean BBQs are."" I fucking know how they are, why don't YOU learn how to be nice to customers before assuming that one person, who is NOT hungry for meat, is going to sneak a piece of food. I don't know if I'll go back anytime soon. If I do, I'll probably have words with the manager if he is there. He's lucky it was busy when we left. I'm knocking off 3 stars because I don't like feeling like the a**hole when clearly the the manager was being the a**hole.Good points - we were never rushed, brisket is some of the best in town, great value. Bad points - us feeling shitty in an otherwise good place."
3/8/2011,5 star rating,"I know! In a town with one bajillion and one places to eat AYCE KBBQ, you might wonder why I give this place 5 stars. It's because I LOVE it. Now, be prepared on busy nights & times to wait FOREVER. OK, maybe an hour or so. My mistake in going at 7pm on a weekend. Bad move, but you know what, if you want a snack, grab some chicken a few spots down or just leave altogether and hit the pho place or go somewhere else. It's Ktown, this is not the end all be all.OK, back to Hae Jang Chon. [Random, I always want to say Haeyoung because I just finished watching ""My Princess"".] Yes, the service is spotty. Yes, sometimes the hostess might look mad at the world. Yes, that is not water (good, because I live on tea). Yes, one or two of the servers look like cousins from Beast or Infinite. Yes, they might put your booze in cups and you may drink it faster than usual before closing time. No place is perfect, but I have just grown to love it here. They put the sprouts, kimchi and sometimes the pancakes on the grill-pan (extra points for red pepper in the sprouts). The AYCE is pretty decent. Some days are better than others. More good than bad or OK. Chicken is awesome. Samgyeopsal is always good. Sometimes, the brisket is double rainbow good. I might always look happy or appreciative, because I always get good service here. And my friends and I are never pressured to leave right away. Some AYCEs are all about making a buck and herding people in and out. I never feel like that here. Another cool thing, having some drinks and then heading to the coffee place across the way to sober up (or perhaps have some coffee and dessert. Alas, this is not their review, but a tiny suggestion to go over should you have a little bit to drink)."

5/10/2015,5 star rating,"Best KBBQ place I've been to! We had bulgogi, brisket, thin pork belly, thick pork belly, unmarinated and marinated shortribs, intestines (tripe and something else? not sure what it's called), spicy pork, squid, and octopus! Unmarinated shortrib and pork belly were my favorites, but everything was really good. AYCE also includes with steamed egg, kimchi pancakes, and bean paste soup, but you have to ask for them! I thought those dishes were okay, though. Banchan was also solid.At the end of the meal, they make kimchi fried rice on the grill - it was too sour for us, but I think it's because they gave us half the rice but all of the kimchi haha. Grills here are flat, circular stone grills, which makes everything easier to cook, I think. They clean it pretty frequently using shredded radish! It gets really packed, so definitely try to make a reservation, or you'll probably have to wait at least half an hour."

(But really, we just wanted to eat KBBQ and not think about manny' lost haha sadness ) As of now, it is my #1 place to go to for KBBQ... But, sadly I feel that the first time I went was better. I don't blame them, one can expect the weekends to be packed!!Memorable mentions:BEEF TONGUE: (10/10) OHHHMYYGAHH the beef tongue here is so amazing!! My boyfriend and I must have ordered 10 or so rounds, because the beef tongue here is just the perfect amount of chewy and melty!!BEEF BRISKET: (5/10) oh man, the brisket was just not on point last night. We had to ask the server to get rid of our already grilled brisket because it was just WAY too fatty! I'm not going to hold it against them though, because the first time we went here, the brisket was perfect... Even more so than the beef tongue! Everyone else was nice, but I forgot what was ordered to go into detail, haha. We had kimchi fried rice at the end, but I was too full to enjoy it. We will be back when we come to ktown!"

6/18/2009,5 star rating,"This place was amazing! It was heaven compared to the other place I went to. My friends and I went during lunch time, so we were one of two parties in the restaurant. Waiters were prompt and friendly, and the meat was fresh. (It was RED!) They didn't get pissed off at our constant ordering of dishes, which was a plus. The squid here is amazing.At the end of the AYCE meal, be sure to try the kimchi fried rice and the soup. I was put off by the kimchi at the beginning of the meal and now I regret not having tried it."
5/8/2011,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is one of my favorite Korean BBQ places in the city. It's AYCE for $16.99. You can choose from 19 different items to grill. Some that I remember:-Beef Brisket-Bulgogi-Kalbi-Pork Belly-Beef Tongue-BBQ Pork-BBQ Chicken-Squid-Hot Dogs(!)The meal also comes with steamed egg, korean miso soup, kimchee pancake(!) and KIMCHEE FRIED RICE at the end. The kimchee rice is sooo good so make sure you save room for it at the end.The ambience is nice and it's decorated in a cute way. Reminds me of some places I've been to in Korea.Service is just ok but it's usually because they're very busy. Speaking of busy, they can get packed on the weekends so be prepared to wait.Parking is valet only during the evenings. Kinda sux but that seems to be the norm in K-town.Tip: If someone orders steamed rice during the meal, they will give you less kimchee rice at the end or charge you for it if everybody got a steamed rice earlier. Basically, you get one or the other."
8/22/2011,4 star rating,"Another great place to eat in Ktown (there are many). When you're getting tired of Sanya, and want more variety and also some more cleanliness, Hae Jang Chon is your place to go. All you can eat is still pretty cheap at $16.99.For this price, you get to choose from many different kinds of meat and so many more side dishes. It is such a great deal and you will be a happy, very satisfied pig.Now let's go over some of the meats you should order. The beef tongue is definitely one of the best, and is fresh and so tender. The pork belly and pork shoulder were also very tender and good quality. I was a little disappointed by the kalbi. It wasn't that flavorful. Â I recommend wrapping the meats with the rice paper. It is a great combination.They also come with so many side dishes: salad, bean sprouts (YUM), kimchi (not that good here), steamed egg, kimchi pancake, and a lot more. To end off the meal, they cook kimchi fried rice right in front of you. So whenever you're in Ktown, this is another place you HAVE to try. For 16.99, you will get a boatload of food and you will definitely be a happy happy customer!"
10/15/2011,4 star rating,"Delicious and reasonably priced. The things that set this place apart from most other AYCE KBBQ places in K-Town for me are the extra deliciousness and they give you kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice. Yay for kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice. Although I've only been to like 5-10 other AYCE KBBQ places in K-Town, so that's what, like 4% of the existing ones?When I go on Saturday evenings, the wait is 1+ hours. Not sure if it's worth the wait.I'm not sure how I feel about the birthday music."
10/31/2011,4 star rating,"I can't pronounce or spell 90% of what I ate, but I can say that for $16.99, I left mesmerized, full and REALLY stinky!This was my first Korean BBQ experience and based on it, I would DEFINITELY come back. Â I do remember the short rib and the marinated beef were both delish. Â The Kimchi cake thingy was also interesting and tasty as were all the dipping sauces.One thing I made note of (& why I dropped a star) was that the staff was not exactly friendly. Â In fairness they were busy, but for those of us that were new to this cuisine, a little welcome, patience and guidance would have been helpful, but we were mostly scared to ask anything out of fear of an eye roll or scowl. Â Interestingly enough, I mentioned this to a friend who said she's sensed that at various other Korean BBQ restaurants. Â Perhaps its a cultural thing? Â I dunno.Bottom Line: Â Try this place. Â Go with an open mind and try everything. Â Also, DON'T WEAR ANYTHING FANCY, you will REEK!"
5/8/2015,5 star rating,"This review has been a long time coming. I call this restaurant ""the happy pig"" (probably cause of the logo) but mostly because the food tastes like it was happy being prepared. The authentic Korean grills are what makes this food amazing! Not to mention the great service (which is a plus!) and bomb ass Hite beer to go with it, served in ice cold glasses. Yes, depending on what day/time you go there is a wait.....but it's worth it! Affordable price, delicious food and great ambiance!"
8/26/2012,4 star rating,"The prices raised to $17.99 a person now Â for all you can eat (updated on their website). Â There are a lot of items you can choose from and you get steamed eggs, kimchi pancake, soup, fried rice and all the appetizer dishes. COME EARLY or else you'll be waiting FOREVER! I thought I came early but showing up at 4:30 but I still had to wait 30-45mins to be seated. I really thought at first the staff was just SUPER slow at setting up tables because I could see from outside that there were plenty of EMPTY tables but they weren't seating anyone. They would slowly set everything up and take their sweet sweet time to do it. But I later realized that the grills they use are made of stone and require a LONG time to heat up, and they want the grill heated up before the customer sits down so they literally just let the grill sit on the top of the fire for a SUPER long time before seating the customers. It's super inefficient and is so time consuming! But I think it is nice that when you do get seated, you can eat right away before everything is already set up for you. Overall, I thought the food was delicious. It was annoying to wait in the beginning but I thought it was worth it. It's probably not worth it if you come during peak hours and have to wait longer than an hour to be seated. The staff was nice but I don't know if I liked how they sometimes try to take over and cook the meat for you. I know they have the best intentions but sometimes you just line all the meat up perfectly and then they come over and stir everything up and ruin everything. I really liked the bulgogi, spare ribs and BBQ chicken. Those were my favorite meats!"
5/7/2015,5 star rating,Line out the door but it's never as long as it looks! And it's worth the wait! All you can eat and so delish! We love this place!
11/28/2017,5 star rating,Best experience with Korean BBQ! Very clean and super friendly environment. They even taught and educated me on the correct way to eat my dish. And of course the food was amazing and delicious! Thank you! Would definitely recommend this place :)

5/24/2010,4 star rating,"I've become a huge fan of this place. Two big reasons:1. Food is awesome2. Service was super friendly and helpfulOrdered:Stewed pork w/hot potatoBeef rib eyePork ribsHite beer and sojuAll were delicious but especially the stewed pork in that typical Korean red soup. The meat on the pork would just be sliding off. SO tender. The potatoes would nicely take the saltiness away.The waiter guys are all super cool and friendly. I think it's a cultural thing but I find Korean establishments waiters/waitresses to be more stoic than all cheery. If you go to the core places with the older Korean ladies some seem straight up pissed. I know it's not personal and I have no problem but yeah these guys were cool, funny, and helped us order.Will go back.TIP: Like most Korean BBQ places, wear clothes that you don't mind stinking up and don't plan on going anywhere classy afterwards. You will be smelling well into the next day, as that stuff gets into your skin lol. Â The only destination after eating here should be back home to your couch and TV."
3/30/2011,3 star rating,"I'm rating this place with three stars because the service was quite poor. Waiter had a heavy accent and was a bit difficult to understand. Even though my friend made a great effort to try and understand him, the waiter suddenly exasperated. We ended up having three servers that night and came around to check on us about 3 times. No bueno! We though it might have been the fact that we did not order any alcohol, hmmm. It gets pretty loud in there, not a good place to carry on a conversation. On the other hand, the food was really good and they served mass amounts of it. The menu if fairly priced. It can take anywhere between 15-45 min to get a table. Luckily it was only two of us so we were seated promptly, or so I thought. I did get there 15 minutes late, terrible lil o'me :) Ohh valet parking only so make sure you have dolla bills on ya!"
12/12/2011,4 star rating,"Some close friends ventured out to LA to meet for dinner last Friday, I said Korean BBQ...but the place in Ktown I've always went to? Closed down :( So I jumped on Yelp and found pretty good reviews & details, off to Ktown we go to Hae Jang Chon!Note: They don't seat you until your ENTIRE party is there. I was late, so my friends had to wait til I got there but I get the reason why, this place gets jammin' packed! 19 items to choose from for AYCE at only $16.99? AWESOME! We loved the Beef Short Ribs, Pork Belly & Beef Honeycomb, the Kimchi Pancake was delicious, as well as the great assortment of unlimited banchan (kimchi, rice cake wrap, pickled daikon, Asian spinach/broccoli veggie dish, fish cake, bean sprouts, potato salad, house salad).I didn't care too much for the kimchi rice that's served ONLY at the end - too mushy, and who wants rice scrambled on your grill with all the leftover remnants of all the meat you grilled & ate throughout your meal? What I didn't care for more? The service was kinda lame - they didn't give one of us a soup, we didn't know steamed rice could be ordered during the meal, and they pile on the meat onto your grill right away to hurry up your eating. I get it, the line's long, they want to get the most rotation out of their tables...but the beauty of Korean BBQ is to grill your food at your table, and eat while you're hanging out and drinking those tall azz Korean beers :)My two friends are still talking about the great food - and hands down, this place rocks it for the $17 price tag. WE WILL BE BACK!"
1/30/2012,1 star rating,"Came here for lunch and walked out stuffed but not satisfiedThey have a good selection for the AYCE but none of the meat were fresh. Given that there weren't too many people, the lack of service was also unacceptable. This is actually my second time here so when I yelped this place and saw 4 stars w/ nearly 1000 reviews, I was totally shocked. My first time wasn't memorable so I thought, new management. Whatever's going on, don't believe the hype. this is definitely not the place to spend your money. try kyochon 2 stores down. no it's not kbbq but it's great chicken and definitely a better way to spend your money. if you're coming at night, parking sucks and if i'm not mistaken, parking is NOT free if you are eating at this particular restaurant."
5/21/2012,2 star rating,"I don't get the hype. It's been a long time since I do AYCE Korean BBQ. Family is in town so I yelp and Hae Jang Chon Korean was on top of the list. Just came back home from it jumped right in the shower. Now I remembered why Korean BBQ rarely on top of my list of the place to eat. You know in life there are sign of things, from reviewing yelp I've mentally collected them. One, if there's more white people than Japanese people in a sushi place, then this place gonna sucks. Two, if there's no old Korean people eating at AYCE place, then you should know their meat is below average. If you're name is Oprah and you read a story about a character name Harpo, it's a sign from God that you should play that role (Harpo when spelled backward is Oprah), lol off topic. Yep, that was how Oprah got started to fame. She said it was a sign from God to play character Harpo in the story ""Purple Color"".When seated all the little dishes were set ready for you to start munching. Then we picked 4 items of the 19 items, only four at a time for a table of 51/2, the half was my 4 month old nephew (Must see picture) lol.Angus beef - chewy, little flavors, 1/3 are fatShort Ribs - Softer but still chewy, little flavors... dude what happen to Korean famous marinate? That's what makes Korean BBQ so great because it has bunch of marinate with bunch of ... wait for it... MSG!Canadian Pork Belly - straight up pork fat with itsy, bitsy meat. Yes it's pork belly it's suppose to be fatty I get that. Would be nice if it's smoked or cured. Nope, it's frozen then thinly sliced no flavors.Bulgogi - tough, little flavor, disappointingKimchi pancake - after my ""uncle"" tasted it, he said ""these are a little bland"" in Aussie accent, lol. I didn't bother touching it. It's like jello. I wasn't full but more of disgusted full like you were excited before eating then disappointed. But it's $16.99!Would someone please tell me this other AYCE KBBQ place. My bitch ass ex took me there it's on 6th Street, green building, super packed parking, double door entrance. I think there are two stories, high ceiling. They charge $18.99 AYCE and it was way better than this place. Recaps:Meat is below average. Grading beef is simple just have to remember the top three: Prime, Choice, and Select. Yes, beef are graded based on the amount of marbling in the meat and the age of the animal. These beef were Select cuts.Service- attentive, friendly and the guys waiters are a looker. Was that why there are so many teenybooppers? I'm not gay, and there's nothing wrong with that, but this waiter ""Jay"" should he be in some Korean boy ban?! Ambiance - typical Korean BBQ place, yeah you'll be covered with BBQ smell all the way home. Didn't think it would bothered me that much until I got home."

We did the all you can eat :) best deal. and it was damn good. Though alot of people hate cooking their own food when going out i enjoyed doing it.we ate the pork shoulders (which sounds odd but damn good), the galbi,and brisket it was all delicious. Â The price was fair and the food good. Â Only problem i had was this one couple next to us who were extremely annoying. Â The guy was some douche bag that thought he was funny and was talking loud so he could let everyone know in the resturaunt he was dating an asian. he needed to get over himself.but anyway id definately go here again. worth the price"

8/29/2011,3 star rating,"Dragged the bf here after a night of drinking. I love korean bbq and desperately tried to convince him that the $16.99 all you can eat deal was the best value for our money, and that we would be able to finish it all. He just shook his head, probably thinking that his skinny ex-girlfriend would've never put him through this.Our waiter looked like the Asian version of the Situation with overdeveloped pecs and dyed hair. When we asked for more time to order, he shot back, ""You don't have much time."" When we decided on the bulgogi beef instead of the all you can eat special, he replied incredulously, ""That's it?!""Needless to say, we couldn't even finish the bulgogi beef, but it was delicious--very juicy and tender with great flavor. The banchan were also good; I especially liked the kimchi and potato salad. The dipping sauces they provided were fantastic.Despite spending the entire meal saying ""I told you so,"" as we left LA the bf said that this was his favorite restaurant we had gone to during our trip."
6/17/2015,1 star rating,I may never understand why this place has a long line. I went here for lunch and the service was horrible. The meat took forever to cook and it was chewy. Terrible quality meat. Their side dishes were stale. I don't get why people wait in line for this place. Did i miss something?
6/15/2014,4 star rating,"This is a great place to eat! The food was awesome and fun to be cooking in front of you at the table. The place was crazy packed but luckily we made a reservation so we didn't have to wait. Parking was ridiculous. Tiny parking lot and it was mostly valet (~$2). There was a long wait for the valet and to get our car. When you sit down, there is a large stone pan that cooks the meat. You get all the standard Korean side dishes. Only $18.99 for all you can eat Korean barbecue, which is cheap for where I am from (Phoenix). Many Korean BBQ places can get smokey from all the cooking meat. This place had pretty good ventilation but you will still leave smelling like BBQ. I would suggest leaving your jacket in the car so it won't smell. The heat from the table top will keep you warm. The meat was delicious and it just kept coming. They bring you the raw meat to the table and it is cooked on the stone plate in front of you. Our server did most of the cooking so we just sat back and ate as it finished. Everything was good but we especially enjoyed the marinated short ribs and the octopus. BE CAREFUL of how much you order because there is a large charge if you have leftover meat ($15 I think)."
12/27/2012,5 star rating,"With so many KBBQ choices in LA, it can be challenging to find one that offers great food and service at a decent price. If you're reading this, you've found one of the best AYCE kbbq in LA! The wait around 8pm was about an hour long ... but it was worth it! Â  $17.99 for AYCE was a deal for the variety and quality of food. We went here for my sisters white coat dinner celebration and the whole family enjoyed it.Unlike some other Korean restaraunts I've been to, the staff here was very friendly and accommodating to non-Korean speakers. We ordered almost everything on the menu ranging from brisket to bulgogi to squid and baby octopus! The kimchi fried rice at the end was a nice way to top off a satisfying meal. I will definitely be returning here soon!"
10/28/2012,1 star rating,"I've wanted to try this place for long time because every time I pass by 6th, there are so many ppl waiting outside to be seated and I heard it's like an hour or two waiting! I took my friend and his mother here for the first time around 5pm on Saturday to beat the waiting.Service: Suck. When we order first dish of bbq we want, we waited 20 min for the meat to come. Guess they were short on staff on Saturday? Food: D+ I'm not sure why this place deserve 4 stars from 1000+ yelp reviewers. I'm guessing they don't know what BBQ should suppose to taste like? Their brisket meat was alright.. but their marinated kalbi and bulgogi are just sooooooo bland and wasn't flavorful at all. Soybean soup was also bland. I had one spoon and I was done with this soup. Anyone want to try this place here just because it has high reviews on help, please skip here. I rather go Moo Dae Po II or Road to Seoul(not that I'm fan of two places but better between the 3) over this."
12/28/2010,5 star rating,"By far, my no.1 all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place! Â I love this place so much, it's a pity I can't eat as much as my eyes want to...hahaha... Â It's $15.99/person. Â Unlike others, they use stone grills and puts the kimchi on the grill... The meat are very fresh and good. Â The squid here is the best! don't know why but I love their squid compared to other BBQ place... All the banchan (side dishes) are delicious... I'm happy enough just with the banchan... there are many korean BBQ places that serves bad banchan, but not here... I always ask for refills...hahaha.... Â their kimchi pancakes are also good, though my Korean friend said it needs more kimchi.. ^^ But she did say all the others dishes were great...Then the best part is at the end when they make the seaweed fried rice and give you the soybean paste soup... it's sooooo good..... I'm usually too full at this point but I'll still try to eat them cause they're so good...Ask for the barley tea, not water....I've never been disappointed with anything they serve here...

Â One thing I didn't like was that the grill did not get the char on the meat that I like. Â Other than that, everything was fabulous! Â Good quality meat, great service, Â I came out with minimal smellage. Â The kimchi fried rice was bland in my opinion but I was there for the meat. Â My recommendations on meat are: brisket, pork belly, and beef tongue! Â sooooooooooooooo good. Â I wish I could find a place in Northern Cali as good."
4/30/2013,5 star rating,"My favorite AYCE Korean BBQ spot. The food is too good. & the servers are very attentive, no matter how busy it gets. When you come here, try the brisket, bulgogi, and kalbi. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The banchan selection is also something to look forward to, as well as the kimchi fried rice at the end (make sure to leave the rice on the grill for a little longer to get the extra crisp). The atmosphere is relaxing. A great place to chill with friends and have good food."
4/29/2013,5 star rating,"This place is great!First of all, we had the best waitress at a KBBQ ever, Yun-Rim. All the staff that we interacted with were very pleasant, but she took the cake.Also, the meats were good, wish there was a little more variety of bulgogi, but everything tasted great.The restaurant decor and atmosphere is clean, and overall complements the food well.Definitely will come back."

3/17/2015,1 star rating,"Came here on a visit to Los Angeles with my family and ended up leaving with a very poor impression of the restaurant. So, it was lunch timd and we decided not to get kbbq, but some other meat items on the menu. I dont get why servers don't think service is important. Is it that hard to give a smile and be polite? I guess it is for them. Also, the bulgogi we ordered came out with uncooked onions. Looked like a half assed job. I probably will not visit again due to the first impression I got of the restaurant. How unfortunate..."
11/28/2010,5 star rating,"How is this place only $17 per person for all you can eat?Perhaps there's something questionable going on behind the scenes to keep the cost down, but unless it directly affects my health, I could really care less.They have a wide selection of meats to choose from, but if you're wise, you'll just keep demanding brisket and kalbi. Â Tongue is acceptable. Â The sides are good, and even the salad, simple as it is, deserves high marks. Â At the end of the meal, once you start whining about feeling full, they'll dump a bunch of awesome on your grill and make kimchi fried rice for you.The average patron here is on the younger side. Â Mostly large groups of college-age (or slightly older) friends; you don't see too many families. Â That shouldn't stop you from bringing yours though. Â Recommend taking someone on their birthday for a good laugh.For those familiar with Palace BBQ in the Bay Area, Hae Jang Chon is a completely different, though no less satisfying AYCE KBBQ experience."

I waited 3 hours in line on a Saturday evening.I called in advance, they said reservation list is full but the wait time is from 35 - 45 minutes. We put down our names at 6:15, walked around for a bit... 2.5 hours, we are still waiting for a 2 persons table. THIS IS INSANE!I mean, the food tasted good... but I got sick all day the next day. Whether it is because I was too hungry after waiting for 3 hours and food was just too heavy at 10 pm or food poisoning? I don't know. I just know, I've been traumatized. If you must try this place, call a few days in advance - 30 minutes wait with reservation."
8/12/2010,5 star rating,"Wow. Â I actually went on vacation with my usual no red meat diet when I had lunch here. Â This is the most authentic korean bbq I've ever had. My gf who spent 2 years in Korea said the same as well.16.99 is a bit pricy for lunch, even if it is all you can eat but the quality and authenticity of the meal really makes up for the price.You get all the delicious well made banchans- fish cake, kimchee/bean sprouts, greens,, potato salad...but they are truly made right. 4 delicious sauces, bean paste, chili sauce, sesame sauce, and another with radish. A pancake, egg souffle, rice, and your choice of 4 meats at a time. Â You can order from a variety of pork belly, pork shoulder, angus steak, galbi, bulgogi, beef tongue, octopus, chicken, hot dog even. Â All you can eat! The portions are generous and we couldn't go more than one round of meat order.Hands down the Best Korean bbq I've ever had. This place exceeds all of the Korean bbq places in the Bay Area.Our server was very good. I believe his name was Jae Won? He was sweet, attentive, and joked around with us. Didn't care for the assistant manager as much- he was not so friendly.Cant wait to return!!!!!"
2/6/2015,5 star rating,"Came here for the second time last night to celebrate my Puerto Rican friend's birthday (she loves Korean bbq). It was her second time as well and we couldn't be happier with the service, we did not have to push the service button not even once! Great job for our server, she was soooo sweet and attentive. Our food left me completely satisfied. We had different meats and brisket of course!!! We also had some beer and a long happy night of non-stopping talking and laughs. This place was everything last night. Keep up the good work!"
9/23/2015,4 star rating,"Probably the best service we've had at a KBBQ. The meat was good but not great compared to others, brisket was a little tough. And our steamed egg was burnt and inedible. Overall good experience."
6/6/2013,4 star rating,"On a Sunday night, we had a group of 6 and waited 45 minutes to an hour to get a table. This was the first time for most of us and the staff here were very helpful and when we were almost done with the food, they'd come by to take another order. Once we started to slow down though, we felt like they were trying to rush us out. The food and sauces were delicious, totally hit the spot. It was a pretty reasonable price at $25 per person with tax and tip. There appeared to be only a single bathroom and someone was in it all evening."
7/13/2014,5 star rating,"Stumbled in here around midnight and I could not have been happier with this place. The smaller sides are authentic and delicious, as is the marinated meat and seafood. Definitely order the squid and beef tongue."
10/14/2007,4 star rating,"$80 bucks for three people...not bad.Your typical K BBQ joint. Open ""patio"" seating for smokers, inadequate venting, perfunctory staff, 99% Korean population, etc. The thin beef brisket and black pork belly were good, though. Good portions (not overwhelmingly awesome). I was rather disappointed with the gamja-tang (spicy potato soup). The pork shoulder was good, but the broth, although moderately thick and very spicy, lacked flavor. Of course, the meal wasn't complete without the kimchi fried rice in the end---not better than other joints, yet it was still edible. Kimchi pajeon rocked. Their salad, however, was just iceberg lettuce with a sweet vinagrette, not the traditional green onion and romain lettuce one. Still, that with the meat in salt-oil rolled around roasted garlic cloves dipped in denjang = heaven. I don't care if Â I sweat garlic, I swear it's the only essential spice.Overall, a good first experience, even if it is located next door to the wretched Kyochon Chicken. I guess I don't really have anything to complain about because my friends bought the dinner (for my birthday). Huzzah for free meals!"
10/14/2010,2 star rating,Very overrated... Nothing really good bout this place... N I even waited for the kimchi fried rice OMG sooo greasy n the bean paste soup is soooo salty all the meat was ok... I won't be bak but I really loved the waitersI will see everyone at Road to Souel the best acye kbbq to me so far
7/26/2013,3 star rating,"As a frequenter of cheaper AYCE places like Sanya and O Dae San, I'm going to say that Hae Jang Chon has much better cuts of meat than those places. That's to be expected, since it's cheapest tier of AYCE is $18.99.However, I knocked down Hae Jang Chon down a star from the 4-star review I would give it, because, despite the amount of attention we got from the waiters and waitresses (rare at busy AYCE places), it was negative attention. It felt like the entire time, despite there not really even being a wait anymore (my party of 2 came in at 11 PM, when the rush had died down) the waiters were constantly rushing us. Multiple times, they would come up and just grab the tongs out of my hands and start dumping meat on my grill and I would have to insist multiple times that they STOP because there was already a lot of cooked meat on the grill we had to finish."
8/28/2014,1 star rating,Came here once and never ever will I come back again. Came here on a Thursday night for a party of only 2 (including myself); arrived at 8:30pm and waited over an hour just to be seated. It's just way too ridiculous to have to wait for so long just to eat something so basic.
10/8/2009,4 star rating,"After arriving home I counted the number of animals I ate: just three, although they were prepared seven different ways. Â I was definitely an amateur compared to the possibilites offered by this Korean barbecue restaurant, which specializes in all-you-can-eat. Â With touches that set it apart from other Korean barbecue joints, this place doesn't disappoint if you're looking to get filled up with delicious food for a good price. Â Also within walking distance from the Purple Line!Best Qualities: Â Food, atmosphere, value. Â Hae Jang Chon uses darker, more natural materials in their restaurant, and doesn't have the nasty bright lighting that seems to taint other Korean BBQ places. Â They also use this nifty stone grill that cooks the meat more evenly, drains it well, and doesn't get as nasty as the metal plates. Â The meal comes with four sauces (love the condiments) and is a pretty good deal for $17.Aspect to Improve: Service. Â The service was sufficient--reasonably attentive and helpful but nothing extraordinary.Recommended Items:The whole farm."
3/6/2010,1 star rating,"Let me tell you, I loved this place. I went there often and made the 30 minute trek to get my kbbq fix.They totally ruined their customer relationship with me this past week. My boyfriend had made reservations two weeks in advance for my birthday dinner. We get there.... with about 8/12 of our guests already and they won't seat us. We waited 30 minutes to be seated and one guy the one with the glasses just totally dismissed me when I asked him what the situation was.We finally were seated, but lo and behold THEY SCREWED UP THE RESERVATION. For a party of 12 they separated us into four separate tables... what's the situation here? If you're there to celebrate you don't want to be separated from the people you're celebrating with.My boyfriend specifically booked their long table. The people that were currently sitting at that table had already ordered and what not so I'm PRETTY POSITIVE they just either booked them a half hour earlier than us and blamed double booking. Either that or they simply seated people without a reservation there first. The stupid thing was that party didn't even utilize the whole table. We complained they said ""I'll talk to the manager"" but never did. But, we tried to make the best out of being at 4 different tables. I just hopped from table to table.NOBODY came to take our order for another 30 minutes. We had to ask. Finally, they wouldn't give us tongs to cook our meat.... but would completely forget about us and our meat would BURN. Then my friends at one table were COMPLETELY out of meat but their meat platter was behind them. They asked the waiter if they could get it he said NO NOT YET.WTF. Theyre DONE EATING why cant they have their meat?We had to take things into our own hands or we wuldve been there for HOURS and just took the plates ourselves and used chopsticks. My friends repeatedly asked for more water and it never came, had to ask for orders of rice MULTIPLE times before it came, and finally at the end where you would USUALLY get kimchi fried rice they didn't even OFFER and turned off our stoves.Let alone. We had only been eating one hour so it wasn't like we were taking a long time.ALSO they had the nerve to complain that each table seated 4 and we only had 12 so we shouldn't have 4 tables but 3.I was like excuse me, you messed up the reservations now you're complaining about tables? They only had THREE PEOPLE WAITING AT THE DOOR. because it was ""a special day"" they said they would let us have the 4 tables. really? really. to sum it all up, most of us never got past 2 orders of food at an AYCE which isn't much considering it's split between 3-4 people. Yes, the food was good. But would I come back after being treated that way? Doubtful. I don't care how good the food was.Now, to be fair i must mention the waiter was nice to me after finding out it was my birthday, but just being nice to my table doesn't extend to all 4 tables.I hyped all my friends about it and hoped to convince them to make the trip out there with me, too! because i thought it was so amazing. but now, i doubt they will because they are pissed off to no end. However, the other times I have been there the service was amazing. But, it just takes one time to sever ties."
5/16/2010,3 star rating,"Came here at 6:30pm on a Saturday and surprisingly the wait wasn't too long. Valet was just $2 and they pull up your car pretty quickly.On with the food. For an AYCE korean bbq the meat here is just the same as any other place. You cook on a stone top that has a little hole on it to drain out the oil. For us, the entire top slide off the fire. A waitress used a pair of wooden chopsticks to hold it back in place.Overall, just another average AYCE Korean bbq restaurant. Great if you're looking for a quick fix for your bbq cravings."
10/15/2010,3 star rating,"I decided to have one of my bday dinners here for some AYCE MEAT. Why, bc meat is frickin awesome. Obvious!I had a reservation for 7:45P, and of course LA traffic always manages to put a damper in your schedule when you need to go somewhere. We were about 15 minutes late and I went to the hostess and she told me she gave our table away bc I didn't answer my phone and we have to wait and put our name on the list. EXCUSE ME? I did not get a phone call! I think she was just saying that because they had a ridic line outside. Granted, yes, It's my fault I was late, but I did NOT get a call from the restaurant. My friend was nice enough to be the ""bad guy"" and ask to be seated ASAP since we had a reservation and it was for my birthday and everyone drove from afar. She said we would get the next table, but I think she just put us down on the list bc we kept going, ""waittttt, we're next"". We got seated in about 20 minutes or so.I personally think this is one of the better AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants I've been to. Great selection and the meat is one of the better qualities. They even have the kimchi pancake and egg fish as part of the menu. I think the AYCE for $16.99 is worth checking out. I would be back here if I ever had that Korean BBQ meat craving!Parking can be tricky in the lot bc this place is always crackin, but there is street parking too. Also, you should check out Haus across the street for some yummy desserts!"
2/15/2011,5 star rating,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this kbbq place1) the service was wayy better than any kbbq place.2) the meat was fresh and thinly cut so it was easy to cook and easy to eat.MUST have: brisket,bulgogi marinated, thin bacon, and short ribs YUM YUM YUM$16.99 definately worth every pennyAlso.. i dunno what ppl are fussing about the lack of banchan. dude. your here to eat the meat. not fill up on the sides.. ne ways i didnt feel that there was a lack.. we got this sliced tofu item, shredded radish, big bowl of salad, kimchi, beat sprouts, kimchi pancake, potato salad, this green veg, and at the end we got soup and the kimchi fried rice. fried rice =heaven on earth hahaha i love it.We got tons of rice paper and radish paper which they kept refilling..Parking sucks though. but it doesnt matter hahaLOL make a reservation so u dont have to wait 30-40 mins.. haha luckily I made a reso!Thank you to my yelp buddy!I will be back. SOON!"
7/4/2011,5 star rating,"The stone grills are amazing, and they make a huge difference in the quality of the meat. So tender and flavorful!I like that there are no fancy frills here. The staff is friendly, and they spoil us with so much yummy little treats in the beginning. I love the rice wraps that they give you for your meat, and the awesome sauces that come with it. Kimchi pancakes, kimchi fried rice, omg so much kimchi options! The marinated kalbi is my favorite! The pork shoulder and the honeycomb are also worth a try. Deliciously decadent, I eat so much meat here I feel like a LION! Rwar.... Burp. The staff will get Asian aunty on you and take over the grill, if you are cooking your food wrong. So if you are a first timer at Korean BBQ this is a good place to go. This is my favorite Korean BBQ spot so far, but keep it in mind this is a Filipino/Chinese's persons opinion. However, it's only $16.99 for all you can eat, whearas other places charge $19-20 and the whole experience is just boo boo. The first time we tried to come here it was a 2 1/2 hour wait, so try to get here during earlier dinner time, if you don't want to wait your whole life to get sit down and eat."
8/15/2011,4 star rating,"If I go to a Korean BBQ restaurant and there's an option for All-You-Can-Eat, I'll take it. It's because I know I can eat my money's worth, even if the food isn't that great. So when I find a place that has both quality & quantity in their buffet selection, I'm sold.Visiting with a friend in LA, we decided to grab ourselves a Korean dinner.I got the All You Can Eat Special for $16.99 (+ 1.00 for the Beef Brisket option) which included a wide selection of meats. We stuck with our rounds of Beef Brisket, Beef Short Ribs, Beef Tongue, BBQ Pork, Kim Chee Pancakes and Kim Chee Fried Rice. All the meats were tasty. I really enjoyed their Kim Chee pancakes, which was a first for me.They cooked the food over a hot stone rather than a metal grill. It seemed easier to clean because the stone was circular which prevented any food from getting stuck in corners. Each time they replenished our meat supply, they cleaned our stone thoroughly in a matter of seconds. I really appreciated this because it showed they were sanitary and to some degree, healthy. I'm all for clearing away those burnt, carcinogenic food bits.If you're hungry for some good Korean BBQ, stop by Hae Jang Chon with your empty stomachs! You'll get your money's worth."

8/13/2012,5 star rating,"This has always been my go to place for korean bbq in ktown.There are plenty of AYCE BBQ places around the area. But there is something about Hae Jang Chon and that flat iron/stone grill that produces the most savory meat! While it may not be as wild and loud as Moodaepo2 or Road to Seoul, Hae Jang Chon can hold it's own just fine. While there are plenty of meats to choose from, I keep finding myself coming back to the beef brisket here. It seems slightly more thinly cut than some of the other places nearby. Do Make sure to loosen that belt one notch when they serve you kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal. gotta love it!"
7/21/2015,3 star rating,"Paid like $22 bucks a person & definitely wasn't worth it to me. I rather go to Gen Kbbq. Better variety of food and better marinated meat. This place isn't bad, but if you're in the area. I still rather go to Gen Kbbq. This place didn't satisfy me at all. Everything tastes basic to me, like the regular cheap $10 kbbq."
1/13/2011,5 star rating,"This is hands down the best Korean BBQ I've been to, the prices are very very fair. Â The service is great, and the all you can eat buffet is awesome. Â The best part about it is the kimchi fried rice!The short rib is just perfect, as a colleague says, it's an ""explosion of flavor in your mouth, and I love that explosion"" insert your own joke here.The staff has always been very friendly and they are definitely my first choice for Korean bbq. Â They do get busy on the weekends and if there are Lakers games at night. Â They take reservation so if you don't want to wait, I'd suggest making a reservation."

4/13/2011,5 star rating,"My favorite ayce Korean BBQ place so far. Good enough that it impelled me to write this review. Great selection of meats to choose from, so you never get bored of the flavor. Â Quality was solid, beef tongue was better than most places. They also have a cool stone grill that cooks the meat fast and evenly. Although, not as good as charcoal in my opinion. Their banchan was so so, I've definitely had better at other ayce places. The salad could use some green onions, and the Egg dish was Â a bit runny. What stood out for me was their excellent service. First of all, they have English speaking servers, so you don't feel awkward ordering in English (yeah my Korean sucks). Secondly, they refilled all our banchan and ice water without us asking...which is CRUCIAL. Last and most importantly, they grill your meat for you. This type of service is unusual for an ayce place..epic win!!"
7/16/2011,5 star rating,"My friends and I had dinner here for the first time last weekend. One of the guys had introduced the place to us. We live about half an hour away from Los Angeles so we never knew about this little restaurant. Usually we would head to Garden Grove for our Korean BBQ Â fix, but I think we have found a new group favorite!I think the atmosphere at Hae Jang Chon is perfect for Korean BBQ. It's not an overly fancy restaurant where you tend to watch how much you eat and how you eat nor is it a shabby restaurant by any means. It's just STRAIGHTFORWARD eating, eating, and eating! You have a good time with friends, the atmosphere is lively, the meat is fresh and well-marinated, and the service is fairly accommodating~ The unique thing to this restaurant (at least it's the first that I've seen at many places) is that the meat is cooked on top of a large stone plate above the fire! It might just be me, but it seems that the meat is cooked faster this way...?For that first time eating at Hae Jang Chon, our group actually stayed for 3 hours (6pm-9pm)! I so could have eaten more but we were saving ourselves for dinner. They give you a lot of meat per plate and the price is reasonable at about $17(?) per person (without tax). My favorite is the bulgogi there :) I sure ate my money's worth that day!I am definitely coming back in the near future and possibly with more company!"
7/16/2015,5 star rating,"Best KBBQ in LA if I do say so myself. The service is impeccable!!! The quality of meat is amazing. And you can order as much meat as you can handle!

10/26/2010,5 star rating,"I've been to many AYCE Korean BBQ joints in the area and this place is hands down the best I've tried so far. Â First, they use a stone grill Â that's tilted to drain the fat (can you say awesome?!?). Â There's also a huge selection of meat, but they only allow you to order 4-5 types at a time. Â There were also about 6 banchan dishes, plus a kimchi pancake and steamed egg. Â In terms of quality, to be honest, I didn't really see a difference between here and other AYCE places.The service was phenomenal (especially for a Korean restaurant). Â  Other AYCE places are usually pretty stingy about refilling on rice paper and radish/moo (*cough*!..yi ssi hwa ro...*cough*), but our waiter kept refilling our dishes even without us asking him to. Â Mind you, this was all on a Friday night and the place was packed. Â However, be forewarned, parking is a BEEYATCH! Â Even with valet, there's usually a wait since there's only one row of parking. Â And don't even think about finding street parking on a busy night."
2/24/2012,5 star rating,"My favorite AYCE korean bbq place!FoodThe meat here is better quality than most competitors (including Road to Seoul and Mo Dae Po, in my opinion). Â The cuts are thin and not as fatty as most places. Â All for a good price too! Â My only complaint here is that they don't have that much banchan.As far as the actual grilling experience goes, it's interesting too because they use STONE PLATES for the grill vs. traditional steel plates. Â I initially resented this because I thought it was cooking our food way too slow, but after it heated up--AWESOME...like pizza-stone-in-an-oven-awesome. Â So PRO-TIP #1: Let the stone plate heat up first!ServiceThe service/waitstaff here is really friendly despite the place being super busy. Â PRO-TIP #2: Make a reservation if you have a large party! Â There aren't that many large tables here and I saw one unfortunate party wait for more than an hour, maybe two hours, before getting seated. Â Part of the reason why this place is SUPER BUSY is not only because the food is great, but because how relaxed the atmosphere is and how they don't really seem to pressure you to leave even if there's a ton of people waiting. Â A big plus in my mind.And the greatest part- the overhead ranges/vents actually work! What an amazing concept! Â A korean bbq place that isn't hazy with meat smoke- great success."
7/11/2012,5 star rating,"OMG, definitely worth your money and you WILL NOT regret it. I've been to a lot of kbbq AYCE places but this tops EVERY ONE OF THEM. It has a lot of different types of Â GOOD QUALITY meat to choose from that will satisfy everyone's taste buds! Don't get too stuffed with just the meat because at the end of the meal, they will cook kimchi fried rice for you on the grill and serve soybean paste soup. I recommend getting the spicy pork (the meat in the foil) and cooking it before you get the kimchi fried rice so that you can mix it in with the rice. You can tell the server and they will know.Staff is really friendly and attentive but the wait is unbelievable. It can range from 1 hr-2hrs! I recommend coming for lunch.You can make reservations. 6 people needed Mon-Thurs and 8 people needed Fri-Sun."
1/11/2015,5 star rating,"Be prepared to wait up to 90-120 min during peak dinner hours. Â You can make RSVP if your table is greater than 6. Â Great deal in $22/pp for AYCE dinner. Â Service is excellent, you're served banchan immediately as you take your seat. Â I would say what sets it apart from other AYCE Korean BBQ places is the diversity of meats and the stone grill it's cooked on which gets cleaned with radish after every round. Â Meat favorites include brisket, kalbi, and pork shoulder - all go well with makkori (Korean rice wine). Â Make sure to save room for the included kimchee fried rice at the end!"

5/19/2009,3 star rating,"i was sold on the way too late fried rice. i was intrigued by the cleaning of the pan with the radish.so there i went with two of my friends to check out yet another AYCE KBBQ. eating off that shield was interesting for the first meat (brisket) but by the time we had our third (porkbelly, then short ribs), all the stuff on the shield started melding together and by melding together i mean that it was frying in many different types of fat because it wasn't draining that well. when the korean pancake got soaked in pork belly fat, i decided to bring it to the middle to ""deep"" fry it and it worked. crispy! nice...all was good until the radish came to ""clean"" the pot. disgusting. i just saw pieces of disgusting burnt meat juice leftovers creeping towards the clean stuff we had on the side waiting to be devoured.i also wasn't so enthused that the fried rice was made on top of this shield along with a pot of soup that was laid on top of the shield, all next to our clean meat waiting to be eaten on the side. i don't know.. i just didn't like that it looked so unclean. and i'm not your typical clean freak.i would have rather had them just change the shield instead of the whole radish gimmick. it just didn't look like a thorough cleansing in the first place and i would have rather eaten the radish. in terms of experience and taste, my friends enjoyed it and we were stuffed after three meats, fried rice."

Â i was thoroughly satisfied and happy when i left. Â it was very similar to honey pig minus the price. Â they put bean sprouts and kimchi on the grill and made kimchi fried rice at the end. we ordered the marinated and unmarinated short ribs, thick pork belly, brisket and chicken. Â normally, i've found that the quality of brisket and pork belly at ayce's isn't very good but that wasn't the case here. Â i didn't have to pull of too much fat. i thought all the meats were pretty good for an ayce. Â my favorite was the unmarinated short ribs.the only downside is it's not good for groups. Â we had 6 people and one tiny grill and they wouldn't bring another portable grill until 2 more people came. i've been to manna and yi ssi hwa ro and i like this ayce the best!"
3/20/2011,4 star rating,"I went to Hae Jang Chon Korean BBQ Restaurant with 5 other people, and the six of us got the all you can eat for $16.99/person. We thought that they would put an 18% gratuity on top of our bill, but OMG THEY DID NOT!!! Even better, hahaahha!! No worries though, we tipped them quite well (even tough the 6 of us had a difficult time with space at the table). ;P We came on a rainy Sunday around 1PM, and we didn't have to wait at all. In fact, the place was fairly empty, since not many people wanted to come out in the rain. Surprisingly enough, traffic to K-Town was pretty good compared to usual.Anyways, their all you can eat menu meats consists of: bulgogi (marinated beef), black angus beef brisket, beef short ribs, thin or thick sliced Canadian pork belly, pork shoulder, beef tongue, BBQ pork, BBQ chicken, BBQ squid, beef abomasums, beef honeycomb, baby octopus, and hotdogs. We got eight thingys of meats, but I wished we could have tried everything, but I'll save that for next time when I go with people without dietary restrictions and what not, lol. We got: 1 bulgogi, 1 black angus beef brisket, 1 marinated beef short ribs, 1 thin sliced pork belly, 1 beef tongue, 2 bbq chicken, and 1 bbq squid. You can rarely ever go wrong with bulgolgi, so that was amazing. Beef tongue sounded odd to most, but it was pretty tender and tummy. I couldn't even tell that it was ""tongue."" The chicken came pretty thick, but scissors and whatnot always fixed that! The brisket was one of the quickest to cook, and it was great with the 4 dipping sauces that they had for us. I wasn't a fan of the pork belly, but it wasn't horrible, and if you are a fan of pork, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. Some of the shortribs came with a lot of fat, but it was tasty nonetheless. I've never had squid at a Korean BBQ place before, but it was rather interesting; it was chewy, and it came in three pieces: 2 thingys of the tentacles and one large flat piece.Other than the meats, you receive the little side dishes, a bowl of salad, Â and four dipping sauces. FOUR DIPPING SAUCES!!! This is the first Korean BBQ place that actually gives you FOUR different kinds. They also gave us kimchi pancake and steamed egg, and both were VERY good. Gotta love all you can eat places, haha. As other yelpers mentioned, MAKE SURE TO GET THEIR KIMCHI FRIED RICE AT THE END OF YOUR MEAL, INSTEAD OF THE STEAMED RICE WHENEVER! IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT! So yes, the server comes over to your table with a bowl that looks like seaweed slices, but it's actually seaweed slices with kimchi and rice. After the hot plate has been cleaned by the server, the server dumps the bowl onto the hot plate and mixed it all up for you. My reaction was, ""omg.. the next time I make kimchi fried rice, I'm definitely going to put a bunch of seaweed slices in it!"" After the mixing has been done, we served ourselves, and it was sooo amazing. We were all semi-full from all the sides and meats and everything else we've eaten that day, but who could say no to that delicious made-on-the-spot kimchi fried rice? That's right... no one can! Mmmm.. nomnom-a-licious!After the kimchi fried rice has been devoured, a bowl of bean curd soup appears. It resembles miso soup with the miso paste and tofu, but it was MUCH saltier than regular miso soup. Most of us just ate the tofu portion and tried a few sips of the liquid part, and just left the rest. I guess it could have been very good with plain rice, but we weren't going to pay an extra $5 each for that. :P We all had a great time at Hae Jang Chon, and we would definitely come back eventually. Not sure when, cause these friends and I don't hang out all that much (location differences), but if I had the option to come back, I definitely will. Their lil pig mascot outside on their banner was cute too. Parking in the lot cost $2, but I parked on the street for free, since it was Sunday."
7/7/2015,4 star rating,Excellent place for a late night grub. I was there around 11:30pm and there were people waiting for a table. $22 per person for all you can eat. Service is great. I will definitely go back.
6/17/2014,5 star rating,"Came here for my first Korean BBQ experience and had a great time. I'm usually not much of a meat eater, but I enjoyed trying everything. The service is great. They are very quick and bring out everything you order. They let you play with the tongs and man the grill, but also come over and help do it the right way (all the food is cooked right at your table!). It's all you can eat so go for it and try everything! Very fun, just be prepared for a long wait (I recommend Frank N Hanks cash-only dive bar a couple blocks away to grab some cheap drinks while you're waiting). I believe they do take reservations, but that they fill up early and it then becomes walk-in only anyway. Try it out! Note: although there is a parking lot, it will probably be packed unless you are going at totally off-peak hours. If going for dinner you'll probably have to park elsewhere and walk. This is a great spot for groups! Lots of fun and everyone is really into it."
5/15/2015,5 star rating,One word. Epic. It's the only KBBQ I've found that cooks on the stone grill surface. Keeps the meat very tender. Meat quality and selection is good for $22 AYCE. I'd like to see more sides however. Definitely try the bokbunja (may have spelled that wrong) raspberry wine. Pairs perfect with the meat. Bring your appetite and if you come in the evenings be ready to wait. The wait time is anywhere from 40-120 minutes when they are busy.
12/22/2017,1 star rating,I am very aggravated and annoyed at the service here at this restaurant. The waitress at the door was so rude and she purposely let 5 groups of people in front of me and my company. This is a sad sad establishment. Something needs to be done about it!
12/23/2013,4 star rating,"Mama likes this restaurant.I actually seen this restaurant ad on the newspaper many times. I think it's the LA Weekly. They have cute picture of a pig if I'm not mistaken. So I've always wanted to try this place.My friend took me here the other day for lunch and it was great. We go eat korean bbq here and there once every couple of weeks. This place is a little different. First of all, their kim chi is the bomb. Wow, i've never eaten kim chi like this before. Very tasty. Secondly, they don't use a metal grill. It's like this stone grill. For some reason, I like it wayyy better. Of course the sides and meat are very good. Try it. You can get all you can eat for about $16"
4/25/2010,5 star rating,"nothing gets me going more than some raw meat over a stone grill. Â its $16.99 for all you can eat, and comes with all the fixings: Â all types of meat, rice paper, kimchi and side dishes, lettuce, rice, soup, and kimchi pancake. Â Meat is cooked on a stone grill, and theres a nice tray that catches all the fat and grease,perfect for dipping your meats in (Just kidding!). Â The kimchi fried rice was an interesting flavor too, but its definitely worth trying.The call buttons on each table does what its supposed to, but we pressed it at least 10 times with no response. Â TI was probably too busy for the waitresses to hear, but if you're going to implement the system, make sure it works.Also, I thought valet parking was free, but when i went to tip him a dollar, he said ""its two dollars"", so park around the corner instead."
10/12/2011,5 star rating,"This review is long overdue. By far one of THE best Korean BBQ places I've ever been to. Service is always awesome, fast, friendly and helpful. All of the food is just terrific. It also helps that there's a quality check here for the people that can't cook worth jack. The servers will be more than happy to assist your table with the grill and serving, giving you time to sit on the sideline pondering about your inadequate grilling skills.Pork belly, short ribs, bulgogi, meat meat meat! I don't think they have the same type of black pork belly that can be found at Road to Seoul but brisket is the preferred cut of meat to order imo.Panchan is provided as well as kimchee pancakes, they're alright. Nothing amazing but are you really at a KBBQ place to feast on their side dishes? No, or you're doing it wrong. However noteworthy is the kimchi fried rice cooked on the grill at the end of the meal which is pretty darn good, it might actually be even better if they didn't completely clean the grill before cooking it.For bang for buck, considering the immediate area is surrounded with KBBQ places all offering the same AYCE prices, you're guaranteed to have a good time feasting here. Eat, be fat, be merry."
1/8/2010,4 star rating,"We were here for a friend's birthday. Â This place is great to come with a large group. Especially since it's AYCE for $16.99. Â Can't beat that in L.A. Â The service was great, they were very attentive. Â  All the meats are pre-sliced and marinated and ready to cook. Â  The flavors of the meat blend well together to make the perfect buffet of meat. Â Oh I loved how theeeee... marinated beef, brisket, beef short ribs, and pork belly. Â Their pork belly was seriously scrumptious. Â I am still drooling from my meal there. Â Please come hungry, because you are gurantee to go home FULL!!!"
3/11/2010,4 star rating,"I tell myself every time after going here that I will never be back because I no longer want to eat meat again. Â Inevitably, I find myself back here again, regretting the 2 pounds of meat that I just destroyed. Â I am also sickened by the fact that they make you fried rice at the end of the meal, almost like dessert. Â Disgusting, but amazing.This is one of the best AYCE places out there -- great kalbi, brisket, and pork belly. Â Service is also very spot on, and they clean your grill on a regular basis. Â I will never be back again though, because I want to live past 30. Â (OK, that was a lie. Â I will be back next week.)"
7/4/2015,5 star rating,Best Korean BBQ I've had so far. 4 meat maximum per order I suggest the brisket and the marinated short ribs. Staff is friendly also.

9/24/2014,4 star rating,"We came here because we wanted quality meat and this place has over 2000+ reviews so there must be something good about it. Personally I do feel that $21.99 for dinner is a little pricy especially since I'm not someone who likes to stuff herself. If you're a big eater, you'll get your money's worth.My group arrived at 5:30 and I arrived at 6, but they wouldn't let you get seated until all parties have arrived. I can understand since dinner can get busy and their place is pretty small. I want to say around 15 tables? But I really didn't count them.They offer 22 items for you to order for the AYCE deal. They have the usual brisket, short ribs, thin and thick pork belly, octopus, and bulgogi. They also have shrimp, which we didn't order and hot dog, which I almost laughed. Other stuff they have included honeycomb beef, steamed egg, kimchi fried rice, and kimchi pancake. They had four different types of sauces and 4-6 side dishes.Brisket is still my favorite type of meat for KBBQ. Their short ribs and bulgogi were also good. When their octopus came, it looked fresh and beautiful. But after it was cooked, it shrunk and didn't have much taste, lol. I haven't had kimchi fried rice is a long time so it was definitely refreshing for me and it was tasty.The food hits: brisket, short ribs, bulgogi, kimchi fried rice, potato salad (came with hidden chopped up apples inside!).The food misses: octopus (not much taste), steamed egg (It came flat. The pretty ones are suppose to poof up, lol), and kimchi pancake (Tasted a bit sour and spicy which I thought it a weird flavor for a pancake, but some of us liked it.)Now onto the best part: THEIR SERVICE. Everyone was very kind and attentive and always wore a smile on their face. Almost too attentive. We were there for one and a half hours and they came over about 20 times to check up on us if we need to order more meat. The rhythm was more like: we order meat with one waiter, another comes over to ask us and we'll have to let her know that we ordered already. This process happened 4-5 times, lol. They also did most of the cooking for us and cleaned the stove for us with radishes after every 1-2 types of meat. Ultimately, they were almost like the mother you never had. ;)Atmosphere: 4 starsFood: 3.5 starsService: 5 stars"
7/3/2015,5 star rating,The small octopus is the most delicious thing I have ever eaten! The quality of food here good and delicious! My Korean friends say this is better than theirs in Korea!! This is by far the best all you can eat place I've been to. I'll be back sometime soon for that small octopus.
2/10/2011,4 star rating,"Went here late night on a Wednesday after seeing a show in Hollywood. Place was almost empty, but it was getting on for 1:00 AM by the time we walked in anyway.Got the $16.99 all you can eat deal, and was excellent. Wide selection of meats, good side dishes, pretty much everything I want out of a KBBQ experience. One thing we also got with the meal, which I had never had before, was a Kim Chi pancake. Amazing! Flavor was milder then I expected, but I loved it. I would definitely come here again."
11/29/2015,4 star rating,I enjoy coming here for korean bbq. Their stone grill is unique and their side dishes are okay. Friendly service and they cook the meat for you. Parking is via valet Â so make sure to have some cash. Lines get long so come early.
2/14/2015,5 star rating,"Before you get a table, they set it up. The meat comes out really fast and their service is fantastic even though they are really busy. Food is good. Highly recommend the bulgogi. However sometimes they are too fast to flip the meat/clean and it splashes everywhere... But I can't complain. They also split checks!"

Korean BBQ: good and plenty. Service is on point. It is JAM PACKED and the host/hostess didn't seem like they knew what they were doing. They were seating people who came way after our group, first. The confusion and long wait would deter me from coming here again :P There's too many Korean BBQ places to choose from to put up with this shenanigans."
5/9/2015,5 star rating,Best place for Korean bbq. The staff is so friendly and the food is amazing! The wait time is worth it.
5/12/2009,4 star rating,"This has got to be the more unique AYCE KBBQ places in Ktown.. since the food is cooked not on a open flame but on a big piece of stone.The taste is unique to other KBBQ places the workers there are very attentive and they help you cook your food and all i had to do was eat!!one of the things i found to be good is that they come by to clean your ""stone"" every so often and they use shredded dakon to absorb the charred stuff off the grill.. makes me wonder.. what do the other KBBQ places use? they prob use some really harsh chemicals to clean theirs.. which makes this place more ""eco friendly"" sorta way. So i was very glad to see that.the Price at $16.99 is pretty much the same as other AYCE places.. i definitely will come back again in the near future."
10/5/2010,4 star rating,"We went here one eventful Friday (9/24) only because Gui Rim was closed by midnight. Â This place closes at 2AM! Â (Valet closes at 1AM and those people come in hawking keys to customers for the asking price of a couple dollars in tip. Â Hey, you might even take home someone's brand new Audi if you're lucky!)For $17, we got all you can eat Kimchee Pancakes (heck ya!), hot kimchee (that's a first for me), hot bean sprouts, pickled radish (my favorite), fishy tofu (that's the correct terminology), leafy full green salad with a citrusy (more terminology) ginger dressing, steamed egg whites, creamy apple potato salad (to even any spiciness out), flat white rice noodles, more pickled goodness, and four types of dipping sauces. Â Oh my, indeed.Meats on that hot and heavy circular stone plate starting with my most favorite to least favorite:1) Â Thin cuts of brisket2) Â Beef Short Ribs3) Â BBQ Beef (Bulgogi)4) Â Pork Belly (Sliced thin)5) Â Pork Belly (Sliced thick)I probably wouldn't order the pork belly again because they didn't seem to be marinated in anything and the thick sliced pork belly was more like a porkchop. Â We should've chosen other meats or more beef.Staff is very helpful in placing and cutting up some of the meats on your cooking stone. Â They're friendly too.I really like Korean food for their different flavors, textures, and colors and the fact that it's clean, healthy and fresh with no horrible heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach afterwards. Â Your clothes won't be penetrated with too much smoke at Hae Jang Chon, but it'll still probably smell of sweet and succulent Korean BBQ. Â Look out for the pig!"
5/31/2011,3 star rating,"A very different kind of Korean BBQ. Everything is cooked on a large stone slab/bowl in the middle of the table.AYCE. A little more expensive than the average AYCE K-bbq place in the K-town area.Meat quality is ""fairly good"", on a scale from NOOOO to AMAZING. Service is a little frantic as these places always are.It comes down to a matter of taste and preference, and while I enjoyed Hae Jang Chon, I actually prefer the typical charcoal grill setup more.3-4 stars, closer to 3."
11/1/2011,5 star rating,"Hooray for cheap valet! Only $2.Hooray for excellent service!!Absolutely loved it. They came instantly with a ring of the bell! I was AMAZED. Hooray for the extensive selection of meat!! 19 items! That got me coming here even though it costs a little more than other places. They offer marinated short ribs! Yummy! BBQ beef (bulgogi) was alright, definitely not my favorite. Brisket is yummy too. I love watching the fatty part sizzle in the pan! And lastly.... pork belly! Ok, I love love love pork belly. I always order pork belly at KBBQ restaurants. They offer Canadian fresh pork belly and you can get either thick or thin. I normally eat the thick ones so I tried that, but it was alright. The fatty part is harder than other ones I've tried, so I wasn't really satisfied... then came the thin pork belly! YUM! Hooray for thin pork belly!! It's as thin as the brisket and I think the brisket has a little more taste to it but I still love TPB more because I get bored of eating brisket. It wasn't like that for TPB. I kept wanting more and more even though my stomach was about to burst! So bad but so delicious!Definitely check out their website! They have a page on the BENEFITS OF EATING PORK! haejangchon.com/benefitsâ¦"

It's super busy, but the staff always seemed to be on top of it, and very prompt to assist. Never waited longer than a couple of minutes for refills on anything. Environment is very fast, loud and full of life, it actually adds a bit of spice and entertainment to the place. It's a one price for all type of deal and I love it, it gave us an opportunity to try the different meats. The BBQ squid was my favorite. Sides are what you would get anywhere else, they do however have this pancake that I tried for the first time, it wasn't too bad actually. I had a great time and I left with a happy stomach. I will definitely be back."

12/6/2007,5 star rating,"I was so excited to eat the all-you-can eat feast here because it consisted not only of your typical meat (galbi, belly, bulgogi) but also pancake, rice, and soup. Â For only 16.99! My inner fat girl is coming out.Little did I know that this place, considering how much manual turning-over of meat and scraping of grill work they have to do, is severely understaffed. Â We rang that bell like a sugar-high kid on Halloween night and no one ever came. Â I understand it's busy but it was pretty ridiculous. Â We weren't drunk enough to entetain ourselves, so we left before even getting to the rice portion of the meal.Other than that, it has a cute outdoor area with tv's playing and an oddly endearing rustic forest feel to it. Â  Meat was good and better than average. Â Sauces were great; my dipping hand was happy. 16.99 for all you can eat!! Need I say more? Just go when it's not so crowded and you can get the best of service because, seriously, they do eveything here.Added plus: Â this place has that a-dor-able $.25 coffee maker at the entrance that I get each time.Edit: Â I came back a year later. Â And damn it, do I miss this place now that I live in the Bay Area. Â The meat was just utterly delish, and ...with soju, it's absolute Korean culinary heaven. Â Service was also much much better, even when crowded."
2/19/2009,4 star rating,"Oh, yeah. This place has got the goods. All-You-Can-Eat K-BBQ for $16.99 that is open till 2am and includes squid? So awesome. I wish they would marinate it in a spicy sauce though, instead of the same as the galbi. Hae jang Chon is a kimchi BBQ restaurant, as you can see on their sign when you walk in. This means you get kimchi pancakes at the start of your meal (included in the $16.99), and the option to have kimchi fired rice at the end of the meat parade. This also means that their best meats are the ones that go well with the grilled kimchi: non-marinated ones like the chadol and pork belly. I think the chadol is the better of the two, it is fatty enough stay juicy on the grill while the pork belly dries out, even if you set it on the kimchi to avoid overcooking. Here is what we had in order: panchan on the side, of course; kimchi and bean sprouts on the grill; kimchi pancakes, chadol, pork belly, galbi, squid (cuttlefish), chicken; kimchi-fried rice with dwen-jang stew.I'm sorry to say that their galbi isn't so great, not as bad as Manna, but not as good as Tahoe--if you're looking for the best galbi quality versus price compromise, Tahoe's AYCE at $17.99 is your best bet. At Hae Jang Chon the galbi was just mushy, not tender-mushy, just questionable quality mushy. Last time I was there, we ended up trying all the meats 'cause our server swore that their chicken was really good and we just had to try it. What can I say, she was an ajumma, I am trained to do as they command (and it was a command, not a suggestion). She was right, it was very tender, but come on, it's chicken, and you're at a K-BBQ joint. We won't be getting it again. That is, if I can stand up to the ajumma next time.The service was exceptional though. It was westernized in that we had one assigned server who took care of us the entire night, and believe me, when you get to your fourth meat...and you know there's more to come...and that it's followed by fried rice...you will feel time expanding--a couple hours will seem to stretch into the entire night. Our ajumma server was friendly, commands and all. She stopped by frequently, gave us our own pitcher of water, and she cleaned the grill out in between the pork belly and galbi, and again before the fried rice. However, like other reviewers have said, I think the fried rice at the end would taste better if they didn't clean the grill up after your meat. She also set down a huge bowl of garlic and jalapenos when I asked for more--they used to do this for me at Tahoe, but lately they make me ask for more servings about three or four times before they give up and give me a bowl. Hae Jang Chon is the place to go if you like cooked kimchi with your K-BBQ, and is also recommended if you see a famine coming in the near future. You'll be full for a week after eating here."
6/2/2009,4 star rating,"Update: I gave this place another chance months later and now it's back to being my favorite korean bbq place again! Thank you for getting a better meat purveyor.This used to be my absolute favorite Korean BBQ place. Check out their website--they've changed the menu. The brisket and pork belly have gone down in quality and deliciousness! The pork belly even smelled a bit too much like pig. There are new items that the waitress even said are not popular with the clientele. They no longer bring out the kimchi pancakes unless you ask them for it (twice). I want their old menu back! I am hoping they read this and change the menu back to the original. Whenever I went, this place was packed and now it's pretty empty. Will the owners see the pattern?Again, I only wrote this review to get the old experience back. I've tried their new menu twice just to be certain. I'm certain that it used to be amazing and their quality has fallen. Try the changed menu for yourself and let them know if they should change it back. Let me know so I could come back to my favorite place again :("

Â Is not the best but is a package of everything they have here:Favorite Meats from this place:1) Intestine2) Pork belly (Not a pork person, but their thin slices of pork is very fresh3) Fresh beefOf course their meat is not as fresh as some of the places I have been to in Koreatown, but what do you have to complain when it is a ""All You Can Eat"" for $16.99? Too bad they only give one steam egg for every two people, but there is one time when i went there with my friend and I myself alone drank 4 bottles of beer (Large), and 1 bottle soju. Â The buzzy me kept bugging the waiter for steam egg and I ended up eating 7 steam eggs. Â Hahhahaha also didn't get a chance to eat any meat tho. Â Tip: Â Get a large beer cup, pour the cup 2/3 full with hite, and add a shot of fresh soju. Â Gulp it up in one breath, finish it off with a medium done beef from the grill with a piece of kimchi.

8/3/2010,4 star rating,"Good thing I was 45 minutes late to a 9 pm dinner on a Friday night! Â That's how long the wait was by the time I hauled ass to LA and found parking. Â I spent a good 15 minutes looking because I was being a cheap ass and didn't want to pay for valet. Â If I had known it was $2, I wouldn't have bothered circling the area four times and then ended up walking 2 blocks to the restaurant. Â I can't complain about the walk back though, since that helped digest the food a bit.This is one of the best All You Can Eat Korean BBQ that I've been to at a bargain price of $17.99 for thin / thick pork belly, pork shoulder, short rib, brisket, chicken and squid. Â The boys had already started on the first round of short rib and brisket when I arrived. Â By the time we were done, it was a good 6-7 rounds of meat consumed. Â The chicken and squid were marinated well and were quite tasty. Â I think I could've eaten four squids on my own.Service was excellent during the first hour and 15 mins. Â They refilled our banchan, they cleaned the grill with shredded daikon which I was pretty darn impressed and amused by, and got us another round of drinks. Â By the last two rounds, service seriously waned as if we were non-existent...they even stopped coming by to cut our meats. Â We even had to use the service bell, which according to B. was their way of saying, ""It's time to leave."" Â Being slightly drunk off the soju, I buzzed the service button one too many times and started cleaning the grill with our banchan daikon slices. Â Since the boys over-consumed on the meat, we didn't have any room for the kimchi fried rice. Â L., who stopped in later, helped clean up after them since they looked like they were all going to keel over with the last round. Â R. sat there telling L. how they were going to catch her and charge her for consuming the food while I was pushing the meat in her direction. Â Good food should not be wasted - it was great times!"
9/19/2010,5 star rating,"It's my favorite AYCE KBBQ in LA. Hands down! It's really clean or that's the feeling I get! I've never had to wait that long because I usually come on weekdays at 5-6pm ish. There are 19 different meats for only $16.99!!!! They give you a good amount/variety of side dishes!I love how they give bean sprouts and kimchi to grill. It just works so well with the meat. The quality of the meat is pretty good for the price! Once the grill gets all gross from cooking the meat, they bring radish to clean the grill for you. When I first saw this, I was so amazed! HahaAfter you're done with the meat, they make fried rice for you on the grill and give you bean paste soup!!! It's some legit stuff!!! It completes the meal :)When it gets busy, the service isn't as prompt and I have to repeat my order sometimes for lets say water, because they keep forgetting. Parking is valet...but it's only like $2.I want some hae jang chon right now!!!!"
9/23/2010,5 star rating,"I've been to Tahoe, Manna, Chosun all those AYCE and there is no competition. I always feel like its an experience eating here, always so fun.Price: $16.99 for 19 different types of meat ?! thats the same price at tahoe for 2 types of meat.Taste: The best of all the AYCE BBQs. SO MUCH FOOD ! you start with about 5 complimentary side dishes. There are 3 dipping sauces for your meat & 2 different kinds of wraps (sticky rice paper and tangy radish one)On the stone grill they place bean sprouts and kimchi and kimchi pancakes and all the meaty goodness you order.When the grill gets dirty after a while they bring grated radish and scrub it off. They also bring you a bean paste soup to share and place it in the middle of the stone grill so yummy. On top of that they bring you a fried rice mixture and make it crispy over the grill.Suggestion ! Order the bulgogi as the last meat and after it finishes cooking ask for the fried rice and mix it all together. (: DELISH.Atmosphere: Pretty clean and laid back. Theres an outside section for smokers. Theres korean music playing in the background not too overpowering though.Service: Â Little buttons on the table to get waiters attention. Waiters usually dont come by unless you push the button but its fun. Waiters dont speak too much english so you might want to take a korean speaking friend along with you on the first visit but who cares, we're not monkeys right ?Theres is seriously so much food you have to unbutton your pants to get up.TIP ! the bench with the lights seating towards the back of the room has no back support and starts feeling uncomfortable after a while.I used to go almost every week until i started realizing that the bottom half of my body was being hidden behind my stomach. Now i go every once in a while as a treat to myself (:"
6/6/2011,5 star rating,"BEST AYCE KBBQ IN KTOWN!Can not beat Â this place. Â I will be dragging many people here in the future.Reasons why it's #11) 19 choices of meat2) Does the rice & radish paper (common but suprisingly there are still places that don't have this)3) Good tasting side dishes that they refill often4) STONE GRILL (that they clean often with an entertaining method)5) $16.99!!!!!!!!*) Kimichi Fried Rice? (This is an extra point because I sadly stuffed myself beyond being able to request this, but from the other reviews it sounds awesome, next time i shall practice ""moderation"")Break it down real quick for ya'll. Â This place is the shiznit. Â Unbelievable selection of meats, the menu's on the wall and I spaced just trying to grasp the idea of having all that available at my beckoning (it was a wonderous feeling). Â I didn't even get to try all of it because i stuffed my face before I go to get a plate of everything. Â Still incredibly satisfied with what I made it through. AND THE STONE GRILL! Â This will repeatedly appear in caps because it was amazing how good the meat would taste comeing off the STONE GRILL! Â It cooked the meat in it's juices so every bite was packed with flavor. Â Unlike other KBBQ places, none of the grease was wasted here! Maybe unsettling for some, quite appealing to me. Â The STONE GRILL also creates alot less smoke than the grills traditionally found at KBBQs, so you don't smell like you just came out of a burning building. Â Plus, before you can even worry that your grill maybe getting a little dirty, someone pops up with a daikon and vinegar mix they teppanyaki across the grill, cleaning up all the burnt and grease that's been collecting on it. Â It's actually a very natural and entertaining way to clean the grill. Â Also provides a good pause in the eating to take down another shot of Soju. Â STONE GRILL!Also, try the intestine! I know gross to some, but if you can stomach it(it's a pun!), they do it good here: they snip the sides of the ""tube"" so it grills flat. Â Makes the cooking intestine procedure alot faster than waiting for the whole tube to cook and it also turns it from fat filled tube to a piece of crispy-fatty-crispy, kinda like bacon. Â I was impressed. Â Will have to remember to save room for the kimchi fried rice at the end next time.(5/5) because its got a great selection at AYCE, great service, unique experience, and only $17. Â On on that note, STONE GRILL!"
10/17/2011,5 star rating,"YUMMY YUMMY YUMMMMYYYYYYI LOVE MEAT especially when it's all you can eat.For $17.99 (around that price) you get a wide variety of choices.My favorite is the small intestine that they have.... dip that in some hot sauce and IT'S SO DELICIOUS!Also, after you are done eating all the meat you can possibly want, they mix some rice and other things to make you some korean styled rice thingy. Very delicious!Oh and cool thing is that instead of changing their grill pans, they use radish and water to scrub down their stone grill. Cool Cool!"
12/6/2011,4 star rating,"A solid 4 stars, bordering on 4.5 stars!The $16.99 AYCE Korean BBQ spread is terrific. Meat choices include Bulgogi, beef brisket, chicken, BBQ pork, pork belly, and really fantastic whole squid. A lot of other Korean BBQ places charge a couple extra bucks for squid, but it's included in the price at Hae Jang Chon. Â The banchan side dishes just keep a' coming, and include kimchee, spinach, fish cake, and sizzling egg flower soup. Â The service is very attentive, and they'll even scrape clean your grill top (using shredded daikon and water) in the middle of your meal if it becomes too caked with charred food scraps. Â Don't forget to ask for your kimchee fried rice (also included in the price)."
1/6/2012,4 star rating,"AYCE BBQ for 16.99$. Not the largest selection of meats, but I like it here because I like the simple dipping sauces, the stone grill, and the freshness of the meats. They don't come out frozen. The wait sometimes is unbearable, but it is compensated by being open later than many other places."
3/8/2012,4 star rating,"How do I know where to go? I look for the restaurant with a giant pig. Â How do I order? I bring a Korean friend, or point.AYCE Korean BBQ places that I've been to a few times but never realized.Great quality of the meat. Â Open late which means probably a good choice for late dinners (10pm or so). Â A LOT of colorful banchan with amazing variety and refills. Â I really enjoy how they give you steamed eggs, the flour wraps, and the thinly sliced radish wraps. Â They throw in the kimchi pancake, fried rice, and definitely give the squid a try. Â All of which I now associate with hallmarks of a legitimate Korean BBQ. Â Parking is street or lot. Â Lot is valet but it's cheap $2 or so? Â After a certain time they just come in the restaurant hand you your keys in exchange for the fee.Service is excellent."
3/13/2012,4 star rating,"Hands down, one of THE best AYCE Kbbq places I have ever been to. Just minus one star for the super ridiculously long wait time. We roll in on a Friday night at 10pm and we didn't get seated until 11:25pm. Ridiculous, no? But my friends and I just drove down from SF so we were starving and really just wanted a lot of food, so we bared the wait.When we were seated, we were showered with a wide array of banchan and ordered our meats (4 orders at a time). I like how this kbbq joint uses stone grills rather than the steel racks you find everywhere else. The staff here is also pretty helpful - whenever they're walking by to check up on you and your meat looks like it needs tending to, they'll stop by to help cut up your meat for you. Yay for great service! They also play along with our humorous jokes too, which is appreciated. I also applaud them for cleaning our grill several times without us having to wave them down and ask - the grills are cleaned right in front of us with pickled daikon slices. My favorite cut of meat for the night was their Kalbi. The marinade was pretty awesome and the meat was super tender without having large chunks of fat. It's pretty disgusting when you just get a mouthful of beef fat - gross! But none of that at Hae Jang Chon!Of course when you're done eating, you smell like bbq. No surprise there. Price was reasonable at $17.99/pp for ayce. There is valet parking in the lot for $2 or you can park on the street around the corner."
3/18/2012,4 star rating,"There is a reason why people would wait two hours for korean bbq at this place.It is amazing! They have a large selection of meat, they serve you fast, and my favorite- they always always ALWAYS clean the grill with their shaved radish. I also enjoy their kimchi pancakes!!!This is a place to go to, everyone that I bring here loves it and always wants to come back for more.Happy Eatings!! =]"
5/21/2012,4 star rating,"Came here on a Friday night like an idiot and waited almost 2 hours before we were finally seated. It was well worth it because the food was delish and I ate over $18 worth of BBQ.Before you even get seated they have the side dishes and salad all set up and ready to go. The staff works fast and attentively to avoid burning your meat. To top it off, they serve FISH CAKES!!!I recommend getting Brisket and Marinated Kalbi. Definitely a win-wIn."
8/20/2017,4 star rating,Everything is really great with this place . Have been here over 10 times easily . My reason for the 4 stars is that EVERYTIME I come I feel rushed !!!!! I would love to just hang out and let my meat cook before I keep getting asked of what meat I would like next . At first I thought wow good service but then realized they want u out quick to accommodate there line which is understandable but it does get pretty annoying and makes you feel less valued as a loyal consumer in such a competitive genre of food.

4/7/2011,5 star rating,"I live at The Mercury where you have at least 5 AYCE KBBQ places withing walking distance (this included). Â Out of all of them, I would have to say this place is my favorite. Â For $16.99, you get 22 items ranging from your standard chadolbaegi to intestines, tongue and squid. Â The quality is decent, the decor is unassuming, and they clean your stone grill with mu (white Korean radish). Â The meat comes with the standard side dishes you would find at othe AYCE. Â Kimchi and spicy bean sprouts are plopped on the grill next to the meat like an uninvited friend, topped with Korean pancake slices. Â Every time I've gone, the pancake would be eaten, but the kimchi and spicy bean sprouts would burn on the grill. Come with a group to take advantage of all the artery clogging goodness that is on the menu. Â My favorites are the marinated kalbi and the chadolbaegi. Â This wouldn't be the first place to take your first date unless you don't mind them watching you stuff your face while gristle streams down your chin.If you want great service, come on a weekday. Â The line and wait can be long during the weekends."
11/10/2011,5 star rating,"Great scott, I think i've finally found my favorite ayce korean bbq place. Yes! yes i did find it!After many gluttonous nights of greasy foreheads, sodium induced high blood pressures, unbuckled unbuttoned pants and smoke stained shirts my journey has culminated at Hae Jang Chon. Aight it's not life changing but I can solidly and informatively say this has been my favorite.Price is cheap for all the different meats and quality you get. I've had better brisket, but they stole my heart with the suuuuuper tender short rib meat. Other ups: The pork belly thin sliced and huge slices of beef tongue. Daymn. Hungry again.I also get kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice? Money. Bang. Sold. Favorite Place."
4/4/2012,4 star rating,"This is now one of my favorite places to go now for Korean BBQ for multiple reasons. First off they have a stone grill instead of the normal grill. Every so often they will come back and clean it with some radish and water and the grill is good to go again. There's no need to wait for them to replace the grill at like other Korean BBQ's.The meat and sides are delicious, but one of my favorite items they offer is the kimchi fried rice the offer near the end. You will need to tell them that you want it and they will bring the items to make it right on the stone grill. The service here is amazing someone is always there to check on you. I rarely have to push the service button because someone would always be at our table helping us out."
3/14/2013,4 star rating,4 1/2 stars! Everything was so tasty and comparable to Seoul. Â They make kim chi fried rice with your leftovers at the end and plenty of pan chan to go around. Service was quick. It was worth the hour wait (not like we waited cus we head next door for drinks first). Â This place was still pack at 9 PM. Â I didn't try many korean places in LA but I don't think I need to after coming to Â Hae Jang Chon. This will be my go to spot from now on and worth the trek from SF.
8/10/2011,4 star rating,"First off, I appreciate that Hae Jang Chon isn't one of those dumbed down and noisy Korean barbecue joints whose primary mission is to cater to college kids looking to get their fill of substandard meat and soju at 12 o'clock at night. That said...The cornerstone of any Korean barbecue has got to be the meat, and here, it's pretty good. To be sure, they're not offering a fancy cut of well marbled wagyu or a something from Niman Ranch, but everything is fresh and well marinated. Their selection of 16 or 17 different items is fairly large considering that the offerings at a number of other Korean barbecue places I've been to have topped out at about a dozen or so. Squid is one item I don't usually see at other places, but here it is. The accompanying selection of banchan side dishes is pretty standard. The green salad that comes with the meal is decent Â but could be chopped a bit finer to make it easier to eat. One thing that I really like about Hae Jang Chon is the helpful attitude of most of the wait staff, who are patient enough to explain the protocols of Korean barbecuing to the uninitiated. And when they see you being a bit overzealous and ready to take your undercooked meat from the grill to your plate, they'll come over and politely cut up and cook the meat a bit longer for you.The wait for a table during the weekend (and even some weekdays) can be trying--an hour or more. But once you get a table, you'll be enjoying some pretty good Korean barbecue."
8/20/2012,4 star rating,"Okay, why was this my first time here? I have frequented way too many other AYCE Korean BBQ places in Ktown and nearby areas to have only discovered Hae Jang Chon NOW. Let me just tell you why I absolutely loved this place:1. Service is actually GOOD. How many of you can testify to having horrible service at AYCE korean bbq restaurants? I've had my fair share of being ignored, being mad-dogged, being looked down on, etc. They gave us everything we asked for quickly and kindly - all during prime dinner time when the place was overflowing.2. For $17.99 you get 19 CHOICES of above average quality meat (but beware of the weird items like hotdogs, which is the American store-bought kind according to my friend). My faves? the brisket (the thin meat) is a given of course and it's actually pretty good here. But the star of the night was the pork belly (the thin cut so it cooks faster and feels less fatty) -- it was like a melt-in-your-mouth fatty goodness mmmmmm3. They give you free kimchi fried rice at the end. Why at the end? I have no clue and when I asked, I got a confusing answer. Who cares, we'll eat it whenever it comes.4. Their salad is good! Okay I know it's just salad but don't you think that a good salad is so necessary to wrap with your meat in the rice paper? Oh and btw, they gave us so much rice paper whenever we asked ;DSome petty reasons why I docked a star: - we waited over an hour. It was Friday night though so whatever- our servers were often a little TOO involved in the cooking process of our meat. I actually like to cook my own meat, thank you very much. Our server straight up yanked the tongs out of my hand without even asking and proceeded to cook it himself...um excuse me? It's rare for them to care that much though, which is also a plus- their kimchi was wayyyyyy too fermented and sour (though this may not always be the case)- the biggest issue? this place is WAY TOO SMALL. they need to get on that expansion because they're obviously way too popular for such a tiny place. it'll speed things up too!"
8/11/2014,5 star rating,"A guy I use to date brought me here for our first date, I'm thinking oh no this guy is going to find out way too soon what a fatty I am. Anyways ... the quality of the meat is wasn't cheap like other place I've been to. I don't know how I'm living in ktown and I still have revisited this place definitely soon though! It's probably one of my top five Korean BBQ!!"
4/25/2015,5 star rating,Amazing! I love the thin meats. The sauces are amazing! Unlimited salad. The dressing is so tasty. The staff is so helpful! I'm taking my whole family! Thank you!
9/6/2012,5 star rating,"This place is pretty awesome - very decently priced, all-you-can-eat, and delicious food. Of course, it isn't a Chosun Galbee - but for a chill night out - if you find yourself randomly craving Korean BBQ like I always do - go here! It is open till 2:00AM, always packed with a mix of ages and cultures. Do not get frustrated IF you have to wait because if the place is packed, that means it's worth waiting for, right? :) RIGHT."
10/17/2012,4 star rating,"I went this past weekend to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Yup, that's right. Just the two of us... at all-you-can-eat korean bbq. It was delicious and a great deal if you're able to eat a small horse in one sitting. Unfortunately, horses don't fit in our stomachs.I'm not sure if I got my money's worth with just the two of us eating since we weren't able to take advantage and try everything available on the menu. Note: They charge you extra for any leftover meat so don't over-order or you'll be slapped with an extra $15 on your bill. We ordered four kinds of meat and barely finished it all, on top of the extra things they give you as part of the deal. We even had to refuse the kimchi fried rice at the end which I absolutely regret. I love fried rice. I'm asian so it must be ingrained in me (again, pun intended)!All in all, I'd come again but armed with meat-eating friends. I think they allow reservations for parties of 7 or more. If you're anything less than that, be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes for a table. The wait isn't too bad. I recommend hopping over to the bar next door for drinks beforehand."
9/2/2009,5 star rating,"for about $21 with tax tip included, you can't go wrong with this place.A ridiculous meat selection just helps. Not to mention they bring special ban chans including steamed eggs and jjigae and finish your meal off with kimchi fried rice.super clean place compared to manna or etccc.... seating is decent, although i'm not a fan of round patio tables that are small enough to fit..the waiters could be a bit moody depending on your party size and demands but then again who's to blame? they're human as well.overall, a great AYCE experience. Highly recommend this place"
12/31/2012,4 star rating,"What a great deal for only $17.99 all you can eat BBQ dinner!I came here with a party of 4 total on a Sunday night. Wait was about 40 minutes (you sign your name onto a sheet). The small tables are apparently meant for 2-3 people so those tables were seated first.The banchan that came already served when we sat down already wasn't too varied or special. There really wasn't too much of it, perhaps the focus is more on the BBQ. We also got a salad that was pretty decent.Service is quick and friendly, although they didn't always understand our requests. There's a bell on the table for quick service.We got the brisket, short rib, bulgogi, squid, chicken, pork belly, squid, and beef tongue. They were all quite good! There's the traditional oil/salt/pepper sauce for the brisket, otherwise the short rib is already flavored. The tongue was quite tender. The chicken wasn't too flavorful though. I thought the bulgogi could have have been marinated better. By the time the squid came, I was way too full and entering food coma status. Squid wasn't really marinated either.The servers come by every once in a while with a vinegar/radish plate and clean/scrape the grill so there isn't leftover burned bits on the grill. This was a niceWe also got kimchi pancakes and steamed eggs. Both were ok.Quite good and would come again!"

I got super annoyed when we had pork on the grill and one of them came turned it when it was still raw and then put it in our salad... Really?!? It's freaken pork not beef One of the old ladies also complained that if we don't order fast it would take along time for the stone grill to heat up again *sighs* Still like the guy workers here better one of them actually refilled our cups when we almost ran out, filled the salad and asked for our order and when we didn't know what it was he told us :)Apparently beef honeycomb is kinda like intestine lolCome in before 6 or else your going to have to wait forever"

4/20/2013,2 star rating,"Ok...the level of service and quality of food has gradually declined at this place since we started coming here several years ago. Not only that, now the wait time to get seated has become unbelievable...45 min to an hour minimum. You are crammed in the dining room like sardines and the noise level is ridiculous. Bad part is we started seeing more and more patrons getting up and leaving because the wait-staff is so overwhelmed that they can't tend to every table within a decent amount of time. And it doesn't help that the servers are totally apathetic and rude if a patron complains or waves at them more than three times. Seriously? This is what you're here to do.It's sad to see one of our favorite places die a slow death. But oh well...in a market where there's literally a Korean BBQ spot on every other block, we still have plenty of options to choose from."

All You Can Eat Korean BBQ.3. Super attentive staff4. $16.99 per person!They give you sooo much food you leave feeling like you swallowed a whole cow. Aside from your choice of 7+ cuts of meat, you get a nice banchan selection, kimchi pancakes with bean sprouts, soup and kimchi fried rice at the end. We almost never get to finish the fried rice because we're so stuffed. The only downside is that parking can be a pain if you come during peak hours. Other than that, we will be coming to this place over & over again!"

7/15/2012,5 star rating,"I have been to a couple AYCE korean BBQ places before, and this place definitely stands out as having good meat and a lot of selection. In particular, they offer leaner meats on the AYCE menu, which is really nice. All of the meats are tasty, and they are very consistent about replenishing anything you have that is running low, including sauces, rice paper, salad, etc. A lot of places I have been to require you to ask, and even then they give you a dirty look. Not so here!Once we were seated, the food was spot on and the service was great. They don't charge for rice, either! The only complaint I have is that we came in two cars, and the only korean guy in our group (who made the reservation) was in the second car to arrive. When we came in and told them we had a reservation, they told us it would be 30 minutes- an hour wait. When our friend arrived and spoke Korean to them, they told us they would give us the next table. I found that a little sketchy, so I would recommend making a reservation and coming in early so you don't have to deal with a wait, or b.s. like that. That was essentially the only rudeness we dealt with, though, they were very hospitable after that, including accommodating (and not charging for) the two year old in our party (as a heads up for those with kids).My biggest complaint about this place is the bathroom. They're single room men and women's, and I don't know what people do in there, but I had to wait 15 minutes to use the restroom there, and once I came in, it was pretty gross. Probably not entirely the restaurant's fault, but I would be aware of this when deciding how much to drink, haha."
8/5/2017,5 star rating,It's the best korbeq in town for that kind of price range. Their beef tongque is bomb.
7/18/2014,1 star rating,Ordered one ala carte of bulgogi for a nice lunch and first off the service was annoying because they wouldn't leave us alone as there was only three groups of people eating including us so I think they were over staffed. Then we get the food and it's not great but not terrible. Bulgogi was dry and barely had flavor to it and the sides were mediocre. They also kept forgetting to give us parts of our meal and the spoon to eat the steamed egg. While we are trying eat the waiters would constantly come over and ask us if we wanted to order more and by constant I mean they probably had 10 people working and each of them came over and asked the same questions to us individually. So annoying! Then we get the check and they have overcharged us :( we explain to them this and the waiter named Tiger (who was really cute haha) tells us about 15 excuses as to why it was charged that way which were all incorrect. We FINALLY get the bill correct and at this point we are so turned off to this place we leave cash for the bill and leave. Really disappointing!

After 5 mins of being at the restaurant, the power all of a sudden goes out. Luckily, my friends had already started eating so our gas was still burning & we were able to cook. We were brought a candlestick for light. Â We were only able to order certain things. Â The staff was very apologetic and offered us free beer. :) candle lit dinner kbbq style... Low ventilation, dim lighting... Quite the experience. Felt like I was camping."
1/12/2012,3 star rating,At $17 bucks a person I would expect more. Other Korean BBQs nearby are better. Also they only offer soda or beer to drink. No tea or refills. They do offer about 3 more choices then other places around. And the decorations are nice. I will not be coming back.

7/29/2017,2 star rating,Mediocre beef meat. Â  Thick slice bacon is pretty good. Â The hot stone method of cooking Korean BBQ beef makes no sense to me. Â  Basically allowing the watery beef to be cooked in the juice. Â Almost like boiling beef in liquid. Â  Not possible to sear well at all. Â  Â 4-5 banchan side dishes only. Â  Ok taste wise. Â Too many other better choices nearby.
4/23/2007,4 star rating,"I actually like this place a lot. The only Ktown barbecue pork place unofficially endorsed by Helio. Their two best offerings are the fatty pork belly and the tasty pork shoulder. Both are not marinated, like the typical beef dishes, therefore you end up smelling smoky after the meal instead of garlicky. Many is a time I've had to walk home naked from Ktown after having had to burn my clothes post meal, but not at this place.They get an extra star for having the cutest pig logo."

2/21/2011,4 star rating,"Since I was in LA, AYCE Korean BBQ was a must. $16.99 compared to the $25+ in the Bay Area.. better eat all I can in SoCal!They have a wide variety of meat - kalbi, brisket, chicken, pork, even hot dogs and squid. You can order up to 4 different types of meat at once. Side dishes are so-so and they didn't offer fried rice like some reviews said. Because there is only one drainage hole on the side, the plate tend to get oily quick and end up soaking to the meat. Meat was good but I felt really greasy after.Sadly, no thrifty's green tea ice-cream like Chamsutgol."
9/19/2011,3 star rating,"I understand your boss probably steals your tips cause you work in an Asian restaurant, but damnit you work in a service industry. Â Smile mofos! Â Out of four communal servers,(3pm), none was smiling. Â It's the type of place that you wonder if you pissem off your food will have spit, urine, or worse in it. Â The bad: The host was immature.Service was solemn.Sides were below avg.Flea in one of the dipping sauces.The good:That said, MEAT for AYCE was good.Beef tongue is no Tsuruhashi(fountain valley) or Totoraku(best beef tongue)Short rib is nice flavor, deboned.Kimchi fried rice is average.(do not detour for kimchi fried rice to this place). Overall a good value."
12/11/2012,4 star rating,"Great food. Cramped space. Could use a couple more servers to service the customers quicker and make the place more efficient. But DAMN, when the food gets there is it ever DA MONEY!Usual KBBQ accoutrements, ie banchan, and plenty of it. I guess if there is a distinguishing aspect to this place, it would be the solid banchan, end fried rice, and ridiculous wait. No, since KBBQ has become all the trend with Koreans and non-Koreans alike recently, there's a decent wait at most solid KBBQ joints now. Love how when I was growing up in LA as a kid, all these assholes would mock Koreans for taking pics of everything, karaoke, KBBQ, cheating on their wives, etc. Now these are all part of the everyday American culture. I can't possibly out-Asian any of my non-Asian friends in any of the above. So I guess I'm saying that Koreans are mad trendsetters. Also, Gen. Petraeus, I don't blame you. I mean, I saw your mistress and I saw your wife. And I understand. Yeah.But I digress...As most people who know me will attest to, I'm not big on AYCE anything. Shit, even if ever the strip club industry adopted this business model, I think you'd get lap danced the F out. I mean, you would right?Hang on, gotta write a note to self about a potential future business...Anyway, where was I?Yeah, so I think it'd be awesome, and quite profitable for my libido, to have an all-you-can-handle strip club.Then after you're exhausted out, you can come to Hae Jang Chon Korean BBQ to replenish your depleted protein supply. Cuz, I'm sure some of you will have definitely lost quite a bit at the pre-BBQ strip club. Not going to name any names. Tyler.Anyway, where was I? (So much on my mind at this moment.)"
7/29/2015,2 star rating,"I was pretty disappointed. I was recommended here and let me say, It wasn't horrible. But really not worth it. The meat basically had no taste. Service was okay. 4 Adults was $102. $22 per person i believe, somewhere around that range. I won't be returning and will try to be finding a better Korean Bbq place."

Buuulllllllll we cleared their own lot like throwing a sausage down a hallway. The car has like at least 2 fingers of gap between the tire and the fender. Such BS."
5/9/2009,5 star rating,"I been to many Korean BBQ places, and many of them the waiters are rude and do not want to attend to you. Â This place has awesome service, friendly smiles, and even help you cook the meat. Â The kimchi is a lil on the sour side if ate cold, it taste better cooked. Â For 16.99 with drinks its about 20 a person, and well worth it. Â My only complain is the parking. Â The parking lot does not have enough parking. Â The people working in valet told us it was free valet parking, but when we were ready to pick up cars they charged us, beware!!!Besides parking, I am going to become a regular here!"
5/16/2010,4 star rating,"I had the $16.99 all-you-can-eat dinner here after a creepy photo event with a group of other Yelpers last week. I have to admit I'm a total KBBQ rookie (if you don't count the Kogi truck and Freshia). Heck, this was my 2nd ever visit to any Korean restaurant. As far as I could tell though, just about everything I ate here was delicious. We had heaps of brisket, spicy pork belly, cattle tongue, and some other thinly-sliced meats all cooked at our table. They were complimented by some small relish dishes, rice, steamed egg, potato salad, and green iced tea.Parking in front of the place is valet-only, so I went the cheap-o route and tucked my car away into one of the side streets. Our party of 10 finally got seating after about a 1/2 hour wait, but I personally think it was worth it.I'm definitely gonna be on the lookout for something like this closer to home."
7/17/2010,3 star rating,"A.Y.C.E. kbbq for $16.99.first, valet parking is a must. it's just too chaotic there to take time to find your own spot...and it's only $2, so don't be a cheapass. despite my friends and i having made reservations, we still ended up waiting a good 15 minutes or so. but once we were seated, all the banchan and stuff were already setup.the beef brisket and short ribs were pretty good. however, what stood out for me was the pork shoulder. after cooking it, it almost looks a bit rubbery...but it ends up chewy and tastes amazing. the beef tongue was also pretty good, although the cuts were too small, in my opinion. the kimchee pancake they put on the grill was also great.i was really disappointed in the pork belly as well. despite the place offering thin or thickly sliced options, both ended up still being really thin and cheap with their cuts...and they still have some bone in them. i personally like kbbq places that offer thick cuts of pork belly with marinade with no bones...and so this place disappointed me.service was decent, though we had to use the call button a few times when it got a little busier. the waitress was attentive and scraped the grill clean with what looked like white radish or something every now and then.decent place for A.Y.C.E. kbbq, but only if you like beef brisket, pork shoulder, and short ribs...otherwise go to another place that has better cuts of meat."
5/31/2017,4 star rating,"A friend took me here on a Tuesday evening and our wait time was only like 5 min. We ate and drank Hite until we were uncomfortable. Their brisket is flame, beef tongue was interesting, pork belly (get thick cut!) was bomb. We were given perfect portions when we asked for meat. They had all my fave banchan and I almost cried. Our waitress was sweet and attentive and I love her for giving me hella potato salad after I asked for my 4th refill. She recommended pork shoulder and galbi, but shoulder was a lil too fatty for me and their galbi was mediocre. They also make you kimchi fried rice at the end but their kimchi was eh so the fried rice was just ok."

3/15/2011,5 star rating,"BEST AYCE KBBQ for 16.99. No more going to manna or road to seoul or tahoe for me! 1. Hot stone plate - nice touch! it stays hot longer and cooks the meat more evenly. plus it has this hole on one side where the oil pours out so you're not cooking your meat in too much fat.2. Banchan - they have good banchan here. My favorite is the steamed egg. You get all the regular banchans and they put kimchi on the hot stone plate as well.3. Meats - LOTS of choices for meats and very good quality. The pork belly was delicious as well as the short ribs. 4. Kimchi fried rice for dessert?! - Yup! They make kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal as if you're not full as a fattened calf yet. So leave room for it. :) They also give you soup. i think it's like a soybean paste soup. it was salty so i liked it. my friends didn't care much for it. 5. Service. The service here is actually good. They don't bring out the meat as quickly and it almost seems like they want to take their time so you're not ordering as much but i didn't mind. We still ordered a lot anyway. They're not as rude as other kbbq places. :p Oh, and they clean your hot plate after every order of meat. They clean it using shredded radishes which i think is pretty cool!This is, by far, the best ayce kbbq i've ever been to where I paid less than $20. I will be coming here more often. :)"
5/8/2011,2 star rating,"Im quite frustrated with this place. I made reservations for 20 several days prior only to arrive on the day of the event and be told that they do not have any reservations in my name nor for such a party. Â My friend asked to be charged to add an egg and they refused. Â When we asked for tea, we had to ask about 4 times before we got it. Â When we wanted to sit in a different arrangement amongst each other they weren't having, but yes in the end we won that one. Â I just don't know what to say about this place. Â I'm pretty upset. The food on the other hand is a bit fun. Â There is lots of variety and its nice to experience stone grill cooking. Â I'm not sure to say I'll come back, there probably won't be next time. Â I think my experience has left me a very negative feeling about the place. Â Maybe I'm angry right now and maybe I'll change my review tomorrow morning because the food was decent but right now it is a generous 1.5 stars rounding up.After dinner, two of my guests complained that they were not happy with my choice of location from past experiences. Â I so regret booking here. Â I should have asked for the guys name who took my reservation. Â Someone needs to be held accountable."

I don't know what the hell was going on last night but there was a dude sitting in the corner that looked like Mike Shinoda. 5 stars for the sexy older men that seem to be in this restaurant.Also the thinly sliced pork belly UGHHHH SO GOOD"
4/20/2011,5 star rating,"ATTENTION: HOT WAITER ALERT.His name is Tony Choo. Check him out! Ask for him! Tell him I said hi. (JUST KIDDING DON'T DO THAT THAT'S EMBARRASSING) He is nuhmoo nuhmoo muhsheesuh. I don't know how old he is, though...Came here recently for my cousin's 21st birthday with a reservation. You'll need one if you're coming for dinner. Â Our (hot) waiter suggested playing the happy birthday song ad nauseum so I abided and it was hilarious. Also, free Choco Pie with a candle if it's your birthday!I actually like how they don't give you an assload of meat super quickly and the service was pretty bomb. The meat was tender and I think my new favorite kind of pork belly is thinly sliced like brisket instead of the ultra-thick bacon slices. The price is your typical AYCE for Ktown, so.. nothing special about that really.I also enjoyed the kimchi fried rice at the end! Then again, I went on a Tuesday and Tuesday isn't usually a poppin' night. BUT YEAH this place is fun!"
2/23/2013,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is one of my top choices for AYCE kbbq despite the long wait times. The staff is always super quick and efficient, and they serve customers with a smile on their face. plus, i love the kimchi fried rice they do at the end (although it's not as yum as dong il jang on 8th). i also like that this place has thin pork belly. when cooked, it kinda looks like chadol but tastes like samgyubsal! it's ingenious! valet is $2. you can try to find street parking, but... good luck with that.Haus cafe is across the street if you wana wash down animal fat with a latte."

The place is packed, smoky and noisy, just like a Korean bbq should be. The meat cuts were excellent. The staff was attentive, friendly and got us what we wanted right away. The only ding is the baby octopus, I didn't care for. We call this the piggy place because at one time they had a drawing of a piglet in front."
12/19/2013,1 star rating,I would give this business zero stars if could. Just because of service. My girlfriend and I planned a trip to Cali. When planning we saw that Hae Jang Chon had great reviews so decided to make a reservation. We were planning to meet old friends and have a great time over Korean BBQ. This reservation was made about a week before we came. Today my girl friend decided to call to reconfirm the reservation made for dinner the next day... However they tell her that they had never made a reservation for her and continually asks her to tell them when she had made it and check her call history and call back. Seriously do not know how they would be able to track all that but ... We gave them the benefit of the doubt. Called back and provided them the exact date and time we had made the reservation. My girlfriend originally requested a table for ten ... But only 7 of her friends confirmed. So she asks if they are willing to make a reservation for 7. They respond ... Has to be 8 or more to make a reservation. She explains that we haven't been to LA in five years and this was like a reunion / get together with old friends we had left behind dinner... But still they would not accept. Hating to see her upset and freaking out that her event was going to be ruined... I stepped in to make the call.I call and immediately ask for the manager. The obnoxiously rude host barks he's not here. Then I ask when will he be in? In his rudeness he manages to mutter the words seven. So I thank him and tell him I'll call back at seven. Night goes on... And I decide to call them around 8. The host picks up the phone and consistently yells hello hello hello and then hangs up. I call again and this time speaking louder ... And finally get to talk to him. I ask about him recollecting a reservation that was made and when I was about to explain to him that I wanted to speak to a manager to further explain... He hangs up! Thanks Hae Jang Chon for a great time. Would they have treated Barack Obama the same way if he had called to make a reservation? I think so. Love the five star treatment ... Wish you all the best of luck.
1/9/2013,4 star rating,"A Cut Above.Hae Jang Chon is my friend. Â Hae Jang Chon picks me up when I'm low and celebrates with me during the highs. Â Hae Jang Chon makes my tum tum happy.I won't pretend to be any expert on Korean bbq, but i've had my fair share in the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles. Â Out of all the establishments I have tried, this is the only one that slaps kimchi bokkeumbap on your grill when you're done devouring all the meat. Â Fried rice for dessert? Â Yes, please.The menu is pretty standard here: galbi, short ribs, brisket, pork belly, etc and many come marinated or unmarinated. Â $17.95 for dinner which to me, feels like a steal. Â The service is absolutely impeccable here. Â I'm not Korean and sometimes Korean restaurants can be a little intimidating to dine in for this reason. Â Not HJC. They are super friendly to everyone while serving you with a smile every time. Â A very pleasant atmosphere to come and enjoy delicious food with friends.But a heads up if you come on a Friday or Saturday night as this place gets mighty packed with a queue time of at least an hour or more. Â Thankfully, there are some bars in the vicinity to get sloshed at while you wait for your name to be called. Â This is my new favorite BBQ joint in Los Angeles."
7/22/2017,4 star rating,"Pretty damn good all-you-can-eat for the price and good quality meat. They've got a cool twist with using a stone grill that gives more flavor (marinated meats are already nicely fragrant) and I recommend saving space for kimchi rice at the end. The place is quite clean and organized, you sit down at a set table of banchan (side dishes) and the waiters are very intuitive in assisting you."
6/11/2009,4 star rating,"$16-17 for a decent all you can eat Korean BBQI'm a beef lover, I must have been killed by a cow in my last life, LOLUnlike other all you can eat Korean BBQ, their meat are not deadly frozen. Highly recommend to try their beef tongue, so tender. Doesn't matter how full you are, the Kimchi Fried Rice is a must. I usually do it with my little trick and we all love it, yum yum.Price of beer and soju are reasonable. Parking lot is really small, but they have valet, tho it takes forever to get your car."
6/8/2010,4 star rating,"Thanks to my friend for introducing me to this gem of K-town BBQ. Â All you can eat for $17 plus tax Â and tip and drinks (if you want them). Â And it's really all you can eat - they're not kidding.You get your sides. Â Which aren't that great, but who comes to K BBQ for the sides anyway? Â Some light greens (type of kim chi), marinated tofu strips, a weird potato salad w/ mayo, and sliced pickled radish and wonton-like wrapper meant to wrap your meat in. If you want lettuce wraps it'll cost you extra. Â Actually, the pickled radish slice is quite nice. Â They also bring a huge green salad with a soy dressing which is really good and you can nosh on that all night in between meat and get your roughage.Their sauces are amazing - this amazing red chili paste which is more flavorful than hot and some soy that's been marinating slices of garlic and slices of pickled radish. Â The garlic and radish lend it a slightly tart and spicy flavor. very pleasing.The grill is a hot stone and there is very little smoke in this place compared to other K BBQ joints, which means you can actually wear something cute and plan to go out later rather than racing home for a shower smelling like a closet-smoker.They dump the regular cabbage kim chi on the grill, along w/ bean sprouts and a kim chi pancake which is awesome. Â And then comes your meat. Â SO good and they have a lot of selection. Â You can order a few at a time but make sure to finish otherwise you will get charged. Â The bulgogi is good, the marinated short ribs are good, the thin pork belly is good, the chicken is good. that's all we tried. Â Go for them all. Â After you are stuffed to gills your dessert is kim chi fried rice which they dump on the hot grill and mix up in front of you. be sure to let it sit for awhile to get a crispy bottom. Â Also they bring a soup.And when your bill comes it is so cheap you gotta laugh and rejoice and get ready to head out for more drinks. Â This place rocks."
7/7/2010,4 star rating,"Los Angeles K-Town is the place for Korean BBQ, but you have to be picky. Not all are good, but this one well, was. Walking in, you'll inhale the mesquiteness of Korean BBQ. Serious stuff here - they have a ringer on the table for you to call on the server. For $16.99, you get to select from a list of meats (19 to be exact), including your bugolgi and so on. Includes the side dishes of radish, rice, flat rice paper, egg for your claypot, kimchi and so on. Myself and friends enjoyed our time here. Service was quite slow and drink refills wasn't that great. But otherwise, good food for a late night feast. Would come back again."
3/14/2011,1 star rating,"I'm so sad. I was known for wreaking havoc on all you can eat Korean BBQ and owners were afraid of me. I loved all you can eat Korean BBQ since its inception. I also loved Hae Jang Chon since I first discovered it. All of this changed a few days ago when I got sick from this place. It has been 5 days and I'm still messed up and can't even eat normal food. Now the thought of all you can eat Korean bbq makes me sick. I'm scared. It's all so foreign to me. I thought my relationship with AYCE Korean BBQ and Hae Jang Chon would last. Alas, I must let go of both b/c this place messed me up."
2/1/2011,5 star rating,I thought I would never betray Road to Seoul. I was wrong. I found a new love and it's Hae Jang Chon. Everything here is seriously SO GOOD!!! You can't go wrong with this place. I am salivating as I am writing this. Everything is good there. Their squid is exceptional. The greatest part is the kimchi fried rice afterwards. How can something so simple be so stinking good?!?! I just don't understand!!!

I must say this place has elevated my cholesterol! LoL! Totally became a regular here."

9/10/2017,5 star rating,"I went here during a summer vacation. I looked up on Yelp to see what was so good about this place. I have to say that it was worth the way, because the people here are nice, and the food are amazingly delicious."
6/6/2014,1 star rating,"So the restaurant is hands down really good, what they should get rid of is the valet company. I personally work for a valet company and this company is honestly the worst I have seen yet. Customer service is rude and then turned us and a few cars away because apparently they were too low yet they valet cars that are 10 times more expensive and even visually lower, so right off the bat it was a BS excuse. These valets are bringing the company down."
4/2/2018,5 star rating,"This our first and only experience eating in Ktown for the Korean BBQ experience. We have our own Korean BBQ here in Sactown but pales compared to these places in Ktown. The price here for lunch is 24.00 and 1/2 price for kids AYCE. Our 9 year old was full price, so don't bring your kids unless you starve them for a couple days. I like that the menu is straight forward and isn't tiered, where other restaurants charge different prices depending on the meat package you choose. They had about everything from fresh octopus, beef tongue, boneless short ribs to name a few. The young waiters and waitresses were o.k, but we were helped by an older waitress and she was on it. I've never had this type of service where she would dump your meats onto a hot stone grill and leave for other tables and then occasionally she would buzz back around to cut your meat or coach you on cooking certain items. I was cooking fresh octopus and while she was walking by, she states, ""octopus done"" or when I was cooking shrimp and I started to plate she says, ""not done, not done"". She also would come without asking and would clean the grill. Because the stone grill was big and heavy, she would dump a bowl shredded daikon onto the stone and the moisture that exuded from the daikon would be enough to remove the burnt sauces. There was a four item limit when ordering as was explained to us by the young waitress that started us off with drinks, but when this lady showed up, there was no limit. Every time she walked by she kept asking what else did we want to order even before the food finished cooking. At the end of your meal the waitress will offer to make you Kim Chee fried rice from the meat drippings on the stone, but because I freight trained all that meat, I had to finish it all since my wife and kids quit early, so we declined the offer. There were signs stating if you waste food, you will be charged. We were seated next to a couple of young girls where they left a whole plate of uneaten cooked bulgogi and they were not charged. They do give you large servings of whatever meat you order and since they only ordered one round, maybe that was the reasoning. My favorite was the boneless galbi and bone in was not on the menu. The menu will also state if the cuts are prime or choice angus. Everything here from the banchans to the dipping sauces were very good and my favorite was the oil with salt. They charge 5.00 for lettuce and it was a little steep for the wife since we pay a buck extra here in our neck of the woods. Overall, this place rocks and we would not hesitate to come back."
9/9/2015,2 star rating,"I guess two stars because its cheap, but is it really cheap enough? Banchan limited and tiny selection, food keeps on coming, but do you really want it to?"
3/31/2015,3 star rating,The Korean BBQ was okay and also I liked the meat but the grill was too slow for me. There are other good Korean BBQ that are around I would say but if you want something really late then I would say go here.
11/21/2008,5 star rating,"My personal favorite Korean BBQ place. All the beef is fresh, red, and tasty. I like their Kalbi the most. Sweet tender meat ... and I just get 5-6 orders of this stuff for myself. And I am set. My average meal here takes about 3 hours. For 16.99 I eat about a good few pounds of beef.I'm not big on the side dishes. I go and attack the most expensive cuts of beef, which I think the Kalbi is. Pork belly is nice too but way too unhealthy for my taste, but still good if you let it sit and get crispy.The rice wrappers have been a little bit dry, they need to do a better job of wrapping those things up before they store them in the fridge.Kimchi fried rice is the way to finish the meal. I wish they used the 'flavored' grease and dump it back into the fried rice, thats what I would do. I bet it would taste so good from all the Kalbi fat. Just like what I do with my george foreman grill, pour the 'flavor' back in."
7/3/2010,4 star rating,"With the short amount of time I had, this was the only Korean BBQ I could find open late. Â It was 1am and there were still a decent amount of people dining. We were quickly seated and quickly decided on the all u can eat option on the menu. We chose short ribs, pork stomach. BBQ beef. Appetizers came right away and the meats shortly after. The stone pan they use doesn't leave the meat chared and preserves the natural flavors in the meat. The light marinate they use also keeps the natural flavors in tact. They give you an assortment of sauces to make your own dipping sauce but I enjoyed the nice clean flavors. It was a nice refreshing change to the heavy flavors of by area Korean BBQ. After a couple of rounds of meat we leave full and satisfied. I would definately give this place another try if you have a late night craving for Korean BBQ."

11/13/2011,5 star rating,"OMG this place was worth the wait!!! Â We arrived here around 6:40 after the JIN movie premier. Â We parked on the street and just walked over. Â The lot at the restaurant is Valet and was super busy, save your money and just park down the street on 5th. Â Anyways we waited about an hr and everything smelled so good. Â Before we arrived at the table everything was set up for us. Â Each person had 2 trays of sauces with various dishes strewn about the table. Â oh and the salad dressing is so tasty!The waiter asked us what meats we wanted to start with, we ordered brisket and marinated short rib. Â It's helpful to have the HUGE menu board above the kitchen so when you don't know what meat to order next you just glance in that direction. Â Our favorite meat by far was the marinated short rib. it was so tender and flavorful. Â Cooking on the stone grill was really cool and it kept the meat very moist and tender. Â After our first order of meat, they brought out the steamed egg. A little bit later they brought out the kim chee pancake. Â The waiters and waitresses are all super nice and attentive. Â Even with so many people they still take care of every table. Â The neat part is between every meat order they bring out onions I think to ""clean"" your stone grill. Â pretty cool!Once you are done with all your meats they make your kim chee fried rice. Â SOOOO YUM! they make it front of you and it has kim chee, strips of seaweed and an egg. if you leave it on the grill long enough the rice on the bottom gets crispy. my favorite!this is far for us but I think we'll be coming out here a lot more now! yummmand we're doing laundry now because our jackets smell like korean bbq :D"

2/26/2013,2 star rating,Next time I'll pay a little more and go to oo-kook or even go to a non-AYCE.i should've known better. I walked in and saw no Korean customers. Brisket had too much fat. All the other meats I ate were tough. Didn't enjoy this meal at all.
2/25/2013,5 star rating,"For the amount of money you pay here, you get a lot! It's $17.99 for AYCE Korean BBQ and that includes a very large list of meat selections including hot dogs (haha--I've never ordered that). Their sides are incredible too. The Kimchi is fresh, the fishcakes actually taste good, you get radish and rice paper, and all the regular side dishes most other places give you. However, an added bonus is that they also bring out Kimchi pancakes, boiled egg and at the end of your meal they make you fried rice with delicious sea weed if you request it. The atmosphere is very loud, at least at night. The music is bumping like it's a club but if that doesn't bother you then Â this is great place to try AYCE KBBQ."
2/24/2013,2 star rating,"I'm not sure why this place has such great reviews. I've been to dozens of other AYCE KBBQ places in LA/OC and this place doesn't even compare to even the average KBBQ joint in OC.In short:- Poor service- Poor quality and taste of meats- Lack of parking- Long waits- Too expensive for such poor quality- Music was way to loud for any conversationOkay, so first impressions:Parking: As with all of LA, parking situation is horrible, especially if you're the type that doesn't trust valets. I hear that the valet service is $2.Walking in: It's a fairly small restaurant that is noticeably dim, but perhaps that's how they want to set the ambiance.We ended up in the corner booth hidden behind their fridge - poor service, poor lighting. The waitress we ended up with was terrible. She stopped over every now and then, cooked meats for us, and left without seeing to our refills. The other waiters that stopped by seemed excellent though. We ordered the the brisket, pork belly, bulgogi and marinated short rib first. The brisket was literally all fat, which was disappointing considering the table next to us had great lean-looking brisket. We didn't even get the pork belly either! The bulgogi was cut thinner than I'm used to but was delicious and had a hint of ginger. My favorite meat was the marinated short rib; probably the best marinated short rib I've had at an AYCE. Also surprisingly good was the kimchi pancake - it reminded me of deep-fried onion rings with the subtle kimchi aftertaste.Last note - Upon reading other reviews, it seems that the restaurant was much better in terms of quality/service, but has gone downhill since then. ***Please keep this in mind when researching other AYCE KBBQ options!!!!*** Not sure if this place has a lot of regulars, but seemed like 80% of the other parties here were new to the restaurant and were therefore just exploring. I'm 100% sure that seasoned AYCE KBBQ fanatics would definitely not give this place anything more than 3 stars.Overall, food was meh, service was terrible - I won't be coming back!"
2/24/2013,5 star rating,"Ah, Korean BBQ. Â This place is a great option for ""All you can eat"" (AYCE). The grill is a dome shape, and they throw a bunch of kimchi and sprouts on the grill before you even get the meat. Â They hook you up with a kimichi pancake beforehand (grilling it up, to get it crispy). Â The banchan is delicious. Â The meat is really good. Â It's open super late (I think 2am.) Â Excellent!"
2/23/2013,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is one of my top choices for AYCE kbbq despite the long wait times. The staff is always super quick and efficient, and they serve customers with a smile on their face. plus, i love the kimchi fried rice they do at the end (although it's not as yum as dong il jang on 8th). i also like that this place has thin pork belly. when cooked, it kinda looks like chadol but tastes like samgyubsal! it's ingenious! valet is $2. you can try to find street parking, but... good luck with that.Haus cafe is across the street if you wana wash down animal fat with a latte."
2/23/2013,4 star rating,"This is me and my friends favorite go to Korean BBQ eat all you can eat place. Yes, I agreed with some comments that the wait most of the time takes forever but it's so worth it. For the price you pay $18 for all you can eat meat, it's so worth it. I rarely eat beef but whenever I come to this place I indulge myself with beef brisket and beef tongue. Oh so yummy! Their side dish spicy fish cake is my ultimate favorite plus it's unlimited so that's a bonus. Â I also love their chicken and squid, marinated well. The place is newly renovated its nice and clean plus the servers are super nice and friendly. I went to Road to Seoul in recommendation of my co workers and the place was just okay and their servers were too busy to cater to me and my friends. Here in hae jang chon, the servers are super friendly and they are fast. No matter how busy the place is. I give this 4.5 because I hate waiting to get in. The longest we waited was 2 hours and we almost give up. But hey it was worth the wait."
2/22/2013,3 star rating,"I came to this place several times throughout the years and I've seen it change from great place with good quality meat to popular venue with declining food quality. Â The service has been consistently good and the ambiance is fun and enjoyable. Â To be honest, the food is tasty and for what you pay, it's a great value. Â However, the reason for giving it 3 starts is because I've seen how great the place was before compared to now. Â Additionally, when compared against other rising kbbq places, this restaurant seems to be just average"
2/19/2013,5 star rating,"I got recommended this restaurant by my sister and we took the risk of waiting an hour for two tables of 4. I'm glad that I waited and got to experience this Korean BBQ restaurant. The environment seems very traditional Korean and home-like. The service here is amazing. All the waiters here are so friendly and mother-like. They like to take care of all their customers by helping cook the meat if necessary, and cleaning the grills frequently. We got asked, ""Would you like more meat?"" nearly 20 times within the hour we were there. A great thing about this restaurant is that they use the stone grills instead of the metal ones. One of the benefits here is that they give you Kim Chi pancakes before the meal and Kim Chi Fried Rice after you are done. The pancakes were crispy and packed with flavor. The Kim Chi fried rice was really good at the end, but I don't know why they can't serve it with the meats. The only bad thing about my first visit here was that the brisket we got was 80% fat and it filled me up quickly. Our friends at another table got the brisket and their's was about 90% meat so I don't know what happened."
2/19/2013,4 star rating,"All you can Eat Korean BBQ for 17.99. Must get here super hungry because you will for sure leave full and satisfied. The BF and I were looking for a good AYCE Korean BBQ and came across this place. It had 4 stars and over 1300 reviews so I was like damn they must be good. When we got here, there was a line. I called and asked how long the wait was and the hostess said about 1 and half hour. Well we decided to wait, normally we never wait but we wanted to check out what all the hype was about. But to my surprise, we were seated within 40 minutes...it wasn't so bad.When the hostess seated us to our table, all the side dishes were already setup for us. Service was good, the manager comes around with a smile and cuts our meat for us. Servers would check up on us consistently and make sure we are grilling the meat right.The meat and seafood were good...we ordered the brisket, pork belly, beef bulgogi, baby squid, octopus, and beef short ribs. They were all so yummy!!!Overall, this place was good but not sure if we will wait longer than 1 hour if we were ever to come back here."
2/17/2013,1 star rating,"There are at least half empty tales there, but they don't want get us seated. They claim they don't have enough chairs. It's a really bad marketing strategy. Letting people see a lot of people waiting outside doesn't get more business for you! Customers will leave once they realize that!"
8/29/2017,2 star rating,I came here with my friends to eat and the meat was good. But what I felt uncomfortable about is this lady kay. She kept screaming at the employees and it hurt our ears. Also one of my friends saw her put side dishes down and had her finger in there. We asked if we can get new sides and she ignored us..:( guess she didn't hear us??

10/8/2015,5 star rating,"Absolutely LOVED this place!! Unlike most Korean bbqs where a person in your party gets stuck cooking while everyone else eats, the servers come around and cook/check on your meat, allowing you to eat comfortably and not burn your food! So awesome! Great service. Delicious food. 5 stars."
3/20/2015,4 star rating,Really good. Long wait. Â Not mind blowing for long wait. Â But really good.
11/6/2011,5 star rating,"We love this Korean All-you-can-eat BBQ on a stone pan restaurant! Â For the price of $17 per person, the quality and selection of meat is unparalleled which makes us travel all the way from Redondo Brach every time we want Korean BBQ!The energy of the store is great, too!We were pleasantly surprised when we received a phone call to confirm our arrival 30 minutes before our reserved time, so that they put our name on their waiting list manually to make sure we get our table soon after our arrival.We recommend this place quite highly!"
2/4/2013,4 star rating,"We went on a Saturday at 4:30pm and called for a reservation for 8 people. They gave us two tables next to each other so we had two grills - which was really nice.:Parking:Street parking is free down the side streets - or the meters are free after 4pm right on 6th street. Or you can pay for the lot.:Service:The service was more hands on then other kbbq places I've been. The servers would bring the meat, put it on the grill right away - then return and cut the meat up without asking if that's what we wanted (specifically hot dogs and squid). They even put meat back on the grill that we had finished cooking and pulled off - apparently they didn't want us eating meat cooked medium with a little pink - perhaps afraid of us getting sick?The servers were also very anxious to get us to leave - probably because at 6pm the wait was huge (people hanging out all over the parking lot) - but we wanted to try all 19 meats -which we did. A lot of people complained about the service - but overall ours was pretty good. But - we did come early and eat from 4:30-6:30pm.Like several other people mentioned - they charged the wrong amount to my credit card. We split the bill on four credit cards - and they charged mine 56 instead of 26 like all four other cards. They corrected it.:Food:The bulgogi and the short rib were the best. Hot dogs were fun to try - but they were just hot dogs - no marinade. And the kimchi pancake was great.The AYCE was $17.99 per person. They have Hite beer for 4.50 for a big bottle that you can split.:Table Setup:The round traditional stone grills are really nice - the food does not stick like it does to the traditional slat grills at most places. The round stone sits on top of a flame in the middle of the table (no risk of burning yourself). And the servers come by with radish and oil to clean the stone once in awhile - which is really cool and smells good.Our table also had a buzzer to ring the kitchen when we wanted something.:Overall:I would come here again - but I would only come for an early dinner. I would not wait in the long line they have later in the evenings - it was not that good."
10/7/2015,5 star rating,"Best Korean BBQ place I've been to. Came in on a Tuesday around 7 and was seated immediately, they weren't busy but by the time we left there was a line. Coming early or making reservations is ideal. The quality of meat was excellent. Service was excellent. Beer was very good. I have no complaints. I would definitely return and definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious Korean BBQ."
11/24/2010,4 star rating,what do u expect from all-u-can-eat place? Quality or quantity?To me this place is very good place when u want to eat a big meal.meat quality is good( comparing with other all-u-can-eat places) enough.I love their sang gal bi and beef tongue. and jijimih(?).service is great
7/6/2015,5 star rating,"I usually don't write many yelp reviews but I really wanted to give a shout out to our server Steve who honestly gave me and my friend the best service we've ever received at a kbbq place! Seriously this guy was good. He was always on point getting everything we asked for, was constantly checking up on us, and refilling our waters without asking!Onto the food, everything is pretty standard in terms of your typical kbbq place. I really liked the spinach and fish cake banchan side. The kimchi had a strange flavor so I didn't really care for that. The best meats were probably the marinated short ribs and the beef tongue. Their dwenjang-jjigae was also the BEST I've ever had a kbbq place. Everywhere else always makes it super salty but they make it perfectly here. I really wish I could've had a bowl of it just to myself haha. Overall I had a really great experience here but mostly thanks to the amazing service we received. Thanks Steve and I hope to be served by you again! :)"
8/26/2017,5 star rating,The most honest people I've ever met in the restaurant business. I went with my cousin and his wife today who were visiting from out of town. I had driven by and always saw long lines and wanted to know if it was as good as it seemed. I can tell you this is by far the best Korean bbq all you can eat in Los Angeles. The kalbi and Bulgogi were very good. Great side dishes as well. You can't do better in all of Los Angeles. As far as the honesty goes.. my cousin and I always fight over the bill. So in my rush to best him to pay for the meal I overpaid. It was $127 and I thought I left Â $150. After a couple hours I started thinking the bill was wrong. For 3 of us it should have been under $100. I call and the manager speaks to the waiter and they remember us and immediately say they charged us for 4 and made a mistake. The manager tell me to come by and they'll reimburse me for the extra charge. I get there and not only do they reimburse me but tell me I actually left $170. The bill was $95 and I asked the take an extra $20 for a tip. So I was given back $55. That is what I call honesty. I'll definitely be back for the food and it's nice to know they are good people as well.
3/18/2013,4 star rating,"I came here on a Sunday night around 6:30 with a 7 person party. We called in advance to make a reservation, but they said they didn't take reservations for parties under 8 people. So we just had to arrive and wait. We arrived and the place was packed with a line out the door, but even so, we only waited around 20 mins for a table.The staff was very friendly, and service was fast. The quality of the meats were great, although on this particular day, the marinated meat we kept getting more of was inconsistent. The first plate of kalbi beef wasn't as strong in flavor as I've experienced from years of Korean BBQ-ing, the 2nd round was pretty much the same, but the 3rd round of kalbi was pure heaven in my mouth. The Bulgogi was consistently great. The BBQ Pork was delicious, and I got a nice surprise from the slow creep up of its spiciness. Personally, I like Korean BBQ places that have an actual grill, because I like my bbq to be crispy for flavor and texture (I've found that charring the kalbi a bit makes it much sweeter and much more flavorful). This place featured an angled stone circle, which yes, cooks the meat evenly, but also had a lot of my meat sitting in juice, not letting it crisp up. The hole at the bottom of the ""pan"" also often got clogged from the grease, and eventually the grease found its way through the clog and got on the bottom of the stone circle..because the heavy circle was angled, it started to slide whenever we weren't using the tongs to hold in place.Overall, this was a great dining experience and I would probably come back. It's just a personal preference that I like BBQing on an actual grill than a stone circle, but I would recommend to give Hae Jang Chon a try for all Korean BBQ lovers!"
6/6/2014,1 star rating,"First of all, the valet experience here was horrific. They didnt take our car because it was too low. We were able to clear on every bump with ease. They refused our request to self-park. We drove around for almost an hour. Besides that, the food here is extremely delicious. Â Best korean bbq I have ever had."
7/1/2015,5 star rating,"My favorite Korean BBQ restaurant!! Meat is perfect. I love marinated short rib, small octopus & spicy pork. Make sure to get a kimchi pancake. Steve is the best waiter! Come expecting a wait, but it's well worth it. It almost hurts me to recommend this place, because I don't want to have to wait longer."
9/15/2014,5 star rating,"Awesome great service. But the asking for tips even though you had just left a $20 tip on the credit card sign off paper, is just a bit like "" what the fuck else you want? My wallet?"""
12/18/2014,5 star rating,"Great service and food was good as well. Â You get a lot more sides than you normally do at other places. Â The staff is also friendly and attentive.*Note: Only valet parking during dinner time, but it's only $2!"
1/29/2015,4 star rating,Not bad at all. Â Great service for sure !!!! Â All you can eat korean BBQ $22 per person and lots to choose from. Â I'd go again with my kids in tow lol
4/18/2014,3 star rating,"We waited in line for almost 90 minutes which is why I'm reducing a star and another for the quality of the meats. This could be a personal problem but I feel like the quality of meats and selection can be found elsewhere for almost the same price without a wait. I however do live next to Cerrtios which has an overwhelming amount of Korean BBQ places so that could be why I am being so picky. Beef tongue, Kimchi pancake and the Bulgogi were my favorite meats. Try as many as possible and don't be afraid to be adventurous. The wait staff will cook the food for you if you need help which is a plus."
3/10/2009,4 star rating,"this has become my new fav korean bbq spot. Â went in on a friday night and did not have to wait for a table. Â btw you can make reservations even if you're only a party of 2 (unlike some other places in K-town). Â we ususally are lucky enough to get street parking, because sometimes the valet lot just seems a little too hectic. my favorite thing about this place is the kimchi fried rice and the steamed egg; if they could only serve that to us at the beginning of our meal, maybe i'd give them 5 stars. Â  $16.99 for ayce korean bbq, what's not to like. Â ps they do have an indoor/outdoor seating area. Â also if you haven't tried the ($0.25) coffee from the dispenser they have, you definitely should cuz it was a really good pick me up after our meal."
8/1/2010,3 star rating,"So I read the reviews and listened to the hype and broke down and went here and broke my diet for a day. Â AYCE Kbbq...lots of protein..low carbs can't be that bad. Â So we went for lunch, it was pretty crowded for a Sunday and quite a mixed crowd. Â As someone mentioned earlier, the banchan was just okay. Â We ordered the brisket, short rib marinated, and chicken. Â The brisket was good. Â The kalbi was just edible..it had a weird freezer burn taste or something on it. Â The chicken was just alright. Â We then ordered the thin pork belly and the spicy pork. Â The pork belly was tasty..sweet in fact. Â The spicy pork was really spicy...too spicy for my taste and the heavy marinade makes it hard to figure out if it was cooked.All in all, the experience was good but not phenomenal. Â Price and portions were exceptional and a good place to get your meat fix for the month. Â I don't think I'm a big fan of cooking on the stone plate. Â I'm more a fan of the the soot bul jeep style. Â I like the round tables and the ventilation was good. Â I'd recommend for the hungy man appetites out there."
4/4/2012,5 star rating,"Definitely our favorite Korean BBQ restaurant! Here's why:1) Best salad ever. I know it's ironic that you would go to an all-you-can-eat buffet and talk about the salad instead of the meat, but that's how good it is. I normally don't like salad, but the dressing is so light and tasty, I always eat several bowls here.2) Stone grill. Unlike a metal pan that burns and sticks to meat, the stone grill used here heats the meat very evenly and keeps it tender and flavorful. You can eat at your own pace without fear of all the food charring.3) Great service. The staff is quick to bring more food, more water, or even turn your meat for you if they notice that you forgot or don't know how. They also come by periodically to clean your grill with shredded turnips, and even though the lines are long, they don't rush to kick you out.4) Of course the meat and the sides are delicious. The galbi is conveniently boneless, and the bulgogi is good, but the best one may be the Black Angus brisket - simply delicious!"
12/15/2012,4 star rating,"Been to a lot of korean bbq (ala carte and ayce) restaurants and none of them have really been 5 star places. Â I've been to this one a handful of times and it's a consistent 4 stars because of the meat and value. Â Normally, I'd just agree with the Yelp crowd and move on, but felt I needed to write a review JUST b/c of last night's service.Yerim (our server lady) was AWESOME! Â She had a friendly smile and occasionally chatted, but also did a great job watching over at least 3 tables. Â She cut up all the meat into bite-sized pieces (easier to eat, faster to cook, everybody wins), and never let the grill sit without any action. Â Basically all you had to do was grab a piece, open your mouth, and enjoy like a glutton. Â Some might want to do it on their own, but I gotta give props to somebody that just wants to help, especially in a crowded kbbq.Meat (b/c you come here for the meat anyway):Thick pork belly (samgyupsal) is pretty good.Chicken and squid are good with a hint of marinade.Marinated short ribs (kalbi) is decent (good cut, not LA-style where they slice it so you need to eat around the bone and fat, but not very marinated/seasoned).Brisket (chadol) is ok, but maybe a little on the fatty side.Other food:Pancake (pajeon) is pretty good, but a little greasy and small.Kimchi fried rice (kimchi bokumbop) is a nice touch at the end and they'll actually toss in whatever meat you've got leftover too.Side dishes (banchan) meh, but at least you get the steamed egg, which I don't eat anyway...Not 5 stars mostly b/c the grill is more like a hot stone pot, which means that meat sits in its own juices and doesn't get nice, tasty, cancerous grill marks."
4/29/2014,4 star rating,"Nothing brings me back to the great memories and nostalgia of my beloved K-town like soju and K BBQ . Â Hae Jang Chon is a great place to reminisce and relive those times with a cold bottle of Chamisul and gogi. Â Solid meat selection, attentive service, and do not forget to save room for the kimchi fried rice at the end. Â On another note, lot of hipster there the night I went. Â How K-town has changed. Â Cool."
3/11/2015,4 star rating,"This place is almost perfect. The only downside is that it's so popular and they don't take reservations, seat parties without everyone there, or handle the crowd very well. Â Depending on how big your group is (mine was 5 people) you could be waiting for an hour and they don't offer too much information without you forcing your way into the door over and over again to ask for updates on how long they think it will be. All that being said, once you're seated, get ready for one of the best meals you could ever have for under $30. Unlimited plates of delicious Korean BBQ, comfortable seating, and attentive wait staff makes this place a must go in Los Angeles, just make sure your entire party shows up early. If you show up after 6pm your wait could be very long."
10/15/2012,4 star rating,"What a wonderful place. Â The meats are really good as is the side dishes. Â Loved the kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal as well as the kimchi pancake. Â The potato salad has apple in it, which actually works."
11/15/2014,5 star rating,There is always a wait but the food is really good. Â I love coming here! Â We like the marinated short ribs and the marinated beef. Â The shrimp was also yummy. Â They have lots of yummy side condiments too. Â They have raised prices since the last time I was here but it was still worth it for me. Â Yum can't wait to go back.
1/24/2015,4 star rating,Yup def one of the best out there.. I thought i found a great ayce in Orange County... Nope this spot has great quality meat.. Great happy service... Nice location and stone pot cooking instead of the metal grills... Â Parking is valet which makes it easy.. I recommend the squid.. And the Angus brisket..... And yes this one isnt like most places all fatty bacon like... Â Its actually Meat!! Will def visit again!

1/24/2010,5 star rating,"This is my ABSOLUTE favorite all you can eat kbbq. Everytime my friends want kbbq, I always recommend this place. For the price and quality of meat, I think this place is a really good deal in Koreatown. Tahoe, Road to Seoul, and Manna can't compare to this place. For 16.99, this is an amazing deal. They have 19 different kinds of meat to choose from. The meat is very good quality. I especially love the pork shoulder, thin bacon (the thick one is a bit too much after a while), and the short ribs. They use stone grills instead of the usual metal grills. The stone grill is a bit tilted so all the fat and grease from the meat slides towards a hole and into a tray that is right under the hole. This way, its a lot healthier since a lot of the grease and fat has trickled into the tray. Every so often, when the grill is dirty and the fat and grease is stuck to the grill, the waiter comes with a bowl of shredded daikon to clean your grill in front of you. 2 minutes later, the grill is clean and ready for you to cook more meat!They have kimchi and bean sprout which they put on the side of the stone grill to keep it warm. They also give you kimchi green bean pancake which is put on the side of the grill to keep warm. You also get steamed egg, 4 different side dishes, salad, rice wrappers and daikon wrappers for the meat. At the very end of the meal, when you can't eat anymore meat, they make kimchi fried rice on your stone grill. This is my FAVORITE part of the meal. I'm always really full by this time but I still end up eating a lot of the fried rice because it is sooo good. They also give you a pot of the miso stew with veggies, which sits on the stone grill to keep warm as well. This place is located inside a small plaza. They have free valet, so you only need to tip the guy. TIP: This place gets really crowded for dinner. If you have a big group and don't want to wait forever, you can always call ahead to make a reservation!"
3/30/2009,4 star rating,"4 1/2 stars rounding down...It's kinda difficult for me to remember the name of this place because it's just korean words, but one look at that happy pig in the sign and Ding! instant smile on my face.We got invited to a friend's bday dinner and I actually came here wearing a sweaterdress! (smell sinks in) Â :( ugh... We went back every weekend for the next month! This place is different from most other kbbq's IMO because they grill kimchee and the flat rock grill is angled to drip out excess oil! Genius!! Â The meats are really fresh and the banchan delicious. I esp like the steamed egg side dish, it needs to be sitting next to me at all times. This spot actually has waitors/waitresses that COOK for you! Though if you have an overzealous, overeager, can't-really-cook-at-home gf eager to prove herself, yes, you can do it yourself! This is actually a bit important because the waitors will actually let you know when the meat is thoroughly cooked but before it dries up, basically when you can attack.Lastly, what a great deal. At $17 a head, you can get yo meat on...Don't be afraid to valet... just tip them a few bucks and you're good to go."
5/17/2010,4 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised with this place - service was excellent - the waitresses are very motherly and keep the food coming. Â The banchan is a little ""meh"", but they make up for it with the (a) kimchi jun (pankcake), (b) steamed egg, (c) dwaen jang jjigae, and (d) KIMCHI FRIED RICE. Â The meat quality is not bad too. So far, this is the only AYCE place I know that does the spicy fried rice at the end of your meal."
4/25/2017,3 star rating,"I guess my fam was very lucky and had great timing because we didn't have to wait in any line at all on a Tuesday around 2:30pm... got sat very fast and the table was prepped with dipping sauces and dishes with garnishes and toppings. Cold icy water in stainless steel cups. Staff was almost friendly and quick but they did forget to bring a few things we ordered and slow on the water refills, plus touched raw chicken with clean tongs then stuffed the tainted-chicken blood-stained-tongs back into the container with all the clean utensils we were using to cut the meats and cook with. Kinda pissed me off, isn't that a WORLD WIDE understanding ???...that raw chicken can have crazy bacteria and can get you seriously ill..!!!....Maybe the guy was new to the job and failed the food handlers test a few hundred times before photoshopping a copy off of google and getting a job touching and handling food without basic knowledge of health and the usual bacteria within food. Â I Am totally not a germ-o-fobe I will eat beef and fish plus other meats basically raw, but I'm not cool with ecoli or salmonella... a little bit of tape worm is fine with me .....but I'm not down with raw chicken. Anyways the food flows nicely and the short rib is great, BBQ beef and BBQ spicy beef wonderful, steamed egg is delicious and delightful, shrimp squid and octopus was nice... kimchi rice very good and you can just order and order. I kind of tried to out do myself and so did my kids, my goal was to have to get wheel barreled out of there or maybe pushed out on a dolly... at $26 a person we must get our moneys worth.....AND !!! and they even CHARGED MY 8 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER FULL PRICE while she eats like a small tiny baby bird, crumbs. So $26 for a little kid..That was really weird, but it wasn't a surprise and it says it on the menu or website so I wasn't mad at it but just confused and taken back at the idea..... maybe it's because they are taking up a seat?? Who knows the logic?? What ever.... I might go back because it was good basic all you can eat kbbq... but this is LOS ANGELES ...the best city in the world ... L.A. Â ....SO YOU KNOW there's 5000 Korean spots to try out.... so 3 stars it is... it's good and worth the try."

4/16/2012,3 star rating,"At 12am on a Saturday evening/Sunday morning, my friend and I accompanied her friend/coworker on a late night dining adventure at his fave KBBQ place - Hae Jang Chon.It was a busy night but we were seated after 5mins of waiting. Of course the AYCE special was ordered and we tried the usual brisket, short ribs, and pork belly. What was new to me was the beef tongue which was fine - nothing crazy. Didn't care too much about the unmarinated meats that were ordered. The kimchi rice served after you're through with the meat servings is really good - I've never had anything like it! The sides were good too - and boy is that kimchi spicy!Service is good and parking isn't too bad. I'd mark HJC as a standard K-Town BBQ joint - not amazing, but not terrible."
6/22/2015,5 star rating,"Great service, delicious food. My boyfriend and I both agree that we've never been to a Korean bbq restaurant that has been so helpful, kind, and interactive as this one. They use a stone grill, I thought it was kind of odd but saw no huge difference. Only the fact that it did cook longer. Their meat was great and I am Not usually a fan of pork belly but it was amazing here! Will definitely come again!"
5/6/2010,4 star rating,"I ate here yesterday for the second time. You will not find a better deal anywhere for Korean BBQ that you cook yourself. $16.99 gets you all you can eat. Of the meats to choose from are marinated or unmarinated short ribs, brisket, bbq chicken or pork, thin or thick sliced fresh Canadian pork belly, squid, tripe, etc.. Plus, after you finish the meat they will make you kimchi fried rice at the table. The only thing I had a problem with was the chicken was dark meat and was not trimmed well. It had a lot of fat on it.If your in the area I highly recommend giving it a try for luch or dinner. I said no to being a good place for kids just because you cook things on a hot stone and your kid could get burned if they are acting up."
5/20/2010,3 star rating,"We enjoyed the food a lot. No complaints there. The banchan are a bit lacking, but the kimchi pancakes are quite good.HOWEVER (and this is big) -- it took them forever to take our initial order. We made a reservation for 8 people for 6:15. We showed up exactly on time and there was ONE other table occupied. A couple showed up after us and was promptly seated and served. We pressed our call buttons several times, but were completely ignored until someone from our party got up and started taking beer from the cooler. That certainly got their attention. (We weren't trying to steal the beer, of course, but we were frustrated after being ignored for so long.)I've been here one other time before -- with a predominantly Asian group -- and the service was good. Last night -- with a predominantly white crowd -- the service was not so great."
3/23/2011,5 star rating,"Yum! Â $17 is pricier than some other joints, say O Dae San... Â But the quality of the meat and service is SO MUCH BETTER. Â I like this even more than Manna and Moo Dae Po.I came with a very large, non-Korean party and we survived without issue. Â The menu and the waiters are all very gringo friendly, so have no fear.We tried just about everything on the menu, including the baby octopus, but ended up sticking with the basics just because they were so good. Â Kal bi marinade is probably one of the best I've had in Ktown. Â My one wish is that there were a better banchan selection, but I'm more than willing to overlook that fact. Â The stone is so much more efficient than the regular grills at other spots. Â If you end up as the cook for your table though - your hand will burn all night long because that sucker is HOT! Â The soup and fried rice at the very end were a little too much and a little too salty for me, though if I had more of an appetite I'm sure I would've finished them off anyway.Parking is valet for $2, but keep in mind you can hit Nandarang or Haus across the street afterwards without moving your car.A note on reservations. Â I made one a week and a half in advance. Â I called the day of to confirm and to add a couple people to our party. Â Apparently, the guy who took my reservation the first time never put it on paper! Â Fortunately, calling at 12pm the day of was a good idea - they still accepted my reservation without issue -- even though we didn't really need it. Â Get there early and you won't have a problem."
7/26/2011,5 star rating,"OMG! This place is SOO GOOD! the AYCE is only like 16.99 for dinner and they have SO many different kinds of meats and sides. First off, the grill is stone so it is really different than a lot of the other korean bbq places that I have been too. Second, they give you A LOT of different side dishes with this egg soup thing and at the end they make you kim chi fried rice!! Also, I like how they clean the grill with the radish(??) or something and yeah its really interesting. i would definitely recommend this place and definitely come back when I am in the area!"
11/14/2011,4 star rating,"This was my second time visiting Hae Jang Chon. Â The first time was amazing, there was no wait and the food and service were spot on. Â This time, with a group of 20, it was a different story. Â We had a group of 20+ and had called a week ahead to try to set a reservation. Â The restaurant unfortunately doesn't do reservations for Friday evenings because they are so busy (understandable), but they recommended us getting there before 8 and they'd do their best to seat us by 8:30. Â Many of us got there before 8, but as we continually checked in with the hostess and manager, it felt as if they kept pushing our group back. Â We weren't seated until well after 9:30pm.Once you're in the food and service are great, but with a big group... if you're going with friends who don't care to wait, I'd recommend opting for another place in K-Town. Â Good for groups: Noooo way.Good food and service: Yes."
9/19/2017,4 star rating,"I was told this is one of the best kbbq in town. I went in expecting a really awesome experience.I feel like it's alright but not the best in my opinion. First, the place tends to get crowded. It's pretty small. I waited for an hour and fifteen minutes. Very little parking. The food is okay. I'm not really into marinated meats so of course I stuck with briskets and pork belly. The server was very attentive. I guess they were really busy when we went so It felt a bit rushed. Like they just want you to finish eating and get out of there. Price is not that bad. Overall, It's a good place to go but I wouldn't recommend going on a busy night."
7/5/2014,3 star rating,"I was excited to try this place, but I really wasn't impressed. Came here with the fam, which means two adults and three young kids. I called ahead and they said kids from 0-3 are free, and 4-7 is half price. After we arrived and they seated us, they said each kid was $10 each. Okay that was annoying, but whatever.On to the food... There were a lot of things that were too spicy for me, such as most of the banchan and the pancake. The pancake wasn't good so don't bother. The egg soup was also bland so don't waste calories on that either. We ordered the brisket (way too fatty), pork belly (probably the best meat), bulgogi (nothing special), beef tongue (too fatty), marinated ribs (pretty good, but not spectacular), shrimp (shrimp is shrimp), Â squid (nothing special), and the honeycomb (can't you just say tripe on the menu?)We walked out feeling greasy and unimpressed. With the vast amount of competition around, I would go out and try something else. This place thrives on their old newspaper ranking (sure it's affordable, but that doesn't necessarily equate to quality) and the number of yelp reviews."
8/28/2012,4 star rating,"I came here for a birthday because I was craving kbbq.The price is $17.99 per person for AYCE bbq, and it comes along with steamed rice, egg, kimchi pancakes, and many other things. Overall, the service was very great, the food was okay. The short ribs didn't taste as well compared to other places; everything else was fine though. It's worth it for the price of $17.99/person. The interior is very inviting and a waiter often came by to ask if we needed anything. I came here on a Monday around 6pm and we didn't have to wait long! The only reason we waited five minutes was because they set up everything on the table before you sit, like firing up the grill, setting up appetizers, etc. Instead of replacing the grill, they cleaned it in front of you with onions (I think). It was very interesting to watch though. The stone grill also never gets too greasy because it has a hole on one side for all the oil to come out onto a little tray. They do come by often to check if the tray is full. Another interesting thing was that they play this birthday song on someone's birthday if it is requested."
4/21/2013,5 star rating,This place is awesome. Â The meat selection was great and they kept it coming. Â You have to get the spare ribs.There is a reason why they have so many great reviews and they definitely proved it.We'll be coming back.
6/17/2015,5 star rating,"Superior service. They were constantly on the ball helping us cook the meat, and asked us if we wanted to order anything frequently. Service was speedy too! Everything we ordered (brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, etc and also the pancake and steamed egg) were really awesome! Waited for about 35 min to get in but it was worth it."
10/7/2015,4 star rating,Used to order delivery from this place everyday when I was working in my Koreatown immigration law office. The food is decent although a bit expensive. The only dish that is really worth it is the salmon with crab meat at $15 I think.
1/12/2015,4 star rating,"Really good food here! Parking is horrible around the area, luckily our buddy lives near by so we were able to walk over. I've never tried to park there myself but I assume it is required to valet for the parking lot because I tried parking at a different place myself that had a valet since there was no parking near my buddy's place, but the valet guy came up to us and said we can't park there. Anyways that's another story...we waited about 15 min to be seated for lunch. Price is about right for being an all you can eat Korean bbq. You just tell them what kind of meats you want and they bring it out right away. They will even put the meat on the cooking plate for you, then you take over your part of the cooking and enjoy! After leaving you will smell like kbbq though so yeah don't wear really nice clothes."
6/14/2015,5 star rating,This place is awesome. My first time here and i was impressed with the quality of meat and sides.
8/4/2015,5 star rating,"I am leaving this review not only to say how awesome this place is for Korean BBQ, but the customer service that Steve provided for us is almost impossible to find these days! He was constantly checking on our table making sure we had everything we needed at all times. The polite, vibrant attitude he gave really makes us want to come back as often as possible. What a great guy, with amazing customer service skills. You're the man Steve! Keep up the great work"
7/6/2009,4 star rating,"First thing I noticed was that they used a tree in the middle of the restaurant to hide the gas line running in the middle of the restaurant. Pretty good tactic to make it look less industrial. They were nice enough to take my reservation considering our part was small and I only called 2 hours in advanced. Any KBBQ place that takes reservations is awesome to me. My parents gawked at the grill thinking that it was broken because it leaned to one side, but we figured out that the hole and the leaning let oil drip out onto a pan which gives you the false illusion that you aren't eating that much fat.The ban chan was ok. The chewy yam noodles were sour and not really my thing but tasted ok with the meat. The kim chee and the bean sprouts were a bit sour too but tasted good on the grill so maybe they purposely made it more sour than is typical. The boiled spinach? some kind of green was good and so were the shredded radishes. I love that they gave us 4 different dipping sauces: fermented bean sauce, vinegar and soy sauce, chili sauce and sesame oil with salt. The salad here was pretty good since it had a tart dressing that went well with the rich meat. The kim chee pancake was greatly improved when put on the grill and slightly burnt.So onto the meat! There were a lot of choices and we had the marinated short ribs, squid, brisket, beef abdomen, and pork belly. The marinade on the short ribs were pretty good but the cuts of meat were a bit random so some were really good while some were really chewy. The squid was good with the char from the grill and the tentacles were especially good. The brisket was better than some places, not especially fatty so they were pieces of meat vs. fat with some meat. The beef abdomen was definitely different, a bit chewy with a real intense beef flavor. The pork belly was also good, nicely cut with out random bits of cartilage, etc. The kim chee fried rice at the end was awesome with the dwen jang chigae (fermented soy bean soup). At first I was like this is not that special, but as I kept eating it was so addicting and I almost finished the whole thing despite being soooo full and the saltiness of the soup complemented the sour spiciness of the rice.Lastly, the service was also really good. I was surprised since our call button was broken, but they still came to regularly check on us. The cleaning of the grill was intense and done really well so I felt like our meat was sitting and cooking in an sh*t load of carcinogens. Overall it was definitely worth the 16.99 but next time I am not getting the soju at 11.99 a bottle it was a def. ripoff. Meat to try next time: the beef tongue, marinated chicken, non-marinated short ribs and the tripe."
4/25/2010,3 star rating,"Went for my birthday on a Tuesday evening with a group of six and we were pretty much seated immediately because the place was half empty around 8:30 when we arrived. Â I really liked the stone grill and the way it was tilted so the fat could drip down. Â All the meat we got was good, but I noticed the stone grill took longer to cook the meat than regular grills. Â This was kind of frustrating especially with a large group of hungry mouths. Â We really wanted to try the kimchi fried rice but we couldn't wait and had to get regular white rice to eat during the meal so we were too full at the end. Â The staff was surprisingly attentive for a korean restaurant. Â They responded to the bell and always brought drinks and food relatively quickly. Â I can imagine the service would be pretty bad on a busy weekend so I'm glad I went during the weekday. Â All in all, pretty good. Â Good quality meat and they even took our picture since it was a birthday and gave me a cute little card to take home with the picture. Â They played a birthday song but luckily nobody came over to emphasize it was our table celebrating. Â I still think my favorite is Tahoe Galbi or Road to Seoul still, sorry!!"
6/30/2010,4 star rating,"I've only been here once; so I won't give it 5 stars just yet, but in terms of the all-you-can-eat Korean spots I've been to, this may be my favorite. Â Previously, I liked to hit up guiram, and I've also been to Tahoe. Â However, the quality of the meat here is better, and so is the variety. Â The panchan is also better (I'm a big fan of the kimchee pancake that arrives early on).I won't go through my favorite dishes since it's AYCE; you can try whatever you want! Â However, the marinated pork bulgogi was a favorite of mine.Taste: Â Very goodDecor: Â Fun, rowdy - the kind of place you want to go with a small group of friends and dig in to meat.Service: Â Very good"
8/10/2010,4 star rating,"First trip to L.A and my friends HAD to take me to KTown to get some authentic Korean food. It is a MUST! I met them at school in New York so when I went to LA I met up with them. They took me to this place and told me I had to eat until I'm stuffed. So I agreed! My friend made a reservation beforehand so we just had to wait 10 minutes for them to set up our table.Boy do they get super crowded! The place is fair big, but still not big enough for the amount of people that come in. There seems to always be a wait. The parking is 2 dollar valet I believe and the parking lot is very small. Good side? 16.99 dollars for ALL YOU CAN EAT plus pancakes, salad, sides, tea water, and fried rice. SO SO SO GOOD! We went a good 5 rounds of all the kinds of meat you want. I'm not korean so my korean friend was very informative of what kinds of meats I was eating. He also did all the ordering and told me what sauces I should dip the different kinds of meats in. Gosh he was so awesome. The waitress was SUPER nice. She was rushing us to eat fast and leave. She was always around when we wanted to order another round. She refilled our water and got us soup when the time was right. She was so nice! I would definitely come back when I'm back in SoCal! I love it here and it has the best Korean BBQ I have ever tried! This place is a must try especially if you have never tried Korean BBQ before."
1/1/2011,2 star rating,"Slow slow service. I've been here twice and I can't recall another place that offered poorer service. The first time was tolerable because the restaurant was busy and i was in a big group but there is no reason you have bad service when half the restaurant is empty. There is a female server named Sarah, I think, who was really rude; and I thought she was going to yell at us. And my entire party of three was Korean, 2 were elderly, so I don't know why she was so rude. So the bad service required us to sit here almost three hours for a basic family Sunday lunch. It wasn't busy and I'm not sure how the service became so bad. My parents who are almost 70, and who have eaten everywhere in Los Angeles, thought this was the worst service they ever had, and have already told the rest of my family not to go backNot recommended."
1/23/2011,4 star rating,"Atmosphere: Loud and crowded, but that's ok. Service: Pretty attentive with more than one person serving you. Food: Good choice of meats for the grill. Could have more banchan offerings though. But the ones they served were good. And one of the Korean bbq places that make kimchi fried rice for you at the end of the meal. Price: $16.99 all you can eat. That's pretty good.Would I go back? Yes."
3/23/2011,4 star rating,AYCE K-BBQ Quality of meat here is good as well as the selection. Â I love the kimichi fried rice at the end. Â The only problem here is the wait. Â We usually put our name in and then have a few drinks at the place next door.You cook your meat not on a grill but like a black hot pot.The beef tongue is very good here as well as the pork.
3/25/2011,5 star rating,"Hands-down my favorite AYCE KBBQ place and I've tried a bunch! Service is top-notch and the quality and taste of meat is awesome! I love that they have all these little extras that other KBBQ places don't, like the seafood pancake and the kimchee fried rice they make at the end. HINT for those of you holding out on getting seated earlier because they don't want to sit in the smoking section..We were seated in the ""smoking"" section and honestly it barely made a difference since they had vents on and nobody was actually smoking in the smoking section."
5/28/2011,3 star rating,"We had a craving for some kbbq but it was already late and so, I made a few calls around some places and this restaurant with the hours and the price fit the call. Â Here, you get the regular korean bbq meats from beef brisket to bulgogi to marinated chicken. Â What did surprise me was the option for kbbq squid. Â That was something different. Â Anyway, all sides are also typical: kimchi, string beans, fish cakes, rice paper, small side salad and so forth...you get the idea. Â Here's my breakdown of the my three star rating:1 star: open late night - until 2 am.2 stars: friendly service. Â Unlike some other kbbq places with the angry korean ladies who just ignore you. Once you ring the bell here, they're on it. Plus, the servers go around the tables to make sure you're cooking the meat correctly and for newbies or those who dont really cook, this is a definite plus.3 stars: ventilation. ventilation. ventilation. Â Other kbbq places, it would seem as though you come out smelling like you too were being cooked but we didn't come out smelling crazy like kbbq. Â Lastly, for the price ($16.99) - You can take your money and go to another kbbq establishment and still get the same thing for a much cheaper price."

8/23/2011,5 star rating,"I came here for my birthday dinner on a Monday at 7pm. They were extremely accommodating when I had to change my reservation from 13 to 15. (Same day reservations OK!) They told me there was a 1hr-2hr wait even with reservations! I freaked out a bit! But when they called me to confirm 2hrs prior to my reservation, they told me it would be a 30min-45min wait. Much better!Most of my party was running late; so we didn't even sit down until 7:30pm! The hostess was gracious enough to hold our table (which was already set aside at 7pm!) for the 30min I was waiting for everyone to arrive. Their policy is, 1/2 the party must be present prior to seating. No crazy 30min-45min-1hr-2hr wait! My party ended up being 18 instead of 15, but they had no problems with it! They added on tables, chairs, place mats, and all the fix-ins multiple times without a fuss. Our waiter didn't even have a problem with 1 of my friends just having a beer.Hint: Free parking on side residential streets. Valet is $2.AYCE Menu: $16.99/per person for 19 items-black angus beef brisket, beef short rib (marinated or unmarinated), bbq beef [bulgogi], canadian fresh pork belly (thin or thick sliced), pork shoulder, beef tongue, bbq pork, bbq chicken, bbq squid, beef abomasum, beef honeycomb, hot dogs, and small octopus-kimchi pancake, rice cake, steamed egg, bean paste soup, and kimchi fried rice or steamed rice (rice paper and sweet radish slices for wrapping are provided to making delectable bites of goodness, and they are refillable!)-salad and 4 banchan that change, as well as, kimchi and bean sprouts that can be cooked on the grill-4 sauces: sesame oil with salt&pepper, hot sauce, sweet radish with jalapeÃ±o, and bean paste sauce (jalapeÃ±o, onion, and garlic available too)Onward to the deliciousness:-salad: actually surprisingly very good! the dressing really made it!-potato salad: not my favorite-- too thick and chunky.-spinach: really yummy! the sesame seeds on top really put it over the top!-spicy fish cake: good. the sweetness and the slight hint of spice played very well together.-radish: nothing special.-kimchi: pretty good-- even better grilled!-bean sprouts: nothing special.-black angus beef brisket: so good with rice paper and lettuce! and even better wrapped in sweet radish slices!-beef short rib (marinated): very juicy-- just the right amount of marinate-bbq beef [bulgogi]: absolutely delicious! the flavor was right on-- just enough juiciness and sweetness.-fresh pork belly (thin): crisps up so nicely when left on the grill to char a bit on the edges-- probably my favorite meat of the night. it's so delicious when dipped in the sesame oil and salt&pepper mix.-beef tongue: liked the texture of tongue, but not the slight bloody taste. it goes well when dipped in the sweet radish with jalapeÃ±o sauce and wrapped with lettuce in rice paper-- this gets rid of the iron aftertaste.-bbq pork: cooked in foil-- it was spicy, which wasn't expected, but definitely a happy surprise! it was so yummy!-bbq chicken: the chicken was fairly good. it didn't burn, but cooked through nicely. it was tender and juicy.-bbq squid: not a fan, but it wasn't bad. for people who enjoy bbq squid, it's probably really good. the texture was actually very nice-- grilled perfectly!-hot dogs: very soft grilled. just an average hot dog, but hot dogs are one of my favorite foods so to have it on the menu is awesome!-small octopus: really rad to have tried this even if it wasn't my cup of tea. had two of them to give it a shot. the texture is very chewy, and it has a bit of a fishy after taste that i didn't much care for.-kimchi pancake: decent. the sourness of the kimchi really came through, which turned me off a bit. really prefer potato pancakes over these any day!-steamed egg: so-so. maybe because they split it between the whole table, and the egg barely rose to above 1/2 an inch! steamed egg should fill the whole bowl! that's when it's best!-bean paste soup: too salty, but very good to sip on between bites of kimchi fried rice-kimchi fried rice: so freaking delicious! we had our waiter cook a whole order of bbq pork in with our rice! it was incredible! must order!!!I love that they help you cook by cutting up the meat with scissors, cleaning off the grill with radish, and emptying oil-drip tray.I gave my waiter Eric an extra $10 tip for being so awesome. He constantly asked us what meats we wanted, refilled food&drinks quickly, and provided fast service. He also brought out my cake and cupcakes with candles that they provided with flashing lights, loud Korean birthday music, and the whole restaurant was clapping for me! It was amazing, and I was not expecting that at all! They provided a knife, forks, and mini plates for the cake too!I had a fantastic birthday dinner here! We were there for 3 hours just enjoying ourselves! Everything went so smoothly. Great service, high-quality delicious food, and I will definitely be back!"

10/31/2011,5 star rating,"My expectations from an Asian restaurant is fast food, quick but bad service. I have never been let down by these standards, until I visited this restaurant on Saturday. I've always been a fan of AYCE Korean BBQ, and I am more in love with it after visiting this restaurant. To get a trifecta of great food, great price, and great service is rare in an Asian restaurant and this place goes above and beyond to accomodate and make sure you are a priority. What customers should be feeling. :)Their food options is abundant and plentiful, love their bulgogi, bbq chicken, bbq pork, canadian bacon (thin sliced). The only one I wasn't too interested in was the beef tongue. It had an odd flavor compared to the others I've tried before. The steamed egg is good, as well as kimchi pancakes (and I'm not a fan of spicy foods). The staff is very nice and kind, always stopping by to help you cook your meat, even got a refill on my water without asking for one! The only con I can say about this restaurant is the wait. I was lucky enough to have a short wait, but I am more than aware of how long the wait for this restaurant is. I set a reservation for 11 people for 7pm, and I was told that I would have to wait 30 minutes regardless, which I did, but it was well worth the wait. Just wanted to put in my two cents about how great this restaurant was, not that it doesn't have enough of it haha. :)"
1/16/2012,4 star rating,"Atmosphere: place is kinda tiny and although it has a small outdoor seating, the bar is small and there is no place to wait to be seated. But the decor is pretty, it is just a bit squishy.Reservations: only for big parties, so if you are dining with four people, prepare to wait. Parking: small parking lot with VALET ONLY, about 2bucks. you can go down that street and find parking if you get lucky.Service: SUCKS! yea like any other asian place, they do their job, and dont really cater to you...examples: asked for a sprite, NEVEr got it. My friend asked for onions about FIVE times before getting it, they cleaned our grill after four servings of meat. Food: the REASON WHY I GAVE THIS PLACE FOUR stars.-17.99 all you can eat bbq. You pick the meat you want to eat. You will get charged if you dont eat all of it. Sides are already on the table when you are seated (we did not get lettuce). You need to ASK for anything else, kimchi fried rice, steam rice. etc.the quality of the meat was soooooo gooood. we got the beef brisket and marinated bbq short ribs.....I would have liked to try the squid and pork and anything else, but we were sooo full after four servings of meat...soo key is to EAT slowly!!!So i will be back, but now i know to keep asking for things or else you wont be served them."
2/11/2012,5 star rating,"BEST AYCE KBBQ IN LA!!!I came to HJC with my girlfriend for our months-aversary and it was definitely a great experience. Let me tell you off the bat that I am a picky KBBQ eater and there is a certain criteria to be covered to be successfull as HJC does it all! If you seen my review for Gen KBBQ in Tustin/Irvine, HJC might be the one place that can compete with it.So what got my attention?-AYCE for $16.99/$17.99 at DINNER?? WHAT?? That is ridiculously cheap for what you get here (I will explain further down). There is a 2 person minimum for this $16.99 deal (Basic package, just the bare essentials like beef brisket, pork belly, sides, some other meats, etc) but more often than not , I won't be coming here on my own. The next package up is Â (What I got) which further upgrades your menu to include Squid, BLACK ANGUS beef brisket, canadian pork belly, marinated bbq, and a bunch of other goodies which for 1 dollar more is pretty worth it!! AYCE also includes for both packages (I think): kimchi pancake, rice, soup, kimchi fried rice-OPEN LATE!!! open until 2 am so get your grub on AYCE almost anytime of the day!-authentic decor and feel with a bunch of koreans eating around me so you know it's good if their own kind is eating it too (not to be racist, but they would probably know best!)-circular metal/clay grill that doesn't really burn up like most other places and they come around often to clean your grill and replace them if needed. this is the first place i've seen the technique where they use radish to clean it and it was very successful which at the same time kept the flavor you had from before intact and also doesn't require you to wait for your grill to heat up again!Of course every good place has to have it's bads.. which doesn't stop me from coming back here. Things to watch out for:-bad parking on the street. I had to park a couple blocks away and walk over due to really messed up K-town parking. THere is valet available up front but is subject to additional fees.-rooms are kind of isolated in some areas but they still provide good service and there is a service button that is responded to in a timely mannerMUST TRY!!!"
5/8/2012,3 star rating,"Came here the past weekend for my friend's b-day. We had a huge party of 13 so we needed to go to a AYCE KBBQ that accepted reservations. Koreatown AYCE BBQ restaurants are infamous for not taking reservations and doing a first come first serve basis so we chose this place. I came here before and liked the quality of meat and service so I wasn't disappointed by the groups choice. Our reservation was set for 7:00 PM so we all met up at 7 and waited until our table was set up. This restaurant isn't that large so seating 13 people was expected to be difficult. But what came about was never expected. For some reason, they sat half our group at a table which I sat in and we started eating while they told our other half to wait for another table to clear. They waited about 1 hour to be seated. 1 HOUR with a reservation is never taken kindly which made this restaurant lose 1 star. The other star is lost because of its service. I always had good service while dining here but for some reason, our waiter that was helping us out had the meanest face like he was about to punch us every time he came to replenish our ban chan or our order of meats. It wasn't a pleasant feeling and I felt uneasy every time he came by. Now onto the food: the meat here are okay. I love the tongue and brisket and the spicy pork. The galbi is a bit bland and their other meats seem to be a bit poor quality. Â We came on a Sunday so maybe they didn't have the freshest ingredients. I love their ban chan and the kimchi here though. I also like their daikon wraps that come with the rice cake wraps.Overall, the food here is good for a AYCE but they can seriously work on their reservation protocol for large parties and maybe fix that waiters attitude!"
6/2/2012,4 star rating,"Only $17.99 for all you can eat Kbbq! What's the catch? Â No catch, only if you want extra pancakes, it might take a while. But aside from that I thought they ranked pretty good in all areas.They were clean, had good ventilation (I know this because I came out not smelling too much like kbbq), and the meats were decent. I didn't get to try everything but the waitor recommended pork shoulder and it was YUMMY! Â I was skeptic because it looked a little fatty and dry when it was done cooking. Â However, it was one of the best! Â A must try! Â  Â I also liked that there is pancake, kimchi fried rice, and the thin slices of radish (not all kbbq's have it anymore). Â Something different I liked is that they use a stone plate to cook the meats in. Â Instead of changing the grill, they use radish to soak up all the oil and clean it. Â Brilliant and quick.Service wise, I thought they were pretty good. Â Our waiter came by refilling our rice papers without having us to flag him down. Â The only downside is the wait even with reservations. Â But I would definitely come back but in a smaller group. Â We were a group of 14 and they split us up in 2 different tables even though we waited made reservations and waited 30 minutes."
6/10/2017,4 star rating,I love this place. Their side dishes are def good. They have a wide variety of different meats to choose from. Only have it 4 stars for the wait time.
4/13/2013,4 star rating,For sure stop if your ever around K town. Or not. I drove 50 miles for this place & I'll do it again. Came here 2 celebrated my BDay with my family & friends & absolutely Loved it. DA BOMB. U Gotta hit this place. AYCE Korean BBQ indeed...
11/23/2016,5 star rating,"This is the best KBBQ in LA and it's less than $25 per person! Service, quality, experience are so, so much better than other spots. There are a ton of choices for meat and sides. It's also not overly smoky like Road to Seoul. You can make reservations as well! Shawn was our waiter and he was SO awesome and helpful. I recommend trying to get here earlier than later, though. The wait time can be BRUTAL. Came at 6:15 PM and had a 20 minute wait. There's lunch and ala carte ordering, too!"
11/23/2014,5 star rating,"If you're in LA, this is the spot to get some bomb korean bbq. Something about that stone grill, makes the meat a tad bit different than the others. Parking will be a little difficult since there's not much lot space, so just park in the neighborhoods. I've done it 3 times already but haven't gotten a ticket."
2/16/2015,2 star rating,Didn't think this was the best Korean BBQ. Kimchi rice was okay and the beef wasn't all that. Bulgogi not as as soft and the Brisket was chewy.
1/25/2019,1 star rating,"My family and my in-laws went to have dinner here on Sunday (1-20-19) to celebrate my mother in-law's b-day and there were 9 of us. When we got there (at 7:30pm) -we were told it would be a 90 minute wait, which was fine because I knew there were 9 of us. 8:45pm came around and we were told there were a couple of parties ahead of us. At 9pm we were still told there were a couple of parties ahead of us. By now my 9 year old was already hungry and had been asking to eat since 8:30pm.; I asked him to wait a little longer since it was 9pm and according to them we would have a table around 9pm. Long story short, at 9:55pm I had to take my son to eat at place that is located adjacent to this restaurant because they still had us waiting to get a table. When I'm at the other place buying food for my son and I, I get a text that we're finally getting a table (10:14pm to be exact). I told my sister-in-law that we were waiting for our food because my son and I couldn't wait anymore for them to give us a table. I'm not stupid! I get it that this is a popular place to eat, but this is our 2nd time going here in a year and they did the same thing last time. They had us waiting for a longer period of time than we were initially told. This time, it really bugged the heck out of me,...why tell people to wait 90 minutes when they knew it was a 165 minute wait???!!! I'm sorry, as much as I like their food (and its average quality for Korean BBQ) because its not 'extraordinary', I am not okay with them telling me its going to be 'xx' amount of minutes waiting and then making it double that time. I can tell you that I will not ever come back to this place. I don't care how popular a restaurant is, I am NOT waiting 3 hours to be seated. According to other people eating there, the staff likes to hook customers saying its a moderate wait time when it's not. So if you're told it will be a 60 minute wait, don't plan on being seated in 60 minutes!! Take a lunch bag with a snack if you're desperate to eat here."
7/27/2015,5 star rating,"My favorite AYCE KBBQ in the area!Meat quality is great (favorites were the thinly sliced pork belly, thinly sliced beef tongue, and spicy marinated pork). I thought it was the perfect amount of side dishes for KBBQ, (for us it was fish cakes, green vegetable, mashed potatoes, kimchi, thinly sliced radish), with Korean style pancake and egg. Only downside was the green vegetable with the meat was rarely refilled, and it was just a bowl of plain chopped lettuce. But I've never been very satisfied with the lettuce options at KBBQ places in LA/OC, so that was an expected disappointment. We did have to wait about an hour on a Sunday night with no reservation at 8PM for a group of 5. When we left at 10:30pm, there was still a mass of people outside waiting to get in. They said they do take reservations for parties of 6+.Service was great the night we went. We had people checking on us constantly. We never had to wave people down, we even had multiple people checking on us, even with the place was packed on a Sunday night. Something else I loved about the place was the amount of lighting. I could actually see everything on my plate and see the meat! $2 self parking in the lot was convenient as well."
6/3/2015,5 star rating,"This review is for when I went in April. LOL but I just had to write a review after trying other bbq places. This place is the bomb people. For AYCE it is pretty much bbq heaven I'd say. The meat is good, the service is good and I really liked the kimchi fried rice at the end. We went on a Sunday and the guy at the reception told us we might have to wait for like an hour and a half but only had to wait for an hour which is pretty ok given for a bbq place in Korea town. I liked the banchans too. This place might become my go to Korean bbq place in the future. I really recommend it!"
4/3/2014,3 star rating,"great place and great food and great service. But like all korean places, they friggin force tip. We left like $10 because that was all I had, and none of the rest of my friends had any money because i said it was going to be on me. i was forced to overdraft my card to leave a bloody extra tip. Our bill was $83 all together for everyone. I should not have left a tip at all, but i was not going to be so cheap. I did this for a friends bday. Tipping is a courtesy, not a right. Before anyone bashes me, remember that, i also have worked in the service industry and know how hard it is, however i sure as hell did not force anyone to tip me."
1/29/2009,4 star rating,"I've had my share of all-you-can-eat Korean bbqs and this one is overall my favorite in quality and service. Â For the same price as many other Korean bbqs you get the barley tea (bori cha?), kimchi pancakes (kimchi pajeon) and my favorite the fried rice (Kimchi Bokumbop), and i usually leave it on the grill a little longer to get it nice a crunchy. Â The service is quick: those guys get your stuff immediately and after your first round of meats, they clean that grill goood.The downside of this restaurant are that the banchan changes all the time, they don't have Gaeran Jim (steamed egg), and also no beef tongue (Woosul) which is also a favorite of mine. Â Also for those who don't like the fatty meats (how can you not??) the brisket (chadolbegi) and pork belly (samgyeopsal) is on the fattier side here.And remember: dip, wrap, partake, and ALWAYS wash it down with a nice cold HITE...ahh"
9/29/2009,5 star rating,"amazing birthday meal. make sure to ask for the kimchi pancakes and plan for a long meal to do it right. service can vary between overbearing and hands-off, but it didn't really bother me and become a fun game. each time i started to cook our own the next round of meat a server would jump in and take the tongs from me."
11/23/2009,4 star rating,"this is my favorite AYCE place in Ktown. It used to be Tahoe, but I dig the more authentic feel of Haejangchon. For 18 dollars per person, you can overdose on basically ALL types of korean bbq... I go strictly korean...meaning I head only for the chadol (brisket), galbi (short ribs) -- both marinated and unmarinated, and samgyupsal (pork belly). The service here is decent... there is one actress who's really chill, she always ends up serving me (kinda got a deep voice? real baggy jeans? I SWEAR I WASN'T CHECKING HER OUT!) ... anyway, my point is, they're GREAT about giving you stacks of rice paper and piles of radish. I LOVE that they have both out there to begin with. the only qualm I have about this place, is hte amount of smoke that generates and the slightly small grill... if you have a party of 4, you're going to grill and eat at a much slower/faster pace. The meat quality is wonderful, the galbi isn't too thick or sweet...but most of all, the perks are amazing... the fermented soy bean soup and kimchee fried rice. YUM!as a waitress at a different korean bbq restaurant, I HIGHLY recommend this one for AYCE. all in all, it will be an awesome experience! (PS. go with a korean person if you're a newbie...it's ktown and it can get kinda intimidating!)"
2/5/2010,4 star rating,"The meat here was pretty damn flavorful, it's ayce 16.99 and they have some fun choices. I had the squid, bulgogi, pork belly, chal dol, and beef tongue, they have beef stomach and intestine Â and pork intestines too Â and I wondered what the ""hot dog"" was? lol...The bulgogi was sweet and delicious chal dol was tender and tasty too, pork belly good and crisp even the fat.. Squid was good too one of the guys came and cut it up into little chunks for us witch was cool. They have kimchee pancakes and a nice panchan also and serve kimchee fried rice at the end if you can handle it.. me and my friend were stuffed from the barbarianism so we had no room for rice this time. Â Its open till 2am so that's 1 star off top! Â They valet also"
4/7/2010,5 star rating,"My first yelp review!! And it would be for kbbq haha, but anyways to business.I came here back in January for dinner at around 5ish? Be warned parking SUCKS. They have a VERY small lot shared with other businesses in the same plaza. If you are early, you should be fine, but if not...it's going to be a bitchhhhh (can I say that? haha) I do know they offer valet parking, not sure how much it is though, maybe like $5? When I went, it wasn't too busy at all, maybe 3 other tables were being served. But they only had 1 server so service wasn't that great. AYCE kbbq for 16.99 here is definitely worth every penny. You have a choice of who knows how many different types of meat...15+. I never really liked marinated meats, so I stuck to the pork belly and brisket. And they definitely don't disappoint here. The meat is probably the best quality meat I've had. The brisket is pure meat, not like the other cheap kbbq places with its rolled up curls of fat. Their salad, sides, and sauces are also on point! These are the biggest deal breakers for me. The salad tasted fresh, the sides are pretty typical...but you do get these kimichi pancake things that are pretty good. I love that they heat up the kimichi on the grill, it's so much better that way. The BEST part is that they cook you some bomb kimichi fried rice at the end...so save SPACE. I sadly learned the hard way, but I still ate it all. Overall, I loved the place and will frequent this place as often as I can. Plus it's open till 2 am?!?! Did someone say drunk kbbq??Food babies all day everyday."
5/1/2010,4 star rating,"Very yummy!! Came here last night to entertain some out of town guests. It was their first time having Korean BBQ, ever!We had many different types of meats. All very good. Very fresh. What I did not like was that they put our kimchi and beansprouts ON the girll, off to the side. I was always so concerned about our raw meats touching them. None of us have gotten sick, so I guess that's a blessing! But it was very good food.It's hard to judge Korean BBQ places because there are so many in K-town. So much competition between each one. I don't know which is my favorite..."
3/12/2011,2 star rating,Food was just okayService was slow and two servers bumped into my back several timesPrices are fair
11/21/2012,4 star rating,"The wait here is insane, so don't pick this place last minute if you're starving. My entire family came here once and our experience was good for the most part. I think I prefer the low-key atmosphere of other places but group dinners are great here, without a doubt.My dad is totally old school, traditional Korean man from poor rurals of South Korea. When he came in, he was immediately demanding for service and respect, not surprising. When we actually got to the table, he would order literally everything off the menu and would whisper into the worker's ear and laugh. Here comes the worst part, he snapped his fingers at one of the waiters....SO EMBARRASSING. The food was good, don't get me wrong, but my dad was just awful lol. Luckily, the Korean workers here know men like my dad, so they put up with him. Not only that, but my dad suddenly became buddies with the restaurant owner and he ended up giving us a $20 discount on the meal and free Soju...not that I cared for the alcohol anyway. Aside from that embarrassing evening, I like this place but the meat is definitely odd at times. I ordered the chicken platter, and there was a strange rubber quality to the texture. It's hard to explain, but I will stick with my beef and pork from now on. The rice papers they give you is bomb-diggity. I'll probably come here when my sister comes to visit me from NY this Christmas. But seriously, make a reservation...you'll thank me."

11/18/2012,3 star rating,"The food isn't bad - that's not what the three stars is about. The food is standard AYCE, which would normally get it 4 stars. The three stars is about the absurd wait. I've only been here once and my group waited TWO HOURS. After that long of a wait, the only way this was getting more than three stars was if the food blew my mind. Which it didn't. Nothing I couldn't get anywhere else, which leads me to conclude that this place is mostly just hype. Nothing special about the service or the food."
11/17/2012,5 star rating,"There's nothing I could say that hasn't been said. We got there before 6 on a Saturday, which means we only waited about 20 minutes for a table...not bad. But by the time we were seated, it was almost an hour wait,so go early or make a reservation. Outstanding food and service. Be sure to get a large bottle of Korean beer to accompany your meal...so perfect. But perhaps the best-kept secret is the kimchee pancakes...OMG so friggin' good! The only thing I didn't care for, and I know I'm in the minority here, is the kimchee fried rice. It was a bit too salty for my liking."
11/16/2012,4 star rating,"Bottom line (at the top): my first time having Korean BBQ so I'm not sure how accurate this review will be but I really enjoyed it! --You can pick four meats at a time and we had BBQ chicken, bulgogi, marinated beef, and beef brisket and actually were too full to get anymore. They give you a bunch of kimchi, a small bowl of mashed potatoes and apple, and your choice of kimchi fried rice or steamed rice comes out at the end. I'm not really sure why you can't get it in the beginning or middle but they give it to you after you finish your meat so.. Just a heads up. The kimchi pancake they give you is sooo good. Love love loved it. I'll have to ask some of my Korean friends at USC for more kbbq recommendations! This was a good start I think :)"
11/16/2012,5 star rating,"This restaurant became one if my favorite! It was awesome place! Yesterday is my first time to come here. I like kimchi fried rice and short ribs. I dont have to hurry up because there are no limited time to eat and i can choose 19 kinds of meat! They are so delicious~~ Â My friend said i have to wait at least one hour to get in there and she is sick and tired of this..but yesterday there are short line!! I took the table just in 15min! the server eric is very kind, he asked for what i need in every 10min. also another server jena(i think she's host) is very nice and kind! i couldnt hear her calling my name so i missed my turn at first time, and i waited my friends who were late. She tried to check me up more than twice and when my friends came, i can seat in right away!! She's ready my table! Also Thanks for candy:) this place is one of high ranking AYCE restaurant in k town!Does not matter lunch or dinner,the price is 17.99per person only for 19 items with fried rice and kimchi pancake and den jang stew!! They are so awesome!"
11/15/2012,3 star rating,"To be completely honest, I'm not sure if this place is worth the wait for me..especially since the entire party has to be there for you to get seated even though your table has already been set up and you're just waiting on ONE person. Very strict with their policy but seems useless when there's two tables total in the restaurant and twenty open ones.. By the time we got seated our banchan (side dishes) were already dried and kinda gross..$17.99 for AYCE. Open til 2am which is very convenient for the area. They have about 19 things to choose from and 4 different dipping sauces (hot sauce, radish ponzu, salt&oil, and the bean paste one). I love the bean paste soup (dengjjang) and it's a hard dish to mess up on, but they somehow manage to do that so that definitely took away my excitement when they first arrive with the bowl. It was very bland and tasted weird. Their intestines are different than the ones you normally get at AYCE KBBQ also, can't really explain it. Their squid is not as good as Road to Seoul's either.All in all, I would only come here for late night when all the other AYCE KBBQ places are closed or if I have my entire party with me and the wait is not longer than 20 minutes, otherwise I'd definitely go elsewhere first before heading that way because I'm a KBBQ lover and I don't like to be disappointed.OH! I however love the way they clean the hot stone and how they make you kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal, so make sure you save some room for that :3"
11/14/2012,4 star rating,We waited an hour to be seated but it's worth it. All you can eat Korean BBQ. Choose from 19 items for only $17.99. This is why I like SoCal. Food is competitive so very delicious yet so cheap. The best I like there is the short ribs YUM!!!
11/13/2012,5 star rating,"BEST ACYE KBBQ, EVER! (Sorry, Hwang's, I feel like I'm cheating on you...)Heard a lot of hype from friends and finally had the chance to come here on a Friday night. And it lives up to the hype. Got in around 11:30pm as a party of 2, and waited for almost an hour (good thing we were waiting in the car and watching Top Gun so the wait wasn't too bad). The host, Daniel, Â was on top of everything! He's very efficient in seating guests and figuring out which party goes next. The waiter took our orders fairly quickly and our food came out as we requested, smaller portion of everything (so we could try everything!). The meat was juicy and well marinated and the rice paper was big enough to make wraps (woot!). The waiters were very friendly and constantly came by to help us cook the meat and check up on us.The only thing I would recommend (seems like other Yelpers have the same idea) is to have the kimchi fried rice WITH the meat. Oh Yums.Great food, great price, with friendly and efficient service. You can't get better than this.P.s: valet service outside when the parking lot gets too crowded."
11/12/2012,4 star rating,"The price was a bit higher than I would have liked for Korean BBQ place.. The meal was delicious, and I liked that staff members came over every few minutes to help you cook (whether you like it or not). I was not as impressed with the bulgogi pork. They brought it over wrapped in foil so we weren't too sure what to do with it for a while haha. I also loved watching them clean the grill with the radish. My favorite thing about the dining experience was when they made kimchi fried rice at the end! yum!"

3/30/2011,4 star rating,"Went Wednesday night at 12:00am so there was hardly a crowd. Party of three AYCE we tried the black angus brisket, bulgogi, chicken, bbq pork, and the delicious canadian pork belly. Â I personally didnt like the chicken nor the bbq pork, so the bulgogi and thick pork belly became the staple order. Â The stone grills are interesting and have a larger cooking surface and seems to result in a cleaner cooking experience at the cost of losing the ""flame broiled"" taste. Our server got + points for a good sense of humor, considering he was working til 2am serving us drunkards. Â Did I mention the AYCE $16.99 two person minimum? Â Prepare to chow down."
6/15/2011,4 star rating,"This place is really good. It is probably one of the better ones in K-Town. The fact that they actually have kimchi available to try as well as tin foil cups filled with oil to fry garlic is amazing. If you've never tried frying your garlic instead of grilling, it is a must. Very few places that actually do this. After you're done with the meat, they make kimchi fried rice that finishes off the mean just right.The bad: the wait. If you dont have a reservation, you're going to be there a while. I think everytime I've gone, the average wait was hour and a half. But you can make reservations for relatively larger groups (6 people) but it has to be done at a reasonable time before the actual time you want to eat. Service is actually pretty good considering it's really busy. Overall, really good food, just make reservations or get there early."
9/18/2011,2 star rating,"Typical Korean BBQ, but with rude service. Â I understand they are busy, but to ignore you completely for 10+ mins. Â When we finally got our waiter's attention we had told him the meat quality wasn't to par, but his response was the all there meat is the same and he couldn't do anything about it. Â I would never go back. Â There are plenty of other BBQ restaurant in ktown."
3/15/2012,4 star rating,"Great experience.

2/29/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing food, service so good they did everything but chew our food for us. What KBBQ place have you been to where they ask you if you want more salad after they take the empty bowl? That's right, just this one. Juice rivers run of the meat down the side of the stone grill plate. Heaven."

9/22/2012,4 star rating,"If a friend told me that I would wait 2 hours to eat here.....I would have told him that we would head to Kyochon next door instead. Good thing our stubbornness paid off because this place is bomb! Â Everyone stands outside looking, trying to estimate how much time tables need before they finish up and then calculating how that translates to waiting time. Â The wait was longer than normal I assume when I went because the restaurant was undergoing construction. Â There was a sign outside that stated they were not allowed to have more than 45 ppl inside at a time because of that. Once we finally got in, the staff was real friendly and still moved quickly because we had only 1 hour left before last call. Â We thought the 4 meats-order-at-a-time limit was going to hinder our all you can eat experience....but it didn't. The waiter was quick on service and he wasn't too snooty if we had a few pieces left and he still brought out more food. Even when the doors were closed, the waiters never rushed any of the patrons to finish faster. Â SIde dishes and drinks were refilled promptly. Props to the good service!The meat here was pretty juicy and tasteful. I like my korean bbq heavily marinated. Some of the other AYCE bbq places have unflavorful meats but this place was the antithesis of that. The kalbi and bulgolgi were the best choices in my opinion. They also have hotdog and chicken choices but its what you thought....just a hotdog and unmarinated chicken. At the end, they will make kimchi fried rice on the grill if you want. It wasn't as good as I remembered kimchi fried rice to be but still an option if someone was still hungry after eating their face off. Be careful of the grease/oil pan that collects on the side of the grill. It almost spilled a couple of times because it got so full. Don't hesitate to have them swap it out before you burn yourself!"
3/23/2015,4 star rating,"Was very iffy about the small options of meat. Â Girlfriends and I chose this spot for our kbbq dinner. Despite the small options it still satisfied our hunger. Â The quality of the meat is very tender compared to other ayce kbbq. Â My favorite was the short ribs, it tasted like kang do hangs imo. Â Service was attentive and always assisted in helping cook our food. Â The only thing we regret is not getting the kimchi fried rice."
7/10/2017,5 star rating,This place is amazing! The side dishes are incredible and the meat is so flavorful . We loved every bite . Service was fast and on point. The best part of the dinner was Jane! She was so nice . Got us everything we needed right away and she cooked our food and let us know when everything was ready! I loved it
3/8/2014,4 star rating,"Semi-impressed until the kimchi fried rice came at the end and literally at the very end. They won't serve it until you're done ordering meat. Anyway, the kimchi rice has nori in it. It's def the best part. 3 of us = $58 and I ate the most meat in my life in one sitting, so the value is great."
3/19/2014,3 star rating,"Long long waits here just to be able to sit down and eat, even when you have reservations. You gotta make sure you make reservations and your whole party arrives on time or you won't be seated. Service is alright, just gotta make sure they bring out all your food because they can forget. I had seen lots of reviews for this place and I was hoping it would be a great AYCE place but it was ok. The food itself is very average, nothing stood out. The brisket is mainly fat which can be good if that's what you're into. Bulgogi is decent and the short rib is good. The kimchi pancake was different and good, I've never had that before anywhere else. As all Korean BBQ places, it will get smelly and you will come out smelling delicious. Make sure to grab a toothpick on your way out."
7/27/2014,3 star rating,"Price wise it was reasonable at 18.99 per person. However the quality of the meat for K BBQ i've had better. I guess you get what you pay for. The beef brisket was extremely fatty and I noticed other people cutting off the fatty parts leaving very little meat left. The pork belly had bristles. The service was horrible at first. The host sort of an attitude when we didn't seat as fast as she liked, we had a toddler with us and a senior. The next 2 servers were rude and abrupt until Kay came and saved the day. She was responsive, friendly, and very attentive. All said and done, we will try other places."
12/3/2011,5 star rating,"Best korean bbq place that I've been to!$16 all you can eat... mmmm. This place is my favorite because they have a good balance of everything. The meat is great, and so is the salad! I don't even like salad and I love this salad.Go on a weekday and you won't have to wait as long. I called ahead on a Wednesday and only had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Went on a Saturday and waited 2.5 hours..."
3/16/2012,2 star rating,"Way too many stars here. Â Certainly an ok value for the price, but you get what you pay for.Several bites worth were spit out because they were nothing more than chewy grizzle. Â Not fun. Â Then the flavors just did not hit the spot like they should.I also did not like the rushed nature of the service. Â Every few minutes, different servers would come by to make sure we were eating as quickly as possible. Â Don't even think about getting some good crisp brown on your meats - servers will flip it onto your plate pronto.Additionally, the kimchee was not up to par and the flavor was very different than what we are typically used to.We also needed to ask for garlic, jalapeno, and lettuce is five dollars extra. Oh and just soju no sake...If you are a college kid and have little funding, this is probably the place for you. Â If you have a good job and want a high quality kbbq and a non rushed service - give Hae Jang Chon a swift pass and go to any of the other spots in koreatown!"
1/26/2015,5 star rating,"This place is awesome! Gf and I came here on a Saturday night around 6:30. There was valet parking for $2. We put our name down and got a table around 7:30ish. So, if you're coming on a Saturday night for a table of 2, I'd say 1.5-2 hour wait is normal.Here's the breakdown:- COST: About $22 AYCE dinner per person. Great price for the quality! - SERVICE: John was our server, and we were AMAZED at how well he could multi-task! He basically brought all the food and cooked it for us. We just had to sit there and eat. John was busy bouncing from table-to-table, but we always felt well taken care of and never really had to wait for anything. John was awesome! - WHAT WE HAD:-KALBI (marinated short rib): It was decent, but we only ended up ordering it once, even though we love kalbi. The meat was juicy and tender, but something wasn't right about it. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's not the kalbi I'm used to. Just didn't feel/taste like short rib meat. Maybe too thick? I don't know. The marinade as also a bit too sweet. Overpowered it. I mean, it's AYCE, so we should be grateful it's even offered on the list.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - BRISKET: Delicious! Thin slices of beef brisket that just curl up and brown almost instantly on the grill. A must get, especially dipping in the sweet soy sauce mixture you get. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - THICK PORK BELLY: This was decent. I don't remember it that well, so nothing really stuck out about it. We only got it once. Not bad, but not amazing. I feel like it was a little tough to eat (not enough fat?), but maybe it was just over cooked. Don't remember.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - PORK SHOULDER: Delicious! This was one of my favorites here! Great texture and flavor! You just have to get it and try. We got this twice.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - BBQ squid: Delicious! Also, another one of my favorites! If you're scared the squid might be tough and chewy, don't worry. This squid is so tender and succulent, with a nice BBQ flavor on it. It was so good, was just gobbled it all up! Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - BEEF TONGUE: If you're used to getting beef tongue at a Japanese place, this is very different. It comes out looking almost identical to the thinly sliced beef brisket. The taste is a little different than beef brisket, but overall, the tongue is pretty damn good! This is really the only way I'd eat beef tongue. Â - KIMCHI PANCAKE: It was okay. Pretty standard pancake. Nothing to write home about.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - STEAMED EGG: It was okay. It's just steamed egg. Nothing to write home about.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - MUSHROOM: They count this as one of your meat choices. It's just spears of mushroom you put on the grill. It was okay. Adds a nice flavor balance to all the meat you'll be eating.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - RASPBERRY WINE: Delicious! A wine that tastes like raspberries. Sounds good to me! Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - We didn't get offered the kimchi fried rice at the end, but we were way too stuffed anyways. If you want it, just make sure you request it. NOTE: If you don't feel like you can eat a whole portion of meat, just ask for a half portion so you don't waste the rest. They allow you to customize the size of your orders."
1/25/2015,5 star rating,Bar nonr best Korean BBQ in the city hands down.. no contest.. for all you can eat you wuill have enough Korean goodness to feed your hunger and 10 previous ancestors.. all the meats we had were super tender and the service was impecible... this is the only place I will go for Korean BBQ in Ktown. The Kimchi pancakes is the icing on an already great experience..
12/10/2013,5 star rating,"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars since our party of 6 waited over 1.5 hours to get seated, but the all you can eat BBQ was just really really good so I have decided to give Hae Jang Chon 5 stars.There is definitely a lot of food I could have eaten in those 1.5 hours, but who knows, maybe the wait makes the food taste better of my stomach expand in anticipation, and hunger, or maybe both, who knows. It could all be part of a grand marketing or psychological plan, but alas, I digress...I'll keep this very simple. Order whatever you want, with the following 3 _strong_suggestions:1) Make sure you at least try the MARINATED Galbi (Beef Short Ribs). This may be what you end up eating all night. Make sure it is marinated. We tried the non-marinated as an experiment and it tasted, well, bad. 2) If you don't ask for/get white rice, at the very end they will make kim chi fried rice for you, one serving for each person who didn't get white rice.3) Be careful when the server is cleaning the hot hot hot hot cooking pan thingy with the radish or whatever. Our server was too strong and rigid with his cleaning moves (no teppanyaki training here, but it's the effort that matters anyways right :P) Â and the hot cooking pan thingy sort of fell onto the table and could have burned me had it gone 8-10 inches further, and my back/chair was trapped against a wall. That could have been bad, but good thing it wasn't! So anyways, maybe take a look backwards when they are about to clean the pan with their slick moves and if you are trapped by a wall maybe just step out. Better to have to take a trip to the bathroom than potentially get scalded by a hot pan .This place has some really good Korean BBQ. No worries, it is of pretty good quality so you won't regret in at night or the next day :P Yum. I want s'more. I really want some more marinated Galbi, it was so good."
1/24/2013,5 star rating,"This place is delicious, opens late, and if you don't go during rush hours, really doesn't have too bad of a wait. For AYCE, I don't think the meat can get any better, especially for the bargain price of $16.99. Plus, my favorite sides always include the steamed egg (sorry I don't actually know what it's called LOL) and the tofu soup, which I think is awesome that they give it to us for free rather than charge like many other kbbq places. And if you like kimchi (sorry - I don't... don't kill me), then my friends all raved about the kimchi fried rice! Always a good to try at the end!"
8/12/2017,5 star rating,"I really had a great experience here. The beef was marinated so well and I like how their fish cakes were spicy. I tried the black angus beef, short rib, BBQ chicken, brisket, thin and thick pork belly, and they were all pretty solid. There was about a 15 min wait for a party of four but for larger parties the wait was way longer. The waitress, Yerim, is very very considerate and her willingness to help was Â genuine. I definitely recommend this place. At the end, there is kimchi fried rice! There is $2 valet parking though."
10/28/2014,4 star rating,"For the price, this was good. I didn't find the meats to be exceptional, and the ban chan was just ok as well. The kimchi fried rice at the end was a nice perk."
5/11/2013,3 star rating,"Stopped by here late,11pm, on a Wednesday after catching a show at the Wiltern. Â Place was still crowded. Â The food was good and reasonable good for the price. Â Service was okay. Â Ambiance was good but the kpop music was a little loud.Bhah chan selection was soso. Â The bulgogi and pork belly were good but nothing really special.This place is good and I would come back if I was in the area and try some other dishes, but I didn't have anything super amazing yet.Worth checking out if you are in the area."
1/21/2015,4 star rating,"I am definitely not one to be able to tell the difference between quality and quantity when it comes to KBBQ, but this place made me see the light. Its a little bit intimidating to be honest. The wait was extremely long, of course worth it, and I felt like quite the KBBQ newb, however our server made us feel welcomed the second we mentioned we were first timers. HOLY SHIT thinly sliced pork belly is my new love. Amazing kimchi pancakes, like duh best. I had to get used to the idea of the server taking charge of the cooking of the meat, but it was awesome. Kimchi fried rice....delicious! However I could not take more than two bites, as it was served at the end of the meal. YUM."
10/19/2011,2 star rating,"This used to be a really great place to eat ... about a year ago. I'm not sure what happened since then but when I went there to eat yesterday, the quality of meat has dropped significantly.compared to Byul Dae Po or Moo Dae Po II, this place is horrible. The CHADOL had a lot of fat on it and it was very thick. (Chadol is supposed to be thin) The ""gal bi sal"" just had too much fat on it - it wasn't really edible. I mean, the price is the same - for hae jang and byul dae po and moo dae po but the quality of meat at Hae Jang is unacceptable. the only ""hype"" about this place is the kimchi fried rice. But seriously, not worth my money. the miso soup (dwen jang jji gae) was like salt water. I would never eat here again."
1/2/2012,2 star rating,"I think the reviews here over hype the quality of the place. $17.99 is a good price for all the choices you get, but if you want good quality food, I would go elsewhere. We ordered short ribs, beef tongue, pork belly, bbq chicken, and the brisket. The short ribs and chicken were bland, almost unseasoned. The service, while very attentive, made us feel very rushed. They were constantly throwing the food in the grill and pushing us to order more. I like to enjoy my food, and I did not appreciate the rushed feeling.One star for price, one star for variety."
9/12/2012,3 star rating,"We discovered Â Hae Jang Chon from their ad in LA Weekly.Since it is a AYCE and a Friday night, the wait was 20 minutes.The crowd seemed lively and the line was quite long. We were lucky and was seated in 10 minutes.Hae Jang Chon AYCE price is very competive with all the others . The service was okay and needed improvement.Was not impressed with the quality of the galbi.The other dishes seemed fine.I prefer going to a standard menu than AYCE.I have noticed most AYCE places,the Galbi is not of top quality.***** Their neon sign with picture of the pig is eye catching *****"
1/15/2017,5 star rating,One of the best tasting Kbbq meats I've had. The service was reasonably good and our table was always attended to by at least one of the staff. At $21/person for lunch it's not a bad deal but make sure you have at least 1 or 2 big eaters in the group to really make it worth it.
12/2/2013,5 star rating,"this is the it spot for ayce kbbq. i've been here many many times and i've tried to find others like it to avoid the wait, but i've just come to realize that good things are worth waiting for. meats are good quality and plenty in selection. i love the pork belly options (thin slices, & thick slices). i love the tongue, marinated short ribs, the spicy pork, and brisket. their banchan is good. they don't offer many options of banchan but the ones they do serve up are quality, especially the kimchi pancake!service is pretty attentive. the workers walk around and help cook your meat for you and they are responsive with your requests. best part?! the kimchi fried rice at the end! save your stomach for some of that. you will not want to miss this part of the meal."
8/8/2010,5 star rating,"Definitely worth your money worth. Â Only 16.99 + tax for a whole delicious array of all-you-can-eat meat selection. Â Restaurant gets kind of crowded though.My favorite meats were the short ribs marinated and unmarinated and the angus beef brisket. They were delicious! Â Don't forget to dip them into the sesame oil/salt sauce!The bulgogi was just okay, the BBQ pork was spicy so didn't suit my taste bud much. Try them all out if you've got enough tummy space (you can only order 4 meat selection at a time in which you can always order more and more!)Overall, love this restaurant! Â Will be going here often if it wasn't for my boyfriend who's paranoid over health issues."
6/17/2012,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is some of the best Korean BBQ I have tried. My girlfriend told me about the AYCE deal they have and about their really good meat selection and I was sold on the idea. We got there a little before they opened so we actually didn't really have to wait all that long to be seated once they opened the place. However, I was impressed with how quickly this place filled up. Within a few minutes everything started to smell very delicious as meat was being cooked on all those stone plates. They also have a very good ventilation system so you don't get overwhelmed by the intoxicating aromas, nor do you end up smelling like BBQ all day or night. I think one of the things that really set this place apart from other Korean BBQ places that I've been to are their cooking stones. I really liked getting to use this new cooking method and they have their waiters clean the stones with chopped radishes so all your meats taste fresh and delicious. I enjoyed their beef tongue amongst countless other meats. On the day I went everything was fresh and tasted great. The cooking stone cooks your slices of meat evenly and I believe it's a great concept that should be used more often. After we had all the Korean BBQ we could eat for one meal we added the kimchi fried rice. The kimchi fried rice was actually a really great way to finish such a great meal. I also ended up washing down all this meat with a refreshing Korean beer called Hite. Â This is an excellent choice for a meal like this because it's a little sweet and has a light refreshing flavor that complimented our banchan and selection of meats perfectly."
9/6/2012,4 star rating,"So where to begin on this korean BBQ journey...Arrived on a weekday around 9PMish with little wait. We only ordered two kinds of meat and that was plentiful for three gals. The bulgogi was pretty good but the squid was lacking. We probably should've ordered either the brisket or the pork belly, which all looked wonderful in passing. One of my friends noted on the menu that they charge $15 for any uneaten meat, so we went the conservative route. One of the places I've been with better banchan and sauces. I find sometimes with the banchan, it tends to taste like it's been sitting out due to quantity over quality. However, I was impressed by the freshness. Â Here I was, prepared to get all smoky, but was pleasantly surprised by the set-up. Overall, everything was A-OK, but for the price and the endless indulgence of meats, I was pretty happy.Other things of note:Parking is valet for $2 You can't sit on the benches by the register inside and have to wait outside until you've been beckoned"
3/6/2017,4 star rating,"While this is definitely an excellent Korean BBQ spot, I'm not sure if it warrants the long waits and number of five-star reviews on Yelp. Â We went with the all-you-can-eat fare, which includes three main selections - we opted for the short rib, spicy pork, and spicy chicken. Â All were delicious and tender. Â Be sure to ask them for the kimchi friend rice at the end, as this is really the crown jewel of the experience. Â The banchan was your standard fare of kimchi, mashed potatoes (with apples!), noodles, and accoutrement. Â Really nothing to complain about, except they were stingy to replenish any empty sides. Â The service was just okay - our server messed up the order a couple of times, and we had to ask for chopsticks multiple times. Â The restaurant itself is a medium-sized space with lots of wood paneling. Â It's a cozy place with plenty of space between tables. Â Overall, I do recommend this spot, but it's really nothing out of the ordinary."
5/3/2015,5 star rating,I went here to have dinner with my fiancÃ© on a Thursday. Waited about 40 minutes but it was worth it. Lots of meat choices and the steamed egg was very good. Our server/attendant was so great.
5/3/2015,4 star rating,"My husband favorite BBQ, not mine. Long time waiting every time, and at least 1 hour. The food is yummy but the consumer service is so bad. Last time, when they clean even hurt me. If myself only, I will not come again."
1/13/2017,3 star rating,Only the short ribs were really good. The sides aren't that great. The spicy chicken and bulgogi beef were not good quality meat at all.
6/24/2015,5 star rating,"This is by far the best AYCE KBBQ in Los Angeles! I go here at least a few times a month since I live a couple blocks away and it never disappoints. The meat is really good quality and the service is great! There's always a line out the door, I wont go anywhere else but here. Love this place!"
5/2/2015,4 star rating,"I've been here 4 times now - each time the food is great, by far the best I've had in regards to Korean BBQ. Reason why 4 stars instead of 5? No way you can eat here in less than 2 hours."
3/6/2015,4 star rating,It never disapoints! Â We came here starving and went home in a food coma. Our waiter Jay was super nice and attentive. Our food was superb!! We started with the Kimchi pancakes which are my absolute favorite followed by our Meats. We had the brisket pork belly and the short ribs. Every bite was better than the last! Â All the sides were so delicious and complimented the meats nicely. We finished our meal with the kimchi fried rice which is a new favorite of mine. I never got it before but was told it was a must. The only thing I didn't like was that I was too full to finish my food. Great place.. I'm definitely coming back.
11/30/2014,5 star rating,Awesome Korean BBQ. Some of the best in Ktown.
10/18/2014,5 star rating,There's a nice meat selection with great service. The workers help cook the meat for you. The short ribs and bulgogi were the best.
1/10/2017,3 star rating,"I waited an hr in line for this place, and I was surprised with the poor quality of meat here. Of the three meats that I had, only the beef short rib was tasty and of good quality. The bulgogi was stringy and tasteless and the chicken was rubber. Disappointed overall but the short ribs are good enough to warrant the 3 stars total"
12/3/2007,3 star rating,"It was a cold, rainy evening in L.A. Â We were hungry, and someone had suggested Kyochon Chicken. Â I looked in, but was unimpressed. Â On the walk over, Haejangchon had jumped out at us, so we turned ourselves around and headed there instead. Â It was the right choice. Â Haejangchon serves up a solid meal of Korean comfort food, perfect for those depressing, wintry evenings.The interiors are warmly lit, and a row of paper-screen lanterns lines the bench along the far wall. Â The smoke from all that bbq'ing is simply intoxicating. Â Don't sit by the window, or you will reek of garlic and meat and all things Korean bbq for days (as the smoke tends to drift in that direction). Â Do sit by the window, and you can watch drunk patrons having a great time, smoking up a storm in the partially-enclosed patio area just beyond the window. Â I like that they try and keep the bbq smoke ""pure,"" setting aside this separate area for those who might wanna smoke.Being at Haejangchon is like stumbling out into a small, sleepy village. Â It's homey, and while the bbq falls short of the stuff that ChoSun Galbee serves up, it's nonetheless pretty good. Â Plus, you won't have to get in line behind all those well-dressed yuppies and be on your best, snooty behavior while there. Â For $16.99, you get a great, all-you-can-eat selection of food (well worth it, although the entire table has to order it for you to get the deal). Â And you get to kick up your feet and throw back your beer while enjoying it all. Â Just make sure you get one of the waitresses, and not that one waiter with the attitude. Â And for the slightly-drunk, smoking patrons out there: Watch out for those slippery floors and heat lamp cords in the patio area. Â I saw one girl fall pretty hard on her ass. Â Ouch!"
1/9/2011,3 star rating,"All you can eat MEAT?! Â Wow. Â We had bbq ribs, tongue (forgot what kind), beef, honeycomb, etc. etc. Â I can't even remember all of the different types of meat we had, but wow, I had major itis after wards.I can't really comment on anything else really as I was so hungry, I was focused on the food. Â From what I could remember, the bathroom was a bit gnarly and I was cold. Â Perhaps they kick the A/C on high so people can get out fast to eat less meat! Ha!"
4/27/2012,4 star rating,"Despite the wait time issues in a lot of previous reviews, I came here on a Thursday evening and had no issues getting a table for a party of 9. Maybe it was just a slow night?As far as the actual food went - well for starters, the banchan is pretty limited. IIRC, it had the following:Salad/lettucePotato saladDaikon sliversSpinachKimchiSpicy fishcakeSteamed eggThe marinated meats were good (bugolgi, chicken) but I wasn't a huge fan of the rest. I was especially disappointed with the octopus.... I swear it was tasty before, but last night it tasted like crap. Maybe I was just that drunk the previous time!!??Service - very attentive, brought meats over, cleaned grills, provided water all as fast as I could expect. No troubles coming from servers with limited English either!Pricing - $17.99 for AYCE. Don't recall the beer price atm.Ventilation at this place is average at the tables. I recall a decent amount of smoke blowing into my face... 3 star KBBQ place bumped to 4 due to good service."
3/25/2010,4 star rating,I'm gonna be honest. I can't really taste the difference in meat quality or flavor between all these Korean BBQ joints in K-town. But everyone I know who wants to eat Korean BBQ picks this place. And I go and get full as $%*! because it tastes good.So. 4 Stars!
1/5/2013,4 star rating,Great food and quick table service. The wait is almost 2 hours on a Friday night though!! I will only be becoming back on weekdays. Quick tips: if you have a full party of 8 they will seat your party first Also valet is only $2!
12/23/2007,5 star rating,I've decided I will eat here at least once a week in the hopes that one day I will become a proud owner of my very own Pork Belly. And also I feel more Korean after I come here.
6/29/2010,5 star rating,"This is my favorite Korean BBQ!! $17 for All you can eat BBQ and that includes meat, rice, sides, and tea water. The food is top notch, but the best thing about this place is the service...everyone was so friendly and attentive. Keep in mind there is $2 valet to park here unless you can find parking on the street. Also, gets crowded in the evening on Friday and Saturday so wait is long, but you can call in and reserve a table."

7/12/2014,2 star rating,We just finished eating here. We had the all you can eat for 2 and 2 cokes. $45 and it was just ok. The waitresses seem to only regard my husband and almost completely ignore me.
6/30/2010,4 star rating,"Been here three times so this review is long overdue. Twenty dollars straight up should cover you with the tax and tip included. Be in mind that this is ALL YOU CAN EAT. There are many interpretations of what this phrase means. Some believe it means that you should eat to your hearts content. Some, on the other hand, believe that there is some sort of underlying responsibility that comes with the phrase. The purpose is quite subtle really. ""All you can eat"" means that you should eat really all that you can eat. This is the restaurant begging you, or rather pleading with you, to possibly bankrupt them in one night. Why would you not do what they ask when they give you such great food?Examples? During the Spring quarter of 2010, four of my friends ventured out into the Western to satisfy their stomachs. Little did they know that they would make (relatively unknown) history. Their stint lasted five hours. A time so long that the waiters had a shift change (and the waiter that left lost out on the tip). What was consumed was a total of 18 plates. Did they leave happy? No. They were horribly sick, so much so that their hearts felt like they would burst from the mass influx of protein, fat, and cholesterol. We should also be reminded they were dreading the next day. But, they upheld their responsibility to the establishment and as a result, are known as heroes in our group of about 20ish friends. Yep---epik..."
2/10/2011,1 star rating,"Definitely the worst Korean restaurant I have ever been to. Music blasting, noisy, crowded, dirty, poor quality meat, VERY SALTY BANCHAN (side dishes) that taste terrible, expensive all you can eat price is high (you can do much better at Sanya for $9.99 and quality is much better there.) Besides the service is awful and slow. Period.I will never go back to this place again.I don't know how people can give this place good reviews."
12/26/2011,3 star rating,"It seems like I always come here at the wrong time. Then again, I'm not sure if there is ever a ""right"" hour during which to stop by. In my experience, the wait ranges anywhere from 45-60 mins. from 8:00PM - midnight. The valet parking is pretty inexpensive (under 2 bucks), but it is a hassle because the lot is small and there's a good chance there won't be any vacant spots. With that said, you'll have to hunt down a spot on the residential streets, which is no easy feat. The service is ok at best. It's true that they disinfect the grill with grated radish, which is comforting, but in terms of timeliness and attentiveness, this restaurant falls on the lower end of the spectrum. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, however, the outdoor seating is limited to larger parties of 6 or more, and the outdoor ventilation is arguably worse. Hae Jang Chon does offer an unparalleled list of meats, but they fall short in their selection of side dishes. My favorites, though, are the potato salad and the kimchi pancakes. In terms of meats, I'm a fan of the marinated beef short rib and the thick-cut Canadian pork belly. Overall, the freshness of the products is questionable, the wait is long, and the service is ""ok""."

And that's just standing outside the restaurant with its little piggy mascot. M introduced us to this AYCE deliciousness, with its tiny parking lot (valet only, $2). Apparently the wait here is terrible (they open till 2AM) so we hit bbq gold when we showed up at 3PM on a Saturday afternoon to sound of ""party of 3? This way please!""There's dish foods, individual orders, but we were hungry and knew what we wanted- AYCE for $16.99, 19 items total plus some banchan, rice paper and radish slices. They put kimchi on the grill if your table gets crowded along with some delish kimchi pancake they cut up. The meats? You get to pick 4 at a time and the slices are all very thin which is great if you want to try a lot of different flavours. Short rib (marinated/unmarinated), beef brisket, bbq beef (bulgogi), bbq pork, bbq chicken, tripe (honeycomb beef), beef intestine (I guessed), Canadian pork belly (thin or thick sliced), squid, little octopus, beef tongue. (I may have missed one.)The meat quality is pretty good for AYCE, especially for these prices! We had 3 refills of almost everything. They leave you scissors to cut up some of the meats (like chicken, squid, tripe, thick pork belly). They also instruct you to cook unmarinated stuff first and then marinated, since the latter gets your grill dirty quicker. My favourite was the brisket, which wasn't that fatty. The beef tongue would have tasted better on a regular grill instead of the flat stone style one, I think. Did I mention they'll come out with a bowl of white radish shreds and scrub your grill every now and then, like a magical Korean mr. clean? It's just wonderful as you take a break from the omnomnoming to watch them make the grease and charred bits disappear. (We wondered if we devoured some radish shreds, if it'd degrease our tummies. Probably not...)They have alcohol and a bottle of Hite was only $6, soda $1.50. They serve you chilled tea and leave a bottle for refill at the table. Be careful with your cups! All of us had little warped parts on our cups, probably from someone leaving it too close to the grill. They include 4 sauces and a small bowl of salad to go with your meat as well as steamed egg. The egg was a bit flavourless, one of the few bad memories amongst an ocean of delicious ones. The banchan was a bit of a meh as well, not very flavourful and not much variety. After you're done with your meal, they can bring you a Korean version of miso soup (ask for one to share, I'm sure you'll be stuffed like we were) and after cleaning the grill again, make fresh kimchi fried rice. Just enough carbs to top me off like the little piggy I am. Excellent meal for $23 a person, including tip/tax (and a bottle of booze to share), especially with no wait on a saturday. Â Highly recommend if you're willing to brave the wait or come at an odd time like us. Just don't wear anything nice."
10/24/2011,5 star rating,"When I think of Korean BBQ All you an eat, this is the best place I've ever been too. With 19 different choices for meat, a ton of tasty sides, and kimchi fried rice to finish everything off, this is the perfect place to be for a meat fix. I've been here twice and both times, the food was amazing. 1st time, went with just one other friend. 2nd time, went as a party of 5. The only difference is the speed at which things get refilled. Definitely with a bigger party, service was okay. Every time I come to LA, this is the 1st place I go to straight from the airport. It's THAT good."
1/31/2011,4 star rating,16.99 AYCE.The BEST kbbq around. FOR SURE!Great cuts of meat. Plentiful options. Sooo good. Check it out.PS My face is the pork belly. YUM YUM YUM!
7/26/2011,3 star rating,"I had to try this place because of all the rave reviews. I say 3 stars is the most accurate rating for this place ""A-OK""... nothing in particular impressed me, but we had an enjoyable meal. The moment we arrived, there was a wait to be sat, which usually means the restaurant is above par. We waited about half hour then sat at a table with the BBQ grill option. All three of us went with the all-you-can-eat BBQ for $16.99/person (great price). One of the first things I noticed was... $5 extra for sangchu and sesame leaves?!!? Those are usually complimentary with Korean bbq and basically they're overcharging you for leaves :-/. Perhaps $2 upcharge would be plenty.... and compared to places in Flushing, NY or even other BBQ places throughout LA... there aren't many side dish options. I can definitely use at least 2-3 more options on the table for Korean BBQ. Â  We tried the BBQ squid, the marinated galbi, thinly sliced pork belly, and beef brisket. I would like to see a shrimp option on that list but the only seafood options were BBQ squid or baby octopus. I give 5 stars for the pork, it was fantastic. We've all had better galbi... but it was still 3-4 stars ;). I'd go with the baby octopus over the squid and the beef brisket... just be sure not to cook it for too long! It will end up being extremely difficult to chew. I give 2 stars for service :-/ It seemed to me that for every question or request we had, the answer was NO and they were extremely frugal. A true, authentic Korean restaurant never charges extra for rice.... but when we asked for steamed rice, she seemed hesitant because they offer the kimchi fried rice in the end, and we can only have one or the other. When we asked for extra ANYTHING... she quickly insisted that she's only taking ""meat"" order... it was hard to see a smile out of her face once, and we felt we were being chastised like children. The service was really what made the experience less enjoyable.. Summary....Great price on AYCE bbq, decent to good meat, not much variety on side dishes, can improve on service, and frugal with alterations or extra food (side dishes, etc)...."
10/5/2011,5 star rating,"Um, YUM!!!!!!! We were introduced to this place by a friend who lives in LA...and who also happens to be Korean and let me tell you - this place is AWESOME.First off, it's not that expensive! We paid $21 each for the all you can eat (after taxes & tip) and I think we most definitely ate our money's worth. Tons of delicious sides, and they just keep the meat coming. Secondly, it's GOOD. We stuck with the bulgolgi (marinated & non) and the galbi, and all the meat we ate was sooo yummy. They also have that thinly sliced rice paper thing that you can wrap around your meat - SO. GOOD.And if that wasn't good enough, they make kimchi fried rice at the end. I nearly died & went to food heaven. This. Was. DELICIOUS. This is also served with the bean paste soup (which I thought was just okay - really salty). But let's focus on the kimchi fried rice again. SO GOOD.Plus, I really like how they clean your grilling plate with shredded radish. GENIUS! Will definitely be back again."
2/16/2015,4 star rating,Absolutely amazing went for lunch they forgot our rice but brought over a Kimchi pancake that was fabulous. Was able to really expand my palate as well as waistline with the All You Can Eat.
5/7/2012,4 star rating,"I have been turned off by the wait for this place at least... three times. The first time was my fault because I came with a group of 15 people at 7pm on a Friday night (ha), but the other times were because I didn't know... the secret.What is... the secret?Being crazy enough to brave traffic AT RUSH HOUR to blaze a trail straight to the restaurant. Seriously. If you get there before 7pm on weekdays, the wait is nonexistent or minimal. And as a person who abhors waiting, I will gladly deal with Wilshire traffic if it means I get to stuff tasty pickled vegetables and meat in my mouth until I pass out.With that said, the quality of the meat is decent for AYCE--a little over $20 for the deal, tax + tip. I've never had issues with the service staff being rude or unfriendly--in fact, they've always been direct and timely. Then again, I'm very proactive about the button on the table to get waitstaff attention (best part of Korean restaurants!) so I don't have an issue. The sides are pretty standard--kimchi, pickled radishes, spicy pickled bamboo, rice 'crepes' and sesame oil bean sprouts. I like the fact that the grill is flat, because the meat gets to cook in its own oil and is more flavorful because of it. I also like watching them clean the gristle off from the marinated meat with radishes... but maybe that's because I find random things like that entertaining?Save room for the kimchi fried rice at the end, and the bean paste soup, both of which are extremely good. The kalbi cut here is pretty unimpressive, and the bulgogi marinade is simple... but I still think that the quality of the meat and the amount of selections make this place a little better than the rest of the AYCE KBBQ restaurants in my book. And hey, if you don't come early, you can always snack on some KyoChon chicken while you wait, right? Also, I've never been forced to use their valet parking and have always found a spot in the surrounding neighborhoods. I don't know whether that's dumb luck or sheer determination..."
9/1/2009,4 star rating,"WoW! Â You got to RESPECT a Korean BBQ place that has HOT DOGS on the menu! Â We came her for my birthday a few months ago and I think we pissed the waiter off. Â At an all-you-can-eat KBBQ, we're so used to seeing bulgolgi, short ribs, bbq chicken, etc... BUT HOT DOGS??? Are you Â frickin kidding me? Â We were so amazed that this simple item was on the all-you-can-eat menu, that we kept askin for it the whole night! Â The waiter was gettin pissed because as soon as he brought them to the grill, we kept sayin ""we're gonna need some more of those dogs!"" Â Oh well... we did leave him a nice tip.I will definitely come back to this place. You know why? Â THE ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT HOT DOGS ARE BOMB! Â Oh.. and the Kim Chi is served warm! (Seriously)"
6/1/2011,4 star rating,"Make reservation !!!It's a small place, people take too long to eat, and there's a lot of people who want to eat here.Make reservation !!!I came with my friends for an early dinner on a saturday afternoon (6pm). It was a small complex with valet only parking. It was a complimentary valet but 2$ goes a long way with karma.Because we made reservation, we only had to wait for 10 minutes while we got our table prepared. At 6pm, I already saw a group of patrons waiting for their table.It's a small restaurant. Too small for an AYCE. But because of the small place, the service was very fast, and responsive.On the table, there's your typical AYCE side dishes. Although the selection is not as many as Shik Do Rak, I was satisfied with the 4 type of dipping sauces that was being offered. It was interesting how they use the stone grill instead of the metal grill for cooking the meat. But don't forget to ask for the oil drip pan because they forgot to put on one of the grill and when they cleaned it, the water drip and got all over the table (-1 for this).19 items for 16.99 !!! It's certainly the best value AYCE. Gotta love their beef tongue, brisket, short ribs, pork belly, and pork shoulder. Their steam egg and kimchi pancake were a good intermezzo in between the meals.They give a generous portion of the meat with good thick cuts. Let's just say that every bite was as satisfying as the next. Overall, it was a delicious selection of meats, very attentive and fast service. Would definitely come back again with the wife.Just make sure to make reservation !!!"

4/11/2015,5 star rating,It was my first time visiting an authentic Korean BBQ joint and it did not disappoint. The meat was fresh and the servers willingly cooked the meat for us. I would recommend this restaurant for average priced AYCE and for my future outgoings.
10/19/2010,5 star rating,"I've had Korean BBQ at many places, SF, SLC, NYC, Philly, but this place hands down has the best meat for the money. 16.99 for all you can eat high quality meat is ridiculous. There were only 4 sides which is a little sparse but you also get soup, kimchi fried rice and the boiled egg dish. You'll be full for sure and probably exploding! The wait however is ridiculous. We had reservations and still ended up waiting for 30 minutes. In the end it was definitely worth the wait. Warning: No real vegetarian options. They will make a veg Bibimbo, but it's literally just rice and a mix of their sides."
3/14/2011,4 star rating,"I've tried a few all you can eat korean bbq places and this is one of my favorites.It says a lot when I am willing to come her with just 1 other person and not a group of 4 (whatever, I'm a fatty)I like this place the most because it comes with extra sides other places won't give you like kim chi pan cakes, fried rice and soup ON top of your all you can eat meal!I wouldn't say any of the meats are exceptional. I don't like their chicken. I think I just enjoy all the sides and dipping sauces.Services is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are really attentive and sometimes they are not. I totally believe this is based on where you get seated. You get the best service in the middle part of the restaurant."
6/20/2011,2 star rating,"Sadly, being starving and having an intense KBBQ craving only made this dining experience more disappointing...Pros: -The food was pretty good overall, but nothing special. We enjoyed the pork and beef..Cons: -They always seem to be super packed and understaffed so be prepared for at least a 30min wait-Apparently they give you kimchi fried rice last which I had to clarify several times with them (we never got any rice, they may wanna add ""upon request"" to their menu)-Towards the end of our meal, a refill of daikon came with what looked like a green leaf bug sitting atop the pile. YES. It was alive and feasting on our radish!!!! The waiter was apologetic but our appetites were basically unsalvagable at this point o.0Sorry, but just could NOT recommend :("
8/22/2011,4 star rating,"This place is not the type of place where you take your parents to go eat Korean BBQ. It is definitely geared toward the younger crowed with ear popping K-pop blaring through the speakers. But with enough Hite and Soju who cares!This place has quality Korean BBQ and its AYCE so the price is amazing.Their Banchan (side dishes) are acceptable but not the greatest. The service is good, cause of course they have that button. All in all this place is perfect for you and a group of friends to eat your heart out and drink. While listening to some fun K-Pop music. Plus for those non koreans its super accommodating, everything is in english and is explained. mmm Hite and korean BBQ droool."
1/1/2012,4 star rating,"Came here for my 23rd birthday dinner with some friends and it was delicious! We made a reservation in advance and ended up only waiting an hour for seats whereas some others had been waiting 2-3. The establishment is in a small strip mall and is itself small and crowded. Valet parking is your easiest option, but if you care about your car, park it yourself nearby... I saw them do some VERY close maneuvering with the cars that made my heart jump a few times. This place uses stone grill which I find is different from the other Kbbq places I've been to. It may just be in my head, but prefer the stone grill over the metal. Now to the food! For 17 bucks, you get I believe 19 options to choose from, though when I went, we only opted for 5: Brisket, Bulgogi, Short Rib, Beef Tongue, and Kimchi Fried Rice. The brisket is nice and fatty, cooks fast and had plenty of flavor, especially when paired with the brisket sauce. The short rib, you can get either marinated or not marinated, is tasty, but a bit chewy. My highlights were the Beef Tongue and Bulgogi. I found the tongue paired well with brisket sauce and best when not overcooked. The bulgogi was well marinated and was not overpowering in its distinct flavors. It was slightly sweet and extremely juicy. The kimchi fried rice is always a friendly welcome, but isn't extraordinary. The banchan is also not bad, though the apples in the potato salad were a surprise to me.Service is good given how busy they are all the time and the amount of work before them. The servers respond in a timely manner and provide you with whatever you need most of the time. They understandably forget sometimes when you are trying to get 10 things at once and must be repeated. If I were to rank it amongst other kbbq places I've been to, it would compare to the likes of Star BBQ, Road to Seoul in Ktown. It is a step above Tahoe, Go goo Ryeo, and Cham sut Gol. It is second only to my favorite AYCE kbbq restaurant in Newport Beach called Corea Kalbi. Pros:-Delicious meats and well marinated-Service, even when busy, tries to accommodate everyone in a timely manner-Bang for your buck is very reasonable!Cons:-Tiny parking lot-LONG waits are a guarantee -crowded restaurant, very loudNotes/Advice when coming here:-You will most likely smell of smoky kbbq until you shower down. The ventilation isn't the greatest here.-Parking is horrible! If you don't care much about your car, it costs 2 dollars to valet park it. If you are nervous about others dinging your car, park it yourself nearby on the meters and side streets.  -If you do self park on a meter, be prepared for potentially LONG waits (would be cheaper to valet in this case)-Get reservations in advance! It does (seem to) help.-Most importantly, Bon apetit!"

4/16/2011,3 star rating,"I had such high expectations for this place and it's just alright.The stone pot thing in place of a grill... I don't like it. It takes a bit longer than an actual grill, which I don't like. The thin sliced pork belly was pretty good until I was chewing and just chewed something hard and almost broke my tooth like... 4 times. That kinda grossed me out and made the rest of my meal hard to eat. :( That didn't happen with the brisket, though. It was pretty good! I like that they're not stingy with the rice paper. At other places, they just tell you they run out.... how the fuck do you run out of rice paper? Really? The service was good compared to other places in ktown. The waitress dropped the egg soup (not on me, but on the floor. thank god) but cleaned it up and apologized profusely. It didn't bother me or my lunch mates at all.AND they clean the stone pot all legit with the radish stuff. It's pretty fun to watch and the method leaves the grill squeaky clean (:I wanted to get the kimchi fried rice but I was just way too full. Leave some room in your belly to try that stuff.I don't know if I'd come back to this place, as I found a cheaper place that I think is a lot better and closer to my home. tl;dr: stone pot takes forever to cook meat, be careful chewing the thin pork belly even though it's yummy, good with rice paper, clumsy but nice and cute waitress, waiters clean the grill like pros, kimchi fried riceps: they offer hot dogs as a meat choice... interesting."
5/12/2011,3 star rating,"I think there is a reason why this place is filled with non-Koreans. Â Meat was strictly mediocre. Â Side dishes were few and unexceptional. Â Okay, let me backtrack.I went here on a Friday afternoon with the boyfriend. Â There were about 7-8 tables empty but they refused to sit us. Â We understood since there were only two of us and I get that they want to take parties that are larger. Â So we waited and waited. Â After about 40 minutes, they finally said that they were ready for us and sat us in the corner. Â We were getting comfortable (taking our jacket off, etc) when the waiter (who has been talking to this woman who looked like owner/manager) said that we had to get up. Â He said that there has been a mistake and that he couldn't seat us because the table was already reserved (FYI, said table remained unoccupied long after that). Â It was kind of embarrassing but we scrambled for our things and got back up and went back to join the crowd of others still waiting for a table.Another 30 minutes and we finally got a table. Â I really think that the waiter who took us to our first table lobbied for us because he felt bad. Â Otherwise, I'm sure we would have waited longer because while we were waiting, a lady came in, told the maitre d' that she had a reservation and was told that even with the reservation, she'd have to wait an hour. Â The lady asked, ""what's the point of a reservation?"" but the Maitre d' replied, ""others are waiting 2 hours"" the lady just gave up and went out. Â When we heard that, we seriously considered going next door to Kyochon but we persevered since we invested more than an hour already. Â Let me just say this. Â Although I was completely unimpressed with the food and the wait was horrible (it was made worse because some tables were just left unfilled while people were lining up outside), the servers were stellar, especially for an Asian restaurant. Â They were attentive, kept asking us what meat we would like to have next, friendly, and most importantly, we got what we asked for usually after the first time. Â Seriously, food was just so so (especially the fried rice which had a strange after taste-though boyfriend couldn't taste it but I do have a more discerning palette LOL) but the service staff made up for that. Â Unfortunately, I still don't think that I'd be coming back here with the abundance of AYCE KBBQ in K-town."
5/30/2011,5 star rating,"Another restaurant that I wish was located in Northern California. For the price you pay, the quality of the food that they offer is unheard of. There are so many choices of mouth watering meats. Only thing bad about this place is the wait. Something you have to expect when your dealing with excellence. I know that some Asian places have bad customer service. However these stars are solely for the taste of the food, and the price they charge for it."

Parking around here is terrible (as you can imagine), but they do have valet parking for $2 (don't forget to tip these hard working guys saving you the hassle of finding parking).

10/27/2014,5 star rating,"Great ayce Korean bbq. The pork belly and fried Kimchi. Is amazing. I love the fact they use a slanted stone grill. The meat on a stone grill cooks way better than on the open steel grills. Â It's definitely better than Honey Pig. But beware the place is packed and you have about a 30 min to an 1 hour wait any time after 6pm. Let alone the parking lot gets full. So I recommend going early. But If you end up going and waiting, go next door and have some drinks after you signed in."
8/30/2010,4 star rating,"After a summer in Asia eating small portions of tasty food, the one thing I missed was gorging myself with FATTY, DELICIOUS KOREAN BBQ. After my flight landed at 10pm, the hubby and I trekked to this place to fulfill our KBBQ cravings and alleviate a bit of jetlag. Even at midnight, the service was on point and super friendly! We got to eat a bit of everything. I loved the texture of the marinated beef rib but I thought the beef brisket was a bit dry. Pork belly was good. We even had an order of Honeycomb, which ended up being tripe!The great thing about this place are the hours. You can have your KBBQ until 2am. I like to point out that I didn't get the Kimchi Fried Rice at the end, but how can anybody save room for that thing?! That's beyond gluttony!"
10/11/2011,5 star rating,"Its refreshing to give a 5 star review..it doesnt come up very often =)HJCK BBQ does it all. Food quality, decor, service, and price. You knock those out of the park and its a home run for me.Being our 1st time in Ktown (LA), we had high hopes from our seasoned LA friends. We were not disappointed. Right away we were impressed by the cleanliness, nice decor, and fancy stone grills with its own oil catchers. We were also pleased with the speediness of the service, the attentiveness of the staff, and how efficient they are in cleaning the grills for you as well as cooking the meat for you when they think its about to burn.The choices of meat are extensive as well as side dishes. Fun things like pork belly, beef tongue, and other things I have no idea about (Beef Arboteum?) give you a lot of variety and your tastebuds never get bored. Combine that with the 4 sauces, wraps, and nice directions to help you mix and match, its a meal that you will never get bored with. Not only that: the quality of all the food is topnotch and that is something you can taste!To wrap it all up (no pun intended), all this positive comes out to be $16.99! Now that my friends is a very full, happy camper =)"

Â I'm so glad my friend took me here and brought me into the light! Sure, it's almost $20/ person AYCE and the wait is long...but THE AMAZING VARIETY & QUALITY of meat! Tired of choosing from three to four types of meat? Then chose one of the other 13 here!! They give you FOUR different sauces. The side dishes are decent. Â Coming with the AYCE you get kimchee fried rice at the end!! (Seriously, don't miss out on it no matter how full you think you are!) The service here is consistent. I also wanted to note how the food is cooked on a marble slab instead of a grill. Â I don't know if it does anything to the flavor but it's way cooler [: This is definitely one of the best KBBQ places. Â I now tend to scale other KBBQ places against this place haha."

My friend and I thought we could make it to an all you can eat $10 deal Next to Castle BBQ but the girl on the phone wasnt specific as to what time last walk-ins are so they closed us off when we got there.

Waited another 15min to get seated (this was around 10:30pm).So our first order was Briskets and Pork Belly(thin slice). Cooked the Briskets first cause thats how we roll and by god! Best meat around town! Hands down this beats Moodaepo's $25 Menu!(but not Moodaepo's hip ambiance). If ive ever tasted quality meat this is the only place ive tasted it! Now the pork belly.... *mouth is already watering thinking of how to describe it* ... *thinks the mouth watering description already describes it* ...

1/14/2014,4 star rating,Gonna miss Korean BBQ after leaving LALA land... beef tongue was the best. Cast iron pans in the middle of the table was pretty sweet. Def got to know my LA bachelor pad roommate better... made me wish I studied abroad in Hong Kong. Told people all day today that it wasn't all you can eat... checked out the receipt and that's exactly what it was. Woops. Still solid even though all you can eat brings back memories of Old Country Buffet. Unlimited soft-serve ice cream... I'm getting sidetracked. There was a buzzer at the end of the table kind of like a flight attendant call button. AWESOME
4/25/2010,5 star rating,"Omg one of the best KBBQ places I been to. under 20 bucks AYCE, that's including Kimchi pancake and Kimchi fried rice! Our waitress was extremely attentive and gave us good amount of meat. The parking is 2 dollar valet and when we got there we had to wait for about 40 min. The wait was worth it and I'll go there again! ;pMake sure wear something casual or you will smell like BBQ all over!++ for stone grill instead of regular grill"
9/22/2010,4 star rating,"I REALLY wanted to hate this place and give it 1-star. #1: Los Angeles traffic. #2. Why would I have to wait 30+ minutes for Kbbq? There are hundreds of these joints in L.A.. But I absolutely loved this place!L.A. traffic: On the way here, we witnessed a horrendous car-accident right before our eyes involving 3 cars, a head-on collision, and a fire hydrant. Drivers in L.A. are just stupid.The plaza is very small and crowded but the valet was awesome. Pretty cheap at $2 + tip.The brisket, marinated short rib, and honeycomb tripe were incredible. So fresh and delicious! You can freakin' taste the freshness.On the other hand, my table did not like the kimchi. We were also only allowed one steamed-egg per person which sucked (and was also bland compared to my preferred kbbq spot).The staff was remarkable. They were very courteous, cleaned our grill, refilled our drinks/side dishes, and remembered our [very complex] requests. And they were ridiculously quick with everything!Did I like it here? HELL YES!! Would I come here again? Only if I didn't have to drive.(To kbbq fanatics, check out Incheonwon BBQ House in Garden Grove and tell me which you like better)"
5/15/2017,5 star rating,First time ever eating Korean BBQ and it was delicious!! Definitely recommend my favorite was the brisket!! Â Great for a large group...can't wait to come back it's soo goooood

8/11/2012,4 star rating,Place was great. It was our first time trying Korean BBQ and this was a perfect place to experiment. Only downfall is that we waited about 40 minutes and we were really hungry at midnight. I told the waiters that it was our first time and they gave us wonderful meat suggestions n spice. Seriously that thin pork belly and beef short ribs is awesome.
3/22/2015,5 star rating,"Outstanding! The food was outstanding, the service was outstanding, even the valet parking was great! Took my wife for her birthday last Saturday. We got there around 3pm and had a 10 min wait. While we were there it got even busier but the service staff is very friendly and attentive. We are already planning our next visit with the entire family"
1/23/2013,3 star rating,"Come here to satisfy your AYCE Korean BBQ cravings, for just $17.99!The restaurant is clean and the service is great (extra refills of ban-chan, quick service and they do a nice job of cleaning up the stone grills). Complete with Kimchee Pancakes, Egg Soup and bottomless meat, I was not disappointed with this place. Oh, and don't forget the kimchee fried rice they prepare for your right on the grill-- MONEY!"
12/2/2012,3 star rating,"Came here last night after being turned away from O O Kook because they didn't serve new customers after 11pm.I have to say this place would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the method of cooking the KOrean BBQ. It should be said that the meat NEEDS to touch flame for it to be real BBQ. Â Cooking it on a marble platter is worse than cooking it at home on my stove top.It's really unfortunate too because this place got everything else right. The AYCE items were really good, especially the kimchi pancake. Â The selection and quality of side dishes were the best I had ever tasted.Even though the short ribs weren't the best quality meat the marinades were delicious. And for under $18 a person that's a steal of a deal.So I am still in search of a good AYCE Korean BBQ that serves the quality of OO Kook meats and the side dishes like this place on charcoal flame grill. That would be the perfect place."
5/11/2017,5 star rating,"I love K food. It's easy to see why this place is the numero uno choice in Yelp for Korean food ayce. The galbi and bulgogi are bomb and the price is reasonable. Word of warning though: the kimchi rice, and it's really good, comes last when you're all stuffed and ready to go into food coma so be warned."
5/11/2017,4 star rating,"Had a nice experience here! The food was great and he staff were friendly and patient, particularly our waiter who helped us grill and didnt rush us despite the long wait outside. Never got his name, but he had a deep and expressive voice. The only things that kind of turned me off was 1) one of the waitresses/servers who was in maybe mid thirties/fourties openly picked her teeth with her fingers(didnt even try to make an effort to go to the back or use a toothpick) and then proceeded to bring food to customers or help them grill. That was shocking. 2)another waiter, young man, coughed into his palm and then proceeded to bring food to customers without washing his hand. Again, he did this on the open floor. Didnt even have a care in the world. Maybe it's a Korean thing?? But to westerners, its a complete turn off. Despite these two things, I could see myself returning but probably eat my food with caution or watch keenly if any of my servers are being unapologetically unsanitary."
3/19/2017,2 star rating,"Honestly, I had really high expectations of this place due to the good reviews. However, everything in my opinion was just sub-par. We tried the brisket, thick pork belly, marinated short ribs, beef tongue, octopus, and intestines. The brisket and beef tongue were the best in my opinion, but nothing to really rave about. The first couple of bites were good, however because the servers literally dump the whole order onto the stone grill, most pieces became burnt and chewy before we were able to eat it. The marinated short ribs and pork belly were both so tough that it was similar to eating cardboard. I also had high hopes for the kimchi fried rice at the end, but unfortunately it was also a let down. There really wasn't much flavor. The two stars are for the service and the octopus (which my boyfriend enjoyed and said was the best part of the whole meal). I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think that I will be coming back."
9/5/2014,5 star rating,This place was amazing it was so good and I love the all you can eat. The parking lot was a mess but the staff was very friendly. Definitely a place to visit when you're in Korea town
9/4/2012,4 star rating,"Place is really good except for the wait. They were remodeling when I last went and they said over an hour... after an hour the list didn't move and they weren't crowded at all. Did they have some type of fire code violation?Other than this mishap, this is my fav. place to go for ayce kbbq. I really like the thin sliced pork belly! Enjoy!"
7/23/2014,5 star rating,"My first love. No seriously, I used to take 40 min bus rides from UCLA and wait 1hr+ to eat here. It's THAT good. I would bus home smelling like korean BBQ and have no regrets. Service is great, price is great, meat quality is great. Avoid coming here Thursday-Saturday nights because the wait will be close to 2 hours. You can always go next door and get a pitcher of Hite with your friends, which makes the time go by faster. Otherwise, prepare for the long wait. Oh and prepare to hear the Happy Birthday song they play like at least 5x while you eat."
1/16/2015,3 star rating,The food was good but not great. Â Only come here if you seriously love to eat otherwise you will not get your money's worth. I would give it a higher rating if the food was tastier. Â I think I prefer the traditional grill since it gives the meat (and the diners) a smokey flavor.
9/10/2013,5 star rating,Seriously the best Korean BBQ I've ever had. The drive for me is pretty far but so worth it. The rice paper is like wonderful and not cold and hard like some other places I've been too. The grill change is pretty cool here too. I had such a great experience here I would definitely come back whenever I'm in LA!
3/12/2017,5 star rating,Celebrated my birthday last night with family and friends and the kalbi and kimchi fried rice were delicious! Â We made reservations for 6 and we were quickly seated. Will come back again.
2/14/2016,4 star rating,"I came to this restaurant at 12AM on a Thursday because it was one of the only ones open in Koreatown. They are open until 2AM even on weekdays which is great for the late night people. As soon as we got there, It was pretty crowded for a Thursday evening but the wait for 2 people was only about 5 minutes. We sat down and there were sides ready for us such as bean sprouts, kimchi, and potato salad. I'm usually a big fan of potato salad but it tasted as if it were sitting out for a while. I did overhear one of the waiters say ""we're all about the meat here,"" but I believe their sides should compliment the main courses. For the first course of meat that we ordered, we got the Black Angus Beef Brisket, Marinated Beef Short Rib, BBQ Beef(Bulgogi), and the Shrimp which were all brought on one plate. The slices of Brisket that we received had a good ratio of meat to fat (about 80/20). You cook your food on some sort of stone grill in the middle of the table. The brisket was my favorite of the 4 because it was tender and didn't take too long to cook. I overcooked some of the brisket and it still tasted great because it added a different crunchy texture to the beef. The Marinated Beef Short Rib was the next best plate that we ordered. It had a good amount of marbleization and had a sweet flavor to it because of the cut. The shrimp came with the shell on and cooked in about 2 to 3 minutes. It was juicy and flavorful despite the fact that it wasn't even seasoned. The meat that I did not like at all was the BBQ Beef (Bulgogi). The seasoning or marinade they had on the meat didn't really compliment the meat at all. Most Bulgogi that I have had in the past had a kind of sweet taste to it.The service was great and they even have a button on the table to call for a waiter to come by to your table. I rated the restaurant 4 stars instead of giving it the full 5 because of the BBQ Beef (Bulgogi). But Overall, one of the ideal All you can eat Korean BBQ restaurants in the Los Angeles area."
1/12/2017,4 star rating,"Second time to this establishment, and if the lines weren't so long, I'd probably be here more! Came for dinner both times and it's $23.99 per person with unlimited everything! They will come and fill your sauces, refill rice and side dishes as long as you let them know you want more! The staff is great and they honestly seat you according to when you get there. I went once with a party of 3 and once with a party of 2, and they seated us at tables that could seat 5 or 6. Lucky for us, super spacious and more room for all the food! I've tried almost every meat on the menu, and my favorites are the beef tongue, beef brisket, bulgogi, short ribs and teriyaki chicken! (Yes, there's a LOT more to choose from!) The staff is awesome, and I think they know even if it is 'cook your own', they come and cook for you! This is great, being that I am a terrible cook... Make sure you sign in as soon as you get there, valet parking only ($2) and they do take reservations but I've never tried. I'll be back for a third shot and hopefully there'll be less of a wait!"
6/12/2015,4 star rating,"I would have given it 5 stars but the line was terrible. Â We waited 90 minutes to be seated. Â Once we got in, everything was great. Â The atmosphere was good, the plates of meat came out at a pretty good clip and the side dishes were tasty. Â It is priced in the middle at $20 per head for AYCE. Â Reservations are available for parties of six or larger so we will definitely go that route next time."
1/10/2015,5 star rating,"Really good! So many kinds of meat including belly, beef tongue, spicy bbq chicken, etc. the bean paste soup and fried rice are also so delicious!"
1/9/2015,4 star rating,"My first time to try Korean barbecue and it turned out pretty good. Love the brisket, thin sliced pork belly, pork shoulder and short ribs. The service is not bad. I like the sides too. Definitely will come again. $22 per person for eat all you can is definitely worth it."
1/9/2013,4 star rating,"One definite ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BBQ place to go! Â It was my first time coming here and I was very satisfied. Â The waitresses are all polite and welcomed to serve my table. Â They kept coming to my table to help us grill and get our needs. Â What makes it different from other All You Can Eat BBQ restaurants is: -They both have thin and thick slices of pork belly, which I love the most. -They serve pickled radish wrap and rice cake wrap.-They have four different dipping sauces for the meat.-They make the Kimchi fried rice on the grill at the end of your meal.-They have squid and baby octopus."
1/9/2015,5 star rating,"The food was awesome, and the service was okay. That is expected since it was slammed, I was a server and I know it gets crazy. They food was amazing, love how thin the slices of meat were. My favorites are the beef tongue, brisket, marinated short ribs, and the kimchi pancakes. They give you kimchi fried rice in the end as well. Make sure to take anything valuable from you car. The valet took my gf change purse which had $5 in quarters in it, and it cost $2 to valet. Didn't notice the missing change purse until a few days later, so make sure you have $2 for valet after, and before going to take belongings out of your car."
7/17/2012,5 star rating,"I LOVE AYCE KBBQ! Â Ok let me rephrase that, I AM ADDICTED TO KBBQ!!!!I can't believe these LA AYCE joints with their price points. How is this even possible?!!?The variety of meat here are all great. Â I ordered my typical beef short rib (marinated or non-marinated), sliced brisket, and pork belly. Â I love how you have the option of thick or thin pork belly, Â The only meat I didn't like was the pork shoulder..they were cut in these little small, thick pieces. Eh. Â I didn't try the beef tongue but I have a friend swear that it's a tender version of beef slices. Â Maybe I'll try it next time...maybe not.I saw hot dog as an option too. Â I guess that makes it kid-friendly? I didn't bother to try that either.The banchan was the normal deal, nothing that I remembered that stood out but it was all good.The AYCE comes with Korean pancake, steamed egg, and bean paste soup. Â I really liked how we cooked our food on this giant stone grill. Â We had kim chi fried rice at the end of dinner (I call it my Korean dessert). Â We accidentally Â left it on too long and we had kim chi bibambap which was a nice surprise. My favorite thing about this place was the service! Â I couldn't believe how we didn't have to ask for a single thing because they were on-point with refilling everything! Â We didn't even ask for the check when we were ready. Â One look and a nod back, was all they needed to bring us the check. Â We didn't even have to use the buzzer once. Â I found that amazing for not only Asian restaurant standards but for AYCE! Â And $17.99 AYCE! Â Madness I tell ya. Â Madness."
1/5/2017,4 star rating,Not the biggest selection and there is always at least an hour wait but the meat and the type of grill make it worth it.
3/3/2015,3 star rating,"I just can't seem to find the perfect KBBQ spot. A place with all the good sides and no limits, a place with the right amount of options for the right place, a place with a great atmosphere and good service. It may be a mythical place. For me the search continues, however this place is fine. It didn't do what I wanted it to but it was still decent."
8/19/2012,4 star rating,"The wait is a bit long if you don't have a reservation. If coming as a big group, make sure everyone gets there on time or you will end up losing your reservation and have to wait for at least 45 mins. All the meat was extremely yummy!!!!! Usually I would expect to wait forever to get serviced during the busy hour, but not here. The meat came out pretty quick every time we place another order. They are also very helpful with the cooking and cleaning of the grill. The only thing I can think of as being a negative is the restroom area. The tiny hallway has been made into a storage area. Only one stall so line forms quickly. So while waiting in line I felt very uncomfortable being squeezed in between a sticky wall and boxes. Will try to come back again the next time I'm in SoCal."
2/1/2014,4 star rating,"Great service, tons of meat options, don't forget the steamed egg or soybean paste soup or tofu soup that comes with the AYCE, and definitely don't miss out on the awesome fried rice concoction they make at the end of the meal, hits the spot every time! Only con is the crazy wait time always! Either way, one of the better quality and better service AYCE establishments that's worth the wait."
1/3/2015,4 star rating,Much better service ... dont get steam Â rice .. wait till u done ordering meat then get Kimchi FR and soup
5/2/2013,1 star rating,Been here many time cause cheap n food is good. Bad service n u will be skip if all your party is not here at the same time. They skip us n make us wait another hour on top of an hour that we have been waiting. Ofcourse my bro arrived 5 min after they skip us.
4/21/2010,4 star rating,One of the best Korean BBQ places I have been to in LA! Â It's all you can eat & they offer great quality meat. Â Sides are great and the Kimchi/Seaweed rice at the end is really great! Â Staff is awesome and really quick. Place provides a great atmosphere. Â Cost is like $16.99 pp which is outstanding. Plus $2 valet parking is great!!!!
10/6/2010,5 star rating,"Wow.... Â I'm not a fan of AYCE but this place is the best AYCE I've been to in ktown. Â The quality of the meat along the the service was quite fair for the price you pay (~$20). Â  We tried the brisket, short rib marinated, short rib plain, chicken, squid and let's just say we loved the short rib marinated. Â  Â  The wait is super long (1 hour) and they had an ""A"" cleanness rating. Â Highly, highly recommended"
12/29/2010,4 star rating,"Finally had the chance to check out this place and see what all the rave was about. It's a pretty good place for korean bbq. It's $16.99 for AYCE with a big list of different types of meats you can choose from. My favorite as with many korean bbq places is the bulgogi. Very tasty, juicy, and full of flavor. I also like the brisket and the short ribs. I tried a few others but they were nothing to go crazy about. Also another bonus is the kim chi fried rice that they cook in front of you. That was something very new and different to me (in a good way). The service here is pretty good although they could be faster but overall its a good korean bbq place and I would go there again."
10/2/2011,5 star rating,"I went to this place on a Saturday night after a concert with my aunts and a friend. Â Let me say, this place is soooo good!! I was wondering that the place must be awesome for my aunts to want to drive here to eat. Â This place totally met my expectations! Â I don't really remember exactly what we got, but I remember we got the Korean BBQ, bulgogi, and the brisket. Â They were all so good. Â And the kimchi rice they give at the end was awesome! Â Oh, and the pancakes and potato thing were so good. Â The service was very good, and the food was all so good. Â I'm getting hungry just thinking about the food right now. Â I will definitely wanting to be coming back soon."
11/25/2011,4 star rating,"the food was good, i had bulgogi and i liked it. however the wait was ridiculous....i'd prob go there again for a late night munchies but i'd think twice before i go just coz im not sure i can wait that long lolthe side dishes were good, but again, i rather have my food!"
12/4/2011,2 star rating,"The wait sucks on a Sunday night, especially after 6. You can't make reservations till after you get here. The food is average but the crowd is interestingly diverse for sure. The larger the party, the longer the wait. I'd say that if you really want some Korean BBQ, call different places in k town first for wait time before you waste time waiting for a table...unless you're not going to be hungry for an hour..."
7/5/2012,4 star rating,"Definitely good, but rather pricey. Always a line out the door. If you make a reservation, make sure everybody in your party is there before being seated (but even then, that doesn't mean you can get it. They still have to clean up the tables and set up the side dishes) If I had written this review two years ago, I would have given it five stars, but I I've gone here way too much and like it said, it gets pricey. You start to look for cheaper alternatives in the area after a while. Foodwise, you can't go wrong with anything on the-all-you can-eat option (which I always get lol) Make sure to finish everything you order or you'll be charged for it! I recommend trying the beef tongue rather than the normal slices of brisket since it's not as dry when cooked, as well as the thick-sliced pork belly!"
7/4/2012,4 star rating,"Tried this place out for AYCE during lunch time. For 17.99 you get panchan (veggies, potato salad, radish, kimchee, bean sprouts, fish cakes), kimchee pancake, steamed egg, all you can eat meat, salad, kimchee fried rice, and some kind of bean soup which we did not try. plus rice wraps, radish for wrapping your meat, and 4 sauces. (dinner price the same for AYCE)For meats we tried beef brisket, marinated kalbi, bulgogi, and small octopus. The bulgogi was NOT good! I would highly recommend NOT ordering it. Unfortunately that's the meat they gave us the most of. Everything else was tasty. What stood out most about this place was the GREAT service, cooking on a hot stone, and the kimchee fried rice you get at the end! I was so full and wished I could take it home. Save some room for it cuz it is delicious! Overall not my favorite Korean BBQ place in terms of the meat, but the service was better than any other place I've been to. It was also clean, felt well ventilated and wasn't too loud. The waiters also spoke good English which is great for us non- Korean folk. There is valet parking in the lot but we found free street parking a block away."
6/26/2012,5 star rating,"The AYCE KBBQ joints in LA put the ones up in SF to shame. Â And Hae Jang Chon is just another example of an excellent KBBQ joint that knows what it's doing. Â And they do it so well.It's $17.99 for AYCE KBBQ. Â You get 19 different items, including brisket (the best cut, in my opinion), kalbi, pork belly, bulgogi, hot dog (lol), squid, and a bunch of other cuts of meat that I can't remember. Â The cooking platform is a large round stone, which the wait staff nicely cleans up after every few rounds. Â They come by with a giant bunch of thinly sliced daikon, and they use the daikon and vinegar to clean the platform. Pretty cool! Â In addition to the delicious meats, you also get many, many sides, like in all good Korean restaurants. Â These include the steamed egg, spinach, bean curd/tofu, potato salad, and more! Â At the end of your meal, they also cook kimchi fried rice on that stone platform - you should wait for it to cook a while and then eat it when it's crispy on the bottom. Â Mmm mmm! This place is SO legit, I loved it. Â I did notice that the wait can be kind of long during the weekend, but if you're a large party of 6+, then you can make a reservation and cut down your wait time. Â Do that. Â But even if you don't go in a group, it's well worth the wait."
6/25/2012,3 star rating,"I was so excited to come here after seeing 4 stars with over a thousand reviews on Yelp. I brought my dad and sister for their combined birthdays since it's only 4 days apart. The experience was pretty disappointing.I tried to make a reservation for Sunday at 6:30 and was told they don't accept reservations for less than 8 people. We ended up having to wait 45 minutes for a table.The restaurant doesn't has a metal grill like most places. It's this round stone with a small hole for the drippings to run off. They don't wash it but clean it with shredded radish and water in between. The stone does give some added flavor especially to the pork belly.The meat quality is average. The marinade doesn't taste much like anything. Their kalbi are in tiny uneven little cubes. Overall the meat dishes left a lot to be desired.The service was great. Our waiter was really nice. I also like that they give you kimchi pancake, steamed eggs and then kimchi fried rice at the end. I also love their fish cake and kimchi. The kimchi is nice and sour. I grilled my kimchi on the grill and it was delicious. Other side dishes are just average. I didn't care for the potato salad.Ventilation was really poor. We smelled of Korean BBQ more than with other restaurants. I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon."
6/25/2012,5 star rating,"WAIT. SO GOOD! I'm so sad that I just discovered this place a month before moving out of Ktown. I've been having an overload of Korean food for the past year, but Hae Jang Chon has captured my heart, mind, and stomach. I'm not even sure what made the meal so good...it was just krn bbq. OH WAIT...maybe it was the succulent Kalbi and marinated squid and kimchi fried rice and bean curd soup to top off the meal. I was the size of a balloon by the end of all that food and it put me in a very serious case of food coma. Though there are MANY all you can eat krn bbq's in the neighborhood, Hae Jang Chon seems to have not only the best tasting, but also the best quality meat. That KALBI!!! i'm still dreaming...."
6/25/2012,3 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon wasn't bad, but I thought they could improve on the ban chan and service. Â I think the quality of ban chan can be measured first by the kimchee, and then everything else. Â The kimchee was super pickled (over-ripened) and there weren't many other kinds of ban chan. Â It just didn't do it for me. Â The quality of meats were pretty good, except for the cha dol. Â The cha dol in particular was fairly tough. Â My gf mentioned that it wasn't always that way. Â In any case, it's not bad for $17.99 all you can eat Korean BBQ, but I'm confident there are other better joints. Â As far as the service is concerned,... nothing memorable. Â One of the servers almost knocked the food off my chopsticks after bumping into me, but he didn't even turn around to say 'excuse me' or apologize. Â This place is just average."
6/24/2012,4 star rating,"The line for dinner time is usually at least 1.5 hour plus and this plaza will charge you to park in the spots regardless of valet or not. My friends rave about this place being their favorite KBBQ spot and so I decided to go ahead and give it a try.The interesting thing about this place is the stone grill, they never change the grill but rather use daikon to scrape and clean the surface throughout your meal. Staff is very friendly, which often isn't the case for most KBBQ establishments.Meat selection vs. price wise isn't all that great, however the quality of the meats are. The Canadian pork belly (good job Canada, you don't totally suck) and pork shoulders are my absolute favorite. They come in thick and thin cuts (yelp.com/biz_photos/JYGPâ¦) and seriously the fat on them give off a great taste. The Angus brisket, cow tongue, and short ribs are also amazing (yelp.com/biz_photos/JYGPâ¦). Fresh, great taste, clean, and they open late, what more can you ask for?P.S. they also make you kimchi fried rice at the end (much like Honey Pig), so make sure to save some room for that."
6/23/2012,5 star rating,All you can is shown BEST here! Dduk Bo Sam is so good... The saeng galbi is the BEST if cooked a little rare.. So juicy and tender! Don't get the pork sliced thin.. Tasted dry......
6/23/2012,5 star rating,"Definitely my favorite AYCE Kbbq joint. It has gotten extremely popular over the last couple of years, so definitely be prepared to wait when you're there (esp on the weekends). Last weekend, I waited an hour and a half for a party of 3. They do take reservations for large parties, but even then, you probably won't be seated right away. The selection here is amazing. They have everything you could ever want for an amazing kbbq meal. I am a huge fan of their galbi (marinated short ribs), brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, and pork shoulder. The meat is always fresh and always delicious. Their banchan is very tasty as well. I love that they put the kimchi on the hot stone grill. The kimchi pancake is AMAZING. I always end up filling up on too much kimchi pancake! You also get steamed egg, rice paper, pickled radish, and 4 different dipping sauces with your meal. At the end of your meal , they make this FANTASTIC kimchi fried rice on your grill and bring you a bowl of yummy spicy soybean soup. They also serve soju and Korean beer. Hite is so delicious with Kbbq :)Like many other places in Koreatown, the parking here is valet only. You might be able to find some parking on the street, but I would just hand over my keys and let the pros handle it. Valet is $2. This place is also open till 2 am, so it's a great place to go for late-night food runs!"
6/21/2012,5 star rating,"Definitely one of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ places. Besides the rather long wait, I really can't find too much faults. Meat is really good, service is spectacular for a KBBQ place, and side dishes are great too. I think what really makes it for me is the great service. The servers there are really on top of it with replenishing side dishes, bringing more water, and they'll even help with cooking the meat. And watching them clean the stone grill is always interesting!Basically, whenever I crave kbbq, I'll go for Hae Jang Chon."
3/25/2018,3 star rating,"Quality wise, this is the best KBBQ place in LA. If you can afford it, it's well worth the money. I always come here when I'm in LA. However, yesterday my friends and I came by and our waiter was extremely passive aggressive to us. We ordered a kimchi pancake at the very beginning, and asked for it again about 15 minutes later because it still hadn't come out. He said it was coming out, but by the time we were done with our meat, it still wasn't out. We asked about it again when we said we were done with meats because now about 30 minutes had passed, and he replied that the chefs focus more on the meat and grove priority to that. Okay, he could have told us from the beginning it would take a while, and then we wouldn't have had to ask so many times. Once he finally brought it out, he put it down in front of us and said ""here's your kimchi pancake"" in a very passive aggressive voice. It felt like we had bothered him when there was a different way to communicate to us that something may take a while. I've never had a waiter be so rude to us. Once we got our pancake he gave us our bill without even asking if we wanted anything else! My friends wanted another pancake but with the way he behaved we felt like we were being treated like a nuisance and being rushed out. According to our receipt, his name was Kyung. I hope we won't have him as a waiter next time I visit."
8/3/2012,3 star rating,"We stopped for lunch at this passable AYCE Korean BBQ in Korea town. While far from the best, this is by no means the worst either. Â Decent meats and an excellent selection of choices including tongue, brisket, hot dog, small octopus, squid, rib. The sides were disappointing especially the kimchee, which had an unpleasant under taste. Good service. Parking in lot or on street."
9/14/2014,5 star rating,"Hands down my favorite AYCE kbbq joint! It's on the pricier end of AYCE bbq restaurants I've been to ($21.99 per person), but well worth it! Their banchan is super tasty, meat is fresh (brisket, marinated short rib, and thin pork belly are delish!), and they give you bombbbb kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal! One thing that definitely sets this place apart from other kbbq places is their service, which is amazing. The waiters are constantly refilling dishes and always ask if you want anything else. If you're looking for a great ayce kbbq place, definitely come here! Although the wait can be long (expect 40min+), you'll be extremely satisfied with your meal by the end of it all. One more thing, parking is easy! Just valet in the lot for $2 and you're gold."
3/20/2011,3 star rating,"While I agree with everyone about the quality of the meat, I docked points for the following reasons:- Therir banchan selection was disappointing. Maybe I am the only one, but I really look forward to those tiny dishes of delicious banchan to go with my meat- They took FOREVER to clean our grill after we were done with our meal. As we waited for our post dinner kimchi fried rice, the burnt meat would just smoke up and constantly blow into my face whenever the door opened.- I had to ring the bell thing three times to get their attention sometimes. I don't care how busy you are, we are also important!- They wouldn't give me all the dduk (rice) wrap I wanted. I asked for more and the guy gave me a crazy look.all of those reasons would actually only constitute me docking one star. The last star, and most important star, comes from the fact that, while they pride themselves in giving you this large variety of meats to choose from (even hot dog!), they were missing something so quintessential to my korean bbq experience.Cow Intestines.I know most of you aren't with me on this sentiment, but I'm just saying. Cow Intestines."
7/25/2011,5 star rating,"Woohooo! This was my first KBBQ experience, courtesy of my legit korean friends. I didn't know what they were ordering, they always order for us in korean, but they have the interesting tasting water that Korean restaurants have, and then the food doesn't stop coming. There are different sauces, different veggies, different meats, you keep ordering, all you can eat! And you cook the meet on the grill thingy, and once in a while they'll bring some radish and scrub the thing clean. Get the kim chi! and the kim chi pancake! Somehow my vegetarian boyfriend also loves coming here (I'm not sure what he eats)... oh you can get kim chee fried rice at the end! But he's really not a picky vegetarian (he doesn't care if it touches my meat while I'm cooking it or what it's fried in), so I'm sure a real strict Veggie wouldn't like it here much.It tends to be loud, and they sing happy birthday a lot ahah, my favorite place. There's valet parking outside."
9/16/2011,4 star rating,This place is great for group get togethers!for 18 per person you can get a pretty good selection of all the meats and side dishes. the salads are amazing. so are the fish cakes.wait isn't that bad even if it's a weekend night.
7/5/2012,5 star rating,"I am in love with this AYCE kbbq... It is heaven in my mouth. I love their beef tongue and pork..anything pork is good. There is a good variety! For $20 you can get beef tongue, brisket, 2 cuts of porkbelly, hot dogs, beef intestines (i think), and etc. At the beginning you get kimchi pancake and you end with soup and kimchi fried rice. Definitely worth the money!They have really nice service and its pretty fast, once you get seated that is.ONLY problem is that the wait is freaking long. I've been here twice and waited an hour or so each time. But if you have the patience, you won't be disappointed!I will definitely be back.. don't plan on stopping anytime soon either!ps. if you have over 8 ppl, you can make a reservation. Other than that, you have to wait."

6/27/2011,5 star rating,"Best AYCE korean bbq place i've ever been to. I've been to ilmee in VA, and that place is nowhere near as good as this. SO CHEAP. SO MANY OPTIONS. I've died and gone to food heaven. They give you a lot of panchan and the kimchi fried rice at the end just puts it over the top. Great ambience too. Its located in KTown so after you're done eating, u can walk a few doors down and drink the night away or go karaoke! Awesome KTown experience, i'll be back this summer when i visit again!"
2/12/2012,3 star rating,"Good sides, decent AYCE meat, and nice kimchi fried rice at the end. Was everything worth an hour and a half wait? Not really, considering there are a million other KBBQ restaurants in the area.Didn't care for the service either. They were very busy, but the guy kept forgetting to bring us more sides when he came back with more orders of meat. For an AYCE place it's not bad, but I've had better, and since we live a good 20 miles out we probably won't return to this restaurant for KBBQ."
2/27/2012,4 star rating,"OH MY GOSH... Longest wait... EVER. It definitely didn't help that we had 7 people in our party, but at least we got to spend some quality time together watching valet drive a bunch of cars around, and YES, there's valet... It's pretty much necessary because the parking lot is so tiny. What a bummer, but at least it only costs $2.As for the food, it's pretty good and there's so many different kinds of meats to choose from. My favorites were the thin pork belly (don't get the thick cut--it's quite nasty and fatty), brisket, and bulgogi. I really liked all of the dipping sauces and side dishes too, and the service was so good that they were always being refilled. The servers are really on point, so it makes the dining process really easy. They do everything fast whether it's bringing out the meat, refiling your sides/water, or cleaning up your grill. I wish we had a place like this back home... It's even open until 2AM to fulfill your late night cravings. The only places serving food at that hour in San Jose are Denny's, Jack in the Box, and all of the other fast-food chains... Definitely recommend Hae Jang Chon, especially if you're hungry past midnight!"
10/28/2015,4 star rating,"This is another great AYCE buffet. The food is great and the atmosphere is too. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the prices are very high compared to nearby competitors with comparable selection. Their AYCE does have a lot to choose from though, however most of the things I want can be found at nearby places that offer AYCE for $10 instead of over $20."
7/31/2012,4 star rating,"One of the key AYCE KBBQs I've come to know and love in LA. The wait: The lines are VERY long. Arriving after 6pm equals an hour+ wait, even with a small party. I think larger parties can make phone reservations, but we've left a couple times due to wait times. Getting here at 5pm with 4 or less is key. I think every time I've come here after six I've gotten an ""appetizer"" at Kyochon right next door to kill time. The food: The banchan is fairly standard. The little extras here -- thin sliced pickled radish and rice paper -- add a little something extra. They have the standard selection of thin sliced beef, beef tongue, pork belly, bulgolgi, kalbi, and the ones that people don't order (tripe, honeycomb, BBQ chicken). The unmarinated meats are above average quality, and a great deal for the price of AYCE. The bulgolgi and kalbi are GOOD, but not GREAT. The kimchi fried rice at the end is a nice treat but nothing fancy, but the korean-style miso soup at the end is delicious -- maybe all the meat scraps go into making the broth? Etc: The service is standard Korean style ""service doorbell"" centered. When you ask for extra sauce/garlic/etc they make sure they bring a TON. They have valet out front, meager street parking.Is it worth the wait? Yes, if you're smart about it, and in the mood to eat your stomach's weight in meat."
10/27/2015,1 star rating,"AVOID LIKE SARS AND WAR.!! Im a forever resident of Koreatown Los Angeles and do not review often unless something was out of the ordinary or extraordinary and I will be honest with you. Â  Hae jang chon was great ten years ago only because smoking was allowed on the outside patio area. Â  Who doesnt like a Marlboro with a bottle or two of soju and some cheap meat. Â  I believe they were one of the first kbbq restaurants in town to serve pork jowl, Â the face of the the pig, Â and it was decent mostly because it was new. Â Some virgin to korean food from the la times came through this very avg joint and claimed it some culinary gem hidden in this murky, Â foreign world within los angeles. Â  I immediately stopped paying attention to his obviously money driven advertisements of non michelin rated restaurants. Â (mr. Â Gold) Â i still see that worthless review being plastered everywhere this restaurant is being advertised. Â  Oh well, Â score one for the pig. Â  I came back here with the idea that if theyre still in business, Â improvements must have been made. Â  I was wrong. Â  Ayce places tend to use cheaper versions of brisket, Â belly etc, Â i understand that. Â  I wasn't expecting prime, Â cab or even blue ribbon beef. Â  I got trash brisket that was previously frozen, Â unfrozen and refrozen again. Â  I complained to kevin the day time manager and he didnt Â apologize, just brought a different plate of trash brisket again. Â I ordered the nostalgic pork jowl and that was even worse. Â  Jowl is not supposed to come in thick half inch slices, Â but about 1/4inch cuts, Â to minimize cooking time while keeping the flavors inside. Â I told kevin again about this oversight and he told me to get lost and stuff my face somewhere else. Â  His exact words translated from korean to english. Â  I was beyond offended, Â more from the food they serve at this dump than the behavior of the insecure dump that is kevin, Â mr day time manager. Â  As far as ayce places go, Â this place is disgusting in every way. Â  I hope this review saves a patron or two from an egregious meal and saves Koreatown from more scathing reviews than this."
9/11/2012,4 star rating,"At first, I couldn't decide if I like this place better than Road to Seoul. Â These two are easily the most popular AYCE restaurants on yelp (my favorite is Don Day actually).What I like about this place is the service and the variety. Â When I come here, it is less about consuming as much meat as you can and feeling like crap afterwards. Â The service is excellent for such a busy ayce kbbq. Â The waiters and waitresses will actually come up and cut your meat for you.Another + about this place is how late its open - I think it would be pretty badass to eat here at like 1am despite what my cholesterol levels say.Parking is alright, thanks to the valet. Â The wait here is ABSOLUTELY THE LONGEST I've ever had to wait for a restaurant. Â I've been here twice - both times it was over 2 hrs long. Â Thanks to that, I've also tried the Kyochon and Byul Gobchang next door.I can't really recommend any of the meats here that are interesting. Â They have this canadian pork belly which reminds me of the black pork belly. Â I honestly don't remember being able to tell the difference despite considering myself knowledgeable about all things.Overrall, I rate this place the same as Road to Seoul. Â +1 for the dining experience, -1 for the wait"
8/22/2008,4 star rating,"The meat quality at this place is a lot better than many other places. I just don't go here as much because they get really greasy after a couple orders... they use this slanted stone pot with a little hole on the lower side for the grease to flow out, but sometimes that's just not enough!Anyway, they give you a bunch of stuff when you do the all you can eat. Korean Pancake, the usual banchan (though no potato salad!), Grilled Kimchi.. and in the end they make you kimchi bokkeumbap (fried rice)! that's my favorite part of the meal :)also, i was very amused when they used radishes to clean the stone pot between each meat order."
5/12/2010,4 star rating,"I love HJC! Â My husband took me there a few weeks ago and I swear my waistline has not gone by to it's original circumference since that night. Â Initially we thought about going to O Dae San upon recommendation from a friend, but we saw that HJC had better reviews. Â My husband also knew that I love Korean BBQ but don't like leaving smelling like I'm still rolling in pork belly bbq nor do I like dirty and cheap Korean AYCE joints. Â HJC did not disappoint. Â Not only is the stone grill amazing and doesn't end up burning most of your meat, the lady comes by constantly to clean the stone grill with some radish. Â We ordered the beef brisket, bbq chicken, bbq short ribs marinated, pork belly, and bbq squid. Â The best by far has to be the angus beef brisket. Â To top it off, they give you the steamed egg, kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice. Â Overall the food is a 4star, ambience a 3 star, and service a 4 star."
6/18/2010,4 star rating,"Came here on a busy weekend, the place is small and cramped. Â I'd suggest making reservations otherwise go to a different place. Â  The service here was excellent, the waiters were all nice and brought out our dishes quickly. Â They also cleaned our grill each time, which is nice since it's not a traditional bbq grill. Â They use some kind of stone plate, so you don't get the same type of flavor as a traditional flame grill. Â The meat selection is standard at most Korean bbqs. Â The meat quality is pretty much the same as most all-you-can-eat places. Â I was quite impressed with the first plate of sliced angus brisket, it was good quality. Â I decided to order another plate, and to my disappointment, the meat did not come out the same. Â They used a different grade of meat after your 1st order. Â I preferred the un-marinated meat versus the marinated version; I felt the meat was over marinated and way too sweet. Â  You can always dip your meat in the sauces they provide, which I prefer. Â The only meats I liked was the angus brisket, tongue, and un-marinated galbi. Â I also tried the squid, octopus, chicken, bulgogi, but these weren't that good. Â  The side dishes were okay, nothing special. Â The steamed egg was way over-salty, and the Korean pancake was soggy and drenched with oil. Â  The only thing that stood out at this place is the kimchi fried rice at the end. Â But by this time you are so full eating meat, that you can barely eat any fried rice. Â I suggest you save some for the kimchi fried rice, its good, but I have had better at traditional Korean bbqs (not ayce places). Â Nonetheless, a nice touch to a qyce Korean bbq. Â They also give you bean paste soup at the end, but honestly how much rice and soup can you eat after you had all that meat? Â You can also choose between steamed white rice or kimchi fried rice. Â If you order regular steamed rice, you get that during your meal. Â Compared to Road to Seoul, this place has MUCH BETTER ventilation and service. Â However, Road to Seoul has better seating and is a much larger place for big groups. Â  In terms of meat selection/quality, they are both comparable. Â The only thing that gives this place an edge over Road to Seoul is the kimchi fried rice at the end. Â Prices are also about the same. Â I'd suggest coming here for small groups, and going to Road to Seoul for larger groups."
11/30/2010,4 star rating,"This place has all the elements of great AYCE kbbq.... good meat, good banchan, and soju, for $17/person (well, not incl the soju of course).My favorite part at the end, just when you thought you'd never be able to fit anything more in your stomach, is when the greasy goodness and meat drippings accumulated on the grill are soaked up and mixed with kimchi and rice to create amazing kimchi fried rice. Â Pretty bomb, and a great choice for AYCE kbbq if you're not sure where to go!!"

Over half an hour of fun waiting times. Came here for the AYCE and had to order it, although it seemed like people around us got something else like tofu or something. There's a pretty extensive menu of meats that you can order (i think 19 different kinds). The water that they give you isn't normal water...its like a green/rice tea that's a real palette cleanser. AND the best part was our waiter that was cleaning our grill let me have a shot at it for fun (as per my request) and it was so much fun. Radishes + grill cleaners = fun!

11/7/2011,4 star rating,"If it werent for the customer service, i'd give it a perfect 5 stars.but DAMNNNN the customer service sucks!!! If you aren't Korean, they are bias. I can't count how many times they ignored our group of 7 or pretended not to hear the bell we rang. I absolutely hate hate hate when do don't come and refill the condiments....ugh!!Otherwise, their food was delicious. Many choices of meats, many dipping sauces, salad was decent, kimchi was a bit sour but decent. My fav were those pickled radish wraps. Yum!!! The kimchi fried rice was good but I was too full to eat it at the end."
2/13/2012,4 star rating,"Really great service, delicious kimchi pancakes, good sauces, quality meat and they make you kimchi fried rice at the end!Service - much quicker and more attentive than most AYCE krn bbq places. Â They're also way happier looking than the other places.Meat - not quite as good as some of the other krn bbq places, but still good! Â I'd recommend the Beef Tongue, Pork Shoulder, Beef Short Rib, Brisket & Bulgolgi.For reference, besides Hae Jang Chon, I usually end up going to Tahoe or Road to Seoul for AYCE krn bbq.Parking is hard to find, but valet is only $2.Also, there's always a wait on the weekends, so go early or be prepared to wait."
4/25/2012,3 star rating,"Why did I come here? Only because 1000 people reviewed this place and said it was the BEST KBBQ AYCE in town...WRONG. I was disappointed. I mean, they have quality meat and everything, but DAMN, the wait is forever. This place is OVER hyped. I had a party of 10 and the wait was over 2 hours. We got their early at 6pm and set a reservation for 7pm. Good thing there was a bar next door. We drank and waited, but even then, that just made us hungrier! Did you know there are about 20+ other KBBQ AYCE around the corner that don't have a wait of 2 hours? Now that I've tried it, I don't have a yearning to come again. UNLESS there happens to be no one in there. BTW, this place is small as well, while other KBBQ places have two stories!"

12/12/2014,2 star rating,I love that this eatery gets such high ratings! Â Ppl pls keep frequenting bc that means smaller lines at my favorite spots. Â Why for my harsh words?

11/16/2013,1 star rating,"Worst AYCE Â Korean BBQ Experience in a long time.I hate writing bad reviews but this was my experience: Being ignored for beverage refills constantly and having a Grill that never got evenly hot. The worse part though was watching native eaters be given better quality meat than what were being given. Every Korean occupied table had really nice looking fat free brisket and nicely Colored Galbi for the native patrons. The Meat we got served was grey and dark and very tough (Galbi) and the Brisket we were given had marbling all throughout. This is the first time I have ever felt discriminated against in a restaurant and guess what I should have never gone and neither should you. When we asked the Manager, he just laughed us off and said ""The Grass isn't greener.."" and blew us off. Horrible experience. Not worth the money or time lost."

10/2/2009,4 star rating,"Location: Â Inside a mini-mall. Â Valet parking only, which we don't go for, but go around a time or two and you can get street parking with ease. Â It's not a super-big joint so it's good sized if you're 2-4, but anything up from that, and it might get a bit tight. Â Round tables like MDP but a little bit bigger.Hours: Â Perfect! Â Open till 2:00am? Â What more could you ask for?Service: Â Fair. Â If you ask it, they bring it. Â But it's not like they're checking up on you. Â No complaints - this is pretty much a standard for AYCE/KBBQ places.Banchan: Â It's alright. Â Not the best variety I've had, but not the worst. Â Bonus that they bring both the egg-pot & tofu-stew! Â I'm not a kimchi fan so I can't comment on that, but the pancake is delish!Meat: Â To be honest, we only get the beef ; when we're here. Â We always say we'll try the pork or chicken next time, but we just can't get enough beef! Â Flavorful & tastes superb on the stone grill (the obvious difference from the metal plates at other joints). Â Servings are alright for two-three, we've never come here with more than 3/4 people so I don't know if they double up when you're a larger party. Â Oh, it's some 15-20 (?) choices of AYCE and it seems about the standard variety.Misc: Â They're ""dirty water"" as we call it is delish! Â (It's not actually dirty, it's just not full on tea, and it's not just water, and they pour it in the pitchers from a giant bucket). Â Standard $16/17 per person."
9/20/2011,5 star rating,"BY FAR, the best KBBQ AYCE joint I've been to! The quality of the meat and the service is beyond any other KBBQ places I've been to. You can really taste the difference in quality of meat. Most of their meat slices are very thin and it isn't as chewy as other KBBQ places I've been to. The AYCE deal is $16.99, I believe. You also get soybean soup, kimchi pancake, rice paper, steamed egg, and other delicious side dises! My favorite thing about this place is that they use a stone pot to grill the meat which is healthier and the oil is released through a hole in the pot and drips down onto a tray so the grill can easily be cleaned with radishes! At the end, they also make you kimchi fried rice :)"
2/28/2012,5 star rating,"I absolutely LOVE this place.The selection of meats is amazing. Â From intestines to honeycomb to the ribs, you really can't go wrong.

I had a crabby ass friend (I need to apologize too, I felt so freaking embarrassed), and they dealt with it well!Don't fill up completely, because they'll make kimchi fried rice at the end for you, which is the way to end the meal :)Please treat this place well people, and show them your love!"
3/30/2014,5 star rating,I really like the kbqq here they have thin pork belly and the thick kind.... omg soo yummy!! Beware it has alot of fat hahaha... Â I am not a normal girl so I love my pork belly fats :D if you come at lunch time the wait line is not that horrible.... but if you planning to come at night time the wait can be pretty damn long.... if you have a big party call ahead to make reservations they do take reservations however they only give you 15 grace time... so make sure your party is not running on asian time if they do make 1 hour later reservation hahaha... overall I think the price is not bad and the food is wonderful!!! And service they are quite attentive for a super busy resturant. Â I live one block away so I been here multiple times and I have nothing bad to say so far ^.^

They clean your grill as well.Side dishes are pretty good and you get a shit ton.I really liked the thin pork belly and the squid!I really didn't like the seasoned meat that we tried though..it cooked up to a ground beef consistency, which was really gross.Place gets packed so come early."

6/21/2009,3 star rating,"Went with a friend of mine and didn't realize that I've already been to this place until I saw the photo of the restaurant sign. Â We went during the weekend but at around 3pm so it was practically empty. Â There was no wait to our table and we were able to order right away. Â We got beef short ribs, pork belly and some cuttle fish. Â It was all very good and I thought their pancakes were flavorful but greasy. Â With the greasiness of all the meats and the pancakes, we were stuffed. Â The pork belly was the only thing i wouldn't get again. Â The meat was almost flavorless compared to the beef and the condiments. Â Not sure why. Â The price was reasonable considering the amount of food they give you for each order."
10/11/2009,5 star rating,"Although the food is great, perhaps the best part about this place is the service. At most korean BBQ's the service is surly and rude. Here, you get quite the opposite. We had an old lady (aren't they the best?!) who cracked jokes, brought us our food quickly, and always had a smile.Price? Reasonable. AYCE for $16.99 which is about the going rate for most of these places.Make sure to ask for the fried rice (upon request only) towards the end of your meal. Very good stuff.Overall, I love the easy going atmosphere of this place. You see a good mix of young people, college kids, yuppies, and families. My new favorite Korean BBQ spot."

Our server was SUPER friendly and helpful. I totally loved her because she insisted we eat more hehehe!!I cant wait to go back! If I could I'd be there everyday! 16.99 you cant go wrong. OH and by the way my blood sugar DID NOT go up! So see its good for you too!"
1/17/2010,4 star rating,This place was a BBQ extravaganza. All-you-can-eat and then some... On par with other AYCE restaurants. Definately bring an apetite otherwise your better off ordering ala carte. I would have to say we definately lucked out with the parking situation because this strip mall lot was a big mess of huh? We were lucky enough to get there a little earlier than the dinner crowd so we missed having to wait for a table so that was nice.Staff was friendly enough and they did check in every once in a while to make sure we were satisfied with the BBQ.Overall definately worth the meat sweats and the ' I ate way too much and could hardly move ' feeling!
2/3/2010,4 star rating,"True story. Â My family and I went here after a freak blackout closed down one of the other AYCE KBBQ we wanted to go to. Â Yelp recommended this place and we had a great time. Dummy that we were, we forgot to bookmark the restaurant.Second visit - our family goes DRIVING UP AND DOWN Koreatown where we think the restaurant may be because we could not remember the name of the beloved restaurant. In the end, we found it and were determined to never repeat the scavenger hunt again. This is why I'm writing this review. The restaurant is that good. And I will be damned if I have to hunt down all the other AYCE KBBQs in town to find it again! ;)"
2/8/2010,4 star rating,"This is another AYCE Korean BBQ in K-town. This place is definitely good and great. Its got a great grill that drains the fat off to the side. But the thing that makes this place for me is their sides they bring out and the vast variety they have for meat. The way they put the kimchi and the beansprouts on the grill is great, then they top it with a fish pancake thing?, but nonetheless its awesome. Then they have the steamed egg which is great. After this its the meats, I have had almost everything except the hotdog and the weird sounding one thats basically stomach. I can say the meat is flavored very well and is just awesome. Plus the salad is good too, lol.End the coupe de tat is the kimchi fried rice, i dont know why its so good but it just is, maybe its the way they clean the grill? But all I can say if you arent full before hand, after eating the rice you'll be so full u'll have emitting your own gravity like pea-tear gryphon. Just be prepared to wait if you come at a busy time, i came on a saturday night and had to wait 1 hour - 1.5 hours. They do take reservations so you mgiht wanna call ahead."
3/28/2010,5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious KBBQ!!I went with my BF and friend - the three of us decided on AYCE ($16.99 + tax each)I loved the stone grill, little side dishes, barley tea... EVERYTHING!What we got?-Beef Tongue (my first time ever trying this... it was THINLY sliced and didn't even look like tongue! (thank goodness) and you know what?? It tasted GREAT!)-Beef Short Ribs (this was A+ Excellent! Little pieces of succulent, marinated meat that tasted amazing)-Beef Brisket (always a wonderful staple item in KBBQ)-Beef Bulgogi (great taste - awesome marinate and my friend loved eating the onions that was grilled with the meat)-Pork Belly (thinly sliced - not too shabby! However, there was cartilage within the sliced meat that made the experience underwelming)They also gave plentiful: Round Radish, Rice Wrap, Kimchi, etc. The kimchi pancake was YUM-O. My BF loved eating this and couldn't get enough. We didn't try the Kimchi Fried Rice because we were STUFFED to the brim. **We also came here on a SATURDAY night at 6:15PM and were seated REALLY fast** That's why this experience gained an extra star to make it 5 stars!! While we were getting our grub on, I noticed that a LOT of people were waiting to get seated (approximately 7:45PM). The turnover for tables is AWFUL, lol. When we were seated, people who were there before us eating were STILL eating. YAY KBBQ in KTown!"
6/22/2010,4 star rating,"AYCE Korean BBQ for $16.99. A really good selection of items. The thin cut pork belly is really good. I've had better bulgogi, but the small octopus is really good. Save room for the kimchi fried rice and soup at the end. My only gripe with this place is the overall service. If you take a while to eat the servers will eventually stop serving you. A few of the servers are really good and really attentive, but eventually they may switch shifts on you. As what happened the last few times I was there. Overall, this place is well worth it and I would definitely recommend it. The food is really good and they have a big selection of sides. My only advice is to not take too long."
9/6/2010,4 star rating,"Really freaking good. Â I mean, I didn't give it five stars because some of the meats (out of the whopping number of 19 choices to choose from) didn't have much flavor, but all in all, pretty good!!My favorite meats were... the bbq pork, bulgogi, and california short rib. xD My favorite sides? Â KIMCHI FRIED RICE!! even though it was served at the end, it resparked a lot of our appetites! Â kimchi pancake was new and different from what i've ever tasted, and other than that all the other sides are pretty good too! Â They give you a LOT.They make sure you don't leave hungry!The service though... I reserved like 2 days in advance, and when I got there, my friends and I still had to wait for 20 minutes AFTER SETTLING for a smoking area to eat in. Â The smoking area wasn't too bad though, since no one really smokes when they eat in there. Â We did, however, have THE nicest waitress. Â She was working like.. 6 or 7 tables all in the smoking area, and she was still super nice to us and ready to take any of our orders (of course, as long as we were nice to her too.)food: Â pretty damn good. Â I'd definitely go back again!service: GREAT waitress but don't bother putting in reservations... Â the wait will be the same.atmosphere: awesome, better than the ayce kbbq's in orange county.highly recommended!"
9/8/2010,2 star rating,"I love korean bbq but this place was okay. Love the whole all you can eat experience with all the pickled veggies yum :D but I felt that it was lacking in flavor .. marinated short ribs ?? bbq beef ?? bbq chicken ?? no taste whatsoever .. the side dishes and dips had the flavor .. what iritated me most was the waiter/""chef"" would come by 30/40 minutes at a time to cook our food .. I was cooking the food .. I love to cook but apparently they are supposed to cook for us .. When I would cook he would say ""so you are doing my job now ??"" and laugh at me .. errrrr WHERE ARE YOU ?? Given they have a service button to push .. I will not push that damn thing over and over just to make him flip my food .. even so .. the number one rule is not to mess with the people handling your food .. so fail on the customer service .. and what is up with the steam egg ?? ewwww .. water and egg ?? yukkk Â .. pancake kim chi ?? not bad .. so pickled veggies .. got me good .. flavorless meat .. never again ..Update: Forgot to mention that I asked for water NOT tea !! So I asked for water again and they did not give it to me. So I asked for soda and BAM magically in my face .."
10/11/2010,4 star rating,"Worth the drive & wait for $17 all you can eat Korean BBQ!!Staffs are friendly, food are fresh. Be sure to make reservation & get there early! Once you sit down, they gave you table full of appetizers with endless refills. Order the beef tongue, pork shoulder, squid, spicy pork, & beef ribs. At the end they will cook the kimchi fried rice and soup for you to finish up your meal. Thumbs up :)"
10/14/2010,4 star rating,"My All Time Favorite AYCE KBBQ hands down. Extra Points for having figured out how not to stink up their customers.As the 400+ previous reviews may have already mentioned, the meats here are just awesomesauce plain and simple. The service seems to be very good too for a KBBQ place. Our servers are always in a good mood everytime we visit. I can't even count how many birthdays we've celebrated here. Â Our group photos are up on the wall (they do that for birthdays I believe).Valet parking is available, so parking shouldn't be an issue.Tip: It's generally difficult to reserve a table here for big groups (as it is with any really busy restaurant). So make sure your party is there on time otherwise your table may be given away. Just because you have reservations doesn't mean you don't have to wait. So, my advice if you have a larger group? - DON'T BE THE ORGANIZER."
4/16/2011,4 star rating,"Good quality all you can eat Korean BBQ place. The majority of all you can eat places has really cut back on their meat quality to cut costs. This place however, still maintains that same great quality.Service is good and since there are mostly younger servers in there, your non-Korean diners can speak English to them. Vast amounts of protein choices to choose from and ban chan a plenty! :) Make reservations as this place does fill up quickly!!"
5/8/2011,4 star rating,"Best Sunday lunch of 2011!Strolled in with two friends last Sunday afternoon and were seated as soon as we walked in. Decor was modern and relaxing. Tables nicely spaced out. Trust me, some conversations you just do not want to overhear. I dragged my ass out of bed, got ready, and met at my friend's place in little over an hour. I also almost never eat meat but at the behest of my carnivore friends.Lunch commenced with a gimongous (yes, that's now a word) bowl of salad, followed by various sides- steamed egg, chilled spinach (gross), potato salad with apple chunks, fried pancake (this was the only side I really liked)- all brought out very quickly. The salad was my first spicy salad at a korean place and ever. I wasn't sure what I thought about it so I had to try it until it was all gone and also again when they brought us the 2nd bowl. I ordered chicken and bulgogi and both were mind-effing AMAZING! As was the dipping sauce(the semi-sweet brownish one). Like 'what-would-you-eat-for-your-last meal' amazing! I always order chicken at KBBQ and this is my FAV. I felt myself turning into octomom as we ordered second and third rounds of meat. My friends also ordered beef tongue, short ribs, beef brisket, bacon, pork shoulder or pork belly (I don't remember which but I know they had pork), and octopus and were happy to be pregnant men. We did not know about any fried rice or miso soup but maybe they're only served during dinner? Next time my friends drag me to KBBQ, I will have to try the fried rice. The HUGE favors I do for my friends..."
6/1/2011,3 star rating,"Came here with the BF at around 2pm on a Saturday. Not packed but not empty. Parking was easy to find, and although we did have to request service a few times, the part that irritates me most is when we were finishing up our meal (being the last customers in the restaurant), we were completely ignored. We were waiting for them to make the kimchi fried rice for over 10 minutes, and when I waved one of the waiters over to ask them about it, they just brought over the check! I'm not completely annoyed by this type of service since that's what I hate about Korean restaurants - they act like they're doing you some sort of service by waiting on you. I don't get this feeling in any other type of Asian restaurant. Although the meat was good (but the soup was blah and the kimchi pancake was way too salty), I think I'll try out some other AYCE places before I return to this one."
7/8/2011,3 star rating,"The wait is long, even late at night. The meats are so-so (Brisket has too much fatty pieces). Service is a win or fail. One night, our party got friendly and attentive service where we even struck up conversation with some of the servers. Another night we sat patiently watching tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after we got seated being served their orders before us.Yet, I keep coming back here for several reasons. The vibe/decor is fun and chill. I actually like the woodsy-backdoorsy motif. The servers and the crowd are young, so the energy is there until closing. Finally, on top of all the meat and banchan you can eat, you get to end your meal with kim chi fried rice, kim chi pancake, and bean paste soup. Â If you want an example of a Kbbq that delivers on the quantity, Hae Jang Chon is the place. More food to end your all-you-can-eat meal?! For under $20?! Who does that?!?!"
7/9/2011,4 star rating,GREAT banchan for an AYCE place and the meats were of a high quality. Â I'm going to address details not yet mentioned but I liked how the servers came out with 4 sauces at the get go and we had 4 waiters serving us constantly and urging us to order MORE MEAT (*_*).I feel that the $17 per person was reasonable given the quality.If you are in K-town skip the $9.99 places and come here.We were at Hae Jang Chon at 12pm Saturday and did not have to use the valet parking.
7/31/2011,5 star rating,"Went to this place for lunch during work one day. I was very impressed by the quality of the food. This was the first time I've tried kbbq place where it wasn't a grill that you cooked on but a stone, and it was pretty good. It makes it MUCH easier to cook a bunch of food at once.I think we can all agree that you go to a kbbq reason for two things:1) To stuff your face2) To eat a lot of meat (good meat)This place gets 5 stars for both of these. We had a group of about 10, and we ordered a lot of the different items, and they were all good. Even things like squid and tripe (which aren't really my thing) were good. I will definitely go back here, especially since they're open 'till 2am."
11/25/2011,3 star rating,"This place is way too packed on a Saturday night.Long lines of people waiting to get seated.Keep in mind that it's not a big restaurant.It's overcrowded and too hectic for me.We were seated with our party of 20 something.I don't understand why they let people who aren't seated yet inside the restaurant when it's this crowded. Â I understand there was some kind of game on tv, but geez. Â They were literally behind me, my head hit their backs, my bag kept falling off my chair by people who were overcrowding our area.Onto the food.19 different kinds of meat. Â AYCE for $16.99.Service: They tried their best to accommodate. Service was great compared to smaller restaurants that aren't nearly as busy.If you don't let them know beforehand what kind of meat you want, expect to wait about 10 mins 'til your next meat platter arrives.Parking : Lucky if you can find street parking, if not valet like everywhere else in ktown. Would I come here again? Probably not. Â I don't think it's worth the wait and yeah 19 types of meat sound appealing, but it's not like we're eating all of them. Â Most people only eat the basics.BUT I did like their squid."
6/18/2014,3 star rating,The food is good here but I honestly had better Korean BBQ. Would I come here again? Probably not. I do like how they make bokkeumbap after but it still wasn't the selling point for me. I'd rather go elsewhere to my other BBQ places that are on top of my list
4/26/2015,5 star rating,This is definitely the best Korean BBQ I've ever had. Staff were great and the place is always super busy which can only mean one thing...
3/15/2015,5 star rating,Service and food were both amazing! Marinated short ribs are a must and I personally liked the bulgogi. $22 all you can eat and really worth it if you want some good food!
7/9/2012,3 star rating,This place is pretty unique. It is located in the same complex as kyochon and nandarang. They have valet parking here.They didn't use grill like everywhere else. They use stone! we cook out meat on a stone with a hole so that the fat can drip down (a little bit healthier I guess :p). Their meat is just okay. It was better 2years ago but I think their quality is going down a bit.They also gave you kimchi fried rice with the AYCE and they cooked it on the stone after you finish with the meatThe wait can be pretty crazy! we once need to wait more than 1hour just for a party of 2. the big groups who made reservation waited even longer than that (although they have made reservation before).will I be back here? maybe..Oh and they open till late!! :)

6/30/2014,3 star rating,"Was a bit disappointed on my overall first experience eating here... Came here with a group of 5 and I knew there would be at least an hour wait due to the time we went which was around 7ish-8pm on a Tuesday night. Upon seating I noticed our grill was different than other kbbq places I've been to which I thought it was cool at first. For $18.99 you get to choose from 19 items on their menu which we got brisket, bulgogi, beef tongue, bbq pork, and a few other meats. The only meat I enjoyed was the brisket... I feel like the grill didn't do it's job on charing the meat and instead was boiling it from the juices from the meat. It was interesting to see that the waiters and waitresses usually cook the meat for you as if you were doing it wrong lol Also, instead of changing the grill they use sliced radishes to clean up the juice and residue that the meat leaves behind. Some side dishes were good, the kimichi was on the sour side and upon the end of our meal we were excited to see/taste the kimichi fried rice! The verdict.. it was ehhh. It tasted sour which was from the kimichi as well as the seaweed taste from the nori but nothing else. Meh. My mom thought the steamed egg was overcooked and bland. I was excited but then disappointed... Maybe a second trip will be different? We will see about that."
3/4/2017,5 star rating,Best to arrive at an early time in the day! My friends and I came at 11am and we had so much fun!
4/12/2015,4 star rating,"Pretty great for all you can eat Korean BBQ! Most all you can eat places have subpar meat, but here it's actually really really great! Definitely coming back here more!"
4/30/2015,4 star rating,"Great Food and Great Price.I Love it and I will come back for more!! One advice, come here early to avoid the long wait list."
1/5/2017,2 star rating,"We were initially told that the wait time was 30-40 minutes... an hour passed and we had not been seated (table for 2). I checked in with the hostess and mentioned that we had been waiting for 35min, she snapped back with an attitude and said ""Well I said it would take 30-40min"" then she said we would have to wait 25min more! Service was horrible, waiter kept forgetting things I ordered, she would come back to check on us & apologize for forgetting then comeback later & forget about it again! Sides were very small so we had to keep asking for more (if our waiter ever came back) & meats did not have any flavor. I gave this place a try because it was walking distance from my apartment but I will defiantly not be going back."
11/9/2014,1 star rating,This is not a review for the restaurant itself but for the valet. Â Had dinner here today and returned to my car with my baby's car seat base completely unbuckled and unthreaded. Â Who knows what they were doing with my car while We were eating. Â This is not acceptable at all. Â Security even had the gall to suggest that something was wrong with my car. Â Even if my car managed to unbuckle (which would be a huge liability issue for Toyota) how the hell would it have unthreaded itself? Â Very fishy. Â Beware!
1/5/2015,1 star rating,"Food is OK, but their so called reservation stinks. You make a rezo only to wait and then can get there up to 15 after your rezo. Stupid."
12/1/2013,2 star rating,Came here for the all you can eat KBBQ. For the first plate of meat started with the brisket. For some reason the stone grill did not get very hot so instead of grilled the meat it seemed to be more like a steam. The brisket tasted kinda chewy and soggy which was not very tasty. Then we got some pork belly and basically the same thing. The meat quality might of been okay but when you are steaming it on a barely hot grill nothing is going to turn out good.
9/15/2012,2 star rating,"I get that fat is necessary for meat to have its tasty flavors, but there is a line beyond which food just becomes fatty and greasy. This restaurant is often very crowded, which I took to be a sign that it has good food. That's...not really the case. I can't explain its popularity, but I can and will choose not to contribute to it.My main complaint is that all the meat selections for bbq are either too greasy or extraordinarily tough."
12/15/2007,4 star rating,"Haejangchon was recommend by a good friend of mine and it was a great one! Â I came with a party of 12 and they were very efficient and quick to bring us whatever we wanted or needed. Â We got the AYCE meal which comes with porkbelly, chadol, and kalbi followed by kimchi pancake, kimchi fried rice, and tofu soup. Â Why I liked this place: Â They are very clean and each table had a smoke ventilation hood thing so it was not too smokey inside. Â They had good kalbi without the bones, the pork belly was a little on the thick side but I enjoyed it nonetheless, and there was something about the pancake that had our party asking for seconds and thirds. Â Why it didn't get 5 stars: Â The grease from the meat started dripping on to the table, the excess grease also made the kimchi fried rice extremely oily, which most korean food is not. Â Also, this may be a norcal thing, but they didn't give us tongs to cook the meat ourselves. Â Finding the location: Â It is right on the corner of 6th and S Harbot. Â I was the only one who could read korean, but what helped my friends find it was the picture of the pig on their sign."
6/7/2008,5 star rating,"Can you say amazing? Â I cant believe this place is still quite low key compared with its more famous, and might I add, much worse rival restaurant, Manna. Â The price is $16.99, same as Manna's, and if you don't feel like buffet style, you dont have to order buffet! Â However, my review will focus more on their buffet as I got buffet there last time. and WOW.In almost every category, their food was better than manna's. Â the meat is fresher, tastier, more marbled. Â Their Pork black belly, is actually GOOD and fresh, not frozen and tasteless. Â Their sides are delicious, and their kimchi is great. Â I want to speculate that the reason they aren't getting that much publicity is because of this long weird korean name. Â It can be quite hard to find this name on yelp! Â However, when youre driving by and you dont know how to read korean, look for a pig with its tongue sticking out. Â Its also next to this Korean Fried chicken place, Kyochon. Â I highly recommend this place! Â GO!"
2/4/2009,4 star rating,"I'm determined to try as many korean ayce restaurants in k-town as possible!i like this place compared to others because:- great service, there's actually 5-6 workers standing around waiting to serve you. i definitely don't speak korean, and yet they were very attentive.- cleaned my grill 3 times, in between the different meats we ordered.- very tender and flavorful kalbi.- excellent ventilation. - the ultimate best kim chee fried rice ever!!! thought they could do better on:- offer more banchan and meat variety.- serve the kim chee rice in the beginning!! i was so full by the time i finished all the meat, i could barely eat half a bowl of the rice. i asked the waiter why they served the rice at the end and he said, ""koreans no eat much rice in america, only in korea.""- pork belly was wayyyyyy too thick and fatty for me.parking is limited, so save the headache and valet for $2."
4/22/2009,4 star rating,"Updated (11/1/2011) - 3.5 STARSI don't know why but it doesn't taste as good as I remembered. It's either they changed their flavor or I just have a different preferences now. Before, I didn't mind their grill too much but the last time I was there...the meat wasn't cooked properly like how I wanted. Â The side dishes just got awful. Everything was more saltier. I definitely don't like their marinated short ribs that night. It was so tough, not as tender as I had before. [5 stars Reviews]Even though I always get sick of this place right after we eat, I just need a few days to digest the food and I'll forget it that I had it a few days ago and come back within a heart beat. It's really THAT good. I think $17 is a good price for AYCE, esp when it's nothing but meat. You pay about $14 for a combo at the tofu house so why not put in extra $3 to stuffed yourself with all the food you can get? You have 5 choices of meat including short ribs, beef brisket, bacon, chicken, and fillet fish(?). Short ribs and beef brisket are my staples just because I don't like chicken and fish. As for the bacon, it looks delicious but once you cook it...it's not that great. People probably like it because it's chunky bacon but there's no taste to it!Besides the meat, you also get unlimited goodies like bean sprouts, kimchee, salads, noodles, green veggies, and rice paper. I like it how they give biggg bowl of bean sprouts, kimchee, and salads! AYCE veggies. The sauce for the salads is really good, not fattening or anything. The kimchee is a bit sour sometimes so that's probably why they cook it for you first. The soup they provide here is egg soup instead of tofu, which I hardly touch because lack of flavor. My friend said their fried rice (the last meal) is really good here so I had to give it a try and I don't like it. I thought it was weird how they mixed white rice with kimchee and seaweed in it. It had the weirdest taste to it! I was too full to try the miso soup but yea...just stick with your ribs and brisket!I can't complain about the service since they helped us cook the food most of the time. They also come clean your grill here and there so yup yup. It's best to beat the dinner time because you don't know how long you'll have to wait there. It's always crowded at this place. Parking is valet, Â so make sure to have $2 ready when you come out."
6/8/2009,3 star rating,"The quality of the meat was really amazing. Service was slow... and we went on a Monday night at like 8:30PM! Oh, and the service was pretty darn sheity! Our waitress would straight up ignore us. LOL... It was kind of funny actually because I could tell she wanted us to stop ordering and just leave. I didn't think we ate a lot... They give you like a mini serving of everything. The salad dressing was HORRID... It tasted like really watered down soy sauce. The kimchi pancake was good, but the fried rice was kinda ""eh"". Their kimchi was kind of sour and not at all spicy. It's not a bad place if you have like 2 and 1/2 hours to kill and want a more chillaxed environ. compared to Manna, but I don't think I'll be going back there."
10/20/2009,4 star rating,"I am in love. The meat tastes really really fresh but I think at the rate that they go through meat here, it's bound to be fresh. I've been to several that are all pretty good but this place has 19 different choices of meat, whereas most places only has maybe 6. Sure, some of the choices may seem a bit obscure, but who cares, there's so many options! The other thing that made this place unique to my experience with kbbq is the stone grill! They give you steamed egg and a soybean stew that are both really good but what made this place really good is the kimchi fried rice at the end! So when you come here, you better not stuff yourself silly with meat, although you probably should get your $16.99 worth of meat but the fried rice is also really good and deserves some space for. I want to give them 5 stars but my experience with the service wasn't that good. I'm not sure if it's because it was busy or not. We went on a Saturday night but still, the line was not ridiculously long. Yes, there was it's constant flow of customers waiting but that doesn't say much about the service. So anyway, we got seated and they started to bring over food for us, only we had to ask 3 times just for water. Oh, and when you ask for water, they actually give you an iced barely tea/water which is perfect for bbq. Anyway, we'd ask them for something and ten minutes later we had to ask again so I didn't really like that. Overall tho, this is a pretty awesome place. Definitely come here if you've never been."
12/14/2009,4 star rating,"My sister took my hubby & me, and my cousin to this restaurant. Â We selected $16.99 all you can eat (you can pay more to get more selections). Â The quality and the flavor of the meats are great. Â Hae Jang Chon sliced beef tongues into perfect portions - not hard, just chewy. Â The salad + sidedishes (including kimchi pan cake and bean paste soup) are delicious. Â The tilted stone grill has a hole in it so that all the fat/ oil will automatically drip out. Â I like how the waitor cleaned the stone grill with shredded radish - super environmental friendly! Â The kimchi fried rice at the end is also yummy. Â I hope I get two bellies to eat there."
1/24/2010,5 star rating,"$16.99 opens the portal to the meat dimension. You get to choose from a massive list of meat styles. Between two people, we shared the Canadian pork, beef brisket, and one other thing I don't remember. It's clean on the inside, service was pretty good (I didn't have to rely on the buzzer at all), and the banchan, though lacking in numerical variety, was still excellent. You really don't need to fill up on appetizer-like banchan. If you need more rice wraps, greens, or banchan, just ask. The staff is friendly about that sort of thing.After going through your various plates of meat, the staff will clean your stone grill for you before they pile on the next course. At the end, you have the option of getting fried rice cooked on your grill. We were so full we had nowhere else to put it.The parking lot is valet only ($2). For 25 cents, you can get a small cup of coffee/tea/job's tears from the vending machine by the front door. Oh, how wonderful it all was!"
4/25/2010,2 star rating,"First, this place wrecked my stomach for 2 and a half days. Â I thought it might have been just me, but I talked to another member of our party who had similar bathroom experiences. Â Ordinarily I'd chalk this up to a bad job on the grill and undercooked meat, but I was the grill master on this trip and know what I'm doing. Â We weren't sick because of user error, we were sick because the food was somehow contaminated.It's a damn shame, too, because everything tasted great, especially the beef tongue, brisket and short ribs. Â The galbi was a little below average on flavor, but all the meats seemed like very high quality. Â Like others describe, the sauces weren't all quite as good as some other places, but the bean sauce was quite good. Â All in all, the selection and price are great.Personally, I wasn't a fan of the hot kimchi - I like my kimchi cold. Â Also, the fun police were in full effect: Â we did some soju bombs and were promptly and curtly told ""Could you not do that? Thanks."" Â Given, a few members of our party were getting a bit rowdy, but this is a Korean BBQ, where loud, drunk and smoky should be the norm, not the exception! Â Come on, people! Â Clean, quiet, and boring? Â That ain't Korean BBQ!Had I not spent most of the next two days reading magazines on the can I would've given this place 4 stars."
5/31/2010,4 star rating,"All you can eat for $22 and it's definitely worth it! Their calbi is amazing and was the groups favorite. Of course their spicy pork, thin sliced pork and brisket are all wonderful as well. It's a great atmosphere and wonderful for groups. I've been told the kimchi fried rice is wonderful so I'm going back to get that next time.My only complaint was that we had to wait over an hour or so for a table. However on that particular night there was a party of 18 ahead of us so I doubt it would be that long of a wait on a regular night."
6/13/2010,2 star rating,"went there for dinner about a week ago and I must say I was not impressed. I think its not really korean BBQ, more like korean stir fry because there wasn't an actual grill and you cook the meat by stirring it around because it doesnt really cook if you place it in only one place. Its basically using a hot plate to cook the meat but the heat is not evenly distributed so its hot in places and cold in others so you just have to keep moving the meat around, stir fry fashion.The meat itself was not impressive, everything was blank regardless of if it is marinated or not. my favorite thing is usually the bulgogi but their bulgogi was barely marinated. I have had much better. Its sad when my favorite thing from the meal were the sides that they give you because the meat was utterly unimpressive. It is not buffet style so you basically have to tell them what you want and they only let you order 5 things at a time. They wait so long bringing in the food that you just keep eating the sides and we definitely ate much more sides than actual meat. It was $18 per person and I don't think it was worth it at all."
6/25/2010,4 star rating,"Actually I'll be hitting up this place tonight so I decided to spend some time out of my day to write a review on it! The place itself is pretty hip, with christmas lights lining the walls, clean wooden tables/chairs and young people gettin' their grub on. BEWARE: There will be a wait. I don't think I've ever gone here and NOT had to wait at least a good 20-30 minutes. Worth it? Hell Chyea!The meat is cooked on a stone grill and right off the bat, they serve up some kimchi pancakes and bean sprouts. Side dishes arrive shortly after of course, with your usual sesame oil/vinegar dipping sauces. Service is decent... but on a busy night it's hard to get your server's attention. From what I remember it's like $16 ish for all you can eat and the meat quality is pretttyyyy damn good. Pig stomach is fatty but really tasty and the cow tongue is certainly worth a try. ;)There's valet parking out in front and it costs a couple bucks. I really wouldn't recommend you to go there because that would mean my wait would be prolonged! ARGH!"

10/11/2010,5 star rating,"This is a really good AYCE KBBQ joint.The price is decent, the food is fresh, but what I love the most about this place is that they use a 'marble/stone grill' which retains the meat's juices and makes em' taste better. Any KBBQ fan needs to try this spot!"
11/28/2010,5 star rating,We were in LA in August and ate here with the family to celebrate my nephew's birthday. We had reservations and we were late so we lost it. It was our fault. They even called to remind us to not be late. Your whole party must be there before they will seat you. We waited another 45 minutes before we got our table for 8. The place was packed and the smell of Korean BBQ filled the place. Out server was really cool. We all ordered the AYCE special. There were so many choices. We tried almost everything. He brought everything that we asked and he even cleaned the grill in between meat choices. The best part was when they played the techno korean bday song and everyone started clapping and singing. I'm sure my nephew will find it hard to forget this celebration. We plan to go back one and promise not to be late for our reservation.
12/5/2010,4 star rating,"AYCE KBBQ in KTOWN is a dime a dozen. You can find a bbq joint on every corner of every block in KTOWN. On that note, my sister had recommended I try Hae Jang Chon and MAN am I glad I did.AYCE is $16.99/person which is pretty much the norm at any kbbq restaurant. However, at Hae Jang Chon you get 19 meat options, steamed egg, bean paste stew, kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice!! FOODITIS here I come..again :] I personally love the beef tongue and thin sliced pork belly. Remember to save room for the kimchi fried rice though. The servers will come by and clean your grill then cook you fried rice in front of you. It's fresh, clean, and super DUH_licious.Service can be slow at times,but for the most part they're pretty efficient. Â The place is big enough to accommodate larger parties as well. Decor is cleaner than most other places and they have TV's that were showing the football game so thats an A+. Parking is a pain the arse however. The lot is small and there's only one entrance. There's some street parking, but it's not ample. If you plan on eating A LOT I guess it's not so bad to park a couple blocks away to work off everything you ate."
1/9/2011,3 star rating,"Ok, I tried this place again and went earlier during a weekend this time. The food was better than my original experience so I figured I should update my review to reflect it :) A-OK place to go. Wait can be kinda long though, so go early! The meat was better this time around, and the valet parking/bean sprouts/rice water/kim chi fried rice were still there and good. The drain thing still had trouble draining but it didn't bother me as much this time around. Maybe I got all the bad meat last time because I went so super late? Who knows. I'll have to try again to finalize my decision on this place!"
6/9/2009,2 star rating,"My boyfriend and I was on a hunt to find a late-night Korean BBQ, AYCE preferred late one Saturday night. Very ill-prepared, we ended up driving to LA knowing we were bound to find a bunch. After driving down Western for a bit on very hungry and impatient stomachs, we saw the sign for this place (I tend to go for cute signs, and the last time I did it turned out well ... Honey Pig on 8th, and this place has a pig too! so why not?)So anyways, quick summary...Likes - Valet parking lot. Pretty fast service. Yummy rice water. $16.99 AYCE and open late. Â Bean sprouts (my fav) are plenty. And kimchi fried rice! Sounds good! Dislikes - All the meat we got was like 75%+ fat. The grilling surface doesn't drain the oil. And the kimchi was really sour! Don't think I'll be coming back again.. just because the meat is the most important part for me (yea, bbq) and I really didn't enjoy it here =("
1/10/2011,4 star rating,"**4.5 stars$17.99 is a pretty good deal for ALL YOU CAN EAT Korean bbq. But, before you head on over to K-Town, here are some words of advice.1. Wear something that you will not mind soaking in the smell of oil and meat--so maybe leave your jacket in the car?2. On the note of a car, there is very minimal parking. Be prepared with quarters for street parking, or walking a few minutes from a far parking spot3. Drop someone off to go inside & put your name down on the list while you go find parking--it is VERY crowded. My group of 9 waited for 30 mins or so & it was already 8PM by the time we got seated.4. Make sure you know your meats before going. What's the difference between short ribs and ribeye? You tell me. They also have beef tongue, Â tripe & squid for the more adventurous eaters. Squid was good :)5. Go with someone who has been here before or with someone who speaks Korean. Some of the servers had trouble communicating with us & gave us normal short rib when we asked for marinated & we had trouble getting his attention. Â . .until we discovered the little button on the side of our table that calls him over. If you encounter such a server, articulate and talk loudly b/c it is pretty busy/loud in the restaurant. 6. You're in charge of managing the heat of the hot plate. We found out that you have to turn the dial down in order to RAISE the heat. Weird.7. But, don't be afraid to call for help. They will gladly cut up large pieces of meat for you, adjust the heat, or bring you more side dishes.8. On the note of side dishes--they are delicious. Unlimited rice cake papers, pickled radishes, potato/apple salad, sauces, salad & even steamed egg served in the hot rock pots.9. Definitely get the soup & kimchi fried rice at the end! It is a perfect ending to a delectable meal."
1/12/2011,3 star rating,"Went with three couples. Make a reservation if you can, if not the wait would be long.Food: we chose AYCE; not the best quality meat but okay standard for the cost ($16.99/person); there are many choices of meat; you can order up to 4 types each time, when you're almost done you can order more; comes with unlimited salad, 4 different dipping sauces, rice cake papers, radish slices; and a few side dishes (banchan); the menu explains how you eat all these together so no worries.Service: excellent service; make a good use of the bell on your table to call servers so you don't have to try flagging them down; there were many servers helping you refill stuff and turn your meats on the grill for you, etc.; most speak English which is pretty convenient.Ambience/Location: a typical busy Korean BBQ place; the only annoying thing I found was the birthday song, whenever there's a birthday celebration they played REALLY LOUD annoying happy birthday song/music or whatever you wanna call it, while we were there they probably played about 6 or 7 different times, some in a row!; besides that the atmosphere was fine. Located on 6th between Serrano/Hobart; $2 valet or street meter parking."
1/30/2011,3 star rating,"Beef Tongue...Yummmy! in my stomach: Â AYCE Deal for Dinner ~$20 including tax/tip- Beef Tongue (4-5 stars)- Briskets (4 stars)- Calbi (2-3 stars)- Spicy Pork (2 stars)- Ban Chans (3 stars, very limited)In my mind: It was my first time at this place. This place is definitely well ventilated than other places though I still have the KBBQ smell afterwards. Would not the recommended this place if you are starving and cravin' some meat since the stone grill is a SLOW cooker (meaning..there's a lot of waiting time that ruins your appetite). Though the idea of a stone grill is cool. The service is great compared to the other AYCE, they help you grill, clean your grill with radish and is prepared provide service. Meat quality for the un-marinated stuff ie: brisket and beef tongue were good, not sure if i'm a fan of other stuff. They also have Kim Chi fried rice at the end but I'm here for the meat, not for kim chi fried rice. Overall, 3-4 stars for the food because of the limited variety on meat selection. Popular place at night. Try to make a reservation to avoid the wait. Valet parking ($2). Â Highlights: Stone grill, great service, delicious beef tongue and briskets"
3/13/2011,2 star rating,I think I'm missing something. This place was just not good. Not really any other way to describe it. Short rib and brisket seemed to be noticeably low quality. Bulgogi was extremely lacking in flavor. Kimchi fried rice was much better than I thought it would be. I had kbbq the night before at Incheonwon in Garden Grove and it was just on a different level than this place. Sitting on stools on a crowded patio was not ideal either.
3/20/2011,4 star rating,"I love this place!!! This is by far one of the best kbbqs out there. They have great meat and they have the best sides ever!!!! Plus, it's right down the street from a Karaoke place.I've been to this place twice, I had good and bad service. Sadly, I'm kind of used to the hit or miss service at AYCE bbqs. Expect it! The food is definitely worth it XDI'd give this place 5 stars if the service was there all the time. I'm going again soon, so I'll be sure to update this review. ^ ^"
4/13/2011,4 star rating,I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love the food. I hate the wait. Every time I come here I have to wait at least an hour. So if you plan to come here at night and your party is too small for a reservation on the weekdays then plan to wait at least 30 mins. Â I guarantee it. The food is actually pretty good. They cook it on a stone and not the metal grill. It has to be super hot though to cook though so waiting for pork belly to cook may be an event. The place is medium size. Â Don't expect a huge place.
4/20/2011,2 star rating,"This was my second visit to Hae Jang Chon and although I'm not so happy to say, I was quite disappointed with my experience Â this time. Â I went to dinner with a party of nine and got there fairly early, around 6pm and put our name on the list. Â For whatever reason, they didn't get us a table until 8:45PM!! Â I've NEVER EVER had to wait over 2 hours for a table. Â They first told us your table will be ready in roughly an hour to hour fifteen, but for whatever some odd reason, they kept pushing back the time. Â When we finally got our table, they didn't really take the time to ask us what meats we wanted to order--rather, they were just acting as if they were in a super hurry. Â Overall, the food was good, but I was very disappointed in the lack of service, and even the kimchi fried rice didn't taste as good as I've experienced in the past--it was much more greasy this time than ever before.The overall bill wasn't so much for a large group, but my experience overall this time wasn't as impressive as I had I expected. Â If I plan to go next time, I'll see if I'm able to make reservations prior to my visit. Â As Yelp's rating describes (2 stars = ""Meh. I've experienced better,"" it really states the truth about my visit--I've had better experiences in the past. Â I'm willing to give it another try for sure!"
4/21/2011,5 star rating,"i went twice for dinner two days in a row. BEST KBBQ IN LA.SO MANY QUALITY CHOICES. they start you off with a bunch of typical sides and your choice of meat. the great thing is, it doesnt end there. you also get kimchi pancake, fried rice, and soup. all that food for $18 is so rare in la. note: there is a long wait and they have a parking lot but its valet. so look for street parking behind the restaurant."

5/23/2011,4 star rating,"This place is seriously amazing!Once again, I'm on a Korean BBQ adventure with my boyfriend and after yelping, we saw that Hae Jang Chon beats every other place in terms of ratings and reviews.Pros:1. Meat selection is amazing! (Brisket, squid, chicken, etc.)2. Staff is extremely welcoming and nice3. Great atmosphere Recommendation:You definitely need to try the beef bulgogi! One of the things I really enjoy about this particular place is the cleaning style of the grill. It's extremely unique but I'm not going to spoil your experience by writing what it's all about.In addition, I like that they have so much in store for their customers. Kimchi pancakes (delicious), kimchi fried rice (delicious), and the sides are plentiful.The only con about this place is the slightly expensive price for AYCE but aside from that, it's definitely my top choice when it comes to a Korean BBQ place in K-town."

6/14/2011,4 star rating,First thing first make a reservation. This place is insanely packed.All you can eat KBBQ earns 2 stars right there. The meat was not frozen when it came out like some other places I have been to. Another star there. But this place was so packed the waiters were running all over the place even the button didn't quiet get their attention as quick as we would have liked. Â -1 starBut they when we did get their attention they were very quick with the next round of meats +1 Overall I was very pleased with the food.
6/14/2011,5 star rating,"I love korean bbq and this place is definitely one of the better ones out there. I'm not saying it has the best meat out there, but it's pretty much on top of what I usually eat. The price for the meats you get is also very good.The service was quick and friendly. No need to wait around too long to order your next round of beef.The wait wasn't too bad on a Saturday evening, I had to wait about 30 mins to get a table."
6/19/2011,3 star rating,ehhh... Â  edible but ive had better? Â  It might have been because you cook the meat here on a stone instead of a regular grill? not sure? lolservice here was incredible and probably one of the best for all you can eat restaurants but i felt as if the meat and the marination could have Â been better. Â There wasnt much variety in terms of marinated meat but on the plus side sea food is included in the all you can eat option which is different from most other places where you have to pay extra. Â  The side dishes here were tasty. It was hard trying to not eat them since i came here for the meat :P

It's loud and fun. I already want to go back."
6/21/2011,3 star rating,"3.5 is what I gave this place.Korean BBQ cooked over a stone skillet thing? WHAAAAAAAAAT?That's what I thought at first. Then we saw the long line and the packed restaurant, we all expected it to be amazing.We had the all you can eat deal and we ordered almost everything from the menu. Bulgogi - the marinade was good but the cuts of beef or quality of it wasn't that great in my opinion. I just didn't taste that great Beef Short Ribs - I'm pretty sure we ordered this. I'm used to my short ribs actually having the bone. Well, ours didn't have any bones and it also didn't taste that great. Similiar to the bulgogi but the meat wasn't that great.Pork - It was ehhh, it was alright. I usually go for the marinated stuff and I didn't care too much about the porkSquid - It was decent, but i prefer the spicier marinade at other restaurants than the sweet one they used here. The squid was definitely better than the octopus in my opinion.Side Sides - They were great and were refilled very quickly. Rice paper and kimchi was refilled almost as fast as they were consumed.Customer Service was EXCELLENT. The guy that waited on us was very fast, attentive, and courteous. The customer service was what kept my rating at 3.5 and not a 2.Wait was a bit long and parking was a hassle though."
6/30/2011,5 star rating,"The best amount of food you can get for your money! Â The last time I was there, we had 9 people who had all-you- can-eat and ordered 6 tall Hite beers for the table, and our total came out to $23.60/person after tax!!!The waiters there are very attentive and very helpful, especially if you are new to the whole process, and if you forget to turn your meat over in the skillets, they'll come by like clockwork to make sure everyone's coming out right!You leave feeling completely stuffed and happy for a very reasonable price. Â I've only been there with large groups and everyone's always had a very good time. Â Highly recommend it!"
7/10/2011,4 star rating,"Even though we made a reservation, it kicked us back by 20 min, but considering that we were close to 30 people, I didn't think of it as that big of a deal.This was really good all you can eat. THe briskets and the pork belly were excellent, the bulgogi and short ribs were alright. If i had to do it all over again, i'd pile on the brisket even more so than last time (um how did we order 5 orders of brisket?) the chicken takes way way too long to cook. The parking, yes! valet in front of the restaurant for cheap. I didn't feel too sick afterwards, and even the morning after I didn't get horrible meat headaches or stomach pains (meat nightmares on the other hand, yes)and of course all of you who only care about the dollars you spent, this place was pretty cheap for the quality of meat."

I have been here many times when I lived in LA and I keep coming back because this place has decent service and unique stone grills. Â The meat of course is about the same quality as all the other AYC korean bbq places in Ktown. Â We came on a friday night around 7pm and waited about 40 mins to be seated which was fine because it gave my friends and I sometime to catch up. Â There is always a wait for this place so expect at least a 30-40 mins wait on the weekends.

We waited about 10 minutes, and were seated. All the plate of side dishes were set up and all the servers were nice and attentive and fast. However, what I realized was that they meat quality was just horrible.The brisket should have certain amount of fat but our were just meat. chewy meat...The marinated meat and pork were okay, but still I could feel that the quality was just horrible... not only this place, but the whole KTOWN bbq places.Now, I decided to go to NON AYCE bbq place if I have a chance...."
9/8/2011,4 star rating,"It's open late. Â AwesomenessThe staff won't cut you any slack. you better know what the hell you're doing, cause they don't want to explain it.We ordered one dish of bulgolgi 'cause we weren't feelin hungry enough to chow down the all you can eat special.It's a good thing, cause the ONE dish was enough food for two people. Â A bit overcooked for my tastes but didn't ruin the experienceSpeaking of that, be careful when you order the stuff that ISN'T the all you can eat - cuz they probably are gonna cook it for you. Â That surprised us... and them too apparently... we came in, the guy chucked the bean sprouts and kimchee on the grill and dashed off. Â When we ordered, Â he took away our grill with the kimchee and sprouts. Â Dangit!! Â Not only were we expecting to grill it ourselves, but those sprouts were lookin mighty good! Â Oh gods of kimchee and bean sprouts, forgive us for our insolent wastefulness.There is also soju to choose from. Â I asked for lemon with it, which confounded and/or displeased our waitress, but she eventually showed up with a small bottle of lemon juice... ok. sure. why not?? Â This is also a good people watching place, because the place isn't ultra cheap, the food is good and you kind of ""have to know"" what's up - so you get a lot of interesting characters coming through. Â From the hoochie'd out korean girls (gosh I hate that) to the black dude on a date behind us, to people looking like they're conducting late night power meetings. Â Fun times."
9/20/2011,4 star rating,"Out of all the AYCE places, this is my fave. I like their cha dol(brisket), sam gyup sal (pork belly-thick), and the tongue. Their marinated gal bi is not bad either. They bring you the steamed which I really like. Their kimchee pancake is alsogood. As you've read in other reviews, their kimchee fried rice is really good. Can't wait to come back."
9/21/2011,4 star rating,"Actually went here as a suggestion from my sister, she's on the atkin's diet with her boyfriend so they frequently enjoy hitting up AYCE KBBQ places. With that said, I went here with 7 other people for first time and it was more than enough food when we all ordered the $16.99 AYCE, I loved that they gave a whole bunch of choices in meat, and more side dishes than most AYCE Kbbq places do. I suggest going early to avoid the long wait, also if your in a big party ask for another grill. They'll give you a crazy looking one that tilts in an odd direction to spill out all the oil but its so worth it because you'll cook food twice as fast with a big party. The kimchi is nice and spicy :D so yummy! The choices in 4 sauces is a plus you can dip your meats in the different combinations. Hang Jang Chon is a definite must try out of the many AYCE's in LA!"
9/22/2011,4 star rating,"The only problem with this place is the wait on weekends! So if you're starving, it's probably not a good idea to go here. The side dishes were ok and the meat was good. BUT if I had a choice between this place or Road to Seoul (down the street), I would definitely pick Road to Seoul. The food and atmosphere is definitely better there and I feel like they appreciate their customers there. Not the best Korean bbq I've ever had."
9/24/2011,5 star rating,"Best AYCE Korean BBQ I've ever had, hands down. We had a korean with us who was an old regular and knew what to order, so that helped to. But they have a great selection of different cuts of meat. Had the pork shoulder for the first time, and the kalbi - which is offered everywhere - is phenomenal here. The side dishes and the salad keep everything from getting too heavy, even though we couldn't resist overeating."
11/15/2011,4 star rating,"45 minute wait on a Friday night for 6 ppl! They sat us at a smaller table and placed our salad bowl on a side table. The food was great!! Service was spotty, especially when requesting our next plate of meat, it seemed like they took their time. Favorites were definitely the chadolbaegi and the thick cut pork belly! The marinated kalbi came in a close second. Thankful for how they would clean the cooking stone after a few rounds of meat- especially for the marinated kalbi. The salad they have there is SOOO good. Must've filled up on the salad which left less room for meat. :($16.99 for AYCE here is definitely a steal!"

Â My personal favorites are: kalbi, beef brisket, squid, and thick pork belly. Â I like that they make kim chi fried rice for you at the end with your leftover meat on the grill. Â Even though you're so full by then, it's so good that you'll make room for it. Â The soybean paste soup at the end is good too, especially on a cold day.Service is better than expected. Â They clean the grill for you when they bring you new meat without even asking and they'll even cut up the meat for you at times too. Â Since our group wasn't korean, we found their good service to be a nice surprise :)"
11/24/2011,4 star rating,"Who doesn't love ACYE KBBQ? You know what is even better? AYCE Kbbq that closes late!This place closes at 2 so for those of us that has a bigger appetite later in the night its perfect. The selection of meat here is quite good. Meat quality is average, just like any other kbbq places. Their service is actually pretty good for a kbbq place. Always get whatever we asked for without waiting for too long. One of the thing that stands out about this place is the fact that they clean your grill every time they bring out a new plate of meat which is awesome! Your grill will never get too burnt like other places where they change it only because they absolutely have to.Their fried rice in the end is pretty good too. Its simple but so good :DP.s their squid is so good near the end of the meal! pair it with some beer.. mmmmm (:"
12/12/2011,4 star rating,"This place really deserves a 4.5 but I'm going to give it a 4 because I am reserving the rights to 5 stars at an ayce korean bbq place for Road to Seoul. I blame Hae Jang Chon for 30% of the 5 lbs I gained two summers ago. Every time I was craving korean bbq, I headed over to Hae Jang Chon. I just couldn't shake off those meat + kimchi fried rice + beer cravings. I love Hae Jang Chon because of the dome shaped grill, the quality of the meats, the price (~$17 for ayce), and the friendly service. The location is great. It's right next to Nandarang and across the street from Haus if you have any room afterwards to grab some drinks or dessert. Favorites: Marinated short rib, bbq chicken, pork belly and hot dog. This is my favorite ayce kbbq place to eat pork belly because the dome shaped grill allows for the fat to drip off to the sides, while leaving the pork tender. At most metal grills, the pork belly is either too oily or dries up like bacon. My favorite way to eat it here? Put some kimchi on top of the pork belly, slightly marinating the pork and heating up the kimchi at the same time. The flavors in the kimchi intensify by the heat and is the perfect accompaniment to the pork. Tongue is a favorite of mine and is good here but is better at some other places. & Make sure to save room for that kimchi fried rice. I love it when fried rice is made over stone pots/grills because it slightly chars the rice, making an almost nooroogjee texture in the fried rice. Awesomenessssssss ~Be warned. The place isn't too big so if you come too late, you'll be stuck in long lines."
12/13/2011,5 star rating,"Best AYCE korean bbq I have ever been to. We always get the 16.99 for 16 types of meat. The beef tongue is awesome.The waiters are extremely nice and they always ask us if we want more meat. Once it was getting busy and they asked us if we wanted to order a lot at once just in case they won't be able to keep coming to our table. They even come and clean your grill several times throughout the meal. After you're done you can ask them for the kimchi fried rice and the bean paste soup, which they fry on your grill."
12/22/2011,4 star rating,"Bullet points:Good things:Great meat. FOr $20, this place has a good variety of fresh, quality meat. cute decor.Bad:Horrible service - they were just NOT attentive. One of the waiters came by asked us what we needed but before we could answer, he left...what the?! They were NOT even crazy busy...maybe they only had 2 waitstaff?Banchan: they don't give lettuce with the meat. that is extra. i thought...WHAAAAT? ssam is not included...?!?!I gave it four stars because of the meat. That's what bbq is all about, right? yup."
12/25/2011,3 star rating,"I think this place is popular for the low price that works perfect for young students who can eat A LOT. Â We waited 45 min for a table and I didn't feel I got my money's worth.Don't get me wrong, the meat is tender and flavorful with the dips. Â There are appetizers and pancakes and such beside the meat. Â The wait staff is on top of things to keep the tables moving. Â They have it down tight - and we were out of there in 20 min!You see, after waiting too long for a table, we were so hungry and wolfed down whatever we got our hands on. Â And since we ate too fast, we also got full fast. Â I know it's lame -but I don't have an elastic stomach! Â If there is a lesson to be learned, is to pace yourself and plan for a long night..."
1/6/2012,4 star rating,"$16.99 for very good AYCE kbbq. They do use a different kind of grill, more of a pan, which I don't like AS much, but still very tasty. The pan didn't drain as well, so it felt like the meat were all just cooking in their own fat/oil, which adds flavor, but makes you feel pretty gross after eating so much of it. Service is good, although they were a bit OCD about where we put our dishes. They insisted on making sure everyone had access to every dish on the table, even though one of our friends couldn't eat half of it due to her diet, and every time we rearranged the table, they'd come back and put everything back in front of her. Very odd, not sure why it mattered to them so much. But they sure are attentive!We all loved the brisket. I like the marinated short rib. We also had the beef tongue, thin and thick pork belly, and unmarinated short rib. Brisket and marinated short rib were my favorites. I really liked their kimchee pancake as well as their bean paste soup. The soup wasn't so salty like some other places. Not a ton of banchan though and the steam egg portion was super tiny, probably like 4 bites in each bowl. The place gets super crowded. We were lucky enough to get reservaions for 6:30, but I think there were people who waited more than an hour for a table."
1/10/2012,4 star rating,"YAY!!- AYCE KBBQ for about $20 a person- Opened until 2AM- Friendly staff & great service- Kimchi Friend Rice =]BOO!!- Parking sucks, but you can valet for $5- LONG. ASS. WAIT.I thought, this place must be bomb if the wait is sooooo long. It's a pretty small place. But it's clean, the meat is good, the service is unusually great for a KBBQ joint and the staff is real friendly. And after every plate, they clean the bbq grill. I was VERY impressed with that. The only thing was we had a party of 20 and they had to split us up into 4 tables, so we didn't get to sit together. But then we were already waiting for 2hrs =\"
2/10/2012,5 star rating,"I've been to this place several times and it never disappoints. Â It's my go to Korean BBQ spot. Â And it's a shame I haven't rated them yet.My favorite place shut down and I found this by way of recommendation. Â It's pretty typical to other places I've been to. Â Food is great. Pricing is great. Side dishes great.I mean what can I say here that hasn't been said??Why I like this place over others is that the staff (or at least the dude that helped us) spoke english fairly well and was able to make recommendations on how to eat certain meats. He also explained the sauces and sides.Also, he's constantly checking to make sure we're good and he cleans the grill when it gets grimy. Â I felt like he cared that we enjoy our experience here.Service is what really sells me about this place. Â When I come here I feel like they want my business. Â Unlike other places where I get this weird ""you shouldn't be eating here"" vibe.The place is kind of small, and can feel a bit cramped. Â I've sat in almost every booth and table. Â I'll never sit in the corner back booth behind the bathrooms again tho. Â The heat kind of accumulates there. Â So it gets hot. And the grill seemed a bit too close to me. Â I don't have that experience when I sit in other areas... oh well.I like this place. Â You will too. The only thing that sucks is parking. Â Good luck my friends..."
2/25/2012,4 star rating,"Pretty good deal for AYCE Korean BBQ. We made a reservation while driving to the restaurant. Valet was $2. We waited maybe 10 minutes for a group of 6. The meat was of good quality and marinated well. Marinated short ribs and beef tongue was delicious.Best thing about this was that there's unlimited kimchee pancake and boiled egg. Also, they make kimchee fried rice for you at the end if you choose to get it. The thing that we didn't like about this place was that you had a choice between kimchee fried rice or white rice. You can only have one. A couple of my friends wanted white rice and when they asked for more, they told us that it would be charged extra for white rice. Who charges for white rice?! It should be free! If anything, they should be glad that customers want rice because it will fill us up and eat less of the meat. Just a suggestion...All in all, it was a good experience."
2/27/2012,4 star rating,"Dined here last night with my family, and the wait wasn't so bad since it was a Sunday night. But I did drive by the restaurant once on a Saturday night and JEEZ, I definitely would never wait in a line with over 40 people for a small restaurant. By the way, you can make a reservation if you have a party of 6 or more. Valet is $2, and you kind of have to valet. There is NO parking anywhere in this area so $2 isn't so bad.The customer service once we sat down was amazing! Always had someone to make sure we had everything we needed, and they always cleaned the grill after every round of items were finished. The meat wasn't all that special, but the customer service is what got me. I'm used to having to flag down people at these kinds of restaurants, but the servers were really good about making sure we had everything.Overall... I wouldn't waste my time waiting for this place. There are so many korean bbq restaurants in the area, you can have the same food at the same price just by walking down the street. The thing that makes this place 4 stars for me is the customer service."
3/21/2012,4 star rating,"The Wait is TERRIBLE!!!!If it wasn't for the wait.... i really liked their quality of food... and actually, their service wasn't that bad. Â it was actually pretty good from what i remember. Â i thought it was weird that they serve sausages (hotdogs). Â HOTDOGS?!?! Â i thought they were korean hot dogs, but no! they told me costco hotdogs... hmmmm.... yeah, no hotdog for me please~ Â it was really nice that they make the kimchi bibimbap (fried rice) at the end... we asked them to put bulgogi (marinated boneless beef) into our bibimbap and they gladly did it.... they even commented how good it is! Â and it WAS good. Â not a good place if you're on a diet, but indeed, good quality meat korean ayce place~ Â but the wait... oyi...."
5/3/2012,4 star rating,"Some good food here. Fast service and delicious. $18 pp gets you unlimited access to chicken, beef, pork and more. Also comes with side dishes, unlimited kimchi pancake, kimchi fried rice or steamed rice, and steamed egg!The only thing I have about this place (like many places in LA) is there is a parking lot but you have to pay $2 for them to valet park. No choice. Also they don't use their tables efficiently. There were like 3 tables in the main room sitting idly while there was a 45 minute line. Only when it was almost our turn did they finally go and set up those tables for use. What...?"
5/21/2012,5 star rating,"the BEST ktown bbq place in LA. Whenever i have friends who come to LA and want kbbq, i always take them here. As long as they notify me at least a couple hours in advance though... because boy can this place get packed!!! I came here once with 3 others once and waited more than two HOURS to get a seat because we didn't make any reservation! so RESERVE, RESERVE, RESERVE! even if you don't think there will be a lot of people, RESERVE! parking here is validated for $2, which isn't too bad considering it's LA.Their customer service is fantastic compared to road to seoul, and i love all the dishes they lay out for us including a big bowl of salad. for all you can eat (17.99$ i think) you get all the meat you want (duh), kimchi pancake, steamed egg, and kimchi fried rice after you finish all the meat you want to eat! You can always ask for more of the pancake/egg/rice too! And after eating, if you possibly have more room in your stomach, walk on over across the street to HAUS, a cafe with great shaved ice! ;) by that point, you'll be exploding and wishing you didn't eat so much :P"
6/15/2012,4 star rating,All you can eat for $17.99/person and the selection isn't bad.$2.00 for a coke.$6.50 for Hite beer.Service was good.Would probably come back again.They need more parking spaces and tables!

It was a great experience. We got here before 6pm because it gets very crowded. The owner, Sunny, came to our table to ensure our experience was a good one. You can't go wrong here."
12/21/2014,4 star rating,All you can eat with great meat choices that cant be beat. The marinated meat is descent but nothing crazy and the aide dishes are really good.They only take reservations for 8 I believe which makes going there with little kids a bit difficult or small parties because the line gets big very quickly.

10/22/2014,5 star rating,"Hands down one of the best Korean BBQ ever. Â The quality of the food was so good, from the side dishes they give you to their meat. Â Everything was on point. Â It was our first time there and we were very impressed with everything. Â We will be back for sure. Â The price was decent it was most definitely worth it. Â The service and the staff there was so friendly they are always checking up on you making sure you have enough to eat!"
2/8/2015,3 star rating,"Food not bad, price pretty good. Not the best Korean AYCE in LA, but pretty solid. Stay away from the BBQ pork, make a reservation if you can. They pack people in like sardines, so if you don't like being jostled and squashed, this isn't the place for you."
7/22/2013,2 star rating,"I came in with my family over the weekend and while we were among the first groups there and the restaurant only had three other tables the service was incredibly slow. To make matters worse, the meat was not that great (te Galbi was ok, though). The selection of sides was also fairly limited. And to add insult to injury the valet working the plaza is incredibly rude."
6/2/2014,5 star rating,"Went to Hae Jang Chon the first night my boyfriend and I were in LA. The place was packed for a Monday night (11 pm). We waited for a LONG time - about an hour. But when we were seated, the table was already set with side dishes, utensils, and water. I was seriously impressed with how this place did business and could see why there'd be an hour wait. The service was fantastic! Our waitress quickly gave us menus before going to man at least 6 other tables. Almost immediately after closing our menus, she rushed over to take our order. I couldn't have asked for better service at this crowded restaurant.We got the all you can eat choice (4 dishes of your choice from a list). We had the kimchi pancake, pork belly, bulgogi, and kalbi. The food was amazing. I couldn't imagine having better quality food at midnight. The meats were either marinated or could be dipped in the sauces provided. The marinades and the sauces tasted wonderful and each complemented the meats well, in their own respective ways. The kimchi pancake was spicy but was balanced out by the bready exterior. My boyfriend and I ended up devouring all of our sides throughout the meal and our waitress kindly brought us more and more after we kept finishing off our favorites.I couldn't recommend this place more highly after my experience here. Although it's crowded at night, it'll definitely be worth the wait for the food. Next time I'm in LA I'm definitely going to come here again!"
1/5/2014,1 star rating,You'd think a Sunday afternoon would be a great time to hit up an AYCE. NOT HERE. Empty tables surrounded us and we still managed to wait over 20 minutes until someone took our order. Mind you we are sitting right in front where servers and cooks can see us. After waiting an additional 35 minutes we decided to walk out. Will never go here again. At least we got some free Kim chi for waiting 55 minutes!

4/26/2014,4 star rating,"This is probably one of the best AYCE KBBQ in Los Angeles. Great meat choices and love their side dishes, sauces, and bonus was their steamed eggs, kimchi pancakes, and kimchi fried rice at the end. The only reason they lost their star with me is that their shrimp was not de-veined, and the bulgogi meat was too fatty for my liking. I didn't experience poor service that the other yelpers mentioned, in fact, the servers there were attentive and nice considering how busy the restaurant was at the time. I highly recommend Hae Jang Chon and I will definitely go there again!"
7/4/2012,4 star rating,"Tried this place out for AYCE during lunch time. For 17.99 you get panchan (veggies, potato salad, radish, kimchee, bean sprouts, fish cakes), kimchee pancake, steamed egg, all you can eat meat, salad, kimchee fried rice, and some kind of bean soup which we did not try. plus rice wraps, radish for wrapping your meat, and 4 sauces. (dinner price the same for AYCE)For meats we tried beef brisket, marinated kalbi, bulgogi, and small octopus. The bulgogi was NOT good! I would highly recommend NOT ordering it. Unfortunately that's the meat they gave us the most of. Everything else was tasty. What stood out most about this place was the GREAT service, cooking on a hot stone, and the kimchee fried rice you get at the end! I was so full and wished I could take it home. Save some room for it cuz it is delicious! Overall not my favorite Korean BBQ place in terms of the meat, but the service was better than any other place I've been to. It was also clean, felt well ventilated and wasn't too loud. The waiters also spoke good English which is great for us non- Korean folk. There is valet parking in the lot but we found free street parking a block away."
10/7/2014,5 star rating,Best Korean BBQ ever ! The service is great and the waitress was super nice! So worth the wait.
6/27/2014,4 star rating,Great place to grab kbbq. They use stone grills to cook the food. Service pretty quick too. They have a good selection of food plus the quality is pretty good too. They also make kimchi fried rice which is also pretty bomb.

6/25/2012,5 star rating,"WAIT. SO GOOD! I'm so sad that I just discovered this place a month before moving out of Ktown. I've been having an overload of Korean food for the past year, but Hae Jang Chon has captured my heart, mind, and stomach. I'm not even sure what made the meal so good...it was just krn bbq. OH WAIT...maybe it was the succulent Kalbi and marinated squid and kimchi fried rice and bean curd soup to top off the meal. I was the size of a balloon by the end of all that food and it put me in a very serious case of food coma. Though there are MANY all you can eat krn bbq's in the neighborhood, Hae Jang Chon seems to have not only the best tasting, but also the best quality meat. That KALBI!!! i'm still dreaming...."
11/23/2014,5 star rating,One of the best deals ever! We went around 5pm so didn't have to wait much. The food was good and the service was extremely attentive. They kept coming back to ask if we want more bbq. The sides are extremely delicious as well!
6/21/2012,5 star rating,"Definitely one of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ places. Besides the rather long wait, I really can't find too much faults. Meat is really good, service is spectacular for a KBBQ place, and side dishes are great too. I think what really makes it for me is the great service. The servers there are really on top of it with replenishing side dishes, bringing more water, and they'll even help with cooking the meat. And watching them clean the stone grill is always interesting!Basically, whenever I crave kbbq, I'll go for Hae Jang Chon."
10/12/2009,5 star rating,"The business card says Haejangchon Dolgooi Restaurant.We got there a little after 5:30 on a Saturday night and the place was less than a third full. Â The place itself is in a small strip mall. Â Parking is only valet or if you're lucky, you can find grab one of the spots on the street out front and park at a meter.So we sit down and the first thing I notice after the 55"" flat screen with the Florida/LSU game on is the stone grill (Dolgooi). Â Not the typical metal grill. Â It was set at a slight angle and on one end, a hole. Â It's so the grease can drain into a drip pan while the meat is cooking.We all went for the AYCE and within a couple of minutes, all of the panchan and other stuff was brought out. Â We got another dish that had fermented soybean paste and on the other side was some sauces. Â  We also got a stack of rice paper and sliced pickled radishes. Â We ordered four meats to start with. Â The meat came out and even the way the meat was laid out looks really nice and all organized. Â Before she brought out the meat, she brought out kimchi, put that on the grill, kimchi pancake as well as spicy bean.The meat was really good. Â Really fresh and of good quality. Â They cooked our unmarinated meats first. Â We ordered the Black Angus beef, beef brisket, and thick Canadian pork belly. Â All were very good. Â The pork belly was like massive pieces of bacon and after cooking for a little bit, she came back and cut them up into smaller pieces. Â We also had the spicy pork which they put in a tray made out of foil to keep the flavors from mixing with the other meats. Â It was excellent. Â From there we had the marinated short ribs (twice), squid, and baby octopus. Â So overall, the quality of the meat was a 4.5, but the extra 1/2 star was for the service like many have also said. Â Our server was the middle-aged lady and she was great. She got us everything with a smile, explained what everything was and also how to use the rice papers, etc. Â So the meal was finished off with kimchi fried rice. Â The fried rice had strips of seaweed, chopped kimchi and sesame oil and a small bowl of soup. Â The fried rice was cooked on the Dolgooi. Â Both again were excellent. Â We all left very satisfied and full. Â By about 6:30 pm the place got PACKED.Although the food is great, as others have said, perhaps the best part about this place is the service. Â Our server was friendly, helpful, brought us our food quickly, and always had a smile. Â I'm looking forward to going back soon."
11/9/2009,4 star rating,"This place is simply awesome. Â For 16.99 I can eat the whole barn and have room for the 25 cents vending machine coffee. Â The coffee is actually good!Yes the service is lacking at times which is why I took off one star, but for those people who just keep complaining and gave this place 1 or 2 stars, how much are you paying for an all you can eat dinner again?*16 f_ing 99*So you expect the same level of service as in Rubicon? Â Pony about *116.99* and I bet they might lick your shoes.And since when did you get great service from a buffet? Â How about none?! Â You are supposed to get your own food anyways so consider it a saving grace that they are willing to bring your meat out, and clean your grill every hour or so.And Chosun Kalbi? Â You must be kidding me if you are comparing this place to that. Â That's like comparing Outback to Morton's! Â The intelligence of some posters are truly eye opening."
3/13/2010,2 star rating,I love Korean bbq and I've eating at a hand full of different places I tend to eat at the same places if they're good. I would not recommend this restaurant unless your starving and in the mood to wait. It wasn't very expensive though luckily $17 all you can eat per person. They did have $2 valet right in front which I thought was good for K Town. Although the wait wasn't that bad there wasn't any where to wait it felt like you were standing in the middle of everyone's dinner. Our waitress was pretty rude didn't cook our meat nor check on us at all but I guess that's what you can expect not being Korean at a fobby Korean restaurant. The meat was okay probably would have been a little better if it wasn't cooked on a hot plate and a little more flavoring wouldn't have hurt. The kim-chi fried rice was okay I'm not a big fan. My friend actually recommended this place to me and said he loved the kim-chi fried rice so you can be the judge of that. Over all I had a good time eating dinner with my two friends I was visiting we had something to bitch and laugh about :)

5/4/2010,5 star rating,"If you've ever stepped into K-town in LA you should know that Korean AYCE BBQ is major bullet point right along with froyo and cafes.I've been a regular with AYCE joints since birth, so I know a thing or two.Having been to several Korean AYCE BBQs in Ktown, this is by far my favorite. Â Reasonable price and probably the best quality and experience.The stone cooking surface, fried kimchi, kimchi fried rice, and the fact that they clean your cooking surface with radish shreds is unmatched anywhere else.I recommend this place to everyone I know."
5/26/2010,3 star rating,"Took one star off due to the lack of service and wait time even after we had made a reservation. Â We had a group of 10 at 730pm but didn't get seated until almost an hour later and had to split up the group in 2 separate tables. Â The meat was definitely more quality than most places and better yet, if you start early enough....then you have until 2am! Â I will say the side dishes we had were different than other tables. Â It seemed not all tables got the same sides. Â Oh, and every once in awhile, the servers come by to clean the grill. Â Gotta check it out first hand on how its done. Â It's also hard to find parking. Â Don't waste the time, just pay to valet. Â The price is reasonable and if you like all you can eat, then this is a place for you!"
6/16/2010,2 star rating,"Meat quality was not that great just like majority of korean bbq. Â The worst part is the stone grill, I never knew I would end up making steamed brisket with all the moisture from previous meats ordered.The kim chi fried rice is pretty good too bad it comes at the end when I am already full. Â I would rather just eat at Korea house in Rowland Heights or Gyu Kaku in Pasadena."
6/19/2010,4 star rating,"Because this was my first time legitly cooking meet at a Korean BBQ place, I must say that I really enjoyed my experience. The all you can eat deal was well worth it as our party of 6 ate 12 orders. The marinated bulgogi / beef tongue / short rib were definitely some of my favorites, though most of the stuff we ate was pretty good. The pork shoulder, however, was too chewy and a little hard to chew and I was not impressed my the pig intestines. I'm usually a big fan but I think our party didn't cook it right so it turned out extremely chewy. I'm wiling to overlook it though because everything else was great. The side dishes are extremely delicious and I love the radish and other wraps that are given. The complimentary salad is also extremely delicious and goes amazingly with the meat.The service was in between mediocre and decent. The workers were nice when they came to cook the meat but when we asked for more water, or salad, or wraps, it took a while for them to refill.I was rather surprised that my clothes didn't spell like KBBQ afterwards. I didn't expect the ventilation to be so good but I bet it's also because the restaurant wasn't busy when we went. Overall, this place was extremely delicious and I would definitely recommend it to any friend that is in the area"
8/26/2010,4 star rating,"I have been to many Korean BBQ but this stands out because of the way you have to cook the meat. In the middle of the table is a clay circle cooking thing. The meats cook great on it, but they don't get crispy so if you like to wait until your meat gets crispy don't except it hear. I usually get the same meats at each place i go, pork belly, bulgogi, and some other kind of beef, i usually just point to it. The sides hear are also great, the salad is good, the fish cakes are great and a little spicy, and the kimchi pancake is great as well. If you are coming hear i would recommend calling ahead, i forgot to do this last time and i wanted for an hour and 15 minutes."
8/28/2010,5 star rating,"Of all the different ayce kbbq in ktown, I'd say that this place is my favorite. Â First of all, this place uses a ceramic grill and the meat keeps a lot of ""meat juice"". Â That is yumlicious. Â Second, there is an amazingly wide selection of appetizers/side dishes/meat to choose from, and the staff is SUPER friendly and responsive. Â Our waitress was joking around with us and made many useful recommendations. Â Third, the atmosphere was pretty cozy and relaxing, and our table stayed for a good 2 hours without having the usual annoying waitress rushing you business. Â In all, it was a very wonderful and delicious experience. Â The only downside was the wait... I don't know if they take reservations, but if they do make sure you get a reservation. Â We waited a good hour to be seated, and my stomach was crying."

I must hand it to my GPS that this was the best location it ever guided me to *high five*We got there about 19:00, so there was no wait and parking on the street was plentiful. When we got in, we got a table right away and looked through the menu to see what what was offered. I seriously did not know it was an ALL YOU CAN EAT join until i saw the sign inside the restaurant. So we started off with some super tasty pork belly (oh man they were good), pork shoulders, beef, and seafood.Being a n00b at a place like this, the waitress helped us to cook and cut up the meat when they were about to be ready. After a few round of cooking, we learned to handle them ourselves. The food quality is very good, mind you though it was an all you can eat joint, but they did not serve cheap stuffs like the ones in Nor Cal. The service was excellent. They kept my tea cup filled at all times, and consistently asking us whether we wanted to order more food. I ate so much I could barely fasten my seat-belt to drive down to San Diego.This will be my favourite restaurant from now on in LA!!!"
10/9/2010,4 star rating,"I love this place very much. When my friends visit LA definitely i will take them here. Its one of the best All you can eat Korean BBQ. The tongue and brisket especially one of the best. You probably will wait very long to get into the restaurant but still its worth it. I will definitely go back to this restaurant. If you are going there during the weekdays, you better made a reservation.RECOMMENDED"
10/20/2010,4 star rating,"Very good quality meats for just $17! Â They gave a lot of good banchans such as potato salad, a real salad, etc. Â They also had 4 different sauces per person, but I liked the sesame oil + peppered salt sauce the most. If you're a squid lover you must try their enormous yet delicious squid here. If you're a lamb lover though, you're out of luck here because I didn't see that on their menu. They have a good selection of various beef, pork, and chicken cuts.At the end of the meal, they also finish off the meal with a kimchi fried rice and spicy tofu soup. The fried rice had a nice tangy kick to it, but the soup was a bit weak.The place was nicely decorated, well ventilated, and clean. One warning is that there seems to always be a line here during dinner hours so prepare to wait. Also, it's valet parking."
11/15/2010,3 star rating,"Reading everyone else's reviews on here make me think we accidentally ended up at a different Kbbq of the same name but superior suckitude. I kind of hated this place.I had to work a couple of hours Sunday at my office in Ktown so my hubby and I decided to use the opportunity to hit up some lunchtime kbbq. We figured we'd venture off our usual path and try somewhere new and with all the great reviews,this place sounded great. We got the only street spot in the whole neighborhood - that might have been the best part of the whole experience.We walk in and stand at the front for a solid 5 minutes while the waiters ,etc. bustle around not seating us. There were a ton of open tables (3pm on a Sunday) Seriously, they were making eye contact and everything and just let us stand there. Finally someone came to seat us and gave us menus.The banchans were whatever. The sauces were good and I liked that they gave you little ""recipes"" on the menu for how to use stuff - it was cute.AYCE was $16.99 - great! We settled in and ordered Bulgogi, brisket and pork shoulder. The original guy who took our order was friendly but the surly woman who answered our call throughout most of the meal was seriously mean. She was actually rude. At one point she grabbed the tongs out of my hand, stirred the meat around herself and then put them down on the opposite side of the table from me so I had to get up and get them. Uh, I was kind of using those. It was weird.We also weren't big fans of the meat. The brisket was good - I did like that - and I only got one piece that was super gristley and fatty so, cool. The pork shoulder and short rib were both chewy and not flavorful at all. We also go Bulgogi, bbq pork, thin pork belly and none of it was superstar.One of the most annoying things was they offered either kimchi fried rice or white rice - we got neither. The menu said the fried rice was at meal's end so we just assumed we'd wait. Nothing. To be fair, we were so over it by the time the meal was done and they brought the check without the rice, we just paid and left without bringing it up.Not going back.I did LOVE the kimchi pancake we got with our meal. 3 stars just for that."
1/5/2011,5 star rating,"Loved this place. Probably came back like 5 times already within the past 3 months.The service is extremely nice. I might not come to any other place. Kimchi Fried Rice, Gosh, it was delicious!!!!If you love korean BBQ, you'll definitely need to check this out!"
1/23/2011,5 star rating,one of the best all you can eat Korean Â bbq places the meat is really good and fresh way better meat then Hwa Ro Korean BBQ inSan Gabriel the stone grill brings out the flavor of the meat the kimchi fried rice and pancake is really good on your bday they sing u a song and give you a picture card really nice place as good as Road to Seoul
1/25/2011,4 star rating,"I have tried a number of Korean BBQ restaurants and this is by far my favorite (and the only one in which I actually remember the Korean name). It is such a great deal - all you can eat meat and comes with all of the great sides plus a Korean ""fried"" rice at the end which I always make room for. Did I mention a bottle of Soju is only $6.95?! The vibe is very cool too. With all that being said, you need a reservation because this place is constantly packed (may I repeat because it's so good). This place definitely lives up to it's hype so try it for yourself....you may need to call a cab home!"
2/26/2011,5 star rating,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!First of all, the meat selection is great. There is a lot to choose from and the marinate is really good. The waiter was really really funny and cool! He joked with us and brought us anything we wanted. He was very tentative to what we need. What I like about this place is especially because of the Kimchi Pancake! It was delicious! Usually this is expensive, but they have it here so it makes the price worth it! Also, the side dishes were amazing! I couldn't stop eating them and asked for refills so many times. Overall, I want to come back asap!"
3/8/2011,4 star rating,"ok, love, so far, love, love, love this place, well except for parking. I mean wtf!!! it's like a test. So you get all full, fat, and intoxicated then you have to drive through this narrow path trying to get out of the lot. Anywho, bad parking aside, love this place, love the friendly service, love the awesome meat. Ordered the thick cut pork shoulder towards the end, that was awesome, flavorful pork yet not gamey and tender.Umm these Korean boys staff has very nice skin (umm not trying to be all creepy here) but seriously, is that the effect of Â hot stone steam or something??? just curious, LMAO"
3/17/2011,4 star rating,"The food is incredible, no matter what you try! Space can be tight for groups larger than 4-6 people, but its an amazing place. I take my friends here if they've never had Korean BBQ; great cultural experience with the food.*Get the ""All you can eat"" take your time, have some Hite and soju, hang for a couple hours and eat away : ) I've only been to a few Korean BBQ places in LA, but this is hands down my favorite! Highly recommended.**Note; if you go mid-evening on the weekends (past 8-9pm) it might be a while before you get a table. Call ahead if in doubt, this place gets super busy."
3/27/2011,3 star rating,"3.5 stars.Food are one of the best Korean BBQ in town, better than Manna IMO. Â Just take 1.5 star off because of extremely tight seating space (been asked to stand up to give a way to kitchen staff) and be prepared for looooong wait time."
6/25/2011,2 star rating,"I finally tried out Hae Jang Chon the other night and, unfortunately, won't be back. We didn't have to wait long for our table and got our banchan pretty quick. All of it was tasty but the pancake was a disappointment. I'm starting to really dig the pancakes and this was the worst one I've had. I didn't care too much, though, because the meat was coming up......which kinda sucked. We ordered thick cut pork belly (fat-ass bacon), bulgogi, brisket, and short ribs. All of the cuts except the bulgogi were fatty. I know there's supposed to be some fat on there but I'd say about a third of each piece was fat. We did the fried rice thing at the end (they mix up all the leftovers you have and they make it into fried rice), which was cool except I didn't really want to eat anymore at that point. The service was speedy but our server kept on forgetting items we ordered.The water they give us was yellow which was weird. I thought it was just ours at first but everyone else seemed to have it as well. I went to the washroom and passed by the big tub they were taking the water from and it definitely looked yellow in there. I don't know if this is how it was supposed to be or not but just want to give you a heads-up. I'm not a Korean BBQ aficionado by any means; this is the third one I've been to in L.A. I really didn't want to shit all over Hae Jang Chon because I've heard good things but I didn't have the best experience here and won't be back..."
7/9/2011,4 star rating,"Went on Friday around 8pm for 2 people, wait for half an hour.All you can eat less than $20 per person.I really like that they use ""STONE PLATE"" for BBQ. Meats are good, I was too full to eat their fried rice, which looks very nice, so I want to try it next time."
7/11/2011,4 star rating,"Food: This is the first time I had LA bbq in LA and I was not disappointed. I've never had such tender and well marinated bulgogi and galbi in my life. I could swear the cut was tenderloin. The banchan was endless, and I'm really glad that rice was optional. I felt full, but not gluttony at the end of the meal. I was disappointed that they didn't have whole leaves of lettuce, instead they had a tossed salad with a salty dressing I didn't enjoy. Also, I love how LA galbi has the section cut bones and tendon in it, but hae jang just has trimmed cuts of meat, which some people might prefer.Service:I really enjoyed the way they scrubbed the stone grill of its sticky char with shredded radishes, it was so refreshing just watching them do it.Also, Hae Jang Chon really breaks the stigma koreans have of bad service. My non korean friends always comment they feel unwelcome whenever they enter a korean grocery or restaurant. In this case, the servers were incredibly professional, courteous, prompt, and friendly. Price:It was around $22 per person for all-you-can-eat so I'd say it was a pretty great meal. Low carb, hi protein, hi veggies."
7/12/2011,5 star rating,"beef brisket, marinated short ribs, and bbq squid is all i need from this place! love the fact that they open till 2AM and the staff is very accommodating. Although they did forget some of our orders, it was ok. they quickly went and got it for us when we reminded them. i would definitely come back again!"
7/17/2011,5 star rating,"And I thought I was in love with the Korean Barbeque place by my house... I think I'm cheating cause I'm in love with two different Korean barbeque restaurant.Don't let the small parking lot and valet guys stop you from eating here because right when they seat you, your table is literally ready. They have everything laid down for you with the exception of the drinks and meat of course.They have four kinds of sauce but you'll probably just use two. They don't have a lot of side dishes but they are not skimpy on beans sprouts though. If you ran out and ask for more, they will give you a lot.If you haven't had their kimchi fried rice and kimchi fried pancake, you should because they are good.The meat are really good and the people are really nice. Â I would definitely go back if I feel like driving all the way to LA for a good Korean barbeque."
7/20/2011,5 star rating,"Pros:-Service is EXCELLENT! Definitely the best service I have experienced in any KBBQ restaurant. Servers are so attentive and efficient! They came over automatically asking us whether we wanted to order any additional meats, added our water, banchan etc, without us even having to ask or ring the bell. Totally opposite compared to other KBBQ restaurants! -Reasonable pricing. Only $17.99!-Open till 2am. Serves alcohol too.-Meat quality is good! There are times when it isn't as good, but even then, it's still decent!-Stone grill keeps the meat soft and tender. -Wide selection of menu items. 19 items to choose from!-Valet parking. Remember to bring cash to pay for it. Cons:-Really none that I can think of right now. Totally worth the price! Even if they raised it I will still go!"
8/14/2011,4 star rating,"BEST AYCE KBBQ in town!I moved out to LA for the summer and have been there 5 different times!! Little lucrative but when people want KBBQ I always and never hesitate to take people to this place. The people are very nice and you honestly get your money's worth. Not only do you get unlimited bbq but the ""works"" when it comes to complementary food aka ""bahn chan""You also get the daen jang and kimchi fried rice at the end!! (That's if you aren't full from all the bbq)The atmosphere as a AYCE KBBQ place is really good. You can't expect much from a KBBQ place. Korean restaurants tend to centralize on the food rather than good service but they have both at this place so you really can't go wrong!There has always been a long line for this place so if you have a party of 6 or more I definitely recommend to make reservations!Please go and bring your friends! this place is great!!"
8/23/2011,4 star rating,"Place HAS REAL GOOD AYCE, WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. Â My friend recommended this place to me, and I decided to try it out with some people. Â Tried to see if we could each avoid paying for 3 AYCE's since, it is kind of pricey, and because I was with two other people. Â Didn't work, but it's AYCE anyways. Â Had the Brisket, Short Rib, Spicy Pork, and Bulgolgi. DAMN.After spending almost 2 hours eating, I realized I definitely got my money's worth here. Â The banchan was great too, as well as the Kimchi pancakes. Â  Â We were the first customers, so it wasn't quite busy at first, but after a few minutes, the place was packed. Â EAT HAE JANG CHON NOW!"
9/19/2011,5 star rating,"Great selection of meats here! Their Kim Chi Pancake is AMAZING, but order it right away, it takes forever to come out. Service is good but depends on who you get! Fun and loud atmosphere. Great place to just hang out, talk and have great food!"
10/7/2011,5 star rating,"Came here with my cousin and 4 of her friends on a Thursday night. We were warned about the long wait times, but we actually got seated right away when we arrived. This is the cleanest and most well-furnished Korean BBQ place I've ever been to; most other KBBQ places can rival a bowling alley for smokiness!We ordered all beef and everything was super-fresh, especially the bulgogi and kalbi. I'm not a huge kimchi fan, but my opinion might be changed after having their kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice which were both AMAZING.Service was awesome too. Our server made sure our grill was always clean and was prompt with requests for additional food and drinks.Will be back for more! =)"
10/23/2011,4 star rating,"Hands down, my favorite KBBQ around. Love the kimchi fried rice they make for you on the stone grill at the end. It has a picture of a pig in their name, how can you go wrong with that?"
10/27/2011,4 star rating,"One of my favorite places in K-Town to get AYCE KBBQ when I'm with a large group of friends since it's open til 2am. You get a good selection of meat for AYCE and the kimchi fried rice is delicious. The downside is definitely the wait. And parking can be difficult to find during dinner time and the weekends. Valet is the best way to go. Go in hungry, leave satisfied... if not in a food coma. ;]"
11/3/2011,4 star rating,"I've always wanted to come to this restaurant since the raves from many of my friends. It's always a long line whenever I'm in the area. So this tuesday spur of the moment i decided to go with my friend. we had the two ayce for $17 per person. we ordered: 1. Beef brisket2. pork belly3. Beef tongue4. beef abomasum [instestine]The banchan was delish, the sauces were a plus as well. Everything was so clean and in order. I was impressed. The brisket was great, the taste was just right. The pork belly was a-okay, it certainly was not the best pork belly i've had, but isn't the worst either. It was my friend's first time tasting tongue, and she didn't even know she was eating it. LOL. since it was sliced thinly like the brisket, the difference was only coloring. She said it just chewier, which is true. I was feeling adventurous that day and tried the beef abomasum, which is intestine. I can say that i will not ordering that one again. It's very chewy, chewier than octopus or squid. it will be my first and last ordering the abomasum, though i want to try the honeycomb when i have the time and courage again. The service was just right, i suppose. the lady come and goes to help us cook, but she splashed me with oil once or twice because she was not careful and just flicking around. i don't think it was on purpose so i let it go. we didn't get the fried rice at the end since we were full out of our minds. it was a good experience all and all, it could have been better without the slight language barrier and the splashing of oil, but it wasn't an unpleasant either. The valet has been cheap, $2, but i seems to be the standard at k-town. I would come back for the brisket DEFINITELY."
12/8/2011,4 star rating,"I'm digging this spot because the service is quick and the food is quite delicious. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and it gets crazy. We waited for about 2 hours for a table of 4. Luckily there is a bar right next door to relax and grab a drink for the wait. Atmosphere:- casual, cramped, and limited amounts of tablesFood- large selection of meats (bulgogi(marinated beef), calbee (short ribs), pork belly, chicken, squid, beef brisket)- save room for the kimchi fried rice (especially when it's all marinated from the meat chars)- lots of banchan (complimentary small dishes)- filled the entire tableCons- wait time (don't go during rush hour) or wait 2+ hours!- smelly from all that korean bbq smoke But this place is everything you expect from a Korean BBQ. Enjoy!"
12/12/2011,4 star rating,"Whenever we go to LA and crave for Korean BBQ this is our go to place. Price is really good, they have a whole variety of meat choice and they close at 2am! Their salad has a really really really good dressing. The service is pretty quick. The even sometimes cook the food for you. The servers are very helpful. Only think i dont like is the parking. I have gone here when it is extremely busy and when it is not. Parking is really a hassle. They do have valet but the spots are limited. Also some of their grills look as if they will fall off and it scares me lol."
12/28/2011,4 star rating,"This place is amazing. I really enjoy their stone grill and how they clean it also. I'm not going to spoil it for you, just check it out for yourself :DThis is a relatively small restaurant. I guess that's why the service is pretty good. Try not to get a window seat during the afternoon because they don't really have blinds, so the Sun's rays are going to grill you as you watch your meat cook. I came here with my friends on my birthday. I didn't mention it to them, so I don't know if they have any birthday related specials. My friends all raved over the food and such. They told me to come on to Yelp and write a review for this restaurant. Parking really sucks. You're going to most likely end up paying for valet. They should really invest in some blinds though.-1 star for parking and blinds :PTip: try not to get the hot dogs. They're basically Oscar Meyer."
1/7/2012,4 star rating,"Their service is wonderful and this is the CLEANEST ayce kbbq place I have ever seen.Their salad and kimchi stood out to me the most, but I wasn't too fond of their bulgolgi. The marinade didn't taste right; it was a bit sour than normal. But other than that, this place is great."
1/13/2012,5 star rating,Wait for almost 2 hours before we got a table on a Tuesday night. But it was totally worth the wait. Great meat selection and side dishes. Exceptional service. One of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants of all time. Hands down!My only suggestion is that they need a better system (like a pager system) to accommodate the amount of people waiting on busy nights. Parking can be a pain too. But overall for food and service I give it 5 stars.
2/21/2012,5 star rating,Have been coming here for more than 5 years. Owner and staff are so nice to me and my mom. Great music (mix between kpop and American pop). Good side dishes. Wide variety of meat. Kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice are amazing additions to the meal. Good quality meat.
2/26/2012,3 star rating,"I'll go into more detail, but if you're the type that doesn't read much, one word will sum up this review: meh.I'm not taking into account the mandatory valet, Â or the standard (unfriendly) Korean service. Just by virtue of the meat (which is why you go to kbbq places at all), this place doesn't deserve any higher than a 3. Let's just say, I've had better brisket cooked on a portable gas stove and fry pan, in a Big Bear cabin, in 20 degree weather. Their salad was pretty tasty though, I'll give them that.I don't know, I'm kind of at a loss here. I don't see what could possibly be bringing the regulars back. If my friends ever want to go here, I wouldn't necessary be dragged kicking and screaming, but I'd probably do one of these-- Â :TThe three stars is because there was no wait."
4/22/2012,1 star rating,"This is totally not based on their food but their reservation system. A reservation means... you save a table at a certain time for a group of party... right? So, if I say reservation at 7pm for 10 people and we get there on time... I would like to be seated. The lady informed me that even if I made reservations, there could be a chance that I would have to wait until an hour to an hour and a half... WTF would I want to make reservations then?! Quite lame... if it's monetary reason, say that I would have to put my credit card down and then have x amount of hours to cancel.Anyways... I wanted to try this place because it was new to me. Instead, I am going to Road to Seoul because they actually give you the reservation time. Sure they only give you an hour and half to eat... but their service is quick, so I am okay with that."
6/9/2012,3 star rating,"I am writing this while sitting at this restaurant eating. Man service was show, but it was somewhat packed so i give them that.Came here myself to enjoy some Korean bbq after my job because i was starving. Order some bugugi lunch special and waiting. It was agonizing as i was sat next to the kitchen where i can see all the food being created. I was waiting for my sides which i knew was mines and multiple waiter either pass me or just standing right in front of me with out bringing me some sides. After 15 min of sitting there staring at the food it finally came. mind I say, i was starving. The bugugi came out ok, on top of alot off raw onions. Man, cant really enjoy good bugugi on raw onions. Came before, it was better, service seem to have dip a little."
6/10/2012,3 star rating,"Your average KBBQ place. Â Nothing really special about it except that you get the kimchi fried rice at the end. Â Service was good, but not great. Â The server came by often to flip and cut the meat, yet we had to ask 3 times for water. Â Remember to make a reservation!!! Â We made a reservation for 8pm and were seated by 8:40 as opposed to the group that came at 7ish and were still waiting after us. Â (Yes, we could hear them talking shit as we were walking in! Â That's your fault for not calling ahead!)Valet is $2 if you choose to park in the lot."
6/18/2014,5 star rating,"Omg so amazing! My husband and I took my younger brother here while he was in town. The stone grill is perfect to cooking enough meet for about 3-4 people comfortably, and you can't really beat the AYCE price. We came at an odd time on a weekday night, so I have yet to 'complain' about the wait. The meats were good, the banchan and kimchi were also tasty. The service is very fast and friendly. Definitely give this place a try!"
9/17/2014,5 star rating,"food is fresh and tasty. well actually, i like the hite beer they provides. And you will like their disks, which, for me, is better than other restaurants in K town."
11/11/2016,2 star rating,There meat is alright not the best. For 23.99 I expected better quality. The side dishes are not the best. The server kept coming over a lot to see how fast the meat was cooking which was awkward. Almost felt like he wanted us to leave. I wouldn't come back I've had better service and better food at another kbbq.
2/27/2017,2 star rating,Their food was okay but could use more flavor. Our waiter Â was really bad! We had to ask for a dish like 3 times because he kept forgetting. And we didn't get the rice until we almost left. The service sucked and the food was okay.
3/15/2014,3 star rating,The food was decent except for the kimchi I had. It was a little sour and I'm a stickler when it comes to kimchi! The best Korean bbq I've ever had was in Garden Grove and it was cheaper!

11/1/2014,5 star rating,"Hands down the best kbbq. Starting with the service. Came here on a Monday night since weekends it's packed, been to a couple places in city and this is the first place the ""Service button"" was never pressed. They kept asking If we needed anything and the service was friendly. The vibe of the restaurant is enjoyable for the young crowd, would highly recommend it, plus they close at 2am perfect for the munchies ;)"
10/30/2016,5 star rating,Definitely the best kbbq I've had. When the grill was full they cooked the extra meat for us !
4/18/2014,4 star rating,"hands down best Korean bbq I ever ate. Â came around 6 and there was about 20 minute wait.

10/28/2014,5 star rating,"Best Korean BBQ I've had in LA! Service was great, and for only $22, I walked away feeling like I had a great meal. Definitely recommend! But come early, because if you're starving like we were, a 45-minute wait can be pretty painful."
7/8/2014,4 star rating,"I had seen the lines outside this restaurant before so I was excited to try the KBBQ here. We went here during off hours (late lunch) so there wasn't really a wait. My personal favorite is the beef tongue (salt+lime), so I was happy to see that on the AYCE menu. We ordered, and ordered, aaaaand ordered, and I soon became very full. Overall it's your typical KBBQ place. The staff helped cook our meats, which I was very thankful for!"
10/24/2016,5 star rating,Just love this place. High quality meats and high quality side dishes and great service. Excellent kimchi pancakes too AND the grill is stone so no more smoke everywhere ...
7/5/2014,4 star rating,"The place has good high quality brisket, the kimchee pancake was great and the shirt ribs were amazing as well as the squid. The bulgogi ehhh I was not a fan of at all. Very dry! The sides were good and the servers were decent. They didn't seem to understand us well though which made it different. For LA I give it four stars."
10/20/2016,5 star rating,This is my go to spot whenever I can't decide what to eat lol always satisfied and i ALWAYS leave with a happy belly!
4/13/2015,1 star rating,"Do they close at 11:30 or 2am on Sundays? Because last night our waitress, who was kinda rude the whole time she served us told us the former. She hovered after giving us our check them interrupted our conversation to tell they were closing in 15 min at 11:30 though the place was still full and they were still seating people. It was only after we'd paid and were outside that we realized everyone else was still in the restaurant and we were the only ones outside. Did I mention we are all Brown and Black women, all three of us? We talked about it at the car and realized we'd been discriminated against blatantly. That or the waitress lied. We hung out for about an hour in the parking lot and noooobody else was hustled out of the building the way we were. We weren't drinking and we were no louder than any other table. We have been there at least 2 times before ans this has never happened. Me and my friends are so damn dissapointed this happened because the food is great, but we will not be coming back to this bigoted place ever if three women of color cannot sit down and enjoy an evening together without being lied to and shuffled out as soon as they get our money. Not cool. So, 1 star for being racist, Hae Jang Chon."
8/23/2014,4 star rating,"This is a welcome back dinner joined with Nan, K, Annan, Patrick and my self. As a ""all you can eat"" Korean BBQ buffet, this place is a little bit pricey because of the 20+ price per person at dinner time. They have amazing side dishes, above-average meat and nice service here, this is a typical 4-star restaurant. It also worth to mention that they have a big tv focuses on sports!"
12/28/2013,4 star rating,"Came on a Friday night around 6 with a friend and had to wait a good 30 minutes before getting seated. We decided to do the All You Can Eat BBQ. We started with the marinated beef, thinly sliced beef, and the thick pork belly. The beef were good, but I've had better pork elsewhere. For our second round we got the BBQ Chicken and the thinly sliced pork. Both were good! The cool thing about this place is that they'll make fried rice for you on the hot stone. We reserved some of our meat and the kimchi from the stone and added it to our fried rice. So good! They also give you kimchi pancakes and jjigae (stew), so we are our fill. Overall this place had decent food and great service."

1/14/2014,5 star rating,"5 stars!!! AYCE BBQ with fresh meat and so many side dishes. At the end, you can also get the kimchi fried rice which is so good. It also comes with the kimchi pancake for the pancake lover. Unfortunately, You gotta wait at least one hour during the peak time, but trust me, it is worth the wait."
1/14/2015,5 star rating,Go on Wednesdays oh my this place is amazing. So many meats that let you choose 4 at a time until you finish. Then you can cook as desired or have the servers come by and check on the food occasionally. This place blew my mind
5/13/2014,4 star rating,Best Korean buffet I've had so far! I like this place and road to Seoul but this one is better! Long wait also so make sure your entire party is here to be seated!
10/12/2014,4 star rating,"$19.99 for lunch, $21.99 for dinner AYCE. Food was great, good selection, my personal favorite is the kimchi fried rice but it can only be served at the very end which is kind of a downer. Other than that, we had one server for 10 people and he handled it pretty well."
8/14/2012,4 star rating,"As you can see from all the great reviews, this place provides one of the best korean bbq buffet. For a price of $19(excluding tip&tax), you get to choose 19 different types of meat for as many times as you like. The brisket and tongue are a must! Its popularity has resulted in a long wait, especially if you come for weekend nights. You might have to wait for over an hour. Reservations can only be made on the weekdays, and if you are more than 5 people. Ask for kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal. They will serve it over the hot plate and cook it for you. It gives you a perfect ending to your meal. :)"
1/10/2015,2 star rating,Food is okay. The service is terrible! I gave the host my credit card early to pay for my table in advance and he accidentally charged my card for another table (for $120). My table only would have been $70! After that the host nor any of the severs apologized or offered any free drinks or a free plate. It also takes 1 business week for the money to go back to my card. terrible experience!
8/10/2014,2 star rating,"Am I the only one that found the quality of the meet to be incredibly poor? The brisket was so fatty, it turned gray when cooked. We ordered another round of leaner brisket and it was a bit better (but still not great). The bulgogi was also rather tasteless. The tongue and short rib were decent. Another reviewer said the stone cooking surface kept everything from getting too smokey but I didn't notice this. Â However, I did notice the flat stone surface didn't have any sort of drain, leaving all meat to cook in a giant pool of fat. At the end of the meal, we left a bit of super fatty bits and pieces that were incredibly unappetizing. The waiter came over and informed us that next time we would be charged $15 for leaving any food. There won't be a next time- this was the worst Â AYCE KBBQ experience my friends and I have ever had!"
10/5/2012,4 star rating,"I like this place!!!! I am a big fan of Kalbi, so what I base my all-you-can-eat KBBQ reviews on are the quality of the Kalbi meat. I've been to several places around K-town and the price here is not bad. I think in general, K-town is the only place I've been to that is THE go-to city for good all you can eat KBBQ. I'm from the San Gabriel Valley and no KBBQ place around here lives up to that area. That said, the Kalbi here is really good (tender, marinated well, etc), and I like the sauces/sides they give us.If you come here, it can get quite packed! So just be prepared for that... some people starve themselves before going to all you can eat KBBQ, but just be ready for some waiting if you're going at peak dinner hours, esp on the weekends. I was so close to going to the nearby taco truck once because I was hungry and waiting in line. But if you go, definitely try the soups which you can order on the sides, and the kimchi fried rice!The only issue I had that stopped me from giving it a 5 was a miscommunication... we ordered Â Charm-soon soju and they ended up giving us charm-sul, which was about double the price. I should've looked at the label! But nonetheless the whole meal was good, the service was great, and they even give you fried rice and miso soup at the end (if you can consume any more).Wish this place was closer to me!"
9/29/2009,3 star rating,"HJC is all about meat volume and variety. The AYCE option allows you to choose from 19 types of meats. Â Top cuts are bbq pork (daeji bulgogi), brisket, pork belly, beef bulgogi, bbq. Kalbi is well marinated but not the finest quality. When its busy the servers get overwhelmed and miss an order which can slow down the carnage."
1/4/2010,3 star rating,"Came here on Saturday night around 7pm with a group of 9. Â $We made reservation for 7pm, but we still had to wait for 15 minutes. Â Considering the amount of people waiting, I'll say 15 min is not bad at all. Â 16.99 all you can eat in K-town. Â  19 different meat/seafood items to choose from. Â you can order individual plates instead of AYCE if you do not want to pig out like most of the people that come here for. Â It's really crowded in the restaurant, and they definitely need to give people more room to sit and eat. Â Service definitely needs improvement, as we have to keep asking for the same thing over and over again. Â Meat is pretty good, decent quality, and they serve squid, which was awesome. Â you can also tell them to make fried rice (with kimchi and seaweed) for you in the end, that was super delicious. Â they also serve you tofu soup, which is also very yummy. Â I feel like the alcohol was a little pricy, but maybe just b/c me n my friends drink too much. Â It ended up to about $35/person total. Â I would definitely come here again but just not drink as much i guess. Â  It would be a 4-star if they can improve on their service."
4/30/2010,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is amazing! Â The sides were great, and the 19 different varieties ROCK. Â We love how it's cooked on a round marble 'grill' and when it's dirty, they come by with hot water and Daikon to clean it off and you're ready to go at it again. You start out with Kimchee and beansprouts on your grill and then they bring you 4 meats at a time. Â Add Beer to the equation and you've got a match made in heaven! Â Save room at the end for some soup and Kimchee fried rice..."
5/16/2010,4 star rating,"I should write a proper review since it is one of many Korean BBQ restaurants in Koreatown that I like to go to with friends. It's definitely a vibrant atmosphere and it's almost always packed. There's seating everywhere and even outside but it's covered. This place is known for their all you can eat bbq with a great price too. In the end, they pour this rice soup on your grill and you eat it, it's strange but good (certainly didn't expect that). Definitely good to bring more than 1 person for this place, more the merrier."
6/28/2010,4 star rating,"This is a great Korean BBQ place! The foods here are amazing! The buffet deal is awesome!If you enjoy BBQ and have big appetites, here is the place for you! It is great for friends to gather and have beers and meats!"
6/29/2010,5 star rating,"High quality BBQ. Â They have a unique presentation where you wrap the meat in a noodle, pickled dichon, and lettuce. SoYummy. They also do the cooking for you. Price ia very cheap for what you get. Â Better than Moo Dae Po and on par with Chosun Galbi."
7/11/2010,5 star rating,"Came here with my boyfriend on the weekdays this past week cus it was the only place that was going to be open for a while (they close at 2AM!), and it was around 10 when we decided we wanted food.The waiter was soooo attentive that our cheapasses tipped him over 30%. As soon as he saw I wanted to flip the meat to cook it, he came over and helped me. He cleaned our grill off between every new order of meat. Their service is AMAZINGg"
9/10/2010,5 star rating,"WOW!! Â Just got in from dinner here...I am not by far a connoisseur of Korean food, but I know a good meal, and THIS IS IT...EXCELLENT SERVICE and lots of employees who were courteous and speak English, so language barrier need not be a concern...and all of them were so attentive and polite!! AND THE PRICE AT $17.00 FOR AYCE BBQ...really, how could anyone complain?? LOVED IT!Only thing that kinda sucked is the parking situation...and MAKE RESERVATIONS....or be prepared to wait a really long time, albeit worthwhile...."
9/17/2010,3 star rating,I don't like the wait (1 1/2 hours on Friday night) but AYCE for $16.99 is an awesome deal. Â Lots of meat selections to choose from. Â Hot dog was interesting so we had to try it. Â Not bad! Â Their side dishes need some work though. Â Those were just blah. Â Best part is the kimchi fried rice they make on the meat grill at the end! Â Parking is valet only.
10/31/2010,4 star rating,"Are you in K-Town?Are you hungry?Are you a carnivore?Then this is the place for you.Pretty good meat quality, decent side dishes, all you can eat meat at a very affordable price = you win. Â It's better than Road-To-Seoul, Manna, and Ma-Dang-Sae for SURE. Â And they have pretty good service.Also, after you finish the meat, they bring out rice and fry it on the stone top with kimchi and then you win again.Definitely a place to come to again and again."
11/12/2010,5 star rating,"Since the beginning of the All U CAN EAT era, I've been around Ktown to almost every Korean BBQ restaurants.This is the spot!To me I value service more than the unlimited all you can eat BBQ for $14.99.Not only does this place have some of the best cuts of meat, but they also service you like no other restaurant I've been to.The table presentation is also something you don't see regularly, and instead of replacing the charred up grill after a couple sets of cooking meat, they clean the stone grill with wet radish as you are eating.As for the meat, they offer the usual cuts just like any other place,the difference maker here is the sliced pork belly; Â They offer a thin cut which is an experience of it's own. Â It cooks just like the beef brisket slice, but it tastes like bacon!Once you've had all you can eat, they close you out with a rice mix they cook over the same stone grill to give it that nice flavorful crunch.Now if you're into Korean BBQ, I suggest you try this place out mainly for the service and originality they bring to your table.Most places will just bring your meat and refill at your request, but here, they treat you like royalty...almost!"

Valet parkingCONS:So-so service (F-Sun)YOU WILL SMELL LIKE SMOKE!Went here a few times. I have to say that the meat was better on the weekend than the weekday. Of course, service was OK on the weekend, but what can you expect? Â The place is somewhat clean. It's in a small plaza (near The Face Shop). Even though it's valet, there will be some wait time during peak hours because it's a SMALL parking lot. I've never had to wait for a table (my friends were already inside) so I can't comment on the wait."

7/13/2011,3 star rating,"The meat was decent and didn't have any exquisite taste to it. Some meat was just pure fat so be careful unless you like that kind of stuff. None of the side dishes were memorable including the bland potato salad which could have even gone father with simply some salt & pepper. Offered a different variety of meat choices including honeycomb beef, squid, small octopus and beef tongue. The stone grill was a plus. Remember not to stuff yourself too quickly as they'll surprise you with kimchi pancakes (mid-way into your meal) and kimchi Â fried rice (which they're known for) at the end."
8/2/2011,2 star rating,"Far, far from being the best korean bbq in town; or even within a three block radius. Â If you'd never had korean BBQ before, this might seem cool, but the food is decidedly sub-par compared other nearby places.My friend and I have a favorite place (Chung Ki Wa), but decided to try some new ones, read about the AYCE, the positive (okay, mixed, but largely positive) reviews, and decided to try it out. Â There was a long line (45 minutes or so), on a monday at 7:45 pm - the place was jammed, so we figured it must be worth it.Wrong. Â The best we can say is that SOME of the meat was SOMEWHAT enjoyable (for the record, the bbq pork, the short ribs). Â The bulgogi was okay, but usually when you get bulgogi at one of these places, it's freakin' amazing. Â Not here.The food was medicore in the strongest possible sense: neither good enough to really enjoy, nor bad enough to hate. Â In fairness, we did not try anything other than the AYCE special. Â But I cannot in good conscience suggest this place to eat at.There are so many other places to go in Ktown, and so many of them are good. Â I know my little two stars here won't make a drop in the bucket of their rating, but felt a need to weigh in. We will not be returning."
8/23/2011,5 star rating,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Ever since my friend brought me here, I was in love. Came here again a few weeks later with other friends, and fell in love all over again.The first time I came here, it was roughly 6PM and the wait was roughly an hour or so. It's a relatively small location, so it's understandable. The second time i came here was around 10PM or so, and even then, there was still a bit of a wait. Note that I came with only two other people. Large parties, you are warned!Like many other KBBQ places, Hae Jang Chon is AYCE~! Both the times I went, I got the beef brisket, beef tongue, bulgogi, kimchi pancakes, steamed egg, and kimchi fried rice. All super delicious, especially the bulgogi and the beef tongue (it was my first time trying it)! I'll probably try more off the menu next time (if my stomach allows it). All the forms of meat we ordered were excellent and top-notch, no joke. The side dishes were awesome, too, and kept my stomach going when we were waiting for our meat. I was extremely full by the end of the night, but it was all so worth it for $16.99. Speaking of kimchi fried rice, by the way, it comes at the end, so try to leave some room for that.Additionally, the staff here is incredibly attentive, welcoming, and all-around nice people. They cater to your every need, occasionally asking i and grill your meat at times, too. Â  Be sure to pay attention to how they clean your grill. It's different, and I was pretty mindblown over it the first time I saw it.All in all, this place gets five stars from me. I'll definitely be coming here again (and bringing more first-time friends with me!)"
8/23/2011,5 star rating,"The salad, brisket and short ribs are killer! Just straight up thinly slice beef. Â To top it off is the kimchi fried rice.....gotta save room for that! Well Â worth the hour wait! Â And for AYCE only $16.99. Â Great food for a killer price.. Definitely a return visit!"
8/31/2011,4 star rating,"Great memories at this place. I came here twice this summer; once on my birthday with my cousin and his girlfriend who were visiting from Winnipeg and the second time with three of my friends. The first time I went, we came during lunch and had most of the lunch specials. Everything was great but we didn't finish our food so we took the leftovers with us. The service was pretty good the first time since all we had to do was ring the bell and the waitress would come by. To be honest I was a little bell happy, but at least they were patient with us.The second time, my friends and I came during the evening via the Purple Line and we were all starving after a few hours of exploring Little Tokyo and Pershing Square/Angels Knoll in staggering 100 degree heat. After we ate some chicken at KyoChon nearby (because the line was long), we were seated and everything was set up for us. All the servers had to do was bring us the meat since we got AYCE this time. Some of the meats we tried were the pork belly, pork shoulder, and the brisket, which weren't too bad. I think the waiter got a little annoyed at me because I was a little bell happy, especially when I asked about the soup that was randomly placed on the grill along with my friend's fried rice. I asked if the soup was a ""companion"" to the rice... lol.The ambience is pretty nice, not sure if I would call it authentic Korean but they played a lot of cool upbeat K-Pop which we would pump our fists to."
9/27/2011,5 star rating,"Food Taste: 5 StarsFood Selection: 5 StarsService: 5 StarsLocation: 4 StarsCleanliness & Atmosphere: 4 StarsPrice: 5 StarsThis place is delicious. Lots of meat to choose from for AYCE for a great price. Besides the meat the kimchi pancakes, soup, and kimchi fried rice is also AYCE. Lots of delicious side dishes too. Came with my 2 girl friends and we were both shocked how much we ate (shared 4 plates of meat). Service is great too and they frequently clean the stone grill with shredded radishes (i think that's what it is). I thought that was pretty cool and natural-like. Yes...the wait is long but what good ACYE kbbq doesn't have a long wait anyways? The least amount of wait is not during peak lunch and dinner hours on the weekends especially, so that's a given. I don't get why people complain that the wait is long (it's a long wait everywhere) and deduct a star cause of it. All good food requires a little of patience. With that said the only down side about this place is the parking. Parking lot is really small and they got valet for $2.Overall, I highly recommend this place!"
10/19/2011,4 star rating,"AYCE KBBQ that's open til 2am!Me and 3 other friends came here after a show at the Wiltern and to our surprise there was no wait at all. We got seated promptly and we were amazed that we cooked our meat on a stone grill. We were shocked by the 19 item menu and was excited to order everything on the menu.The black angus beef brisket were the best and it looked very fresh when it comes out on the plate. We ordered multiple plates of this. The other meat choices were good as well and we didn't have any we didn't like at all, EXCEPT the hot dogs. They were just plain normal hot dogs.I think we were suposed to get the kimchi fried rice at the end BUT I think they said they ran out? (the language barrier is a bit difficult so make sure to bring someone that can speak Korean to make this more smooth.Other than that it was a good experience and I'd love to come back here again."
12/4/2011,4 star rating,"this place is really good. Parking sucks. Most likely u will end up parking in the street, but the food is really good. FOr koran bbq i either come here or road to seoul.  love the tea here though and their meat has a lot of flavor."
12/16/2011,4 star rating,"Awesome... just awesome. Good quality meat for a good price. Only thing that sucks is the long wait to get in. Oh yea, I remember I wanted to eat the kimchi fried rice while I cook the meat, but I was refused since the waiter told me ""thats not how it works here."" And the ""proper"" way was to finish cooking all the meat first before they can cook us the kimchi fried rice. Other wise they would have to clean the grill twice.... Now though I understand his point, it pisses you off when you're paying for the food, and some macho masculine asian guy tells you ""thats not how it works here."" So after the food, guess how long it took them to clean the grill... less than a minute. So it was unecessary to tell a customer on how things work, while the actual process takes a less than a minute. And I don't need explanations about how busy they are since I see the same macho guy standing around talking to other waiters and other tables with a group of 7 girls. I just don't like lame excuses. But regardless of the macho man, food is awesome!!"
3/28/2012,3 star rating,"Went here with a party of 9 for my mom's birthday. The majority of people have a big concern about the wait time, but if you come in around 4-4:30 you'll get a seat fairly quickly.Service: Don't expect to get amazing service here. Although they're not rude, they're still not entirely welcoming. You can tell the employees are not really social.Food Quality: In my opinion, the food didn't have a lot of flavor. It's like a food eating contest...it's not about the quality of the food it's about the ""quantity"". The group that I went with ordered every type of meat they had to offer under the ""all-you-can-eat"" section of the menu. If I had to recommend something I'd say go with the brisket, but take off all the excess fat (which is a lot). Normally I'd only eat chicken or any type of seafood, but the brisket definitely had the most flavor out of all the choices.Dining Experience: Like I said earlier, the service is not great, but they get the job done. The people you dine with make this a fun place to be, so I would suggest bringing good company. One thing I did appreciate was the fact that they would clean our grill every so often to make sure any burned pieces were taken out (they probably don't do it for the customer's sake, but rather for the sake of their grills, so they don't get ruined). Although restaurants are in business to make money, there are some that offer a great dining experience at the same time (in terms of service and hospitality)---this is not that place.All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. It doesn't really leave you ""craving"" for more, but it's a fun experience with good company.3 out of 5 stars-1 for quality of the food-1 for the service"
5/5/2012,4 star rating,"Dont come here latenight. The service is really bad and that is the reason for one star off. Apart from that, they have some really good options for meat.

7/31/2014,3 star rating,"The wait was long but no longer than anywhere else in K-town. We had the beef tongue, galbi, bulgogi, pork belly and brisket. They ran out of rice!!! How does that happen??? So our table didn't get all the rice and it was a 20 minute wait to get it. Just a tip... When you get low, start the next batch. The food alone would have given this place 5 stars but the service knocked it down. Had to ask for soda refill that I didn't get, dirty look from server who had to wait 5 seconds for my sister to get out of the way so she could cut the galbi, no rice and the rude host when I walked in made this experience a 3 rating."

3/10/2015,1 star rating,i wanted to come here and dine in by myself but they are not sinlge loner friendly and they need a minimum of 2 people and i can understand that since i know they are busy and having one less table for others. i was excited to try it out and found out the hard way and had a big disappointment. i was brave enough and try to hustle my way in and told them i traveled from sac to la for this but it didn't work even though it was true. i even offered to buy a drink and the buffet as well but they say no still so at least i have tried and not just give up. the only possible way to get in was if i bought 2 dinner buffets but what is the point of it for the cheap prices they served if i end up paying double. well they lost my business and i gave it to another korean business.

8/27/2018,2 star rating,"The two stars are for the quality of meat and the kimchi fried rice only. My husband and I arrived at the restaurant at 3 pm and we still waited for one hour to be seated. I don't really mind waiting in line for that long, it is their service that really pissed me off. After we were seated, we ordered three types of meat in the first round. As soon as the server brought the meat in a plate, he dumped two types of meat on the grill and left absolutely no space on the grill. It makes me feel like I am here to stir-fry the meat, not to BBQ. I know why they did this to us because there were still many people waiting outside. They wanted us to finish and leave ASAP so that they could take more people. They kept dumping as much meat as they could until I told them not to ""BBQ"" for me. However, I had to repeat this to every server that came by and tried to dump the meat left in the plate. This became super annoying later on because we got the center table and different servers kept walking by and noticed how our grill was not full while having uncooked meat in the plate. I don't like others interfering how I BBQ and I stopped going to another All U Can Eat Korean BBQ for the same reason. I like to enjoy my meal after waiting for so long, so even though I like the Kimchi Fried Rice so much, I wouldn't come back again."

2/7/2013,2 star rating,"Am I the only one bothered that they won't let you have kimchi fried rice until the way end? I came here with my boyfriend and the service started out great, because it was around 5pm and it was pretty empty. I read a lot of reviews about the 2 hour wait, so I'm glad we didn't have to wait that long, but when it started getting just a little bit busier, they just stopped paying attention to us.We asked for the AYCE and for the kimchi fried rice. They kept saying that it comes after the meat. I don't know why this is. I don't know about you guys, but I like my rice with my food. I don't like to have it for desert.. which is practically what they played it out to be. After we had our meat cooked, they came to clean the stone grill and I thought yes, finally some rice! But then they just took off and no matter how many times I called them to come for the rice, they kept brushing us off.When we finally go the rice, we wanted an order of another meat, and the guy just said no. Sorry. After the rice, you can't order anything else. How is this logical? I paid for AYCE and there is no policy in there that says we can't order anything else after the rice. I thought that it was really inconsiderate. It was our first time there, what is it to you if I get my rice before, with or after my meat?? -.-Alright, enough about my rant on the rice. Let's talk about service. It started off great. We had a bunch of people check in on us and it was really quick, but as soon as more people started coming in, the service came to a halt. Like I said, they took forever to come with the rice even though we asked several times. I had really high expectations for this place. I'm very disappointed. This place is not anymore special than any other Korean BBQ place. Boo."
9/26/2013,4 star rating,"Best place for ayce BBQ!! Sucks that you have go wait for the kimchi fried rice at the end but save room for that. Let the kimchi fried rice cook so there's a crunch. Â Service is pretty good, the servers are diligent and will cook for you. Order short ribs, brisket & beef tongue, note that the egg and kimchi pancake will take a while for them to bring it out."
12/12/2013,4 star rating,Best Korean BBQ in town. Staff is so busy they forget to smile :)
4/7/2016,5 star rating,I come to this place every time I visit LA. Â They have the best service and the best dduk (rice cake sheets) to wrap the meat in. Â One lady waitress there is not as funny or friendly but the guys are awesome! Â So courteous and quick with their service!
3/25/2013,4 star rating,"This was my first experience at a Korean BBQ place. It was a fantastic experience. First of all, service is great, fast, and helpful. The side dishes they gave us were all very interesting. My favorite was the Kim Chi pancake. I enjoyed all of the sauces for the meats that they provided, especially the hot chili sauce, the spicy bean sauce and the sesame oil with salt. I am not too particular on the fatty pork belly, but the rest of the meats we ordered were really tasty. I would come back."
6/4/2013,5 star rating,My go-to-never-let-me-down AYCE kbbq place. The meat has great marbling and it comes at a decent price :L
9/4/2014,5 star rating,Worth the wait!I love coming to this place. Â The staff are always so friendly. The food comes out quickly considering how busy it is. The banchan always taste amazing. Â The BBQ with their many selection of dipping sauces are divine. They have a very good variety of meats that they offer as well as some seafood items.
7/5/2012,4 star rating,"Definitely good, but rather pricey. Always a line out the door. If you make a reservation, make sure everybody in your party is there before being seated (but even then, that doesn't mean you can get it. They still have to clean up the tables and set up the side dishes) If I had written this review two years ago, I would have given it five stars, but I I've gone here way too much and like it said, it gets pricey. You start to look for cheaper alternatives in the area after a while. Foodwise, you can't go wrong with anything on the-all-you can-eat option (which I always get lol) Make sure to finish everything you order or you'll be charged for it! I recommend trying the beef tongue rather than the normal slices of brisket since it's not as dry when cooked, as well as the thick-sliced pork belly!"
11/30/2014,3 star rating,"$21.99 per order of meat 2 orders minimum per table. loved the hospitality, hustle and bustle is awesome, very attentive. Heaters for guest who have to wait a bit for seating are a plus greeting Â was on point, they opend the door for me and my boy friend as we walked in Â loved the silver wear chop sticks. Not so in love with the sides, super weak on that end. Overall superb service short menu."
8/24/2016,5 star rating,"Second time at a Korean BBQ restaurant & first time here. Wait was short, service was great. Food was great. I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone. Definitely a new spot for me."
6/25/2014,3 star rating,"Disappointed. There's too much hype on this restaurant. Service was bad, foods were so so. Well, what can you expect from an AYCE korean bbq? Briskets were chewy like rubbers, other meats were okay. Maybe my expectation was too high. Overall, for an AYCE korean bbq restaurant, it was just okay. For travellers, please skip this restaurant."
3/20/2016,5 star rating,"After many years coming to one particular place I have decided to switch up places and try something new. This place had very interesting reviews. So accommodated by a whiny son and a trusted friend I went. On the way there my son was upset that we were not going to his favorite place. When we arrived there was no choice but park only on valet parking. But it was only $2 and I don't think anyone would want to drive like crazy around the place because there is no street parking. Place was packed. When I put my name on the list the hostess informed us that it will be 20-30 min wait. We were ok with that. When we got in we were surprised that place was very clean. Table was set up. Quality of meats was amazing. My son didn't shine anymore. Comparing to a different place where you would need to wait for everything, including water, forever, here they stop by themselves without us pressing buzzer even once. Our waitress stopped by and asked us if we need more meat or side dishes every 5-10 min. She helped is with putting meat. She cleaned our plates and cooking thing with radishes in vinegar. The experience was outstanding. The whole place works like well maintained mechanism. Side dishes were very tasty. Refills for everything come fast. Since it was Saturday the price was $23.99, but it was well worth it. I guess we are coming back for more."
6/22/2016,5 star rating,The wait here is ridiculous but it's worth it! I live in the area and this is my favorite place for Korean BBQ. Also has great service. My friend has many food allergies and the waiter was very accommodating. I was really impressed.
10/8/2016,2 star rating,"The food was ok but the line was exaggerated about 3 hours , they had priority over people with more luxurious style , bad service"
8/20/2009,5 star rating,"The best service I've ever had at a KBBQ place! Our waitress was super attentive, cleaned the griddle after each plate of meat, and cut up our massive slices of pork belly with a smile on her face. You get a crazy amount of items to choose from - I loved the thick-cut samgyupsal and the beef tongue, but the brisket and kalbi were pretty great too. I thought they had scallops, but they've changed that for baby octopus. Bring back scallops! Scallops, grilled kimchi, and some sesame oil, mmm. I ate plenty of daikon wrap and samgyupsal, and then i traded wrap plates with my friend so I could eat the other daikon wraps and she could eat the mochi (rice paper?) wraps that I didn't care for.The griddle is interesting here, it's stone and it's supposed to allow the fat to drain off, but if you cook something with a lot of marinade then the grill will just get sticky and not a lot of stuff will drain out.We ate too much meat and didn't have room for rice or soup but the kimchi fried rice looked so good. Maybe next time.Some night I'm going to come with friends and we're going to make it a marathon beer and pork fest! They're open til 2!"
4/24/2010,4 star rating,"My tummy is still full of the deliciousness that is HaeJangChon as I write this review...Here's why I loved it!1. They actually helped my All-American self figure out what the heck is in each of those little dishes that comes with the meal. Usually I just feel dumb and poke around not knowing what to do with them. Main point: This place is great for English speakers because you can actually read the menu and actually converse with the staff.2. GET THE BULGOGI!! Mouthwateringly tender and delicious marinated beef....I can still hear it sizzling....A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. The marinated short ribs were a close second, however. I could eat an entire meal of just these two. Especially when they cook in all that excess juice and get a nice crispy crust of delicious flavor on the outside...YUM!3. There's parking!! Granted, we ate at like 4pm in the afternoon so hardly anyone was there...but the good news is you don't have to pay for valet all day.The price is $16.99 for an all you can eat menu of 19 items. If you come prepared with a hungry grumbling tummy you will definitely eat more than what you've paid. In addition to the meat and usual side dishes, they also serve steamed egg, kimchi pancakes, and at the end of the meal there is kimchi fried rice and bean paste soup. Minus one star because 2/3 of the way through our meal, I think our waiter left on his break and no one came over until I rang the service bell at our table."
5/18/2010,4 star rating,"Even though I arrived this place at 11pm, it was still a long wait! The place was PACKED.There was a good variety for AYCE. I really liked their pork belly. The pork bulgolgi was alright..the pork belly was just way better. The squid was good.Their kimchi pancake is awesome! So yummy! I wished that there were more side dishes though.The staff was really nice and friendly. I especially liked the cashier/hostress. She was doing every job there was! Instead of just standing at the cashier, she helped out other waitresses serving drinks/food and cleaning the tables. And she was in a good mood the whole night. I was really impressed.Ahh, I miss the pork belly ^^."
5/26/2010,5 star rating,"This is probably my third or fourth time here, and it keeps living up to my hopes.What's unique about this place is that they (or you, at the table) cook on a ceramic pan instead of a metal grill, and compared to other Korean BBQ's that I've been to I have to say that this method is much better.I always get the All You Can Eat Special for $17 which includes endless meat, sides, egg soup, salad, Kimichi Pancake and fried Kimichi rice at the end (don't like it personally).All of their meat is superb, although I think the beef (all of it!) is by far the best. They also serve Korean Beer (OB and Hite) for $6.50 (big bottles), as well as some other Korean alcohol. My favorite Korean BBQ by far, and I've been to a few.The only complaint that I have is that in my most recent visit we asked for a separate pan to cook pork since one of us was a Muslim, but were refused, even though I know they have the separate portable pans available, but presumably reserved for bigger groups (there were 4 of us)."
2/19/2011,3 star rating,"I've had several experiences with various korean bbq places, and this is my first iffy experience.The wait was pretty serious, which is pretty normal for all korean bbq restaurants, so Â no big deal. Â Pricewise it was a pretty good deal... Meat selection was great! Â They pretty much have everything you could think of, from chicken, brisket, pork belly... and all the good sides-- kim chi, potato salad, green salad, and a yummy one- kim chi pancake!! I really loved that.Service however-- That's the iffy issue I have. Â They constantly clean your grill using chopped up daikon, which is a great idea, but the waiter we had was splattering the mess all over everyone, with no apologies. Â Hot splattering oil on skin isn't exactly a good feeling.All in all, this place isn't my first choice, but I guess I could go back if this was someone else's choice."
3/27/2011,5 star rating,"OMG!! This place is freaking amazing! So many dishes. Came here with my family and tried the all you can eat. I think we must have been here for 3 hours. All the meat dishes were marinated great. The clay grill is great. It doesn't over cook the meat and never burns. My favorite is the Canadien Pork Belly and brisket. The ""All You Can Eat"" is only $17 bucks! What a bargain!!?!? You get all the perks of great side dishes. Kim Chi radish, potatoe salad, fish cake, rice paper, kim chi fried rice, etc. Service is great. I noticed there was only 2 waitresses and 2 waiters. They worked hard. Extremely friendly, very attentive. Be aware that this place gets pretty packed and they don't take reservations. Parking is a pain because the parking lot is pretty small, but don't let that deter you from trying this place out. Bottom line..........................YOU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT! Great food, awesome service, affordable prices!!"
3/31/2011,5 star rating,"This place is ridiculously awesome. Â True Story.At only 17$ a person, you can choose up to 15 different types of meat with side dishes as well. Â You're only allowed to order up to 4 meats at a time, but you'll probably just order your favorites over and over again. Â My party ended up choosing the BBQ chicken, Choice beef short ribs, Beef Brisket, and Marinated BBQ Beef. Â They were all so good we ended up eating those choices over and over again. Â The service is kind of slow, but it is great service indeed. Â After every plate of meat is devoured, they actually come and clean your grill with radish, which soaks up all the nasty burnt meat and makes your grill clean as new! Â You can also ask for refills on the small dishes they offer and radish and rice paper.Great place to bring a group of friends to eat until your heart's desire is met. Â Call for a reservation as there is usually a very long line on the weekends and chances are you'll wait a few hours without a reservation. Â Truly one of the best Korean BBQ places I've been. Â The meat is tender, delicious, and well marinated. Â The dishes are quite delicious and traditional. Â This place is a must go to! Â Cheap price and great food!"
5/16/2011,4 star rating,"I came here with my old roommate after we ate Wahoo's fish tacos and we were still hungry. Located next to Kyo-Chon, I was very tempted to just go for a quicker fix and get the chicken. Another reason was that we had AYCE KBBQ the night before for our other roommate's birthday. BUT, I've always wanted to try this place so we decided to go back-to-back nights AYCE:We walked in and were seated right away, directly in front of the kitchen. Hands down these were the best seats in the house. When we wanted something, there were a line of workers just chilling next to us so service was absolutely great. Since there were so many meats to choose from, my roommate and I decided to try a plate of everything that sounded good.As frequent gogi eaters, we started off with the Chah-dol (beef brisket) because we knew it cooked the fastest (all you AYCE-eaters know what im talking about). We then moved on to the marinated meat and that was pretty good. Subtle in sweetness sounds like an accurate description. Then we had some pork belly and spicy pork bulgogi to cool us down (takes a while to cook) while we relaxed.. OUT OF NOWHERE there was a disco ball with rainbow lights, background music to the happy-birthday theme, and a worker holding a chocopie with a candle in the middle. It was someone's birthday at the table next to us. Everyone was singing along with the heavily accented birthday music. Thought it was pretty funny until I looked back at the grill to see my pork burning.. stupid distractions.Up next we tried some beef honeycomb and beef tongue. My roommate didnt like beef tongue so much, so I ate the plate on my own. We ended with another plate of chah-dol and pork belly just so we could mix it in with our bibimbap (rice mixed with veggies and stuff). All in all we had 8 plates of meat between the two of us, and we completely forgot that we had Wahoo's for dinner before we came to this place. Had we not eaten before and had I not been distracted to burn my pork, I think I would have rated it 5 stars.. Just kidding. The meat quality wasn't AMAZING. For the price and quality, four stars is generous.Maybe next time."
5/31/2011,4 star rating,"This place is freaken awesome! There is always a lot of people every time I went, but it is worth the wait. The waiters are friendly and consistent. The meat are pretty tasty and tender especially the thin pork belly, marinated beef, and etc. I choose this place over any other kbbq joints."
8/27/2011,4 star rating,I like their service.Food is really good.There is always a line when I go there---Even its 9pm.
12/8/2011,4 star rating,"Best Korean BBQ I have ever been. They put Kimchi Â and kimchi pancake on the stone pit so it seems like not a regular side dish. They serve a large portion of meats and the sauces are tasty.Don't bother to eat white rice since at the end of everything, you can order tasty kimchi fried rice and soup. The price is relatively cheap with variety of meats to choose. The best part, they close at 2AM.The cons: if you go in a large group, be prepared to squeeze."
12/23/2011,5 star rating,-- relatively expensive for the amount/variety that you get-- attentive service -- valet parking $2
1/18/2012,2 star rating,"The only reason I can give this place 2 stars is because the meat and rest of the sides are actually really good.I have admit, the first time I came here was during a busy Saturday night. We wanted to try a different KBBQ place than my usual spot. Prepared for the busy atmosphere but got seated rather quickly. Service was spotty and we never felt like we were a priority even though we were seated right in the middle. Dismissed it as only being that way because it was the Saturday night rush.2nd time I went was during lunch time on weekday. The place was empty save for a few people. I was in a small group of 3 in deep conversation so the service wasn't bothering me so much. It did take them a while to give us more meat when we requested it.3rd time was the deal breaker, went back again during lunch time on a weekday. A bit more packed than the previous times. Waited 15 mins to be seated, it wasn't so bad since it was a bit busy. Once we sat down it then took a total of 24 minutes for them to come to our table and ask us exactly what we wanted to order. Then throughout the lunch grabbing a refill was hassle. We had to wave them down from across the room in order to get any attention from them.My verdict is save yourself the headache and hit up a less ""popular"" KBBQ place. The service and meat might actually be a little better.Another thing. I parked my car myself and the valet guy still asked me for my keys and charged me 2 dollars for literally only holding my keys.I gave this place a chance and it disappointed me 2 out of 3 times.TL;DR Meat and sides are delicious, service is atrocious"
5/14/2012,4 star rating,"Pretty good. Â AYCE KBBQ for 17.99. We went for lunch so we didn't have to hit a crowd. Good place, def hit the spot. The place is clean and has a nice environment. Customer service was good, they set up the table before you're seated, place the meat on and occasionally turn it for you when they come to the table. They load you up on plenty of rice paper and sides when you're running low. Food was good, quality of meat was good too. At the end of the meal they make/cook kimchi fried rice on the grill for you, which lived up to the hype. Really good. And if you have leftover meat they'll mix that in for you. Soo good, only thing was that by then end you're a little full and so you wish they made it before so you could eat it with all the meat and sides. So def save room at the end, or just tell the waiter that you guys are done so you can eat it sooner."
5/20/2012,3 star rating,"After living in LA for 6 years (included 2/3 of a year in Korea town) I finally went to a Korean BBQ. It was a friend's birthday and he loved this place (and the cheap price of $18 for all-you-can-eat) so we went. We were all forewarned about the hour wait (even with a reservation) so I imagine if you weren't aware of that you'd be a little pissed.Food:Yum: Kimchi pancakes, kimchi fried riceGood: Simple greens salad (drenched in a tasty dressing,) chicken, short ribs, porkMeh: BrisketService:Our server was really good at getting the food and drink orders people barked at him. The food came out fast. The other staff were all very nice and accommodating. Total Damage: $179.81 before tip (for seven people.)Overall:I don't have any other Korean BBQ dining experiences to compare it to, but it seems like if you're not troubled with an hour wait and don't have much money to spend on dinner it is a prime place to go."
6/7/2012,3 star rating,"The place is trendy, overrated and busy even on a Wednesday night. They're open till 2AM, and turns out there are quite a few BBQ eaters even at late hours.Their side dishes is what makes the food good, The meets? - Just OK, they all tasted like each other and, again, if not for the sides, they wouldn't be good at all. If you're looking for the quantity, this is the right place, since $18 for all you can eat is not a bad price."
6/7/2012,5 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is my favorite Korean BBQ place in Los Angeles. Like so many other restaurants of its kind, there's often a long wait, but I think the selection of meats and sides included in the AYCE menu make it well worth it. The price is also pretty competitive for the quality and variety of their food. The service has always been more attentive than some other KBBQ places I've been, and the banchan (sides) are consistent and delicious (they're the highlight of my meal!). Hae Jang Chon also offers more types of menu items than most places, including squid, beef tongue, hot dog (never ordered), kimchi fried rice, kimchi pancakes, steamed egg, and more. To top it off, their sauces are excellent.Parking lot is for valet only, but I've always been able to find street parking around the block. My friend mentioned he prefers metal grills over their stone grills, but I don't really know the difference. At any rate, I've been here lots of times and they've yet to disappoint!"
4/24/2014,4 star rating,"Yeah, there's a wait so don't expect a short sit down, and make sure your whole party is with you! Cuz they'll hop and skip your ass to the next groups -_- But anywho, I came here for the first time with friends and fam.. And the let me tell you how I felt.. lolThe place is oozing with humans left and right and up and down.. So hence the reason there's a buzzard at your table.. But you're better off flagging them down with your two arms like there's no tmrw. HahaSpeaking of flagging.. During my sit down experience here.. At one point my table ran out of rice paper so we buzzed and raised our hands.. Well the waiters made I contact, but didn't process that we needed assistance.. Lmao ^_^"".. So another waiter who saw us came and rushed over and gave a plate. A PLATE. No food on it. So I flagged another waiter and with sarcasm I told her we would like a plate, but this time with rice paper on it. And she laugh and hooked it up with a cornucopia of rice paper hahahaThe meat was really delicious, but i didn't understand why they gotta save the rice till the very end :/ As an AzN, I just automatically assume i'd have the option to have my meat with or without rice from the beginning, but whatever I see their business tactics lol.."
4/18/2016,5 star rating,The best Korean BBQ in LA! Best things are the beef tongue and the thick pork belly. Make sure you get all your meat orders in before the kimchi fried rice! Had a friend in from out of town and he didn't know this - they were nice enough to let us get a couple orders in afterwards anyway. The best!

6/8/2014,3 star rating,"I whole heartedly agree with the review by Tony L. Â Overall, the place was OK, but definitely not deserving of all the hoopla or worth the long wait.Service was hot and cold, food was good but not exceptional and there are too many other options available in K-town to want to make any effort to return.The marinated rib eye was the best meat.

8/3/2014,5 star rating,"I'm glad we had reservations for 10 on a Friday night because it was so busy. We were seated as soon as our party arrived but we had to split up into two tables. Food selection was great and service was amazing. We were being taken care of from the moment we sat down until the moment we left. We ordered 6 rounds of meat and had hite and soju. We asked for lemon but they said they didn't have any; ok, no biggie. The staff came by every once in a while to cook our food and were quick to ask us if we wanted any more meat. Will definitely go back again."
7/3/2013,1 star rating,"Food is ok. I was annoyed with their services. BF was craving Korean bbq badly and I'm a veggie so I had like the one thing I could order (veggies and rice which made my stomach HURT), and cost way more than it was worth and took a while for them to refill our glasses. Food eh, but service SUCKED. I don't like to take away stars for bad service but if they are rude and I couldn't eat 99% on the menu so I just asked them to charge 1 person for the AYCE and they kept saying no we need to charge minimum 2 ppl for bbq... when it's just my bf eating. Fine, your rules. My rating."
10/31/2016,5 star rating,"The best all you can eat Korean BBQ I've ever had! The service was also really good, be prepared to wait in line though because this place is popular.

12/24/2012,4 star rating,"Finally got to try this place, so much freakin' hype! It was really, really good. I do have a feeling there is MSG & sugar all over everything though. Especially sugar! The banchan is so good here, that is probably why. I couldn't get enough of the sesame oil-laden fishcake & the spinach. Delicious! I gorged myself on AYCE chicken, squid, & beef tongue. Everybody else raved about the pork belly & brisket, but I usually stay clear. The stone grill & service are great! The Korean miso chigae was really great, and of course I loved the fried rice at the end. Glad we didn't venture into hot dogs? and tripe, it would of been just a waste. $45 for my girlfriend & I, & I think we only had one bottle of Hite & one of soju. Lives up to the hype!"

2/24/2014,4 star rating,"Love this place. Â Beware, the line outside can get pretty ridiculous especially on a Friday night...but if people (including myself) are willing to wait up to an hour to get a spot, that should tell you something. Â Best to call in for a reservation and tell your friends to get there 15 minutes early since, unfortunately, they will not seat you until your entire party is there. Â Very friendly staff and quick service once you're at your table. Â Also, they offer valet parking for $2 and I have only had an issue once with the lot being full but there was free meter parking that had become available on the street so it was no problem. Â Favorite spot to go to with a group of friends.Go in starving, and leave beyond full. Â Also try the pomegranate wine*"
4/28/2013,5 star rating,"This is probably one of my favorite Korean bbq spots in LA. A friend took me and my bf here during our visit to LA last month. I was really excited because I was in Koreatown and it was obviously the best place for korean bbq. I had been cravin for korean bbq for a while.We waited for about 15 mins or so. I didnt mind the wait at all. It was a full restaurant and it was a good sign (for me at least!). We got seated by a waiter and he got our drink orders right away. I loved all the side dishes that came with the meal. I really loved the kimchi, the bean sprout dish and all the sauces. They were a great mix of salty, spicy and sweet/sour which I love. We ordered the pork ribs, beef bulgogi, and squid. It was all you can eat and damn! Everything was delicious. I loved the pork ribs the best. It was tender and so flavorful. The bulgogi was definitely delicious. It was marinated to perfection. The squid even had a really good flavor to it. I loved the blend of all thr meats with the side dishes. We ate everything on our plates. The egg soup dish was a great addition to th whole meal. The salad was fresh and the dressing was perfect paired with the meat flavors. The place was packed but everyone was happy and full. I enjoyed looking at what other people hve ordered and took note on which dish I am going to order next time I come here. The service was great. Our waiter got us our next order of meat in just a few mins. I loved the atmosphere, though it was smokey in there but thats expected of a korean bbq restaurant right? It smelled delicious in there too haha. We smelled like garlic, bbq meat and kimchi after we left but our tummies were full and happy. I highly recommend this place!"
9/15/2014,4 star rating,"First time trying Korean BBQ in Los Angeles, have done it before in Tokyo and loved it. Tried this place out tonight by choice of some friends. Thought it was great since it's all you can eat! It may be a bit expensive but you are eating good quality meats and seafood so it is definitely worth it. The best meats that we had were beef bulgogi, BBQ pork (spicy and soooo good ) and the shrimp. I liked that the grill was a stone one, that was interesting and a new experience for me. Made the meat taste good and crisp. Also, enjoyed a nice refreshing chopped romaine salad with a light dressing before chowing down on pounds of meats. The only down fall to this place is it's hot as balls in there. Def need more ventilation and AC flow happening. Otherwise, a fantastic experience and really tasty food. Looking forward to coming back here !!!!"
2/20/2014,4 star rating,"Came here on a Tuesday around 5pm and wasn't busy at first but started to around 7pm. My girl and I order the UNLIMITED menu and stayed for 2 full hours! 1st order was the thin sliced chadolbagee, then the pork belly, with a few shrimp. 2nd order was the angus choice beef which was really tender, the beef tongue (chewy but good), and the yang gui (intestines fried hard taste great!). Finally, we got the kimchi fried rice mixed with leftover galbi and sausage and it was a perfect finish to our big feast. I probably enjoyed the kimchi fried rice best and all the delicious sides. Everything was on point! If you're hungry and want to eat some good quality (B not A) meat, this spot will hit the spot! Also the server was really friendly and gave us good tips on what to order!! Great bbq!"

Â It was empty with the exception of one couple Â so it wasn't because of a crowd that the service was bad. Â I was alone and the waitress never came to check on me, offer a refill on my drink and had an attitude when I asked for another napkin. She only gave me one with my lunch. Â The chicken was not good. Too greasy and I had more onions on the plate than meat. Â I have been to this place twice before for dinner with friends and it was just okay then. And I guess that's because Â we had all you can eat and they turned on the grill so we cooked the meat ourselves. Â I won't be back. There are too many other Korean BBQ Â in LA to be bothered with this place."

2/14/2016,5 star rating,"An hour wait for korean bbq was shorter than I thought it would be for this place. Parking in this area can be quite difficult so we just parked in their valet parking lot across the street, which is only $2 (Super cheap!). As we were led to our table after my name was called, I could see side dishes, waters, dipping sauces, and the grill already turned on for us. Woww...they had already gotten everything ready before we even arrived to our table! Amazing! :) So of course we did the AYCE for both my BF and I. We like to try a bit of everything so we only asked for half orders. We got octopus, beef tongue, pork belly, spicy pork, bulgogi, short ribs, and beef brisket. Mann...everything tasted sOoo good and fresh!! One of the dipping sauces, I just couldn't get enough of and had refills of it. So one of the best parts of coming here is that the staff here cooked all the meats for us! Yepp you heard right! We constantly had different staff come over to our grill to flip, grill, and cut our meats for us so we barely had to do anything but just order more meats! :) I really enjoyed the beef tongue, beef brisket, and the pork belly. If you get the spicy pork like we did, beware it was really SPICYYY (Or maybe I'm just weaksauce). Loll...anyways this Korean BBQ restaurant is so worth the wait so don't be scared off by your wait times! There's a Daiso nearby that you can spend some of your time there while you wait for your name to be called."
12/31/2013,5 star rating,"Really good place !!! I went to there tonight, new year eve. The Canadian pork belly and beef brisket are amazing ! We have waited for an hour to get a seat. I don't like BBQ seafood and BBQ pork, it's taste weird and BBQ pork is too salty. At the last, kimchi fried rice let me disappointed, not tasty at all. But the beef and pork belly are really good and their sauce is good too. I will definitely go back next time when I want to eat meat :)"
2/11/2014,5 star rating,"I've been here twice in the past couple years now and both times I had excellent food and great service. Â This Korean BBQ still treats you great if you don't have a Korean in your group and that's a huge plus since I'm not Korean. Â Haha. Â The second time I went they even helped cook some of our meats. Â We got kalbi, bulgogi, beef tongue, calamari, and chicken. Â It was all pretty tasty for an AYCE place. Â Beef tongue was particularly good and the chicken was tender too (first time I got chicken at a Korean BBQ joint). Â For the price and service, I don't know if it can be topped. Â 5 stars here. Â I'm impressed after my two visits."
2/11/2013,1 star rating,"Wow Yelpers! Well I cant join in with the 4 or 5 stars here. Â We went on a Saturday night and we knew it would be busy but we were ok with waiting about an hour. Â When i put my name on the list and asked the hostess how long she surprisingly said 30 minutes. Â I repeated it ""30 minutes, really"" Yes, she says. Â 30 minutes go by and we check to just see where we are and we are once again told 30 minutes. Â WHAT? So at this point we are resigned to the fact that it was too good to be true and it is an hour wait - OK. Â Another 30 minutes later we check on our name and are told it will be at least another 30 mins. OK wtf? Â So is this their scheme to keep people waiting? Â Because at this point it is 10pm and we do not have too many other options for dinner at this time of night, so we are stuck. Â So yes we stupidly waited an hour and a half for this place, hoping that at least it would be worth it.Finally we sit down and get to ordering and no wonder its all you can eat. The first items you order are a huge serving, Â im guessing to make you full right away. Â You do not want that much of each item, its insane. Â On top of it the meat is not good quality, seems like everyone who writes that this place has quality meat must have waited for hours and devoured their food before really tasting it. Â And then on top of that, you are BOILING your food on a stone surface, you are NOT GRILLING!! I didnt like one thing about this place from the lying hostess, to the food, to the service, to the smell (which if they dont come clean your stone right away gets to burning your eyes). Â This was one of those dinners and experiences that left me in a super bad mood and wishing I could take it all back and start over and to never hear this place mentioned again."
7/12/2014,1 star rating,The food is so salty and oily. They don't change the stone grill at all. So basically all meat tasted the same to me. I think it is not worth to pay $18.99 per person. I won't be visiting again. I just removed it from my bookmarks.
7/3/2016,5 star rating,This place is a must go! Â The brisket is bomb and the meat quality deserves the 5 stars.
3/15/2014,5 star rating,Soooo good! Service is great and well worth the small wait ! I come only to this Korean BBQ place it's really the best.
6/27/2013,5 star rating,"I went here on a 4 day trip to LA and I had heard so much about the infamous $18 AYCE korean bbq here that there was no way I was leaving before trying it (I'm from Nor Cal and AYCE is around $36/person most places. I brought a few people for whom it was their first korean bbq experience and I am so glad this was the place I chose. Here are some highlighting points from my experience.1) They set up the side dishes before you sit down. For people who have never had kbbq before this was a really nice intro into it and looked really fun for them.2) There are vent hoods above each table. Not all places have them and as a person who studies indoor air pollution, this is GREATLY appreciated.3) There are many different kinds of meat for both the adventurous and non-adventurous. They were very kind to my table (since I am very adventurous) so that I could get smaller portions of octopus and other meats so other people didn't feel obligated to eat them.4) They have a stone grill plate instead of cast iron or metal. In addition, they clean it with radishes so the meat gets awesome flavor from grilling. Plus I was there with kids and they all thought this process was really cool.5) The kimchi pancakes. They were money.6) The kimchi fried rice at the end was great, but what's even better is that IT'S COOKED IN THE STONE GRILL PLATE. If your stuffed by the end of your meal, leave the kimchi fried rice in the grill plate on low heat for a good 10 minutes. The rice will get super crunchy on the bottom and it's just like eating it from a dolsot bowl. YESSSS!!!!!!!!Overall, I LOVED this place. Be sure to have $2 for parking in the small lot in front as street parking can be sorta hard around dinnertime."
6/9/2013,4 star rating,Thanks yelper. This bbq place was def 4 stars for quality of meat but their kimchi fried rice was not that good. they should add some meat into their fried rice.
12/19/2012,4 star rating,"clean dining area, good service, good quality meat and crispy fried rice cooked at your table at the end of your meal! i can see why this place gets 4 stars. definitely a must try location if your a local or in town and want to try something new.  walking in, i noticed that the place wasn't that big so i can only imagine how long of a wait it normally must be on a busy weekend night. luckily, we were there for an early brunch at 11am on a Sunday so there were only a few people seated...**BUT if you're planning to go for dinner, you'll probably want to get there 30-45 minutes early. we literally ordered EVERY kind of meat that they offered on the menu...yes, even the squid (which was really good too). but the choice of meat that YOU HAVE TO TRY is the PORK NECK! it has less fat than the pork belly, the consistency of a well done new york Â steak and some great flavor. **REMEMBER to eat it with some GRILLED KIMCHI. the combination is MONEY. Remember to also save room for the crispy fried rice that they cook for you at your table at the very end. i happen to love crispy rice so this was a treat for me. while everyone was tapping out after filling up on all the meat, i continued to sit there eating the crispy rice directly off the stone apparatus ALL BY MYSELF. it was truly a savage glutonous moment in my life that brought me much joy. ****One thing i do REGRET is not asking for another plate of meat to grill BEFORE THEY STARTED making my crispy rice. They DONT add meat when you ask them to cook it for you, so YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE that you have it on your grill before they start. DON""T make the same mistake i made. REMEMBER, order another round of meat BEFORE THEY COOK YOU THE CRISPY RICE! TRUST and thank me later....i hope this review helped my fellow yelpers...bon apetite!"

11/10/2013,4 star rating,"I truly do recommend this place. The wait was a little long but it was worth it. The meat was fresh and so was the kimchi fried rise they make it right on the spot on your grill. The price is pretty fair for an ayce Korean BBQ. Our waiter was a sweet heart, I wish I knew he's name so I could give him props. I'll get next time. The only thing I see that could either be a plus + or a - is that they cook your meat for u. I personally like to cook my own meat, I think that's part of the fun of going to Korean BBQ, but I was able to enjoy my good with out having to stop and cook it."
6/19/2016,3 star rating,"This is a restaurant for Filipinos and white people. I havent been to kbbq restaurant in many years and my return to one has been met with sudden change in the demographics. Ethnic diversity isn't a bad thing, but when NO Korean people are in the restaurant except us, there leaves a very weird feeling of being unwelcome in your ""own"" restaurant. How the symbol of Koreaness is no longer occupied by actual Koreans is a weird development in LA, the supposed icon of nulticulralism."
9/19/2016,5 star rating,The food is amazing !! And so Is the service ! And the place is is just a place really nice !! The only thing that is a downer is that you'll have to wait for a long time to get a table because there are so many people go but it's completely worth it

3/2/2011,2 star rating,"My friends and I have been going to Hae Jang Chon for a long time; this time we left due to lack of service. The whole staff had switched from the normal staff that is usually there. The group tonight consisted of 6 individuals; 2 Europeans, 3 Mexicans, and 1 Chinese. Everyone tonight at the restaurant were mainly Koreans. Two parties that come after us, had been served food before we had been served. I'm not going to say that we were being discriminated but the feeling was there. I would probably go again, but I don't know if we are welcomed."
3/13/2011,5 star rating,"I want to go back already! I've been to several K-BBQ restaurants in K-town and so far this is the BEST one. GREAT service, love the meats and the best salad compare to other places. I always ordered the beef tongue, brisket, pork belly, squid, kimchi pancakes and kimchi fried rice. I have never been disappointed, it was always delicious and I left feeling fat and happy.The place was always crowded but we still got excellent service. Make sure you make reservations for group of five or more if you go here on a weekend."

Â I don't even know if you can self-park.Wait: The wait is straight savage, but worth it. Â Every time someone opens the door, the smell that comes out is straight ridonkulous. Â We waited about an hour for a table of 8.Food: $16.99 AYCE is no joke, seems to be recession proof if they raised it to something like $19.99/person. Â Don't let all these crazy reviews hype up your expectations to the point where you're expecting gold flakes on your galbi. Â It's good, period. Â Sauce Baoss: 4 Styles: Sesame Oil, Soybean Paste, Chili Sauce, and Korean Pickle Sauce.Service: This place is a straight war zone, it's so damn busy that plates are everywhere.

2/16/2012,4 star rating,"This place has a huge selection for all-you-can-eat. Where else can you get baby octopus and squid? The quality is not 5 stars but it will not sketch you out like other kbbq restaurants. The service is very attentive without being over bearing. And for the first time ever, I have loved every single condiment. This restaurant is solid food for a reasonable price... just expect to wait a little while."
8/31/2011,4 star rating,"Great memories at this place. I came here twice this summer; once on my birthday with my cousin and his girlfriend who were visiting from Winnipeg and the second time with three of my friends. The first time I went, we came during lunch and had most of the lunch specials. Everything was great but we didn't finish our food so we took the leftovers with us. The service was pretty good the first time since all we had to do was ring the bell and the waitress would come by. To be honest I was a little bell happy, but at least they were patient with us.The second time, my friends and I came during the evening via the Purple Line and we were all starving after a few hours of exploring Little Tokyo and Pershing Square/Angels Knoll in staggering 100 degree heat. After we ate some chicken at KyoChon nearby (because the line was long), we were seated and everything was set up for us. All the servers had to do was bring us the meat since we got AYCE this time. Some of the meats we tried were the pork belly, pork shoulder, and the brisket, which weren't too bad. I think the waiter got a little annoyed at me because I was a little bell happy, especially when I asked about the soup that was randomly placed on the grill along with my friend's fried rice. I asked if the soup was a ""companion"" to the rice... lol.The ambience is pretty nice, not sure if I would call it authentic Korean but they played a lot of cool upbeat K-Pop which we would pump our fists to."
8/30/2011,3 star rating,"LONG LONG LONG WAIT, i had been waiting in line for more than 1.5 hours, that's not that bad for a Friday nite.....but that's not the reason I gave them a 3 star, the thing is instead of calling the party according to the order they signed up, they just called up random party ...that really pissed me off....other than that, Â the food there are pretty good, most side dishes are good except for the kimchibtw, we got food poisoning after that, and my bf went to ER the next day"
8/29/2011,3 star rating,"Dragged the bf here after a night of drinking. I love korean bbq and desperately tried to convince him that the $16.99 all you can eat deal was the best value for our money, and that we would be able to finish it all. He just shook his head, probably thinking that his skinny ex-girlfriend would've never put him through this.Our waiter looked like the Asian version of the Situation with overdeveloped pecs and dyed hair. When we asked for more time to order, he shot back, ""You don't have much time."" When we decided on the bulgogi beef instead of the all you can eat special, he replied incredulously, ""That's it?!""Needless to say, we couldn't even finish the bulgogi beef, but it was delicious--very juicy and tender with great flavor. The banchan were also good; I especially liked the kimchi and potato salad. The dipping sauces they provided were fantastic.Despite spending the entire meal saying ""I told you so,"" as we left LA the bf said that this was his favorite restaurant we had gone to during our trip."
8/28/2011,3 star rating,"I had been going to all these AYCE bbq places until last year, but I stopped going since I cannot control my portion and kept eating more and more...anyways.. it's my first time coming to AYCE place in a year..This place already had a waiting line at 5pm on sunday.. We waited about 10 minutes, and were seated. All the plate of side dishes were set up and all the servers were nice and attentive and fast. However, what I realized was that they meat quality was just horrible.The brisket should have certain amount of fat but our were just meat. chewy meat...The marinated meat and pork were okay, but still I could feel that the quality was just horrible... not only this place, but the whole KTOWN bbq places.Now, I decided to go to NON AYCE bbq place if I have a chance...."

8/27/2011,4 star rating,"Everything about this place is awesome! Â The endless meat (awesome selection too) was great with the perfect finish of kimchee fried rice. Â We also had soup with our meal and so much more that I can't remember (it's been about a month since I started this review). Â The only drawbacks are the service (not consistent because we had to split our large group into 2 tables, and the other table didn't get the soup or fried rice) and the long wait! Â The food is amazing though and won't disappoint!"

8/25/2011,4 star rating,"So a late night KBBQ adventure led me to Hae Jang Chon. By late night, I mean around 10PM. My original plan was to head to Road to Seoul but it closes at 11PM while this place is nommmin till 2AM! I don't like getting the tail end of food for KBBQ joints. Call me OCD but you crayyy.For meats, I got the brisket, bulgogi, kalbi and beef tongue. The brisket quality is one of the better ones I've had and the bulgogi was very juicy and tender. I really also liked the sides. The potato salad and pancake were my favorites. I also like frying the kim chee on the grill and wrapping that with the lettuce salad and rice paper with my meats. OM NOM NOM!They have an interesting way of cleaning the grill. They throw this shredded, white radish strips and that magically picks up all of the black grime. How? Magic, duh. It was someone's birthday while I was there, so I got to hear 'Happy BA-SU-DEH' over and over again on the speakers. Heheh. Oh Konglish..You also get kim chee fried rice and tofu soup at the end of the meal. YUM! The service was also very efficient and one of the best I've seen at a KBBQ place. Def a fan. My friend said I came out smelling like delicious beef. I'll take that compliment anyway."
8/23/2011,5 star rating,"The salad, brisket and short ribs are killer! Just straight up thinly slice beef. Â To top it off is the kimchi fried rice.....gotta save room for that! Well Â worth the hour wait! Â And for AYCE only $16.99. Â Great food for a killer price.. Definitely a return visit!"
8/23/2011,5 star rating,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Ever since my friend brought me here, I was in love. Came here again a few weeks later with other friends, and fell in love all over again.The first time I came here, it was roughly 6PM and the wait was roughly an hour or so. It's a relatively small location, so it's understandable. The second time i came here was around 10PM or so, and even then, there was still a bit of a wait. Note that I came with only two other people. Large parties, you are warned!Like many other KBBQ places, Hae Jang Chon is AYCE~! Both the times I went, I got the beef brisket, beef tongue, bulgogi, kimchi pancakes, steamed egg, and kimchi fried rice. All super delicious, especially the bulgogi and the beef tongue (it was my first time trying it)! I'll probably try more off the menu next time (if my stomach allows it). All the forms of meat we ordered were excellent and top-notch, no joke. The side dishes were awesome, too, and kept my stomach going when we were waiting for our meat. I was extremely full by the end of the night, but it was all so worth it for $16.99. Speaking of kimchi fried rice, by the way, it comes at the end, so try to leave some room for that.Additionally, the staff here is incredibly attentive, welcoming, and all-around nice people. They cater to your every need, occasionally asking i and grill your meat at times, too. Â  Be sure to pay attention to how they clean your grill. It's different, and I was pretty mindblown over it the first time I saw it.All in all, this place gets five stars from me. I'll definitely be coming here again (and bringing more first-time friends with me!)"
10/7/2013,5 star rating,"So good that you just can't stop! Have you ever eaten SO MUCH that you threw up? Well, folks, it sure is possible! And I am living proof of that. When it comes to the KBBQ at Hae Jong Chon, I lose all sense of control and will eat until I have food stuffed up to my pharynx. No matter how full I get and despite my tummy crying for me to stop, I can't resist the urge to continually consume, devour, gorge. I make myself last until the very last and absolute BEST part: the kimchi fried rice grilled at the end. Hae Jong Chon is by far and hands down my favorite AYCE KBBQ restaurant. And will be my first stop when I come back to California next weekend! Seriously, CAN'T WAIT!"
12/5/2010,5 star rating,"Road to Seoul, we have been good friends, very very good friends for many years, but I have to sincerely depart as I've moved onto bigger and better in the name of Hae Jang Chon!!Being kicking-and-screaming-like-an-angry-child hungry through the two hour wait on a Saturday night should have been discouraging enough to make me want to ditch and go to next door to Kyochon, where you can get the best chicken wings in the whole wide world, butttt let me tell you, IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!Hae Jang Chon is foodgasm galore with their 238943 choices in meats, but what makes it go above and beyond is the kimchi and seaweed fried rice the server grills up at the end of your meal. Even if you are about-to-burst-and-die and painstakingly full, there is somehow that pocket just for the fried rice.I am normally repulsed to Korean bean curd soup, but theirs is so phenomenal, I practically licked devoured and licked the bowl. I kid you not. Oh, and their kimchi pancake is also bombass diggity!It should be a sin not to go here, so do Â yourself a favor, and go to Hae Jang Chon!"
5/25/2014,4 star rating,Worth the wait when I need a really good Korean Bbq fix this is where I go. Its quite a drive but for this place I make the trip. Definitely a big fan of the brisket and marinated beef. The beers are also a good pairing.
5/24/2016,2 star rating,"I went for korean bbq. Had never had it before so I can't compare. But I didn't think it was particularly good, it was fine. What made the experience less enjoyable though was the fact that the place was pretty dirty. On top of that, we'd made a reservation for 8 people, but that didn't mean that a table would actually be held for us. It meant that, only after all of us arrived, we were put on a waiting list. We ended up waiting for 45 min outside. For a party of 8, I think that's bad management really. No apology, not a complimentary coffee or drink to make it up to us, nothing..."
8/24/2014,4 star rating,Absolutely love this place. My boyfriend took me here and it was just awesome. Must try the kimchi pancake and the brisket. The parking is a little bit of a hassle and the wait time is a little long but so worth it.
1/31/2014,4 star rating,"In a city where there is a ton of great Korean BBQ, this wasn't too shabby. Took a star off for the less than mediocre steamed egg side and another star off for the funky tripe. Don't get me wrong, tripe is a funky meat, but I was hoping there would be a marinade to mask some of the funk. Not so. Added a star though for the yummy shiso leaf and the thin sliced pickled daikon to wrap the meaty goodness. Overall, good spot in the city."
1/25/2014,4 star rating,"Six of us celebrated my birthday here at the recommendation of a colleague. Enjoyed the meal and liked that the staff helped grill and cut our selections. Recommend the BBQ pork, chicken, beef tongue. Thought the brisket was too fatty and bulgogi tough. Liked the fact we could get the AYCE kimchee pancakes, steamed egg and kimchee fried rice. Definitely go if in K-Town but also think Manna in downtown LA is great for AYCE KBBQ ."
5/12/2014,4 star rating,"I love this late night Ayce Korean BBQ place! Everything is great from the quality of meat, price, and the service. The only negative aspect of eating here is the parking and the long wait at night. Parking can take up a lot of time if you don't want to valet in the lot. I say hit up lunch time because there is usually no wait. Overall hit this place up!"
6/27/2014,4 star rating,We came at 5pm and got a seat right away and ordered the all your can eat set. It was truly delicious and more than enough.

7/20/2013,4 star rating,Great kbbq place in LA! pay around $20 (including tip and tax) for AYCE and for a variety of meats. You also get a lot of ban chan as well as the the egg and kimchi pancakes! The servers are nice and come when you need them to. Come here for lunch because it's not too packed and parking is not too hard to find. They also cook kimchi fried rice for you at the end and it's a great way to end your hearty meal. Brisket is the best to get because it's thin and you can eat a lot of it. Don't waste your stomach on bulgogi.
10/10/2012,1 star rating,"I've been here several times before and it's always been an OK restaurant. Â Me and my coworkers went today for lunch. Â We all ordered the Hae Jang Kook =(. Â While waiting for our food we noticed that they were re-cycling the lettuce wraps that went out to the BBQ tables..meaning the waitress would not throw them away after the table left, but took it back to the kitchen and handed them to the person behind the kitchen window. Â We all made a note to self not to ever order bbq there with the lettuce wraps but when our food came, I stired my stew and behold there was a black cockroach sitting on top of the soup. Â Disgusting...we all had to leave because the stews all come from the same pot so that means that everyone who ate today got some extra protein. Â Never again at this restaurant!!!"
4/28/2013,5 star rating,"On the outside of the building there's a picture of a ravenous-looking pig wearing a bib and clearly ready to tuck into some of its own kind. Â That in and of itself is awesome, and testament to the temple of meat that this place is. Â The quality and cuts of beef and pork are all quite good and come out very tender and hearty on the stone grill. Â The banchan are of a higher quality and quantity than some of the local competitors. Â And the kim chee rice at the end is such tasty and unique ending to a gluttonous meal. Â We didn't wait for very long when we arrived, but we got there at around 6PM on a weekend."

Which I have to say its not bad since they looked busy!I will definitely go back here again...probably next time I head into ktown."
10/18/2013,5 star rating,This place is always always always busy. Â For the price you get really high quality meats and you get them fast and in good amounts. Â The service here is absolutely amazing as everything they do they do with a smile without complaint and right away as fast as they can. Â Sometimes when there's a bit of downtime they'll come over to cook for you but I personally like to cook my own way. Â Great selection and price and fast service. Only thing would be that the waiting area for restrooms is extremely crowded and the waiting area for seating is outside and quite cold. Â The cleaning of the grill is thorough also. Â Only good things for this pig headed kbbq.
1/12/2014,4 star rating,"Great place! Food is great for a all you can eat, service is excellent! The only problem that I can see is that the place is very small and if you go at dinner time, be ready to wait at least one and a half hr, it is worth it!"
3/5/2014,3 star rating,"3/5 stars because the place needs to be refurnished and the wait time can be a awhile depending on what time you go there during the day. Everything seems outdated and even some of the stone grills they use are broken but still used. The quality of the meat on the other hand is awesome , top quality meat."
1/8/2013,1 star rating,"I called them to make a reservation last friday for a party of 9 people, then half an hour later, i called again to change it to 10 people. When I called them at my reservation time, they said they don't have my phone number and name down anywhere. Then I was told that we would have to wait two hours for a table for 10 people. I don't understand how my name would disappear from the list after I called TWICE to confirm it and each time, I gave them my phone number because they couldn't understand my name."
4/11/2013,5 star rating,"best restaurants ever. Beef brisket was amazing and tasty. And fried rice was cool. You don't have to spend more than $17 per person, and you can eat enough with this money. will go there soon."
4/26/2016,5 star rating,Incredible all you can eat. Everything here is great. Been here multiple times and never had an issue and the meat is fresh. All of the sides for dipping are incredible too. This message probably sounds like I own the place.... Let's just say I wish I did.
12/29/2010,3 star rating,"Went for lunch on a rainy Wednesday afternoon. Â A re-run of a Bundesliga game was on the TV, as we waiting for our table. Â The food was better than average and the pancakes were delectable! However, the service left much to be desired. Â We had to ask for water two times; and we had to ask for another delicious helping of brisket three times, but when it did not come, we asked to the check and left.GREAT FOOD.....SO-SO SERVICE :-)"
2/3/2012,3 star rating,"After reading some of the reviews, I thought this place would be amazing and I would love the AYCE but let me just say, it was just average for me. We came in around 6pm and we had to wait 20-30 minutes, which wasn't so bad. The place got so busy later that it was distracting to see all the waiters rush to serve other ppl. It's so crowded and the total room space is small that it's not a good place if you wanna chill and have a nice chit chat. I felt like I had to hurry up and finish eating so that other customers could hurry up and eat, too. I liked how they had variety of meat to choose from. They were all quite delicious but nothing special. I also liked how they gave you four different kinds of sauce to dip them in. The soy bean soup was just average but the kimchi friend rice at the end made up for it. I haven't found my favorite AYCE place yet and if it's too much trouble (long line) then just find a different place to go to."
2/28/2012,4 star rating,If you like All-You-Can-Eat Korean BBQ then this is a good place for you... Â May be the best Korean AYCE place in Koreatown.Valet park your car and prepare to wait on a long line unless you show up early.Huge variety of meats... all cooked on a stone grill. Â Nice price. Â Our waiter was very attentive. Â Ask your waiter which meats cook the fastest and order them first. Â Very decent side kimchi dishes. Â Make sure to get the kimchi pancakes.For AYCE the meats are pretty decent quality... just don't expect as good a quality as your favorite Koreatown non-AYCE place.
7/27/2014,5 star rating,"My friends and I have been coming here for the past year or so. It is wonderful. I really love coming to this place. The service is wonderful. I was really surprised that they had held a table for us since we had agreed to meet at a certain time but a few of us didnt make it until an hour later due to traffic. Â Keep in mind we are always more than 6 or more when we come for dinner.The food is to die for, or maybe its because i was literally starving since i had not eaten for the whole day lol. but either way it was and it has always been a fun experience. I will definitely keep on coming again in the future. Hope they dont disappoint you when you go visit! ^_^"
11/23/2013,3 star rating,"HJC used to be better a few years ago. Recently came here for their popular AYCE but was a bit disappointed. I had not been here for a while so my memory of the food was much better than I experienced this time. Squid and bulgogi were the better choices of meat, the others were okay. The banchan was kind of blah and did not taste fresh. I used to really like this place, wonder if I came on an off day or their quality just went down."
8/21/2014,5 star rating,"Finally got to try this place after hearing about it for so long! I'm not much of a fan of kbbq and the long line always looked intimidating :( My girlfriends and I came on a Sunday and were finally seated after about an hour and it was well worth the wait! There were so many different kinds of meat and we didn't get to try them all but the brisket was definitely my favorite! Our server, Eric, was awesome! He took our order promptly and checked up on us regularly. He even refilled our water and sidedishes without us even asking! We were too full to try the kimchi fried rice but are looking forward to having it next time. Hae Jang Chon is definitely worth trying if you haven't yet. I will be back the next time I'm craving some delicious kbbq!!"
6/11/2016,4 star rating,It's really good... One of my fav.. Lots of choices of meat.. They have octopus and squid which is really good.. Never had those in any kbbq.

But after we told the host that was my brother's name, we got seated first and ate some side dishes.We got a really good waiter who asked our drink and he was so attentive. The other waiters who came and visited our table are just bullshit. We got our first plate of pork meat. It took them like 5 minutes to get it for us. We ate the second thin pork belly plate (for 4 of us). There were definitely just a few pieces of meat and we were still really hungry. We then asked for pancakes and another thin pork belly but ""Unfortunately"" none of them bring any of our requests. We asked 3 different waiters, and the last third waiter finally brought another plate of thin pork belly. The waiter brought a pancake too. The pancake was quiet small and it was definitely not enough for us. We asked another 2 plates of pancake and another plate of pork belly. But suddenly one of the guy (waiter) told us that they were about to close at 1.30. Their closing time was 2 AM but their last call was 1.30. It did not make any Â AM but their last call was 1.30. It did not make any sense. There were still 30 minutes before they were closed. We then surprisingly ordered 8 more plates of pork thin belly and the 2 plates of pancake that the other waiter did not bring.But ""Unfortunately"" they did not respond us and we got such a confusing and plain waiter who didn't got such a confusing and plain waiter who didn't really understand our orders (another bad thing here is the music was TOO LOUD!). It took us 5 minutes before the manager came and asked what we wanted. Yes the manager ""Clearly"" listen to what we wanted and brought one very big plate of pork belly that equalled 2 plates of pork belly. We ordered 8 plates. My brother was really hungry like he wanted to eat someone. And then we just ate the meat we got and tried to order (tried to tell them that we only got such 2 plates of 8 we ordered) and the 2 plates of pancake came to our table but still we were so hungry because we waited too long and just saw them running-for-nothing. There were more than 6 total employees (include the manager) and that time only half of the table filled up.

Only ""Good"" not outstanding. At the end we saw the check and it reached almost 3 digits, $94 point bla bla bla cents. Separated by 4 it was equal to 25 each of us.

4/12/2016,1 star rating,Their valet service put a huge scrape in my car and tried to cover it up. When I called to ask for information about their valet they said I needed to drive there and ask the valet service myself! I drove an hour and a half to go to their restaurant and waited two hours. They can't walk 10 steps to provide me with the valet management information?! I understand that valet also provides services to other restaurants in the strip mall but it's literally right in front of your restaurant. Do not use their valet service go and look for parking on the street.
4/18/2013,5 star rating,"I loved this place! The meat was tender and I loved the pork belly sliced paper thin, sooo tender and flavorful. The service was great. Lots of wait staff and everyone made sure our table was being assisted. It was a great experience for ayce bbq and we really enjoyed ourselves. This is my new fave and I will definitely be back!"
8/13/2013,5 star rating,One of the best AYCE Korean BBQ in korean town. The meat are well marinated with taste that last long when chewing it. The waitress/ waiter will help us to flip the meat. They will also ask whether we need more water / rice cake / kimchi fried rice. I like the fish cake side dish. The price here are slightly higher than other AYCEs but it is worth a try. Coming in on weekdays might be a better bet as the private parking lot gets filled easily. Will come back again :)
10/28/2012,1 star rating,"The food is good... Not great but good... I understand it is a busy place cause its popular but over 40 mins for bibimbap? That's CRAZY!!! The waiter nearly screamed at me he stated ""I don't know what you want me to do!"" (When he was asked if he could help me with a plate for my vegetarian friend for some salad while waiting for the bibimbap) then after everything I decided I wasn't going to give a tip for the horrible service and one of the servers follows us outside to tell us we didn't leave a tip... Duuuuuh if I didn't leave one its because you guys are crappy! What killed it for me wasn't the wait but rather the bad service of not offering something for my starving friend while his bibimbap was ready...the guy tried saying that it took time to do the orders but bibimbap is not even a hot dish! WTH?????"
2/8/2014,3 star rating,"3 stars bc the meat is soso, I had better meats/bbq else where.But the service, all the side dishes/salad/rice/egg soup etc, and the place itself gets 4 stars.

8/25/2013,5 star rating,"This is the best Korean BBQ restaurant I have been to! Me being an avid AYCE KBBQ goer, this place is by far the best. Growing up in Garden Grove, CA with all those other korean bbq joints, i've had my good share of many different restaurants in the OC area. Finally going out to the Los Angeles area, I've tried a few places, even the famous Road to Seoul, but this place kicks Road to Seoul out the water. The meat is great quality and you don't taste the grill fumes since it is cooked on a stone grill. The staff were really friendly and it was really cool seeing them clean off the grill. Not only do they have the usual side dishes, you can get the korean pancake and get kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal (one of the few places that I know does this). Even though the price can be up there, it is well worth what you pay. You get what you pay for right?!"
5/28/2014,5 star rating,Best korean bbq in los angeles! I love everything from the service to the food! I recommdnd to call in a reserve cause the wait will be long but well worth it!
12/16/2013,5 star rating,"I hope the restaurant would consider for opening a new restaurant in San Jose area. Everything was pretty yum, and the price was amazing. They used radish to clean the stone pot was impressed! Beef tongue and short rib were delicious! Complimentary small dishes and dip sauces made a hit! Waiters and waitresses were attentive!"
11/1/2013,4 star rating,I been to these korean bbq many many times and never had a bad experience.service its ok.on my opinion servers should be more attentives. All the meat its fresh Â and the side dishes are tasty. Its really close from my house and its not expensive so i'll keep coming here until i find a better one.
6/17/2013,5 star rating,"Paid $17.99 for KBBQ AYCE with 19 meat choices! Great KBBQ. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the rice papers that you could wrap around the meat since you can't find them in Korean restaurants in NorCal. We tried the pork belly, short rib, beef tongue, squid, brisket, and the beef honeycomb(intestines). I recommend the pork belly, short rib, and beef tongue! We were both stuffed at the end of our feast haha. Only downside is parking is a hassle. The parking lot is valet only so you have to park on the streets."
9/1/2012,1 star rating,"Came here exactly at 1:26 am. They claim they close at 2 am , had a waiter tell us that ""were closed ..."". Well I honestly thought that was BS considering we came on time. The waiters excuse was they close at 1 and that it takes time to cook the meat. If it was my response for him it would have been ""then why does it say that your establishment close at 2 when you don't ?"" I drove all the way from Torrance, craving Korean BBQ super bad. If this damn restaurant closes at 1, even though it clearly doesn't display that on the website, front of business and yelp, then close and lock the damn door! I guess you guys don't want business. These guys don't know how to run a business, period."
5/21/2016,1 star rating,"I'm only giving this place 1 star because of the service. The food was great but I don't think it was worth the bad service we got. We had made reservations for a party of 12 the day before knowing that this place gets packed and busy. We got there at 10:20 and our reservations were not until 11. We went into check in just so they know we were there. The host guy was incredibly rude and wasn't any help to my friend who went in to check in. She had asked if our table will be ready by 11 and he said that a party of 12 had just sat down at the table we were suppose to be at. We weren't happy about that but we decided we will wait till 11 since that's when our reservations are at. 11:20 rolls by and we are still aren't seated. I go in to ask how much longer it's going to take since we had reservations at 11 and had been waiting for an hour now. The guy rudely tells me that our reservation does NOT guarantee a table but only bumps us up on the list and he repeatedly continued to argue with me. Which by now I am infuriated. I asked to talk to a manager and he didn't want to direct me to the manager at all. I told him what's the point of making reservations if we've been waiting for over an hour (which is the normal wait time anyways), then tells us that our table isn't guaranteed?! Why accept reservations if you don't guarantee tables? So I told him to either immediately sit us at two separate close tables or the big table we asked for. At that point we just didn't care. We were hungry and angry. The food was great but we are never coming to this place every again."

3/23/2014,1 star rating,"I went here for lunch on a Sunday. From the beginning my experience was ruined. They were not accommodating my dietary restrictions. I cannot eat beef or pork so I asked then if I can only have chicken from the lunch menu, but the waiter kept saying I cannot without giving me any logical explanation. It took them 40 mins to get my food out. By that time, I lost my appetite. I ate a lil bit of food and I asked them if I can take the food to go. Again, they have a bizarre rule that one cannot take the rice to go because it's a company rule. I mean seriously? I cannot take the rice for which I paid for? This is not just ridiculous, but very stupid! I am never coming back here!!! Ever again!!"
1/21/2014,5 star rating,Its always my go to restaurant if I feel like Korean BBQ at night. Not too many places open this late. The staff is very attentive (most of the time). Their beef tongue is delicious! Not to mention their sides orders! Yum!

7/9/2011,4 star rating,"I've been here about three times, and I must say it's hands-down better than the $10 AYCE places that my friends always drag me too, as well as other restaurants that offer the same price. Obviously, for 16.99, people should know that they aren't getting the best quality of meat. If you want to eat high quality meat, then you better be willing to cough up another $10-$15 Â and go somewhere else.I agree that Hae Jang Chon probably isn't one of the ""best"" in K-Town. But for people who want to get serious about their AYCE Korean BBQ, this is a good place to start. I'm still exploring K-Town myself. As for the wait, the longest I've waited was 3 minutes. I actually go there early between 5 and 7pm, and on a weekday. Since I haven't actually waited, I'm not the best person to ask about that. The ambience is cute. I like the furniture and the stone grills are pretty cool to use. The servers? Don't be surprised if you get a crappy one; but in HJC's defense I've had worse. Unlike some people (COUGH jourdan r.), I don't see the problem in the waiters speaking English to you. I mean, if you don't know how to speak Korean, isn't that a good thing? And if you do know how to, take the initiative to speak it. Â If you're looking for 100% authenticity, fly to Korea and eat there. Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest. Haha!ANYWAY. Side dishes: they give you a variety unlike other place I've been to. Other people have already delved into them, and they're pretty accurate so I'm not gonna talk about them. But the potato salad is eh. I do like the apples they had in it though. Yes, the meats are pretty fatty, but that's exactly why I enjoy eating here. Brisket without the fat will just taste like beef jerky, TRUST. I've probably had better Bulgogi, but it's still edible, as well as the Kalbi. The Samgyeopsal was pretty tasty too; but remember, I LOVE FAT. By the time they offer the kimchi bokumbap, I'm already full. I tried forcing myself to eat it once, but because I was in so much pain, I could only have a few bites. Oh, since we're talking about the kimchi... LOL my god, this place has the worst kimchi, and it's not an overstatement. It's only edible in the kimchi pancakes (which are bombbb) and the fried rice. Really, when it comes to AYCE Korean BBQ places, it all depends on what you like. Hae Jang Chon is definitely worth trying, yo."

7/13/2011,3 star rating,"The meat was decent and didn't have any exquisite taste to it. Some meat was just pure fat so be careful unless you like that kind of stuff. None of the side dishes were memorable including the bland potato salad which could have even gone father with simply some salt & pepper. Offered a different variety of meat choices including honeycomb beef, squid, small octopus and beef tongue. The stone grill was a plus. Remember not to stuff yourself too quickly as they'll surprise you with kimchi pancakes (mid-way into your meal) and kimchi Â fried rice (which they're known for) at the end."

7/11/2011,4 star rating,"Food: This is the first time I had LA bbq in LA and I was not disappointed. I've never had such tender and well marinated bulgogi and galbi in my life. I could swear the cut was tenderloin. The banchan was endless, and I'm really glad that rice was optional. I felt full, but not gluttony at the end of the meal. I was disappointed that they didn't have whole leaves of lettuce, instead they had a tossed salad with a salty dressing I didn't enjoy. Also, I love how LA galbi has the section cut bones and tendon in it, but hae jang just has trimmed cuts of meat, which some people might prefer.Service:I really enjoyed the way they scrubbed the stone grill of its sticky char with shredded radishes, it was so refreshing just watching them do it.Also, Hae Jang Chon really breaks the stigma koreans have of bad service. My non korean friends always comment they feel unwelcome whenever they enter a korean grocery or restaurant. In this case, the servers were incredibly professional, courteous, prompt, and friendly. Price:It was around $22 per person for all-you-can-eat so I'd say it was a pretty great meal. Low carb, hi protein, hi veggies."
7/11/2011,4 star rating,"I think I came here at least twice in the past month. I love coming to this place for a good fix of AYCE Korean BBQ. For $16.99 you get all the meat your little heart and stomach desire and I have a big big desire for meat. The quality of meat is real decent for AYCE. The brisket is good and you have a choice of thick or thin pork belly. Also, all the tongue, bulgogi, and galbi you can eat. This is all cooked on a stone grill and they also clean the grill with radish. Not sure if it's a big thing but it is to me because I've never seen my grill cleaned off with radish. I eat the radish not use it for cleaning. I thought it was a pretty cool cleaning presentation. The usual banchan were present and were good as well. At the end of the meal we ordered the kimchi fried rice. The kimchi fried rice was really good. It was spicy, had kimchi, seaweed, sesame oil, and there was a little layer of crispiness on the rice from sitting on the grill. There's always exceptional service when I come here. Service is quick and friendly. There is always a wait and I definitely suggest making reservations. There is valet parking available but I hate valet so I park on the street. I will definitely be back for more."

I have been here many times when I lived in LA and I keep coming back because this place has decent service and unique stone grills. Â The meat of course is about the same quality as all the other AYC korean bbq places in Ktown. Â We came on a friday night around 7pm and waited about 40 mins to be seated which was fine because it gave my friends and I sometime to catch up. Â There is always a wait for this place so expect at least a 30-40 mins wait on the weekends. Â Their pancakes are delicious and I love the kimchi fried rice at the end of when your done with the meat."
7/10/2011,4 star rating,"Even though we made a reservation, it kicked us back by 20 min, but considering that we were close to 30 people, I didn't think of it as that big of a deal.This was really good all you can eat. THe briskets and the pork belly were excellent, the bulgogi and short ribs were alright. If i had to do it all over again, i'd pile on the brisket even more so than last time (um how did we order 5 orders of brisket?) the chicken takes way way too long to cook. The parking, yes! valet in front of the restaurant for cheap. I didn't feel too sick afterwards, and even the morning after I didn't get horrible meat headaches or stomach pains (meat nightmares on the other hand, yes)and of course all of you who only care about the dollars you spent, this place was pretty cheap for the quality of meat."
7/9/2011,4 star rating,GREAT banchan for an AYCE place and the meats were of a high quality. Â I'm going to address details not yet mentioned but I liked how the servers came out with 4 sauces at the get go and we had 4 waiters serving us constantly and urging us to order MORE MEAT (*_*).I feel that the $17 per person was reasonable given the quality.If you are in K-town skip the $9.99 places and come here.We were at Hae Jang Chon at 12pm Saturday and did not have to use the valet parking.
7/9/2011,4 star rating,"I've been here about three times, and I must say it's hands-down better than the $10 AYCE places that my friends always drag me too, as well as other restaurants that offer the same price. Obviously, for 16.99, people should know that they aren't getting the best quality of meat. If you want to eat high quality meat, then you better be willing to cough up another $10-$15 Â and go somewhere else.I agree that Hae Jang Chon probably isn't one of the ""best"" in K-Town. But for people who want to get serious about their AYCE Korean BBQ, this is a good place to start. I'm still exploring K-Town myself. As for the wait, the longest I've waited was 3 minutes. I actually go there early between 5 and 7pm, and on a weekday. Since I haven't actually waited, I'm not the best person to ask about that. The ambience is cute. I like the furniture and the stone grills are pretty cool to use. The servers? Don't be surprised if you get a crappy one; but in HJC's defense I've had worse. Unlike some people (COUGH jourdan r.), I don't see the problem in the waiters speaking English to you. I mean, if you don't know how to speak Korean, isn't that a good thing? And if you do know how to, take the initiative to speak it. Â If you're looking for 100% authenticity, fly to Korea and eat there. Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest. Haha!ANYWAY. Side dishes: they give you a variety unlike other place I've been to. Other people have already delved into them, and they're pretty accurate so I'm not gonna talk about them. But the potato salad is eh. I do like the apples they had in it though. Yes, the meats are pretty fatty, but that's exactly why I enjoy eating here. Brisket without the fat will just taste like beef jerky, TRUST. I've probably had better Bulgogi, but it's still edible, as well as the Kalbi. The Samgyeopsal was pretty tasty too; but remember, I LOVE FAT. By the time they offer the kimchi bokumbap, I'm already full. I tried forcing myself to eat it once, but because I was in so much pain, I could only have a few bites. Oh, since we're talking about the kimchi... LOL my god, this place has the worst kimchi, and it's not an overstatement. It's only edible in the kimchi pancakes (which are bombbb) and the fried rice. Really, when it comes to AYCE Korean BBQ places, it all depends on what you like. Hae Jang Chon is definitely worth trying, yo."
7/9/2011,4 star rating,"I went to Hae Jang Chon again and this time I could actually eat here. Â The wait wasn't as bad as the first time I went there even though I waited for 30 minutes. Â Do not come here if you're starving because it is a popular place. Â I liked how they gave us 4 dipping sauces: korean pickle soy sauce, sesame oil, soybean paste and chili sauce. Â They also had instruction how to make Korean taco, rice cake wrap, radish wrap and veggie wrap.yelp.com/biz_photos/JYGPâ¦They are generous with banchans: spicy beansprouts, kimchi, sweet potato, radish, spicy fishcake and spicy greens. Â They also give you radish wrapper and rice cake sheet. Â You get kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal. Â That's not all....you also get steamed egg, spicy sour soup and kimchi pancake. Â Service was amazing. Â I only used the bell once, to ask for the check. Â There were always friendly faces asking if we needed more meat, checking if we needed anything or just cooking our stuff. Â 5 stars service!! I liked the meat selections except for pork belly and intestine. Â The pork belly had tiny white bone and my intestine tasted like rubber.$16.99 is a steal for this place. Â I walked out full and satisfied. Â I really liked its kimchi fried rice. Â My fried rice had generous nori...that's why it was so good. Â 4 stars!!Hae Jang Chon's kimchi fried rice is yummylicious!!"
7/9/2011,4 star rating,"Went on Friday around 8pm for 2 people, wait for half an hour.All you can eat less than $20 per person.I really like that they use ""STONE PLATE"" for BBQ. Meats are good, I was too full to eat their fried rice, which looks very nice, so I want to try it next time."
5/5/2013,2 star rating,"how to say...? I really enjoyed the quality of some of the meats but I confess my bewilderment at the rating this place has. mediocre banchan and service. I don't see any reason to return, nothing sets this place apart. HA! as if my review would turn the tide of yelp success this place has right? left."
4/9/2015,5 star rating,"Love this place, the food and sides are delicious. Only downside is the wait and parking, but what can you expect? There's a reason this place is always full. I come here once every two weeks, definitely one of my favorites. I recommend it if you've never tried KBBQ."
5/31/2016,5 star rating,"Oh my god, don't make me eat here anymore. Food was too good now my stomach is about to burst."
11/10/2013,4 star rating,"Had a great time. Service was great. Meat tasted fresh and the appetizers were very good. I guess it's just like most other Korean BBQ joints in K-town. I don't understand why we waited almost an hour to be seated. Not like there was anything special about it. I guess if you're going to have your guests wait an hour plus to get a table, at least offer an alternative method of contacting them for their seat other than yelling their names out the front door. Manna sends text messages. Think about it."
12/30/2013,5 star rating,Honestly by far the best kbb place around. The atmosphere is just awesome. The service is just amazing the servers are the coolest peoplr. Its affordable and great choices. Definitely my favorite place in la.
1/13/2012,5 star rating,"Definitely the BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT KBBQ I have ever tried! The only bad thing is the waiting, because there are alot of people here!Nothing really stood out, but if you are hungry and looking to eat some meat then this is the best place to go to!"
5/15/2012,3 star rating,"So we went here instead of our usual korean bbq restaurant which will remain anonymous, when my family drove down from Corona, California!We waited almost 2 hours to get seated; I know what you are going to ask, and yes, we were a large group, and yes, I know the wait on Saturday night can be tough, but two hours?! Geeses, by the suite next door already and expand. It's just bad business.Several of the people waiting, because it just wasn't us, it was like a party with how many of us were waiting outside to be seated, ended up buying Â appetizers from the place on the corner to fight the hunger. Come on, I know the food is great and all, but its bad service. I would not return on a saturday night."
9/22/2015,5 star rating,One of my go to Korean BBQ AYCE place in K-Town. We came here for a friend's birthday once. Staff was great and attentive in getting out our meats and drinks. Loved their kimchi pancake. Order the pork belly and the galbi...it's oh so good.
10/6/2012,2 star rating,"Ribs and boulgogi both bland and flavorless. Â Side garnishments could not compensate the blandness -- either too spicy to eat or having a really off-putting flavor. Â Steamed egg was very salty, but about the most palatable item in the meal. Â I think you should offer some vegetables to cook (mushrooms and onions) if you aren't comfortable adding more flavor to the meat. Â i also like how other restaurants provide whole leaves of lettuce for eating with the meat. Â Just some ideas... I feel really bad writing this negative review -- because your service was exceptional. Â You have really great people working there and I felt really welcome an taken care of. Â But the meat was just bland and the side sauces didn't work with it. Â Unfortunately I won't be going back just because I know there is better flavor out there."
11/4/2013,4 star rating,"I've been coming to this KBBQ for a while now and i really like coming here especially when its not that busy, afternoon or really late night. It's usually always busy and the wait is about 1 hour or more during the weekend. Service is good, there constantly coming over to your table, you don't really have an specific waiter, whoever is available comes to your table and help you cut your meat or just move it around. I like that they offer more sides if you finish the first ones. It's a little expensive for AYCE is 18.25, in Korea-town you can definitely find something cheaper than that but the meat quality is not bad and the environment is also nice."
9/20/2013,2 star rating,We pull up.. bumper2bumper traffic in there parking lot. Looking like the 5 freeway on Friday at 3:30ish pm. Long story short. 1 hour and a half wait?? Please add a second floor to your restaurant or something. We left!!! Food smell in the air was great!!! and that gets you 2 stars. Get to it business owner!
3/1/2011,5 star rating,"Best Korean BBQ in LA!!!Great staff, everybody is super nice. Â The service is amazing, they're always on top of things. Â You never have to wait for refills on drinks or meats. Â The place is clean and nice. Â This is the spot for Korean BBQ!"
8/3/2015,2 star rating,"the short wait was too good to be true. we had a small party of 3 and waited less than half an hr. we were rewarded with really bland food. i think my compadres liked it but they are indian and enjoy eating everything. me, i'm not so kind. i felt even the marinated meat was bland. the kalbi and bulgogi did not taste anything at all like all the other kalbi and bulgogi i've had in my life. very light flavor. unrecognizable. and the dipping sauces did not do anything to accentuate the meat. they were either bland/boring or just didn't pair well. the pros are that they had a free parking lot and good service."
9/13/2013,5 star rating,"Probably favorite and best AYCE KBBQ around. Been to my fair share of places and this one bar none has the best service and a lot of meat options. If you're ever in the area, definitely recommend checking it out. Just be prepared, if you go for dinner, the wait can be quite a while."
3/8/2013,5 star rating,"My wife and I have never had real Korean BBQ. It's so much fun, if Â you don't mind cooking your own food. Huge protions of meat: chicken, beef, pork, and shrimp. I'm a big eater and it's difficult to get full in some restaurants, but not this one. I couldn't eat everything that was served. This is just plain fun. Be prepared to deal with some thick accents, but for us that was part of the experience of entering another culture. If you've never done Korean BBQ be open and this will be a real treat."
6/25/2013,4 star rating,"Can't go wrong with this place. Â We had a large number which shrank just before check in. Â Sadly we were put on the regular waitlist, however after talking to lots of the staff, our wait was minimized due to the original reservation. Â Once we were sat, let's see, there was lots of different kinds of meat options. Â Very filling and very satisfying. Â Can't wait to come back to this location."
2/8/2016,4 star rating,"All you can eat bbq right down the street from my office, great location, service is good, however the only reason I didn't five 5 stars was the quality of meat. It was very good but not top quality which was to be expected for all you can eat for only $21.99!"
3/2/2013,4 star rating,"Normally with all you can eat joints, the quality of the meat will naturally suffer, but it's not bad here at all. Completely worth the money and worth taking guests to.The belly of pork, brisket, bulgogi and baby squid are really nice and tender (if they're not, then it's your fault for cooking too well done).Very nice service to quickly get you new plates of meat and any condiments. You can even press a button for quick service like on a business class airplane.The soup and Â fried rice at the end is very good too.The only meat that I've tried that is consistently bad is the Galbi. Even when you cook it pink, it's still hard to chew and lacks juice and flavor."
3/8/2013,5 star rating,"Tried this place out over the weekend and have to say i was very satisfied. They told me originally that it would be a 45 min wait and we ended up getting seated in 15 min. Now for the money you pay i would say you definitely say you get more than enough. From the several different choices of meet to the different side dishes the selection was great. As far as the customer service i would say it was great compared to a lot of other all you can eat korean bbq places the waiters/waitresses are always circling around to help put your meat on the grill, to cut the larger pieces of pork belly, and most of all they bring refills of drinks, food , and side dishes without even having to ask. Now at the end of our meal i didnt know this but they cook a kimchi fried rice right on to the grill so save some room. Overall happy customer and will be back!"

2/2/2012,5 star rating,"The following review is brought to you by beef. Â Beef: it's what's for dinner. Â And breakfast, if I have my way.Being the homebody I am, a typical Saturday or Sunday night might be spent folding laundry or kicking @ss on Modern Warfare 3. Â Yep. Â But every once in awhile, I get an opportunity to get out and about, and for the events of this past Sunday to have transpired, I must have done something right. Â Mother Teresa saving a bus full of orphans and puppies kind of right; I was invited to a night of Korean BBQ with not one, but two of the lovely ladies of yelp, with the dinnertime destination being Hae Jang Chon in Koreatown.No longer a KBBQ noob, I knew what to expect; meat, and lots of it. Â A large brother like me can appreciate that, the same way Shaquille O' Neal appreciates a pulled pork sandwich(es). Â Or a side of beef. Â The promise of self-grilled meat amidst the company of two lovely dining companions made the long drive more than worthwhile, and even the parking situation at Hae Jang Chon didn't raise the blood pressure. Â Although I will say, what everyone else has said rings true - save the time and aggravation, and do the valet parking for $2. Â You'll spend far more than that in gas from circling the neighborhood in a vain attempt to find an open spot.Once my jalopy was in the loving hands of the latest graduate of Twin Towers, I met my companions, and right away, we were called to be seated. Â Damn, I must have done something REALLY good in a previous life. Â Another bit of intel; if you're seated on the bench seats against the back wall, bring along a jacket, sweater, or something else soft to sit on, since the supplied cushion isn't too comfy. Â That aside, our table already had an array of banchan (which means side dishes, for those of you that don't have Seoul) set out; potato salad, various greens, kimchi, fish cake, etc. Â All tasty, and a good precursor to the meat cornucopia to follow. Â Our group ordered pork belly, beef tongue, brisket, and bulgogi (marinated beef). Â For the pork belly, you have the option of thick or thin sliced; go for thin. Â Once those slender slices of swine hits the hot grilling stone, it turns into something magical....like the more mild-mannered cousin of bacon, letting its buttery flavors shine through without smoke or salt.The brisket is also very good, with a nice lean-to-fat ratio. Â Ditto on the bulgogi, which was perfectly seasoned. Â And the tongue was a new one for me, and surprisingly tasty; slightly chewy, with a slightly beefier flavor, it was great with the various banchan. Â As for service, no complaints whatsoever. Â The little ""doorbell"" buzzer at our table didn't see much use over the course of the evening; our waitress checked on us frequently, topping off our water, helping us with the cooking, and periodically cleaning the grill between meat sessions.Despite the hassle of parking (just go ahead and spend the $2 to valet), Hae Jang Chon is a solid KBBQ spot. Â Good food, attentive service, good meat quality, and good atmosphere make it one of the best KBBQ places I've been to so far."
9/19/2011,5 star rating,"This was my first time trying AYCE Korean BBQ in LA so I was pretty excited. I've heard lots of good things, especially about Hae Jang Chon... and it definitely did not disappoint. Went on a Sunday night. Option of valet parking for $2 if you don't feel like looking for street parking. This place is pretty popular and isn't huge so I could see why it gets packed easily. Waited about 20-30 minutes and right when we were seated everything was already set up and the side dishes were already served. Loved it. A great plus: 4 sauces! Bean paste, sesame oil salt pepper, chili sauce, and pickled sweet/sour soy sauce. Side dishes were all fresh and tasty. Korean kimchi pancakes are different from the usual pancakes I've tried... soft & flavorful. I love that they offer more than just the usual brisket, bulgogi and pork belly. 19 different choices!! MY FAVORITE OPTION: SQUID. It's hard to go wrong when you got grilled squid included in an AYCE menu. High quality meat. Loved the marinated short rib and brisket. STONE GRILL made everything taste that much better :) The ambiance is very upbeat and fun. The waiters are very attentive; side dishes are refilled almost instantly, never had to ask for a water refill, and they're always walking around asking if you need anything else. They even come by and cook FOR you. AND ALL OF THIS FOR SEVENTEEN BUCKS!!!!!!!! Go get it!"
8/14/2011,5 star rating,"if a place is good i like to give 4-4.5*.. i dont normally like to give out 5* i've been to 3 ayce kbbq places in la so far (tahoe, moo dae po, mo dae pooII) and i've only been at each of those places once.. this is the 4th place i've tried and been here at least 3x already.. that says a lot about this ayce kbbqthe wait isnt bad and food/service is great.. what i like about this place is that you cook the food on a stone grill, 4 sauces instead of the usual 2, and seemed to have more banchan compared to others.. when you're starting to fill up make sure to save and put aside some pcs of meat bc they make you kimchi fried rice at the end..and its so much better with meat! i usually stuff myself silly that im only able to have a few bites of fried rice, if that. the only thing this place needs is lemon.. my friend always ask if they have lemon bc they like to squeeze it onto beef tongue..besides that, this place is great! i wasnt able to get my kbbq fix the last time i was in town.. i think i def need to fill my desire on my next trip soon.."
7/14/2011,5 star rating,"Absolutely love this place. Good quality meat and they have really great service. I really love the pit you use to cook on because at other places, once they clean or replace the grill, you have to wait to heat it up again but here, they use radishes to clean the grill (weird I know but very effective) and you're good to go. They also make you kim chee fried rice at the end of the meal. It's not as good as mine though but it's not bad."

8/10/2009,4 star rating,"Probably the best AYCE KBBQ place I've tried so far. Â $17.99 gives you a choice of about a dozen choices of meats (beef, pork, chicken, squid). Â Included in the meal are kimchi fried rice (at the end) and doenjang chigae. Â The chadol, pork belly, kalbi, and squid were all pretty good. Â Ventilation could use some work but I'd definitely come back. Â They also have an outdoor smoking section. Â It's valet only - $2."
4/22/2015,3 star rating,"Food is great. Â Meat quality seems fine. Â But seriously, no BBQ is that good for you to stand and wait in the cold wind for 3 hours. Â Yes, that's what I did for Hae Jang Chon. Â I was so hungry and cold, and anything was tasty to me at that time."
1/16/2016,4 star rating,"My husband and I were on our way to Long Beach but decided to take a detour to Korea Town to eat some delicious Korean food, since we are big fans. It was New Years Day and just a little difficult to find one with lots of stars open. We decided to stop here. The food was amazing but for as much competition as there is here, we thought is was too expensive. They also charge extra for white rice. We've gone to many other Korean restaurants in LA and SF for much less and amazing food."
8/18/2012,5 star rating,This place was delicious... Though the wait was pretty bad it was well worth it. There's a nice little bar right next door where you can grab a beer while you wait. The food is cheap for all you can eat and the quality is delicious! The servers were very attentive always checking up on us. I love the the whole feel of the place and for only 20 dollars a person I'll for sure be coming back very soon. The valet parking is also great and only 2 dollars per car. If you're ever in Ktown area you should check this place out... just prepare for at least an hour wait any night of the week.
8/15/2013,4 star rating,"Yummy is all I can say! Good variety of meats. Loved the pork belly and the brisket the most. The banchan was so good too. Since we sat at the front where the waiters pick up the food to bring to the tables, I would say we had pretty good service Â Our grill was cleaned at least 4 times with daikon, and our waiter came by every now and then to ask if we needed more meat or banchan. The fried rice at the end was also so yummy. The seaweed they add to the friend rice adds a nice touch and gives it alot of flavor. The restaurant is located at a busy plaza so you will need to valet. I believe we waited around 45 minutes to get a table, but it was worth it."
11/27/2011,4 star rating,"first... when you go somewhere and plan to do a review don't wait a year and half.So apon another return to Ktown it was time for the wonders of the big piles of meatfor $16.99. What was a resrvation for maybe 12 turned into 10, then 12 again up to 14 and then more street dwelers found there way. FYI... Korean BBQ are not always the best place to show up late or add onto a reservation. Somehow we made it and the meat eaters were ready to dig there teath into some seared tasty flesh.The challenge... Me, I eat anything.. This group, well not so much.We went for the beef and beef and only beef.I was hoping for a little tongue and intestine. But hey, that's a different story eyhh.""None the less despite the limits of the bloody red meat, it was good! As all the other reviews say they have all the general side dishes, gotta say the kimchi and pancakes here are good Â get disapointed in the kimchi in a lot of places.The staff is pretty good and on top of it. Valet is the easiest way to go, $3 to avoid looking for a street spot in Ktown can be worth it."
7/17/2014,1 star rating,"Dont get me wrong. I used to love this place. Authentic korean bbq. But now with an english only menu, waiters defaulting to speaking in broken english, my heart sank. The service was just... rude. I brought my friend here excited to show him the place, but our server didnt even bother to clean our grill until we asked. Even then he seemed unhappy. The food quality is still decent, but with poor service I dont see myself eating here again."
10/12/2012,2 star rating,Decided to try this place based on the many reviews and 4 stars. I guess I expected too much? Waiters/waitresses were rude. When you ask for something they make you feel like it's your fault for asking. I expected better meat quality. The meat had no flavor. Will not waste my time coming back here.
8/8/2013,4 star rating,Decided to go on a random culinary adventure with Jordan tonight and I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. Everything was delicious and affordable. We have officially found our new Korean BBQ place. : )
10/6/2012,5 star rating,"This place is great when you want to feel like a beached whale. All you can eat Korean BBQ with all the tasty sides for $17.99/person. I'm not going to say much else, because all the reviews this place gets speak for themselves. Here's a tip though: the parking lot it is in is valet only. Didn't know that since I always walk there!"
6/18/2012,5 star rating,"I love KBBQ.and I've honestly tried just about all of them--from dirt cheap to fancy fancy.(Castle, Road to Seoul, O Dae San, Manna (Original Location & Fox Hills Mall Location), Tahoe Galbi)Hae Jang Chon is HANDS DOWN my favorite. It's on the pricer side but honestly just by a few bucks. It is definitely worth it. It is the only KBBQ place where I legitimately like everything! Their egg soup, their sides, their salad, kimchi pancakes, and obviously meat. Their meat quality is by far the best and they offer THIN sliced pork belly! I cannot stomach the normal cut of pork belly offered at other kbbq places, but since they offer thin sliced pork belly here I always order it! (But they do offer thick slices for those of you who do like it!) My favorites are: marinated short rib, thin sliced pork belly, bulgogi, and--roll your eyes meat connoisseurs--brisket. They do offer seafood and chicken but I'm not big on seafood and chicken is just too risky.Five Stars Because:- Stone grill, honestly makes a difference when cooking your meat.- They clean your grill periodically! They use thin sliced radishes to clean your grill; it works wonders and it helps you to last longer since your grill will cook evenly and fat/grease doesn't build up on your grill- Their cuts of meat are fresh and not dark colored or come out frozen- Not only is their meat delicious, but their sides are honestly amazing. (The main part that separates it from other more expensive kbbq places)- Kimchi pancakes fo free (and they're bomb)- KIMCHI FRIED RICE!*-- you have to order the kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal, SO SAVE ROOM. you can also save some pieces of meat and throw it in the mix with the kimchi fried rice too. DO NOT get regular steam rice, just wrap up your meat with some rice paper and save your rice fix for the kimchi fried rice at the end. it really is a gift from the gods and it makes Hae Jang Chon the undeniable best KBBQ place aroundService:- They're generally really good with service, bringing out what you ask for, refilling on water/sides. My only issue is that sometimes the women servers (I've never had this problem with a male server) get overzealous with their motherly instincts and take over the grill a little more than I would like. I DO appreciate the service and find it very kind of them to take meat off the grill when they think its ready and serve it on the plates individually...but sometimes when I get my order of meat I prefer putting certain cuts on first and saving certain cuts for later. My boyfriend also likes his thin sliced pork belly on the burnt and crunchy side so we end up having to throw some meat they serve back on the grill. I also suppose I just like being in charge of the meat and the tongs.If you're a party of 4 or more, I highly recommend making reservations, even if its a week night. The wait is generally long on the weekends. Even if you're a party of 2, make sure you make a reservation for dinner on the weekends. (Everyone in your party has to be there in order to be seated though.)Overall, delicious cuts of meat and marinade, sides that you have to stop yourself from filling up on, kimchi pancakes that put everyone else's to shame, and kimchi fried rice from the gods. And in comparison to other kbbq places, I would say that their service is the best as well. If you really want the best KBBQ, there is where it's at."
11/17/2009,4 star rating,"This has definitely been one of my favorite AYCE KBBQ experiences. I thought everything tasted great, from the warm kimchee we started with to the kimchi fried rice we ended our meal with. Came with a large group so we were able to do about 4 rounds of KBBQ, we had everything from the beef tongue, spicy pork, ribs, and the octopus, and brisket. I liked the fat in the brisket and the spicy pork was flavorful. The sides were so good, I didn't even ask for rice. Other sides included salad with a great salad dressing, kimchee pancakes, potato salad, and fish cakes. The space is open and bright, and the meat is cooked on glazed cast iron lids, rather than straight on the grill."
1/4/2014,5 star rating,"Awesome KBBQ spot! Meats are delicious, service is great considering how busy they are and they cook your meat for you. Only negatives are parking and wait time but that's beyond their control."
10/10/2011,5 star rating,"I've never had a bad experience here. The servers are nice, sometimes it gets busy so I understand they do not come around as quickly. Be patient! I only get the first three choices of meat, haven't ventured too far. Bulgogi n beef brisket are my favorite. Must have the meal with barley tea!"
8/3/2013,4 star rating,"Awesome place to get your Korean BBQ on. It's all you can eat for 18.99 per person and there is a great selection of different meats and even seafood. Side dishes are not as many you get at some places, but decent selection. It gets packet around 6/7pm so try to go on the early side if you want to avoid the wait. Great place for a group of people."

6/21/2013,4 star rating,"Came here a few weeks ago with my super picky friend who refuses to eat most things and she had a good time and so did I. I am a big fan of KBBQ and if it's AYCE and CHEAP, I'm in for at least one try! This place was great, I will definitely be back! They took our order promptly and the drinks came out fast, but the meat took a while, even though they were not that busy. One of the ladies insisted on coming to our table every few minutes and messing with our meat, until we told her it was okay, we could grill our own stuff... Then she reduced the frequency of her visits and continued to check on us every 10 minutes. Since they have a 4 meat orders at a time policy, we started out with some Bulgogi, some marinated beef short ribs, beef tongue and the brisket. All of these were delicious! The sides were kimchi, a bunch of veggie stuff (no idea what those are called), yummy kimchi pancake, green salad and miso soup, and I vaguely recall some soba noodles too... They were all great, and my friend was willing to try the pancakes and all the meat, (with salad only, lol) but she wouldn't touch any of the other things. More for me... By the time we finished this round I was starting to feel stuffed (and chugging down 2 Diet Cokes didn't help either...) But in the spirit of any good and greedy AYCE-er, I ordered some BBQ pork (sooo good! I wish I had this first!) and pork belly. About three bites into it I realized - and so did my friend - that there was no way we could finish the huge pile of food on our grill! We started to move things around on our plates to make room for everything... It was hopeless. Knowing that some Korean places actually charge you for leftover / wasted meat, I stuffed in another 10 bites or so, but after that my body was just not having any more. So we stalled and stalled, and then just decided that it was hopeless and asked for the bill, be it as it may. To our pleasant surprise we were not charged any extra for the pile of food left behind. We will definitely be back and stick to 4 orders... Maybe 5. :)"
8/1/2013,4 star rating,If you want Korean BBQ that is not as grimey as the $9.99 places but don't want to drop hunnids on couture KBBQ (which I think is pointless and defeats the purpose of KBBQ) then this is the place for you! Usually a long wait though
3/7/2011,3 star rating,"i'd always seen hae jang chon (HJC) when i go to kyochon, but i've never actually eaten there. Â $19 for an array of 19 different meats AYCE is the draw, and the place gets super busy so be prepared to wait. Â when we got there at 8PM on a wednesday, there was an hour wait, so we went across the street to haus for dessert and coffee to bide the time. Â HJC will take down your cell phone number and call you 10 minutes before your table is ready, which is convenient.once you are seated, service is surprisingly attentive. Â the meat is cooked on a big, flat, heated stone platter, which was a first for me. Â the platter is angled with a hole at one end for all of the grease to drain. Â it's a cool way to cook the meat, although obviously there is no charcoal or open flame grilling. Â another cool highlight is that periodically one of the waitresses will come by and scrub down the platter with shredded daikon to clean it.of the 19 different meats, most were beef and pork of various cuts. Â there are also at least two kinds of stomach, if that's your thing. Â squid seemed to be the lone seafood item, however. Â i'm not sure if they offer an upgrade for seafood lovers.the quality of the meat was typical of AYCE joints, which is to say, meh. Â the hoods are typical of AYCE joints as well, so double meh. Â we absolutely REEKED when we left. Â i think my puppy is STILL licking the outside of the laundry hamper hoping to get a taste.with the excellent service, uniqueness of the cooking platter, and large variety of meats, HJC is a good place to go if you're hell-bent on AYCE and are willing to wait. Â there are better tasting AYCE places, but they typically have horrible service with rare exception.as always, my preference is to pay a bit more and eat at a non-ayce place with higher quality and better flavors."
2/16/2011,5 star rating,"I'd like to think that I know my KRN BBQ pretty well, and I just can't get over this place. There are places with better meat but they are probably not all-you-can-eat, which means you'll end up spending like $40 per person. For $17 infinite food, this place is amazing. I'm going to make this review in bullet points so I don't end up writing up an essay.1) Meat: Great selection. They pretty much have everything you could ask for and more. My favorites are brisket, beef tongue, thick pork belly, kalbi, and squid. By they way, they call tripe ""beef honeycomb"". Everyone orders it thinking it's something crazy exotic and then finds out it's just tripe. Just thought you should know. 2) Service: The waiters/waitresses here are like the nicest people in the world. I don't know where this place finds them. I've been to kbbqs where every plate I ask for gets exponentially smaller and worse in quality. Over here, the servers are always helpful and smiling. They clean the grill without you asking... that deserves 5 stars forsure. 3) Extras: On top of all the appetizers you would typically get, you also get kimchi pancake. At the end, you finish off with soy bean soup and this amazing kimchi fried rice. Icing on the cake is an understatement.4) Random: Their grill is tilted so all the excess oil drips into this little container instead of into your body. At least they're trying to make kbbq semi-healthy. Plus at the end, it's pretty glorfying to see the lake of oil you've collected after all the plates you've defeated.5) Smokers: Make sure you grab free lighters on the way out!I've been telling everyone about this place. I wish they had a name in English because I always have to refer to it as ""the pig place"" (their logo is a pig). So if you love kbbq and haven't tried this place, go look for the pig! And make sure you save some room for the rice at the end."
2/27/2010,1 star rating,"Disappointing. I gave this place a raving 5 star review my first time, and I just went back recently and wow. FAIL. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!!So I was taking a group of non-korean friends to this place, and made a reservation for 5 at 9:30. They said we might have to wait 20 minutes ish to be served. DURRRR why am i making a reservationn then?! So got there at 9:27, with my entire party together, my half japanese/chinese friend went in and said we were all here and ready and was told by the hostess that we would have to wait for a while because there are other people without reservations who have been waiting for over an hour. ok. i fail to see how this is my problem. The sad thing was that whenever I spoke Korean we got service, if no, then Â they nodded and ignored us. So I go, speak in Korean and complain, and ask when we're going to be seated because we've already waited for 20 minutes. She says we'll give u one table by the window and I say ok. 5 minutes later she says how about we give you the table in the center because it's roomier? I say ok we'll wait a little more. We go outside because it's crowded as HELL inside and I noticed there's a line going down the restaurant, this side non-koreans, the other, koreans. coincidence? Anywho, as we're waiting outside for another 10 minutes I notice she's given away THAT CENTER ROOMIER table to another group. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT. IM STANDING RIGHT HERE WITH MY GROUP. so I go in and ask what the hell and she's like oh you can have this table right here by the entrance. It's not clean yet, we wait INSIDE cause god knows what this beezy's gonna pull next and FINALLY get to sit down. For the next two hours, I'm just going to summarize, SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. I've only given out 1stars ONCE before, but my god this place completely fails now. We could NEVER get anything, no meat, no banchan, no salad, no drinks, nothing. At one point I told our order to three different waiters and none of them got anything for us for like 15 minutes and our stone plate thing was burning and i heard one waiter ask the hostess ""are they done?"" cause we had no food. CAUSE WE GOT NONE. Honestly though, food was good when we got any, but the problem is that the ""any"" was rare. anyways, this place is just an embarassment to Korean food now, I'd rather go to Tahoe or Gui Il Bun Ji, So na mu, Genwa, road to seoul, ANYWHERE BUT HERE where I can get good food for the same price, Â but not have to be stressed as hellllll and be on the waiters/hostess' ass every single minute about shit. Yeah NEVER AGAIN."
10/18/2009,5 star rating,"YUM!! This was the first ever AYCE Korean BBQ place that I went to in LA. That means I went quite some time ago (like two years) but I'm still writing my review. The gogi was amazing! (especially the cha-dol) Maybe it was because I've been eating dorm food for several months and the only source of protein I was getting was in chicken and tofu, but I felt like the quality was verry good. Service was good and attentive, Ddukobossam was Â good, so were the side dishes. I also liked the atmosphere, it reminded me of Krn bbq places IN Korea. like little round metal tables where everyone gathers, eats and drinks. Also this place is one of the better parking ones. It's located in a pretty big plaza, and there is a reasonably sized parking lot. There's also a lot of street parking."
7/30/2013,4 star rating,"Pretty tasty BBQ here. Nice variety of meats including thin pork belly, two kinds of galbi, spicy pork, and all the others you'd expect. Took my three large sons here and they were scarfing. Kimchi was a bit sour... Nice odang and pan chan here...nice servers and atmosphere and cool ceramic cooking area that gets cleaned off a couple of times during the meal. Coming from the OC I can see why Ktown has such nice eats here. Will come back... Better than Tahoe IMO."
3/31/2014,1 star rating,"I know alot of people rate this place 4+ but for me it s not. People working here r all lier. We r waiting for 2 hrs and end up they r holding a table for reservations without notify customer. However when we tried to make a reservation on the afternoon before we came, they told us that there are no reservation policy. Isn't the 15 minutes grace period ridiculous? They only seat people once the entire party is there but they would allow 15minutes grace period for the reservation. The manger and waiters end up ignoring us without any apologize. Bad service 4*"
5/12/2013,4 star rating,"Delicious KBBQ spot worth checking out. Â The beef tongue, beef brisket, BBQ chicken and of course marinated short rib were all nom-worthy. Â We round-eyes brought my best friend, who I affectionately call our token Korean concubine, for her culinary expertise. Â We finished off our potato salad with apple chunks, kimchee pancake, sesame oil/salt dipping sauce, and egg souffle served in an iron crock. Â Three lunches plus beer for $65, not including tip, was ridiculously cheap for the amount and quality of food we received. Â We waddled out of there in pain from our gluttonous ways, but it was well worth it. Â  Funny enough, it's a great low-carb meal if you skip the kimchee pancake and obligatory bibimbap rice finish. Â I'll definitely be back!"
2/19/2016,5 star rating,"I've tried several korean bbqs before and this is one of the best, if not the best! Service is great, and I appreciate how they clean your grill midway so you won't have to cook your food with burnt leftovers. They serve quality meats (we loved the beef brisket, beef short rib and chicken) and are generous with their sides too. My toddler loved to wrap the meat with the rice sheets. Portions are great -- small enough so that you can try many different kinds of meat. Sub-par dishes were the steamed egg and kimchi fried rice (their kimchi, on the whole, is way too sour for us) but even so, their plus points more than make up for it, so 5 stars it is! :)"
12/28/2013,5 star rating,"One of the best $18 AYCE kbarbs in town. Bulgogi, daeji bulgogi, brisket, and chicken are all very flavorful. Samgyeopsal is ok. Service is wonderful, and they cook for you, clean the grill, and give you extra dishes - kimchi pancake, soup, and egg. Their kimchi and seasoned lettuce is exceptionally good, too! You'll feel really full, on GREAT kbarb meat!The pricing's agreeable, and it closes pretty late!"
12/28/2015,5 star rating,Stopped for lunch on our road trip. The food was excellent quality and was not too much quantity. The five star is for the exceptional service. All of the servers were incredibly hard working and we didn't wait longer than 5 minutes for anything we wanted. They were nice polite and the price was very reasonable.
7/15/2010,4 star rating,"Excellent price for ACYE....$17/person. Great selection of meat, such as beef, beef tongue, pork belly, squid, just to name a few. You don't have to get up and pick out your food, they bring it to you when your grill is empty. Not that many small dishes to accompany your meal, but hey, you're not there to eat the small dishes, you're there for the charred, BBQ meat. Service is excellent and friendly."
8/12/2012,1 star rating,"I have never ever felt the need to write such a negative comment about a restaurant, but the service my friends and I received was horrible, and I mean HORRIBLE! The waiter was RUDE, extremely rude! To be specific, he was talking back under his breath; which is understandable if we were annoying or rude customers ourselves, but WE WERE NOT. We asked politely and had manners, therefore there was absolutely no reason for him to treat us so rudely. The price was expensive for the service and taste of the food. Overall, my friends and I will not be returning. I am so upset, we drove over half an hour and it was NOT worth it."
4/18/2014,4 star rating,"Solid all you can eat K BBQ for like $20 pp. At least a dozen meat choices & they even have chicken & shrimp. The sides are okay & the Kimchi is good. Â Average wait is like 20-30 mins to be seated, service is good. Valet is only$2. I'm happy..."
3/5/2013,5 star rating,"Don't like handing out 5 stars like candy on Halloween, but I love this place. Â I've read a couple of the reviews and some people are correct. Â The quality of the meat could be better, but for AYCE under 20 bucks this place does itself justice. Â They have a tone of sides that you can just keep refilling (the potato salad is on point) and they also have rice sheets which you could use as a tortilla (for all of us use to eating tacos lol). Â The wait isn't as ridiculous as it is at other places, but parking is still a headache (as it pretty much is everywhere in or around DTLA). Â Will continue coming to Hae Jan Chon and also recommend it to anyone in the area looking to try some bomb-dizzle KBBQ!!"
7/21/2013,4 star rating,"Can get crowded and the waitlng time can go up to 1.5 hrs - ouch. But it is worth it. So maybe put your name down and go shop, or make reservations with a party of 8 or more. Most importantly, go HUNGRY. They have all the cuts of meat, and I love the appetizers and sauces. Most of the time I can't even make it to the kimchi fried rice at the end, but I'm usually able to get the steamed egg and kimchi pancake down. The last time we went, they seemed almost disappointed that we didn't save room for the fried rice. Service, quality, and portions are good. They refill everything without you asking."
3/16/2013,1 star rating,I am writing this review while in the restaurant and I am absolutely livid. This place was horrible. Service.. wtf they brought out the meat 25 minutes later even though we kept asking and looking over at the servers for the whereabouts of our food. The brisket was way too fatty..seriously?!! This place is supposed to have quality meat and theyre fucking up on the brisket? 0 STARS HAE JANG CHON..
9/2/2014,2 star rating,I was craving some Korean bbq and haven't been here like forever so I went here. We got the 18.99 and the meat choice was horrible it's more an american bbq. There are a lot of american people than korean's and its crowed. The meat is very chewy and disgusting. It has no flavor to it. This place is over rated and hyped. The service was whatever and I would only recommend if your taste bud was more of an american style you should come here.
8/31/2013,4 star rating,Come here to treat yourself to one of the best AYCE KBBQ in LA. There's always a wait but once you get seated the service is always quick and you wont feel rushed. I love all their side dishes!!!
8/30/2015,5 star rating,"BEST SERVICE EVER. Not once did we have to ask for a refill on any side or water. The meat is better quality than other AYCE. Good quality food, decent price (21.99), and splendid service. Love this place! Worth the wait."
3/17/2016,5 star rating,"best freaking kbbq place i've ever been to!! the wait is long which i don't mind because they had great business. good selection of meats and great service. $21.99 for unlimited lunch, $23.99 for unlimited dinner, wide range, and variety of meats."
4/22/2013,2 star rating,"This place used to be yummy and affordable. Â interesting stone gril instead of the traditional metal ones and a good Korean BBQ AYCE selection. Â I especially like the beef brisket and tongue. Â They also serve bean paste soup and kimchi pajeon with the AYCE. Â However this place has really been going downhill since change in management.(notice even the waiters have changed). Â The meat was subpar the last time we went. Â Chewy and grisley. Â With so many KBBQ places in LA, this one is just not worth going to."
5/27/2013,4 star rating,"Yay Korean BBQ! Very cute place. I like the fact that they use stone grills. The meat didn't feel as oily and I didn't feel as terrible as I normally do with other places. It's pretty cool that they clean the grill right in front of you. The workers are really nice. They put the meat on the grill for you each round of order and sometimes they'll come by and help you cook for a few seconds. The sauce.. (don't know what it's called) tastes amazing with the brisket. The kimchi tofu was yums as well! The side dishes were decent, some better than others. They also give you kimchi pancake and I thought that was delicious. I can still taste it a little. I just really liked this place overall. Tip: Save room for kimchi fried rice! They serve that at the end for some reason."
4/22/2013,5 star rating,"This has to be the best Korean BBQ place I have ever been to. They have a boatload of different meat options to eat and the sides were tasty as well. Everything is cooked on a stone grill which is unique since I have never seen that before. The prices are very reasonable for all you can eat and the service was spectacular. The manager himself was attending to our table making sure everything was perfect. He cleaned our grill in between meats, he helped us cook and told us about the different options he was great. Looked like he was a former member of Big Bang or something. It was really busy and the wait was a little long but it is worth it. Food was always tasty and the service was fantastic. At the end they made fried rice in front of us on the wood stove after the food. Sort of wish I had that during since I was so full at the end but that's fine, I still ate it and I felt guilty and santisfied. I was really spoiled down in LA and now I am back in Norcal for average Korean BBQ at $25-$30 a person. Le sigh. I will miss you Hae Jang Chon."
12/7/2013,5 star rating,"The best KBBQ and the best service I've ever had at KBBQ. Â I eat out with great frequency and only write the rare review. Â This place is worthy of kudos - and a visit!We could not have been treated better. Very timely seated and first rate service. The kimchi, sauces and veggies are on the table when you're seated and they are fresh and and full of intense flavors, each better than the last. Â The meats are all distinct, fresh and delicious. The steamed egg is a delicate treat that is a nice change of pace and should not be missed. Â Chicken is first rate in all respects; ribs were a bit ""textured"" for lack of a better word but all other meats could not have been better. We tried the tongue simply as a throw in - it was my favorite of the meats and will be the first meat on the grill next time! Â  This is not like your grandparents deli tongue; this is something full of pleasant flavors and texture the likes of which you've probably not gotten elsewhere. Â I can't wait to go back. We had the best of restaurant experience, perhaps one reason is that we got there before 7; after 7 there is a long wait."
12/30/2010,5 star rating,"Now this is definitely my kind of place for AYCE korean bbq! It was so funny because I literally live 5 streets down and I've never went to this restaurant... strange. I've been to so many difference AYCEs and I wanted to try a different AYCE so I yelped and thank goodness that I did because so far, Hae Jang Chon is honestly the best. To get to the point, this place is clean, serves good quality meat, and has excellent customer service! The food itself is sooo good but the service was so great that it made the food taste even better. I am all about customer service and the servers here are top notch. With every ring of a bell, they'll be there in literally 2 seconds, I love that! When the pan was getting burnt, without us even having to say a word, a server runs over with water and sliced radish (i know, sounds weird right? but the sliced radish does the job haha) to clean the stone grill for us for our next batch of meat! What a lovely, lovely place... and I never use the word lovely but that's what it was, a lovely experience. The meat is just SOOO good here, it's tender and full of flavor. I can't eat pork so most of the time I ordered the brisket and marinated prime rib, drooool. Such good quality, you really won't be disappointed! I give it 5 stars for EVERYTHING! food, cleanliness, and service"
11/1/2012,5 star rating,"I know, I know. I recently proclaimed incheonwon as my favorite AYCE kbbq, but that's because my friends have been holding out and never mentioned Hae Jang Chon. It's in Ktown and a bit of a drive. But the drive is WORTH IT!. Coming in, you have an adorable ambiance set with the romantic trees with lanterns, walls filled with pictures. But who cares for ambiance at AYCE KBBQ? Let's get to the meat of the review. Buffet is well priced and the choices are delicious. Definitely order, thin sliced pork belly, brisket, kalbi, octopus. They clean the stone grill with radish and onions frequently and the workers are helpful and nice. If you can get street parking, go for it, but otherwise valet isn't so bad, it's around $3-5 so bring extra cash."
10/9/2013,2 star rating,"This place used to be my favorite KBBQ spot about 4 or 5 years ago. Since then they have been explored and became famous. During my visits there in the last two years, I feel that their service and food quality have been declining.By the way I was just there again last night (it will probably be my last time too). Last night the waiter mixed up beef tongue and brisket together on the grill! My friend is the one who ordered and eats beef tongue, and I can't eat it. Â So now, I can't tell the difference between brisket and tongue.Also, they don't have bean sprouts and kimchi cooking on the grill anymore. And the don't offer to clean your grill anymore!"

4/1/2011,5 star rating,"One of my favorite places for AYCE korean bbq. I hardly ever go to ayce but this is one of the very few I actually crave for time to time. Although they can get busy(usually all the time), their service is always great. They give you plenty of side dishes and offer a vairety of good quality meat. Only downside is the wait time. It can get very packed especially on Fri-Sundays."
8/9/2013,3 star rating,"Three stars only because service was good. Lost a star because I've had better tasting KBBQ from cheaper places. Decided to come here for a friend's birthday and they were the only one open late by the time a friend and I got off of work.Parking really sucks. We found street parking though close by which was lucky. What mainly pissed me off and makes me never wanna come back was how rude the guy was when we were paying for our food. I paid in cash and he seemed upset that I was and he asked if I was gonna leave him a tip. I left a tip and before leaving he looked at our party and told us to tip him more. Ummm...EXCUSE ME!? You NEVER ask someone to tip let alone ask for MORE. Incredibly rude. It started off as a great night and ended up ruining it for me with this comment. I usually tip very generously knowing that most servers live off their tips but after that comment, I wanted to take my tip back. Will be sticking to Castle from now on. Better tasting meat for a lot cheaper and no rude servers asking for more tips."

4/21/2010,5 star rating,"My FIRST 5 STAR Korean BBQ place!!! I'm so excited to review about this place because I've been dying to finally give a place 5 stars!! First off, park in the street unless you want your car in valet. The whole parking lot in this place is valet. It's better if you park in the street and walk. You are going to need it after you stuff your face with AYCE korean bbq. I have to agree with Jeffrey M. this is one of the better AYCE KBBQ in LA. The price is very reasonable and pretty average for KBBQ. There is a hugh board in the center that lists all your available meat options, in case you didn't want to look at a menu. I think the only thing that was missing for me with all the other KBBQ was the service. At this place, the people are friendly and accommodating. There was one lady (I think she was the owner), she gave us our sides right away and asked for our drinks. She was telling us about all the meats and was very helpful. They keep the bean sprouts and kimchi on the hot stove looking thing. This kept the side dishes warm. The seafood pancake thing was also delish! Of course the meat was amazing. You get four sauces to try with your meats. This place does not use a traditional grill to cook your good. They use a hot stone marble plate to place on top of the flier. This actually cooks the meat a lot faster than a grill. After each set of meats are cooked, there is burnt residue, just like the grills. The waiters put a pile of radish on top and use that to scrub off any burnt residue on the plate. Â Our waiters even put more meat and cooked the meat for us. The service was SOOOOOO GOOOOD! They cleaned our grill after each meat was cooked, they cooked out food, and accommodated to everything we wanted. 5 stars all the way FOOD - 5 SERVICE - 5 AMBIANCE - 5 ILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!! =)"
6/21/2013,5 star rating,"Whenever a friend mentions ""All you can eat"" I get really skeptical and question the quality. But WHOA! I am not going to lie I was impressed, so much so that me and my friends went there 3 more times in a 2 week span. The service is amazing and super attentive but most of all the quality of meat is superb. For 17 bucks... best dea in town! I highly recommend the beef tongue, everything is good but if you want the leanest and best tasting cut I would go with the beef tongue from this spot! Will be back many many more times"
12/22/2012,2 star rating,"This place was really good when it first opened. It's really mediocre now. The meat quality is not that great. The grill just seems really greasy after awhile of cooking. But what really dropped off is the service...they seem to have a lot of new workers who seem generally unenthusiastic, and you have to literally ask for everything, even cleaning the grill, which they used to do all the time without asking. I gave it a last shot today and it's probably my last."
2/23/2012,3 star rating,"I thought this was the best k bbq i ever had my first time. About 20 times later, I'm thoroughly sick of it. THe side dishes are great, and it's pretty fun. The lines can be super long though. And while the meat was really good at first, the more I had it the beef brisket seems ultra fatty and I always feel very unhealthy when I leave. If you're gonna go go early. Late hours are nice."
1/3/2012,5 star rating,"Off a suggestion my husband and I came here with a small group of friends for an AYCE meat fest. Â We had a 7:00 reservation but still had to wait. Â Which I wasn't surprised considering no one really wants to throw in the towel at AYCE. Â The wait didn't feel as bad as the wait I have done for Road to Seoul. Â Hae Jang Chon is smaller than Road to Seoul and less lively. Â When we were seated the sides, salad, and grills were already to go for us. Â We ordered up various meats and a few Hites for the table. Â Didn't take long for our order to arrive and the waiter got us started on cooking. Â Periodically through our dining experience the wait staff cleaned off our grills. Â After we could eat no more meat, the waiter got to cooking our kimchi rice at the table grill. Â Even though I could barely eat I still have to give it the old college try to try their specialty. Â The rice was pretty good but be forewarned it is spicy. Â From the attentive service, kimchi rice, and less show boating that Road to Seoul I will be coming back to Hae Jang Chon when I am in the mood to be a carnivore to the tenth degree."
9/22/2013,4 star rating,"Super worth it - delicious food for a great price. I don't go anywhere else but here! The only reservation I have about this place is the long wait to get seated and the slow service during busy hours... However, if you go right when the restaurant opens, services is fast and great!"
5/6/2013,4 star rating,This has to be one of my favorite Korean BBQ places! Be sure to come with an empty stomach because it's an AYCE type place. The place is affordable and delicious. Make sure to save your stomach for some yummy kim chi fried rice at the end.
6/16/2013,5 star rating,"It's a very good deal, and there is plenty of food. Parking is very difficult here, and they even have their own valet system within their tiny parking lot. You'd have to eat everything you order as a buffet style (or else they charge extra)."
11/13/2011,5 star rating,"First off, loved the atmosphere and the decor. Very cute and a fun place to be. Second off, came here at 10:30pm on a friday night and I STILL HAD TO WAIT AN HOUR. My starving friends wanted to leave but I convinced them to stay and wait the hour. At the end of the night, we all agreed it was worth the wait. (Also, I think we left around 1am and it was still crowded!)Food was amazing, food quality was amazing, service was consistently nice and friendly. The three of us ordered 3 rounds of AYCE: kalbi, beef brisket, pork belly both thick and thin sliced, and BBQ pork. Everything tasted so good! My personal favorite was the thinly sliced pork belly. Wish I had room for the fried rice at the end but we ended up skipping it. Maybe next time... There wasn't that many ban-chan but it don't matta cause you want all the room in your stomach for BBQ!!Parking was either $2 valet or street parking. We found one spot about 1.5 blocks away but I feel like that was 99% luck."
2/14/2010,5 star rating,"Best all you can eat korean bbq in town at a great price! Â Excellent, attentive service. Â Try their beef tongue...sounds a bit nasty but once we tried it, we now only order that and the angus brisket. Â The meat is freshly sliced to order. Â Great included side dishes! Â Best to arrive early in the night to avoid a long wait."
11/18/2012,3 star rating,"The food isn't bad - that's not what the three stars is about. The food is standard AYCE, which would normally get it 4 stars. The three stars is about the absurd wait. I've only been here once and my group waited TWO HOURS. After that long of a wait, the only way this was getting more than three stars was if the food blew my mind. Which it didn't. Nothing I couldn't get anywhere else, which leads me to conclude that this place is mostly just hype. Nothing special about the service or the food."
7/25/2015,4 star rating,Very good but also very packed at times Â we like this place specifically because they have clean meat and take pride in it . I don't like that they don't give you bowls of fried rice before or to take home !!!!!!!! But we will be back soon
12/11/2010,5 star rating,"Came here for the second time on Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday. Actually it was Alice Y's birthday, check out her reviews on Yelp too! The banchan tasted good and fresh, especially the odaeng. I hate it when the odaeng is sort of rubbery at other places and chewy, not so appetizing. There was also spinach, radish, and the potato salad. Their potato salad had a lot more added ingredients such as apples and peas. Some other bbq places put just a few pieces of fruit and usually just one ingredient. As for the actual meat, there is a big variety to choose from and the quality is pretty good. I especially like that they use stone grills, it seems to cook the meat better without making it stick so much and it's less messy. I also felt that there wasn't as much smoke being emitted and that our clothes didn't smell so smokey because of that. They also clean the grills with radish, which seems to work pretty well and clean up all the burnt pieces and chunks. I like this better rather than having someone change the grill everytime. One of the best parts about this place is the kimchi fried rice and the bean paste soup that they bring out at the end. The first time I came, the waiter made a face out of the fried rice and this time the waiter made it into a heart. The bean paste soup also had a fair amount of tofu in it too. Also, I like the fact that they have dok and mu (radish) for you to eat your meat in, and the dok wasn't too sticky or hard.As for the service, we didn't seem to have any problems. The restaurant is smaller so the servers are able to be more attentive and come by more frequently. Although, our party occupied 4 tables, so some of the end tables didn't receive as much attention. This place also celebrates birthdays. One of my other friends had bought a cake for Alice, and the servers brought it out and the whole restaurant becomes a little dimmer as a disco light turns on and the birthday music plays. The manager and servers even come to your table and sort of sing and dance to celebrate. This is topped off with a complimentary birthday photo that they take. They process it rather fast because you receive a photo in a card at the end of your meal and there's an extra copy that they have you sign and personalize that they post up on their walls. Definitely will come back again, but it's best to go earlier to beat the crowds."
2/10/2016,5 star rating,"Came here on a recommendation from a local, We're from San Diego. It was everything that we read about and more. Â We went on a Tue night at about 7:30 and waited about 10 mins before we were seated. Everything was as previously described, banchan was already served and waiters were there right away to take order. Â We tried several different meats and the quality was very, very good. Â Did not get one piece of barnyard meat, if you know what I mean. Flavors were delicious! The only critique that I would have is because we were only two in our party, I asked for smaller orders so that we could have room for more choices of meat. Their all-you-can-eat portions are very generous and we got full fast. Can't waste the food. The servers were all great! It was like having a team of personal chefs cooking your food. The overall experience was more than expected. Â Highly recommended if you're in the area."
7/22/2013,5 star rating,"I love this place!This is my go-to Korean BBQ place if I'm in Ktown. While their AYCE is a little pricey at $20 per person, I totally love it. The best thing is the marinated beef short rib. So Yummy! also the sides are pretty tasty and offer a wide selection of flavors to mingle with the different meats. I definitely would recommend that you are really hungry or have a big appetite before you come to this place."
3/29/2012,5 star rating,this place was really good. Â was brought here by a friend and it did not disappoint priced well and you don't have to worry about parking because they valet it . it's good ck it out!
11/1/2012,5 star rating,"Wonderful experience at Hae Jang Chon! We were seated quickly on a Friday night around 6:30pm. All the meat were good, I really enjoyed the squid, octopus, and the usually brisket. I especially loved the thin pork belly. Simply amazing. That crispy flavor...taste just like bacon. We tried the honey comb and tongue but those were not my favorite because of the flavors. It tasted weird to me. The kimchi pancake was delicious, a little mushy and oily, maybe I should have left it longer on the pan. Very filling though. The steamed egg was bomb. I was sad when they took the egg away before I even finished it. I actually liked the stone grill better than the regular grills because it doesn't burn the meat. I like how they clean the grill too, it amazed me. The banchans were good...they had my favorite fish cake! Everything was refilled in plentiful amounts. I loved the kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal with the bean paste soup. So good. The rice could have been more flavorful but still tasty. By that time we could barely stuff ourselves anymore. I wish we could have taken the rest home.The service was fantastic. They brought us everything we needed when we flagged them down. If they ask you for more meat...I'd say jump on that because it took us a while to get someone later. There were a couple of ladies who were super nice and were willing to tell us how the meat tasted and would flip our meats for us. Overall, great dining experience. Good service. Good meat selection. What more can anyone ask for?-Give it a try!"
9/4/2013,4 star rating,"We got there but one of my guest hasn't arrived yet. The hostess didn't allow us sit on our table unless ALL the party is there. Really? You got to be kidding me. I have never heard this kind policy in any restaurant. Initially I asked he hostess if we can let our kids and my wife to have a separate table for now because kids were starving. What I received from the hostess was cold mean stare and bluntly said ""No""I mean I saw the reviews but it is all hype. You can go to other Korean BBQ place and get better seating service and foods. I would not come back here again. Competition are tough in LA especially Asian restaurant. What I have noticed that most of the reviews are non Korean people. I guess people who don't know Korean town or LA area would scope this place out because of high reviews. Ok. I gave 4 star because the meat portion were generous and tender. The downside not much of seafood here. Only squid. NO SHRIMP. Side dishes are very limited and side salad are to par. What interesting experience was that at the end the waiter would come over and make fried Kim chi rice for you. That was a plus. Also another good thing is that the grilling pan has unique material (non steel) so no frequent changing the grilling pan. This a big plus because I hated when I go to other BBQ place you have to ask the waiter to kept changing the pan and it is annoying. Other than food was good but seating policy they have to work on that."
8/31/2010,5 star rating,"of all the AYCE kbbq restaurants i've been to, this is my favorite, hands down!5 reasons for loving this place:1. the 54"" (or ginormous) flatscreen behind the counter that keeps me entertained while eating kbbq... you can also change channels upon request2. the staff actually serves/cooks your meat for you... nuff said3. witnessing them cleaning the stone grills spotless with vinegar-infused daikon multiple times throughout our meal4. KIMCHI FRIED RICE!!! at the end.... so save a little bit of space in your tummy for that... you can also get creative with it.. one of the waitresses cut the calamari into tiny pieces and cooked it into the fried rice for us... amaze balls5. the piggy on the restaurant sign... so cute ... and fitting :)**6. the bell you press to get the waiters to come to your table.. so fun to play withthe wait can be long, but expect to stay there at least 2 hours to eat your money's worth... .it's also open until 2 am, so if you're craving kbbq after barhopping... this is the place to be!"
4/4/2010,5 star rating,"This is a great place to fill up on Korean BBQ because its not just about the meat here: the Kimchi pancakes, bottomless salad and side dishes, baby octopus and squid to scoff down between bites of short ribs, pork belly, bulgogi, etc. We dug into mostly the short ribs, bulgogi, and pork belly, but the beef brisket is very tasty too! Go early to beat the crowd, we got lucky and found street parking about 2 blocks away but you can also do the valet parking. I can't wait to go back for more."
9/17/2009,4 star rating,"This place is definitely the best ""manna-alternative"" around. the price is the same, the meat is better and the banchan is pretty darn good. Â The fried rice and soup at the end wasn't to my taste, and I'm not really a big fan of warm, fried kimchi. I like it cold and crunchy! The pancake was good. The dipping sauces, superb! I definitely like the brisket and the bulgogi (but, you gotta let em get a little crispy!). Â The marinated short rib was pretty good too. Try it with some Bek Se Ju and you wont regret it! Definitely be coming back...."
4/14/2013,5 star rating,"Fantastic. Â Probably a little better than Road to Seoul even, which was my favorite all-you-can-eat kbbq place before. Â The pork belly is juicy and flavorful and heavenly - and of course, everything else is great as well. Â The short ribs were great, the brisket was off great, and they hook you up with some good sides as well. Â Just be aware that you might have to wait a while. Â We went there on a saturday, were told to wait 30 minutes, waited almost an hour."
7/8/2013,5 star rating,"Always a good experience. The price has gone up a bit over the last couple years, but that is expected. At 18.99$, it's still a fantastic deal! Lots of good banchan and tons of meat choices. I really like cooking it on the ceramic as well. It looks much more appetizing than on the metal surfaces. It gets a 5 b/c of the perfect match between good enough quality and really good price. Surely this isn't the quality of a place like Chosun Galbee, but it's super solid for what it is. Also, I really like the environment. All around good place and stands the test of time consistently as a good choice for AYCE K BBQ..."
1/30/2012,2 star rating,"So let me start off by saying that I've been here before and it's been good; heck, it's been great and I never had a problem. Â Come yesterday when me and the coworkers decide to eat kbbq, we were offered choices and I backed this joint since I had a good time the times before. Â My girl Sammi called to make a reservation at 9:30pm, and we arrived probably a good 10 minutes before that time. Â What you need to know is that ours was a party of 8 that moved high heaven to get as many of the group free that particular sunday; in fact, we were trying to get together for the whole month and was unable to until that Sunday. Â However, we still lost two the cause so we figured it's cool, they can come join us as the night progresses. Â So when I arrived, we valet and strolled to join with the rest of the group. Â The whole group was hungry already and one of us went inside to ask the register chick if we could start first and the other two can join us after. Â Comes back out and says our request was denied. Â Hold up, what? Â I go inside, tell her the situation and she still says that it is their policy that everybody in the party must be present in order to seat us. Â I tell her, look we'll pay for 8 people if what they are worried about are nohows. Â But I still got the run around and an apology but also a cop out that there have been cases when people wait 1-2 hours for the whole party to show up so we have to wait. Â Okay, but we made a reservation for 8. Â Doesn't matter because she won't treat us like we are waiting until the whole party is present. Â For real girl? Â I'm pissed, head back to the group and asked them to make a decision. Â Sit as a group of six and when the other two join up Â they can sit at a table for two or wait the hour and a half for the rest of the group to show up? We opt for option one and I stroll inside. Â I was just about to talk to register chick again when waiter girl comes up so I directed conversation at both and told them to please sit the six Â that were here, and when the other two show up to please try and sit them as close to us as possible at their own table. Â Waiter girl asks me when the other two are coming and I tell her that I'm not waiting an hour and a half to be seated and eat. Â She says that she'll sit the six of us but *gives me stinkeye* she will not add two people to our table of six. Â Now I'm really smoking. Â Do these people listen at all? Â Then when I told her what I wanted AGAIN, she says that she can't sit the other two anywhere close to us. Â Her exact words were, ""We cannot sit them anywhere close to you."" Â I was biting nails, so I just said to please try your best. Â I go back outside to wait and informed them of the situation. Â They were cool about it, pissed, but cool. Â Come 20 minutes later (by this time it was already 10ish) Waiter girl comes out and tells us that they are going to go ahead and sit us a table for 8. Â Hold up, girl just said what? Â You pissed me off, denied me what I wanted because you said it's policy and no exceptions, you made an exception? Â My girl Jessica C. pointed out that more than half the place emptied out while we were waiting so Waiter Girl probably allowed us to sit 8 with 6 because dinner rush was over and she didn't want to lose out on a large group like ours' tip. Â Whatever, it's sh*tty but what can we do. Â While walking in, Waiter Girl apologizes to me in a nicer tone saying that people lie all the time about reservations and I'm thinking, so you thought I was a liar, psshaw. Â I told her that I told Register Chick we would be willing to pay for 8 no matter if we had noshows. Â But we were still denied.The meat was okay, not too great tasting probably because of the foul taste I had from the battle just trying to get our table. Â The service was better than most Korean joints and they clean out your grill with sliced radish which was nice. Â The waiters are attentive, they come without asking to ask you if you want a refill on this and that. Â Bottom line is, this place is solid for food, but do not, I repeat, do not come with a large party; seems to me that it's pretty out there for the larger groups. -3 stars for the crap I had to put up with just to get into the place. Â Especially on a night like this where we were giving up arm and limb just to hang out with the people we were hanging with that night."
2/25/2013,5 star rating,"For the amount of money you pay here, you get a lot! It's $17.99 for AYCE Korean BBQ and that includes a very large list of meat selections including hot dogs (haha--I've never ordered that). Their sides are incredible too. The Kimchi is fresh, the fishcakes actually taste good, you get radish and rice paper, and all the regular side dishes most other places give you. However, an added bonus is that they also bring out Kimchi pancakes, boiled egg and at the end of your meal they make you fried rice with delicious sea weed if you request it. The atmosphere is very loud, at least at night. The music is bumping like it's a club but if that doesn't bother you then Â this is great place to try AYCE KBBQ."

8/23/2015,5 star rating,Really good place. Food taste Amazing. Good quality. All you can eat for 22$. Really nice staff. Defiantly coming back. Plus they are open till 2:00am
9/20/2009,4 star rating,"my new favorite korean bbq place :) if you've tried honey pig, you can think of this place as somewhat similar? definitely expect a line since this place gets packed pretty quick. service is great and the all you can eat option is pretty decent. if you're a pork lover - you can also get the option of ordering thinly sliced pork belly (so that it cooks in the same amount of time as the rest of your other meat) i wouldn't recommend the hotdog option ONLY because it's not homemade.... and it definitely fills you up fast. we couldn't eat more than one dish b/c they brought out 6 regular hotdogs for 7 people. i'm sure the owners were mad but we made our own ""dish"" with the left over meat and banchan. we heard that they charge $5/person for kimchi fried rice so we skipped this part of the meal :P maybe next time? also heard this restaurant gave tortilla as an option but they ran out by the time we atedefinitely recommend to your friends."
8/20/2013,3 star rating,"Whatever the position Jason is he is on a mad power trip. ""it doesn't matter what the girl said. I'm the one managing"". If he is managing he is not wise in sorting out tables according to reservation. Basically our large group made a reservation and they put other people first and in the end our group had to all sit separately. It would of been faster if we split up in the beginning anyway. It would of been a one star if it wasn't for the girl trying to be understanding. Also I added another star because of our server Young. He made sure we had everything we needed throughout our entire meal. Â Other than that the food wasn't anything spectacular for the price."
1/18/2015,5 star rating,"This place is a must in Ktown. Â Affordable all you can eat prices, and the food is delicious. Â I would advise on getting their early as their will be an hour plus wait to get seated later in the night. Regardless, this is a must stop for KBBQ."
10/15/2013,3 star rating,"Pro:Service is good. Taste is fine.Con: parking is limited. Have to go valet. Extremely uncomfortable chair, have to stand up every 10 min. Octopus and squid are not marinated, taste so so"
6/28/2015,5 star rating,"This place is always the best. Everytime I go visit LA, I always stop by here. The customer service is always top notch. At most KBBQ buffets, when you get too much, they start acting annoyed, but the workers here are really chill. The best thing here is the brisket. Everything is flavored well and refills come super quick."
8/15/2013,3 star rating,"Ok not too sure where to start off but ill attempt it anyways... I came here on a Thursday night (11 pm) with 2 other friends and it was about a 30 min wait. So we wait and finally get called in. Now, I've been to other AYCE KBBQ spots where you can settle for the cheaper option / person because in all honesty 4 types of meat is all I really need. Now, this place was different , at least from my experience. We get the menu and right off the bat the waiter who seemed to be rushing us, points at the $18.99 / person option and said it was the only one available. We were a bit confused Cus I thought we had options... Clearly we don't at (hae Jong choi ). Meat was really really good and at one point we didn't know how to tell if one of the meats was cooked so the manager actually came and Cooked it for us and was very nice. Now back to our other servers.... Both of them sucked, they pressured and rushed us all the time, never came by to check on us and at the very end he was offended when we left him a 8% tip which was waaaaaaay more than his ass deserved so we ended up giving him another 2% because he began making somewhat of a scene. Good food, kinda pricy,, I say just go to O Dae San on Olympic between fedora and Catalina , 3 stars for the food"
12/1/2013,3 star rating,"My non korean friends like this place. I have no idea why. I think the meat and food is just okay. Not the best you can get for ayce, I prefer kogiking korean bbq on western."
4/14/2010,1 star rating,"I've had bad service at a AYCE Korean BBQ before but I'm usually forgiving if its busy. Â Not here. Â I have never had such bad service anywhere. Â I had to wait 30 minutes after my friends had already waited for nearly an hour. This is fine and expected for such a highly rated restaurant. Â I thought things would be more pleasant once we got seated. Nope, I was wrong. Â My friends and I were invisible to the waiters because we got ignored the entire night. Â Does it take 3 waiters to bring us some more water or to take our order again? Â Save your time and spend your $20 bucks at one of the dozens of other AYCE in LA."
2/24/2013,5 star rating,"Ah, Korean BBQ. Â This place is a great option for ""All you can eat"" (AYCE). The grill is a dome shape, and they throw a bunch of kimchi and sprouts on the grill before you even get the meat. Â They hook you up with a kimichi pancake beforehand (grilling it up, to get it crispy). Â The banchan is delicious. Â The meat is really good. Â It's open super late (I think 2am.) Â Excellent!"
12/19/2012,2 star rating,"First of all let me say, something very shady is happening at this restaurant. The vibe is odd and the service is uncomfortable. The worst part of my experience was when a server poured raw beef blood into my beer as she was replenishing our hot stone with meat. I pointed this out to her and she didn't really care that my beer was now ruined. All she did was take away my bloody beer and bring me back a clean empty glass. Well there went my Korean beer! Glad I got to pay for a beer I didnt drink. Ugh.However, Most importantly, the food is just plain ole 'good.' Not amazing and not horrible. But considering how many delicious All U Can Eat Korean BBQ places there are in K-Town, I'll never return to Hae Jang Chon.We went last night to celebrates a friends milestone birthday. Her husband brought a fancy $55 cake for the occasion and gave it to our server to hold till after the meal. Ultimately an employee ended up dropping it upside down on the kitchen floor so it wasn't salvageable. The restaurant manager told us that if we wanted any monetary compensation, it would have to come straight out of the servers pocket. The restaurant doesn't have insurance or tolerance for any accidents from their employees??? What the F***? It was a very sad situation. Our server didn't speak very much English so communicating with him was very difficult. And The manager was less than helpful and rather cold. All in all, it was a very negative and non accommodating evening.I wouldn't recommend Hae Jang Chon to anyone. EVER! Find another place in K-Town with amazing service and food. There are TONS of them!"
8/5/2013,5 star rating,"This place is the best Korean BBQ by far. The food was really good the Bulgogi was delicious, pork belly was really juicy, and the side dishew were really appetizing. And they cook kimchi fried rice toward the end of the meal which was a super plus. Open till 2am so it's a plus after going around LA"
10/1/2013,5 star rating,SO GOOD. Their meat selection was great! The waiters help you cook your food from time to time and they're always around to check if something is cooking on your pan! Wonderful service & extraordinarily delicious food. 10/10 would eat here again!

9/30/2013,5 star rating,"as far as Korean bbq this is almost as good as it gets. We went for the all you can eat set up and it was very good. We did the short rib, brisket, tongue, octopus and shrimp... we were stuffed. All good. The short rib as usually was great. I did miss not having charcoal at the table side set up. The short waitress hustled and had us served asap she was very nice and the service was great. It was packed and for good reason. Fresh meat and fresh seafood at a killer price."
9/27/2013,1 star rating,I went here last night around 12 and it was the WORST FOOD AND WORST SERVICE EVER ! They literally rushed us out around 1:15 when they close at 2. The meat was sooooo dry. The kimchi tasted old and sour. The service sucked. They were eating with their friends in the corner and not paying attention to the customers. My advice.... DONT EAT HERE. Go to Gen Korean BBQ. It has amazing service and yummy meat.
6/10/2013,4 star rating,Came here after a Laker game. Â Great food. Everything is really fresh and the side dishes were perfectly seasoned. Â Nothing to salty. Â Staff was attentive. Â Will come here again if I'm ever in town. Â We came right before the rush but it seems like a wait to get in.
3/9/2013,2 star rating,"this was the first korean bbq place id gone to since moving to LA and recently went back for my second time.. Â not coming back for a third time for a few reasons:1. had to wait outside 15 min despite having a reservation2. meat quality is totally inferior to other AYCE KBBQ like road to seoul and oo-kook.. 3. the ceramic griddle sucks for grilling meat nicely4. compared to the other spots i mentioned, they have much more limited banchan(side dishes)its a popular place but like i mentioned there are just much better options out there available.."
2/7/2013,5 star rating,"Yummy! Great price for great kbbq. If you're doing the AYCE, try the squid it's very sweet and yummy. Love how they make kimchee fried rice for you in the end, just make sure you dont order white rice while you dine because they will take away the kim chee fried rice in the end. It's pretty cool they just come and cook it on your table. Service is nice comparing to many other kbbq joints."
4/18/2013,3 star rating,"Parking- valet $2Side dishes: spicy fish cake, raddish, spinach, potato salad, steamed egg.Meat: cooked on a stone grill. Brisket was prpbably the best. Short rib was meh as well as the bulgogi. Pork was okay. Found it weird that we couldn't get the fried rice until after our meal. Really?! You have a choice between steamed or fried and it was impossible to get it before the end of our meal..Server Eric seemed apathetic. Didn't take orders correctly. And barely came around. And you have to ""order"" the meat in advance because they prepare it in the kitchen and takes a few minutes to come out. Okay place. Not that amazing. Definitely wouldn't be my choice to come back."

Â The waiter at first did not come to say sorry until the female manager acknowledge the mistake. Â However, Â during the dinne4, Â the other Â manager, Â Jay, Â was very rude to customer and coworker. Â This is my opinion. Â This will be my last time and will not recommend"
1/14/2012,1 star rating,Wait is horrible and not worth it. Â Waited over two hours with a Â reservation. Â The party before us waited two hours as well. Â Go elsewhere.Edit: worsed K-BBQ I have been to. Â The stone traps the liquid/oil thus making it seem like we were stewing our meat rather than BBQ-ing. Â The table is so small that I managed to burn my fingers twice because the banchon plates are next to the stone and burns the plates. Â The grills attached to the table is much better. Â Reservations are useless as well.
6/25/2012,3 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon wasn't bad, but I thought they could improve on the ban chan and service. Â I think the quality of ban chan can be measured first by the kimchee, and then everything else. Â The kimchee was super pickled (over-ripened) and there weren't many other kinds of ban chan. Â It just didn't do it for me. Â The quality of meats were pretty good, except for the cha dol. Â The cha dol in particular was fairly tough. Â My gf mentioned that it wasn't always that way. Â In any case, it's not bad for $17.99 all you can eat Korean BBQ, but I'm confident there are other better joints. Â As far as the service is concerned,... nothing memorable. Â One of the servers almost knocked the food off my chopsticks after bumping into me, but he didn't even turn around to say 'excuse me' or apologize. Â This place is just average."
5/25/2015,5 star rating,"If you haven't come here for Korean BBQ, you're doing it wrong *I mean that in the most non-offensive way possible*. The quality of the meat and the service here are really exceptional. Â We decided to try something new last night and came here. Â When we arrived, we were slightly discouraged by the number of people outside. Â I put my name on the list for 2 people and was told 'If everyone on this list is still here, it's a 2 hour wait'. Â We weren't thrilled, but in our experience, everywhere with a wait is usually worth it. Â We waited patiently, and while waiting we were approached a few times by the host who had been checking to see if everyone on the list had actually waited. Â We were pleasantly surprised to have only waited about 50 minutes before we were seated. Â The table was already laid out with small plates of pickled radishes, sesame oil, chili paste, kimchi, bean sprout salad, green salad, and other various delights. Â We were greeted immediately by our server (I think his name was Steve). Â He was super friendly and helpful in picking out which meats to try. Â We had Bulgogi, Beef Tongue, Pork Shoulder, Thin Pork Belly, Shrimp, Thick Pork Belly, Beef Brisket and Marinated Short Rib. Â Our favorites were the Bulgogi and the Marinated Short Rib. Â At the end of the meal we had the Kimchi Fried Rice, which is loaded with green onions and seaweed. Â It was truly delicious. Â We ordered 3 meats at a time, and each time they came out someone was there to put it on the magical cooking stone and start it for us. Â Then, someone would come around and check on us, and cut the meat if needed. Â They made sur eour waters and beers were full as we happily grazed on everything in front of us. Â This was seriously good service - I hope we get the same server if we go again. Â This guy was great. Â This place changed the game for us. Â It's so good that we'll wait in this line forever going forward if we want Korean BBQ."
2/22/2012,5 star rating,"The hours are perfect. The service is friendly. The food is perfection. The place is clean as clean can be.Road to Seoul and Have Jang Chon are my top 2 KBBQ places in Koreatown. Although the pricier of AYCE, it's worth the money, and I'm always happily satisfied. The meat is thick, marinated perfectly, and cooked to prime on their special grills. I love how the service cleans the grills with turnip. It's so fun to watch :)The ban chan is yummy, but honestly, I come for the MEAT, and it's the meat I care about. I've come with a party of four, and we were seated immediately. Coming Sunday at 11AM is a good idea if you don't want any waits. The bulgogi and galbi are simply divine. I have nothing bad to say about this place. It keeps me coming back for a reason.Simply, I've never had korean BBQ at a better place."
9/8/2015,4 star rating,All you can eat for lunch for $19.99 and $21.99 for all you can eat for dinner. 22 items to choose from and all pretty decent. Good for large groups. Good eatin' so I don't mind stinking like kbbq afterwards.

7/27/2010,5 star rating,"Went here again with a KBBQ newbie... They loved just about every thing we threw on the grill. And this was someone with a lot of food history under their belt - did that come out wrong?? what I mean was, they definitely hit up a variety and vast amount of dining establishments in LA as that is part of their job. So pleasing one such reviewer was daunting task - but Hae Jang Chon succeeded in making the KBBQ-devirginizing a gentle, yet thrillingly delicious experience."
6/24/2010,5 star rating,"any yelper worth his salt, pepper & sesame oil knows that not all Korean BBQ joints are created equal. In fact some are much much more equaler. Â But from a primordial muck of infinite carnivorous competition arises Hae Jang Chon - indeed all Hail Hae Jang Chon and it's stone grill goodness.Before i enthrall you and moisten your loins with my finest and most tantalizing prose, take a look at this hilarious review: is.gd/d1Nladid u read it? Unfortunately i didn't receive *Cost*umer service nor was a frock thrown at my grandma. that would definitely be -1 star!Annnnd we're back: Ya gotta start with with brisket...work your way up like a wine flight. You've never had brisket in all it's juice trapped glory as when it's been cooked on a clay griddle. Most brisket turns into a shriveled ball of beef gristle - at HJC....practically prociutto! When dipped in the side sauces, it's a meat masterpiece.Thin sliced beef tongue - i mean, i don't like it but this was the best i ever had! Bulgogi - one of the more beloved beefstuffs, You're so juicy and pregnant with your own nectar at HJC. 2 orders minimum!Got Damn Joo Mul Luk (seasoned beef?) - i don't know how to say you in English, but you are so good to my tummy, you speak the language of love. You have sex on my tongue and spill your essence down my throat. WTF! no...FTW!Galbi...are there really words to describe the ambrosia within your tender borders of beef? Is there a meat with more real estate of flavor than thee? No. And now to be cooked by the -now much exalted- stone grill? The flash frying disintegrates the integrity of the protein strains, leaving your teeth to ""chew"" through nigh liquid beef. are you not entertained? dare you dip it into the salt & pepper with Sesame oil? Then you are the hedonistic tart for which my heart beats.Hot Dog -...yes, i ordered the hot dog. I ate it. It certainly Was. the salad, the bbq chicken, the thin or thick pork belly, the rice paper wrappers, the intestine ( :/ ) It's all a cut above at this resto. For serious.Loosen your belt and over-extend your welcome at this haven of hog & heifer. Service is cool EVEN if you go with a Korean girl and you are a black man! ahhh don't think i wouldn't go there! ;P Don't forget to ask for the kimchi fried rice at the end of your meal. I don't often save room for these sort of carbs when i'm on my meat grind, but it was pretty damn good. I think it's an extra buck or two...Slap my butt and call me Sassy, this is my all-time favorite Korean Barbecue restaurant."
5/29/2012,3 star rating,"I came to this restutant with my family for my mom's birthday and the service was super awesome and the people were super nice, nut the meat did not have much flavor for me. The grill was unique because it was round and drained out the oil which is awesome for those who does not oily food. Overall, this place is a 3.5 for me"
10/10/2008,4 star rating,"eating korean bbq at 10pm is really not a good idea... especially if its AYCE. but aside from my glutenocity (if thats not a word, it should be) i enjoyed the experience. for only $16.99 you can stuff your starving fat face.we were seated along the wall at a non-round table. i later found out that the seat i had taken had no back rest. shit... i was forced to sit upright and support my increasingly large stomach as the meal progressed, but i'll get back to that later. sauces and accoutrement were brought out, and we sat there tasting and asking ""whats this"" to each other while the grill warmed up.then the good stuff... kimchi and kimchi pancakes we placed on the grill after being sliced up with scissors. the best tasting kimchi-anything ive had because i actually dislike the taste, but it was so delicious! next was the brisket; the grill was then covered in meat. we started flipping over pieces with our chopsticks but we were interrupted when our waiter came over and just mixed the meat up with his tongs. i thought that was odd because ive never had any waiter tend to our grill like that. and it was the same when we asked for galibi, pork belly, and chicken. he put it on the grill, came back once to flip them over (even tho we were already doing it), and cut up the pieces with his shamancy scissors. halfway thru the meal, i noticed that everyone in the restaurant was allowed to place their own meat on their grill and cook it by themselves. and everyone that was allowed to cook themselves just happened to be korean. im not complaining about having full service, because i didnt have to really guess when the meat was done. but its slightly irritating that there was an assumption that me and my friends couldnt and wouldnt know how to eat at a korean restaurant.the meat was tasty, i love meat that marinated, but it was also 40% fat. i would have preferred to have just the trim of the meat be fat, because a little wont hurt. the pork belly was fun to watch cook on the grill because it reminded me of caveman bacon... fat sizzling slabs of meat. i was a little pickier about the sides... i didnt like that egg curd (looks like tofu), or the white chunks of something swimming in kimchi sauce. nope, not at all. its ok that there were only 6 or 8 different sides because i only touched half of them. we didnt even make it to the kimchi fried rice because we were all in food coma status before the grill was even empty.aside from the ignorant assumption that we didnt know what to do and the slightly fatty meat, i was stuffed and happy and a little drunk from the hite beers we sucked down. next time i come back, i'll opt for ordering the 2 person meal because it comes with soju and a better portion of meat... diet saver!"
4/24/2011,3 star rating,food was good and I would say the spicy pork was my favorite and this is coming from someone who doesnt really eat that much pork in their every day life. The kimchi was also pretty good but how could a KBBQ place mess that up? Even though I am not Korean myself I can make a mean kimchiThe rest of the food was good but I am factoring the parking into the 3 star rating. The lot is tiny and most spots in this tiny parking lot are compact size only. I would come back but after I have to all the kbbq on my yelp bookmarks
8/25/2013,5 star rating,"Heard lots of good reviews for this place so came to check it out. I didn't know what the hype was all about, but why not it had high ratings. I came with a large group,7 ppl, on a Saturday night. They only take reservations with 3-5 days in advance so anything last minute will be placed on the walk in list. The wait was about 1-1.5 hours. They will call you 15 minute prior to see that the entire party is there and ready before they seat you. Once the wait is over the service was excellent. For $19 all you can eat. The food came fast and they were all delicious. The brisket, squid, short ribs were all really good. Even their side dishes were good. It's probably one of the best Korean buffet I've ever had. The ventilation was worked really well, we didn't even smell when we left. The servers cleaned the grill several times so the burnt stuff won't ruin the food. Would highly recommend this place if you have the patients to wait."
8/22/2015,2 star rating,"wait a looong time. there was not that much food you can pick for. After you made an order, it took a while to get them. They always forget your order, maybe too many people. The restroom is the worst."
4/7/2009,3 star rating,"The downside of having a stone cooking surface is all the fat pools up forcing other meats to swim in grease, unless you like that sort of thing. Either increase the slope of that sucker or bring your own grated radish and clean it yourself. The meat selection was aight. The marinated meats were tasty esp the chicken, only if the portion was bigger! Kim chee rice at the end was tops- just save room for it."
11/1/2010,5 star rating,"this is one of the best all you can eat korean bbq restaurants i've been to.There is always a really long wait, expect an hour minimum. But the way The way I've learned to beat the wait is to go late at night, (for a big mid night snack) around 12ish, since they close at 2am. i wouldn't going at 1am, i've seen them turn down customers...As for the food, i am always amaze how great of a quality they have late at night, the salad is still crisp and fresh, while the meat are still pretty decent cuts. Eating here definitely beats eating at any non-all you can eat bbq place since its only $16.99!! Â For all you can eat. Oh by the way, The sides are ok, they don't have a large variety. But alll in all, this place is great for the price, the wait and they've got great customer service! even though you don't speak korean! :)"
2/3/2011,4 star rating,wow. so this was my 1st time trying AYCE KBBQ on a hot stone surface. I love that the grill/pan doesn't get burnt as easily. instead of changing grills they use shredded radish to clean the hot stone and WAH-LAH you're good to go.they have all the usual selection of meats. My fave is the thick cut pork belly. the customer service is AWESOME. they are so friendly and very attentive--frequently refilling side dishes and waterdef make reservations cuz the wait is FREAKING LONG. p.s. if you want to have an FUN experience bring your friend on his/her birthday. they will play tacky/obnoxious/hilarious birthday shoutout + song. your friend will be thoroughly embarrassed

The meat is pricy compare to other AYCE places but i didnt mind because they open till 2am.. i think. HERE'S THE CATCH.I WENT THERE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THEIR GOOD SERVICE. I LIKE COW'S TONGUE AND TRIED IT IN ALOT OF DIFFERENT PLACE. YEAH THE MEAT CAME.. WHEN I GRABBED COUPLE TO PUT THEM OM THE GRILL, I NOTICED COATED TONGUE! YOU KNOW.. THE FUR ON THE TONGUE? SPIKY STUFF ON TOP OP UR TONGUE! IT WAS SLICED IN THIN PIECES SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IF I COOK IT THROUGHLY, IT WOULD JUST GO AWAY. THE MEAT WAS COOKED AND WHEN I ATE THE FIRST PIECE, omggggggggggggg OMG! I COULD LITERALLY TASTE FEEL THE POKEY FUR COOKED ALL SPIKY! GROSS! SO I CALLED THE ""MANAGER LOOK ALIKE"" WORKER AND SAID POLITELY "" THERE SEEMS TO BE COW'S FUR ON THE TONGUE CAN I CHANGE IT TO DIFFERENT MEAT?"" AND THE MANAGER LOOKS AT ME LIKE I DUNNO SHIT ABOUT MEAT AND SAID "" ALL COW'S TONGUE SUPPOSE TO HAVE THAT!"" and said he cant change it.WTF? I FELT SO STUPID AND ANGRY. HE RUIN THE NIGHT FOR ME AND MY BF AND NEVER EVER WANTED TO GO BACK. People that serves in the restaurant should know how important a single worker can ruin the whole table and chase away a regular/first timer/ or drop by random customer that has mouth to talk. The rumor Â spreads fast. Especially the bad ones.. god i never wanna see that guys face... *barf*"
4/15/2011,4 star rating,pretty good kbbq but im a loyal fan of yi ssi hwaro.this place has a great selection of meat though but service here is extremely crappy.i had to ask millions of time for a place setting and drinks and chili paste.buuut the food definitely pacifies me.their kimchi is extremely good compared to all the other kbbq places ive been to.annnnd theyre open late. great for after work chilling :Ddefinitely a yes :D

5/8/2011,4 star rating,"One of the better Korean bbq restaurants. The wait is like an hour long during dinner time, but it is definitely worth the wait. Order the Sam gyub sal. Then grill the kimchi and eat it together with the sam gyub sal.. best combo!"

4/25/2013,3 star rating,"I used to love this place, as it was my first Korean BBQ experience, but since that first time about 2 years ago, I find our relationship has dwindled. The amazing food that drew me here time and time again before has now turned bland and delightful. Hae Jang Chon no longer impresses with their service, their venue, or the quality of their food. When compared to Goon (or Castle II) they really can't hold a candle to the quality of the meat or the attentive service. Still a decent place, and I am certainly grateful to them for opening my eyes to Korean cuisine, but I will take my taste buds elsewhere from now on."
8/29/2012,4 star rating,came here since it was open late and was surprised that it was pretty damn good. damn good.
5/8/2009,5 star rating,"This is by far the best place for all you can eat Korean bbq, and it beats a lot of non-allyoucaneat places too. They also have the option of getting a course or individual plates if you're not into getting the all-you-can-eat.1. Great service (although slow sometimes because they actually grill and cut for each table)2. Stone grill which is cleaned at your table with strings of cold radish when it starts to get chunky and black--so you dont have that 5 minute downtime of a brand new grill. Plus, its traditional and ancient korean like that... awww yeah. (dont worry its slanted with a hole for the oil to drip)3. Their chadolbegi isn't half-fat like at other places and you can actually taste the marination in their kalbi! You can also try grilling their marinated cuttlefish. Not a big fan of the pork belly, but its pretty standard here since their restaurant logo is a little daeji. As an added bonus they grill some kimchi pancakes.4. They do a kimchi fried rice on your stone pot after your meal.5. Big LCD screen and a generally nicer looking/upbeat place.6. All for the standard price of 16.99 which is typical for K-town."
3/30/2010,5 star rating,"This is my go-to place in LA for all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ -- highly recommended.Service is excellent. Meat is very good. The sides are also plentiful and tasty. Â The price is competitive with other AYCE locations.They use a stone grill here, and they'll clean it between rounds with magical turnip shavings -- a nice touch.Eat your heart out but remember to leave room for the delicious kimchi fried rice at the end.Parking can be a pain here, but it's a quick walk off the Metro purple line subway. Â Reservations will definitely help for big parties or if you want to eat on a busy weekend night.The service suffered a bit when I came here with a gigantic party, but that wasn't really unexpected."
4/24/2012,5 star rating,i dont even know where to start! this place is the best! very good food and good atmosphere! all you can eat for a reasonable price! i go to this place a lot because i like introducing people to it and everyone i have taken has fallen in love it with as well! they even go without even inviting me anymore ha!....i highly recommend this place especially if your hungry and you dont want boring music! koreans know how to eat and how to party!
4/21/2013,4 star rating,"Valet only at night. My Favorite Korean BBQ spot, and a must when the homie is in town from MIA. It's an all you can eat spot. They bring out 3 meats at a time, have great sides, and nothing ever runs out. They keep the grills clean and the food is always seasoned great and tasted fresh and quality. The wait time can get crazy on the weekend so make a reservation."
1/21/2013,5 star rating,"I've moved down here and live in kTown for over a year now. So I've definitely tried my fair share of AYCE KBBQ places....cheap and pricey alike. They all vary slightly but when it comes down to it. For me, it's simple - quality of meats and service. That is what makes or breaks it.. Hae Jang Chon has been consistent these past years. In service. In quality. As well as the ridiculous wait for dinner rushes. But it's always worth it and I always leave happy. I'll be coming back here for a while even if I ever leave this neighborhood, which I hope won't be soon :)"
8/13/2011,5 star rating,"Really my ALL TIME FAVORITE korean AYCE restaurant. The biggest and freshest selection of meats and banchan at a fantastic price. I've been coming here for the past 4 years and it has been very consistent. Whether empty or bustling (usually bustling) the food has been fantastic. They've never run out of anything and the only time I've had issues with service was when we were seated in a far corner. I love their bulgolgi, pork shoulder and brisket. Honorable mention to the squid as well which was so fresh that when you cook it correctly - it is so tender and sweet. I love how they clean the round stone grill so intricately and efficiently with radish! And Kimchi fried rice at the end of your meat filled meal?! Significant other calls it his kimchi fried rice dessert!I take all my good friends, guests and basically people I love here because I love this place so much and it has never let me or anyone I've brought down! Lunch, dinner, late-night or whenever! Every SINGLE time I visit LA, I MUST come here at least once.You won't be disappointed!"
3/8/2011,5 star rating,"Still really frickin' delicious, a year after the first time I went. Consumed copious amounts of short ribs, bulgogi, brisket, and big thick pork belly. YUM! Their spicy orange sauce is delicious, and the pickled radish banchan is always my favorite. This time I had enough room to try the rice and soup at the end, and both were really tasty, although I didn't even want to think about how much sodium was in the soup. Service was pretty great too, yay! Love it."
12/27/2009,4 star rating,"mm meat. good meat, good sides (my favorite are the julienned pickled radishes and the radish/rice paper slices to wrap your meat in), good water/tea, okay service... you leave smelling like you bathed in kbbq, but that's pretty standard. we went around 6 on a saturday and had no problem getting seated right away with 6 people. parked on the street next to the restaurant at a meter, which was fine too.all in all, a great deal if you are hungry for meat!"
11/6/2011,4 star rating,"-Great price. $17.99-Good quality and tasting meats. I suggest the thin and thick pork belly, beef brisket, and beef short rib. the bulgogi is a little too sweet.-Good cooking surface. I think it's a marble surface over a burner. This method prevents from a charred and burnt grill.-Great sides, especially the fish cakes and potato salad.-Great that it stays open until 2 AM-Not feeling the long wait, but there is a bar next door to get your drink on while you wait."
9/14/2015,3 star rating,"The brisket is delicious, as is the short rib. Service was okay, as they might try to rush you during the peak hours. Â I was a bit turned off by it, but I'm sure management is the reason for that. Â Good price. Â Parking is easy with valet."
6/28/2009,4 star rating,"great value - there's a nice selection of different types of meat for the ARCE k bbq. Â The kimchi pancake is a great way to start and the ""dirty water"" tea is refreshing. Â The service can be spotty but the amount of food and the taste is great. Â I recommend the pork (the pork belly is too fatty for me), the brisket, and anything marinated. Â The kimchi fried rice is great so leave room for that at the end. Â not a huge fan of the soup that comes with the fried rice.

10/28/2009,5 star rating,"OK, so I've had my share of KBBQ places, but Hae Jang Chon is definitely the best place I have been to. The main difference of this restaurant compared to many other is the service. The staff is young, attentive, and polite. This place has it all, good meat, great sauces, many side dishes, great grill, and service! I am definitely going back! Def get the brisket, ribs, and the chicken. OH and they serve you steamed egg which comes with your meal. That it also an extra bonus, because most other places charge you extra aside from the all-you-can-eat menu. Def try this place out! The only downside is parking, but when i went i got lucky to find street parking. There is always Valet if you cant find a spot."
6/20/2010,4 star rating,"soild 4.5 stars WOW. I just found one of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ place. We wanted to try a new KBBQ place and thanks to yelp, another hit! We got here around 10 p.m. and ready to eat! It's open from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. definitely a great place for late-night munchies. The menu is extensive with 19 items. The kimchi pancake was good. I liked cooking the meat on the stone grill. First, we ordered the thick-sliced pork belly, brisket, unmarinated short rib, and beef tongue. Second round we ordered the squid and marinated short rib. I really enjoyed the brisket, pork belly, and unmarinated short rib. The quality of the meat was really high for AYCE places. I barely had any room left for the kimchi fried rice but I couldn't stop eating it. SO GOOD! Also, we had the best service ever. I don't know if it's because it was late on a weekday, but the waiters/waitresses were very attentive---refilling our banchans, sauces, cooking our meats, even cleaning our grills 3 times! We left with happy tummies. I can't wait to come back!"
4/9/2011,3 star rating,"The stone grill is pretty good. But compare to other general BBQ restaurants in K-town, the quality of meats in here is not that well. Still, the squid, pork shoulder are good. $16.99/ each all you can eat."
7/1/2011,4 star rating,"cool AYCE KBBQ spot open till 2am! this place would have gotten a 5 star if the service wasn't sooo slow. there was one point in the meal where we had no food in front of us and no servers around us. the other thing i didnt like was the stone grill thing that they have. i like to cook on a grill over fire not a slab of stone that kept on sliding off of the stand.this place wasn't all bad though, the meat was good quality and tasted awesome!"
6/27/2008,5 star rating,This place can get crowded but so worth the wait: kimchi pancakes and kimchi fried rice at the end. Â that's all ya'lls need to know!
1/27/2009,5 star rating,"What I really like is that they have FOUR 4 dipping sauces for your sizzling hot meat! Usually K BBQ places will have just one sauce for you to dip it in. Their chadol was good quality, and kalbi was drenched just right in Korean marinade wonderfulness. Their $16.99 is such a great deal because it comes with kimchi rice, kimchi pancake, and den jang ji gae. The cooking surface (dolgui) is really thick and good quality - they have to clean the cooking surface using radishes because it's probably too heavy to lift up and constantly replace. SOJU is $11.99 which is kind of expensive. The decor is nice and food is authentic and fresh. I have been to a lot of Korean BBQ's and this one is my favorite."
8/19/2010,5 star rating,OMG! BEST AYCE BBQ!! I went here with a couple of my friends and the meat was very juicy. The huge list of different choice of meat is overwhelming. The service is awesome and the atmosphere is awesome. After you're done they make fried rice for you. I always come out with a major food coma after eating here and I love how it's right across the street from my office too!!!
5/16/2011,3 star rating,"This place isn't bad. Â It's not my favorite ayce kbbq place but it's not bad at all. Â The seating was a little cramped and I like there to be a little more free space on the table. Â There are lots of sides like rice paper & potato salad & 4 dipping sauces, and fish cake, and dichon (sp?). I don't eat any of those & only use the spicy & salty sauce. Â I really still don't understand the limit on rice. You get one bowl before they start charging here. Â The meats were good. I think I liked the bulgogi better than the other meats. I usually favor the beef brisket but it seemed a bit more fatty here than at some other restaurants. I still ate A LOT of it. The short ribs were also pretty good. Â I didn't get to try the thick cut pork belly because I forgot about it. Â I did try the thin cut pork belly and it too wasn't bad. I on;y needed one serving of it though. I did try the hot dog because I'm Filipino dammit and I'm not passing up hot dog and rice LOL . Â It was a good meal over all. Not the best but very far from the worst. The unique thing about this place compared to the other kbbq places I've been is the cooking surface. I guess I'd describe it as a large flat bottom bowl made of smooth stone or a large stone plate with a raised rim so the oil doesn't drip everywhere. I'm sure someone's posted a pic of it by now. I always forget to take pics. It seemed to cook everything pretty evenly and things weren't getting burned. I think the best thing about it was that there were no flare ups that you sometimes get from the other type of grills. Parking lot was full but as people have mentioned there is a valet. It's $2. I found parking on the street and it was free because it was Sunday. Â The restroom could have been cleaner. I definitely would have waited til I got home if I had to sit down. The servers were nice but it did take a little longer than I'm used to to get our orders of meat brought to us. I don't think it's the servers' fault though as they're probably just waiting for them to bring it out from the kitchen. Â I'd go back on an invite without a fight. Â Oh. also make reservations I guess. Our friend made the reservations and there was no wait for us when we got there. We did see lots of people waiting as we ate though."

12/26/2012,5 star rating,"Delicious! Came here on a Friday night after watching a show at the Wiltern. 9:30pm. It was crowded with a list going but we were seated within 10min. It's all you can eat for $17.99 per person. We only had one round of food but it was well worth it. The kimchi fried rice was unreal. I wish they would have given it to us with our meat and not Waited till we ate a full plate of meat. We didn't finish it but only because we were full. The general manager, Sunny, was super sweet. She knew we were novices so she kindly helped. She didn't speak English so we communicated with gestures, awesome! Def recommend this place for their amazing food and great service."
7/9/2015,5 star rating,"I LOVE this place. They have such good food and service. They are super responsive and remember your whole order without writing it down. They help you cook the meat too, so all you have to worry about is eating and what you'll eat next."
8/17/2011,1 star rating,Our reservation was at 9 they gave us our table at 10:15. The service was horrible and I would not recommed this place at all. The food was average and you can find the same at a place with better service.
11/13/2011,4 star rating,"Mmmm so yummy. Â This is only the second ayce kbbq place i've been to, but it's tons better than mu dung san which was my first ayce. Â First off, be prepared for a long wait. Â My friends and I got there around 6 and waited about a half hour or so. Â However, when we walked out like 1.5 hours later, we recognized some people waiting that had been there since before we had gone in. Â Also, interesting, but I found a lot of the clientele to be Chinese. Â I don't think I heard any korean inside the restaurant or when we were waiting outside, except from the waiters/waitresses to each other. Â Not a bad thing, but I thought it was an interesting tidbit. Â Customer service: Everyone was so nice and helpful and spoke english! Â One of the waiters laughed and handed me scissors, which I totally forgot were on the table, when he saw me trying to remove a portion of fat off my short ribs with my chopsticks. Â haha. Â They were also extremely attentive to helping turn the meat and asking you if you wanted more meat. Â However, they didn't offer to refill the banchan or get us more water. Â They also forgot the spoons when they brought out the soup and the steamed egg and stuff. Â However, despite all this I thought everyone who helped us was really nice and don't have a big problem with their customer service. Â Chicken: tender and flavorfulBrisket: I thought the brisket was great with great marble. Â Thin and soft. Â However, definitely by our 3rd/last order, I was noticing that the pieces we got were mostly fat. Â Don't know if that was a coincidence or notThin Pork Belly: Also tasty, however, mostly fat. Â If you let it grill a while it gets crispy like bacon, yum. Â Honeycomb: My friends didn't enjoy this at all. Â They wanted to be adventurous and try it, but were like ugh. Â I'm not so adventurous... hahaShort ribs: We got both marinated and unmarinated. Â The first 1 or 2 orders were great, however I thought the 3rd order was tougher and had more unchewable pieces. Â Again, don't know if that's coincidence or if they just bring out less quality meat later on. Â However, the meat in the first 2 orders was tender and flavorful. Â However, I like my marinated short ribs a little more marinated. Â They were a little bland for my taste. bulgogi: pretty yummy. Â very tasty and flavorful. Â Again, I know some people who might not like it because it has too much sauce/marinade/etc., but I like that. Â Kimchi rice: not super amazing, but interesting with all the nori they put in. Â The nori is really what gives the fried rice its great flavoring. Â That being said, wouldn't come here again just for this. Â Pancake: mehsteamed egg: mehsoup: pretty tasty, but by the time it came out we were all sooooo stuffed we couldn't really appreciate it. Â banchan: unremarkable for the most part. Â average but not anything to write home about. Â All in all a great ayce bbq place to go with friends. Â They have music and the crowd can get a bit noisy, but my friends had no problem hearing each other during our dinner. Â I love the way they clean the grill with what I think are chopped up radishes that they use to clean away all the char before the next plate of meat gets put on. Â I could definitely recommend this ayce place to friends for the friendly customer service and great meat."
3/17/2013,4 star rating,One of the better ayce kbbq in Koreatown Los Angeles. Attentive and friendly service and it'll cost you about $20 bucks per person. It gets really packed like all the other good ayce joints in ktown so expect to wait a while. Valet parking only.
5/6/2015,5 star rating,long wait but quick service. Â they speed up service by helping you cook a little at the table.
6/23/2012,5 star rating,All you can is shown BEST here! Dduk Bo Sam is so good... The saeng galbi is the BEST if cooked a little rare.. So juicy and tender! Don't get the pork sliced thin.. Tasted dry......
3/12/2013,5 star rating,"This is the best Korean BBQ ever. Meat and salads are always fresh and delicious. Â Waiting time can get a little crazy, I wish they would've considered opening another location. So far out of all Korean BBQ places I've tried this one is the most consistent as fad as the food quality and service. Anyone who wants to try something new, should definitely try this place out. Try to get there before 5, to avoid crazy lines."
8/21/2013,1 star rating,Food is so so. Nothing that stands out from other AYCE places. I am easy to please n if it aint horrible i always give 5 stars but the manager dude is a punk so 1 star: x
5/1/2015,1 star rating,"Came here excited to have a delicious meal with my girlfriends. Left angry and upset by the racism and discrimination my party experienced. After pretty mediocre service all night, we were told that the restaurant was closing at 11:30pm. It was 11:15pm and we asked why the closing time is listed as 2am on Yelp. Our server lied and said the restaurant closes at 11:30pm. We were ushered out of the restaurant and once outside realized: they were clearly not closing anytime soon (they do in fact close at 2am every night), we were the only table asked to leave, we were the only table of Brown and Black women. We stood in the parking lot, in front of the restaurant, as the reality of the situation sunk in. A fun night of conversation over delicious food was ruined by aggressive and hostile racism. It's 2015, shame on you Hae Jang Chong. I vote with my dollars and my dollars do not support bigoted establishments."
3/9/2013,4 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 6 and the wait was ridiculous. Â It was cold outside and there were a lot of people. Â Before we even got out of the car, the valet guy warned us about the 2 hour wait and asked us if we really wanted to wait. Â Our friend got there early to put his name down. Â The hostess told him 45 minutes so 45 minutes later, we went to check on the status and she said another 30 minutes, again 30 minutes had passed and when we went back in, she 30 minutes again. Â When we finally got our table, the waiter forgot our drinks. Â They were extremely busy so service was slow. Â I guess we pushed the service button a lot so he came over to tell us to stop since his manager was getting mad at him.The service wasn't good, but the food definitely made up for it. Â All the side dishes were so flavorful and good. Â The kimchi was definitely the best I've had in the U.S. Â You can always judge a restaurant by the way they make the kimchi. Â We enjoyed the meat and tried all 19. Â They cleaned the stone plate/grill twice with radish to get rid of all the black burnt stuff. Â This is so much better than changing the trays since you don't have to wait for the new tray to get hot again. Â At the end, they brought out soup and made kimchi fried rice for you. Â Of course we were too full to eat all the rice but it was still good. Â $18 for AYCE is pretty good. Â We're planning to come here again. Â The next time we'll come with a party of 8 or more so that we could make a reservation."
11/11/2009,4 star rating,"If you're craving crowd-pleasing, all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ, then this is a great place to go. Â It's consistently good, and the atmosphere is casual and friendly. Â While other Korean BBQ AYCE restaurants provide you with unlimited meats, this restaurants provides you with unlimited meats AND a steamed egg dish, kimchi pancakes, kimchi fried rice, and soup. Â Even if you are not familiar with KBBQ, the service is good and everyone is pretty welcoming. Â Parking on Fridays and weekends is a huge hassle, so there's ""valet"" parking for $2 in the lot. Â If you want leaner meats, just ask them and they'll bring out briskets with less fat on them. Â Enjoy!"
6/21/2013,5 star rating,"This place is amazing! Good meats, all you can eat for a cheap price! I love their bean paste/sauce."
4/24/2013,5 star rating,"Honestly one of THE BEST kbbq I have ever been to. Although the wait is pretty hectic around 8pm to 12pm. Just know that it is well worth the wait. I recommend the beef brisket, beef tongue, pork belly thin, and of course eat it with the salad. The servers are very nice too. A must try!!"
3/8/2011,5 star rating,"Wow. Â Just wow. Â This is going to my new go to place for all you can eat Korean barbecue.For $20 you get a huge selection of meats, and even meats that you can't get at most other BBQs. Â Of course they have your usual cuts but they also tack on pork shoulder and beef tongue, yum. Â The pork shoulder was bomb, just make sure you grill it until the tips curl up. Â The beef tongue was also not bad, but because the slices were thinner I was unable to cook it the way I like it. Â As for the usual cuts like the brisket and buligogi, well you can never go wrong with those. Â Moreover, all those small dishes, they are all refillable for free whereas at some other places you only get one free refill. Â And at the end of the meal when you are stuff beyond stuffed they cook a kimchi fried rice for you on the grill. Â Also an interesting note is how they clean the grill. Â Here it looks like it is a granite-based grill that is cleaned with daikon or something when it gets dirty - they don't actually change the grill here.Definitely a place I will be coming back to especially since it is open late (perfect for the after drinking munchies)."
9/5/2011,5 star rating,"Great AYCE Korean BBQ; though my sample size of 3 in Koreatown is fairly limited, when we went it was crowded but still with very attentive service, excellent meat cuts, no ""diminished return"" on what food came out, and with a complete meal inc'd the ending fried rice and soup. For Korean BBQ, that's really all you can ask for!"
4/23/2013,5 star rating,3rd year coming and counting~no mattee.how long the line is.will always wait for hjc fav krn bbq.place.ever?!!
3/2/2013,5 star rating,"LOVE this place!Yeah, there's always a line, especially if it's dinner rush hour, get ready to wait for about 45 minutes... but hey, this place is amazing!Great meat.Great salads.Great service.All you can eat Korean BBQ for $17.99"
8/9/2015,5 star rating,"Good food, good service, clean and great ambience. Be sure to make reservations ahead of time because it gets packed -wait can be 21/2 hours if you don't have reservations."
1/10/2013,1 star rating,You know something is wrong when you go to a Korean rest. and there are NO Koreans. Â Maybe my meat wasn't cooked all the way through but I threw up 3 times afterwards. Â I didn't drink and wasn't hung over either.
1/16/2009,3 star rating,"The meat was just ok. Nothing different. Lacked variety. bibimbap at the end was cool and grill cleaning with pickled radish was interesting to watch, but i'll prolly never come here again."
5/16/2009,5 star rating,"My new favorite All You Can Eat bbq joint! For $16.99 a head, I challenge you to find me a place that's just as cheap or cheaper, better quality, and better service.Our waitress was like a friend's mom was serving us - she was always coming around and refilling everything without us asking for anything, cooking our food, and at the end she even told us she was proud of us for finishing all our meat. (The last serving was a stretch for us and we pretty much had to force it down). Loved the steamed egg and kim chi pancake.Our only regret was getting so full that we said we didn't want the kim chi fried rice that they cook for you at the end. Next time I'll plan accordingly and save space!5 stars for an AYCE place - I've had better quality and more variety of panchan at more expensive places, but this place deserves 5 for what it is."
4/12/2010,3 star rating,"3.5 stars.$16.99 for AYCE Korean bbq with different types of meats. Â You can choose from 19 different types! Â It also includes banchan: Â korean pancake, kimchi, potato salad, spinach, etc.I was kinda full when I came to AYCE here. Â I know, what was I thinking? Â But we had a late lunch and we came for a friend's birthday at 5 pm. Â So I wasn't too hungry. Â Perhaps if I was hungry, I would have eaten more.Banchans are good, from what I tried. Â Their Korean pancake was a little sour. Â potato salad had pieces of apple in it.Meat was good, but I don't know if we ordered the non-marinated ones or the marinated ones. Â I thought if it was the marinated meat, I didn't feel like the taste of the marinade came out in the beef. Â It was lacking the pizzazz and flavor of yummy Korean BBQ! Â Their sauce was ok, too.Service: Â pretty good. Â we kept pressing the button that sounds like a doorbell so they could come over and give us more meat or clean up our grill.I might come back again when I'm hungry and maybe it would taste better!"
11/22/2010,3 star rating,"$19 for your choice of meats. Only a few banchan and your choice of rice and steamed egg. The pan was so crazy ass hot and only one drainage hole that the oil splattered everywhere ): they clean the pan in between plates of meat with shredded radishes.The service was reallyyyyy slow, but it was also pretty crowded so that might be why. They also said it was because we ordered pork belly (??). Anyways parking is crazy, but there are some meters on 6th."
12/8/2010,4 star rating,"Who is NOT a Korean BBQ fan? I love love this place. Â It was getting late and the BF and I was looking for AYCE place. We wanted to try another place aside from Road to Seoul. Yelpers gave this a high mark so it was a GO. When we got there I was intially dissapointed. What? Its here? The parking was full and you have to do valet. Now, I don't have any problem with that but when you see those valet guys puffing away and then go inside your car to park it. You just wanna hand them some listerine and a toothbrush/toothpaste to freshen their breathe. Excuse me, I will be smelling KBBQ after so I dont need to mix that smell with your cigarette smoke.After we got in, we signed by the hostess and there was NO waiting area. OK maybe there was a seat inside (for 2) and a couple of benches outside but it was FREEZING outside. Good thing there was minimal wait. When the waiter lead us to our table, I quickly surveyed the place. Its your typical KBBQ place. Carnivores devoring all types of meat like there is no tomorrow. but hey. for 16.99 Â for 19 types of meat? I would eat till I can't breathe. My memory is fuzzy now but I remember we ordered Beef brisket and Galbi. Beware of the chicken BBQ. That was like so disgusting. It was wrapped on an aluminum sheet and we were instructed to just let it cook like that. After 15 mins, it still looked like it was uncooked and we asked our served if we can put it on the stone grill instead. He said no because it has sauce and therefore is WET. Uhmm, Ok. So I let this red mushy thing cook for a couple more minutes then I took a bite of it. Eeww, sorry but it looked like a mops head and it tasted one. Well, actually a spicy mop head. I will still give this place 4 stars because other than the smoking valet guy and the discgusting chicken bbq, everything was great. Very attentive waiters. We never had to call. They sometimes even come to table to check/flip the meat in our stone grill. plus, its HECKA cheap. The food was flavorful. Im not a fan of side dishes but I love the meat. I think the stone grill gives it flavor (or maybe its just my imagination). I can't wait to go back!"
12/25/2011,4 star rating,"OK, so not the best quality meat, but very good for an all you can eat Korean place that costs ~$17/person for dinner. Service is quick and efficient. The ban chan is just OK, but the real star here is the meat (obvi) cooked on a large stone grill that is cleaned periodically by the waiters. I like the beef tongue and the galbi; the marinated squid is also quite good. They serve up MASSIVE quantities in every order, so come with an appetite. They also serve egg soup, kimchi fried rice, and a soup throughout the meal. Parking out in front,"
4/19/2012,5 star rating,"Meat is awesome. It's not as fatty as other Kbbq places I've been to, so I think you get your money's worth. the short rib is extremely tender. My family and I really had a good time eating and having a good time. I'd recommend coming BEFORE 6pm on ANY given day of the week if you don't have reservations. If not, make reservations if you plan on coming around 630 because the place just gets packed! we got there at around 530pm and the place was quiet with only like 4 tables that were occupied. By the time 630pm rolled around, there was a long line outside, like 20 parties on the waiting list and all the tables taken. I love the service they have too!"
8/26/2012,2 star rating,Overrated :/ steamed egg and bean paste soup were too salty. Kimchi was too sour... The pot was not ideal for bbq at all.. its a slow cook pot and it took forever to cook the meat thoroughly. We were pretty annoyed... Very limited side dishes. Bbq squid was the best! Def going to stick w road to Seoul from now on T^T
11/27/2012,2 star rating,"There were 3 of us on a Tuesday night and there was no wait. Although service was great, we all agreed that the food was just alright. There are a lot of better options for KBBQ in the area where the meat and side dishes are more flavorful. Not to say this place isn't decent, but we've definitely had better."
1/6/2013,5 star rating,Great food! Awesome atmosphere and Korean pancakes included in the all you can eat option! Booking in advance is recommended as this place was packed when we went. Have to finish this review quick before I start to salivate! Will be back soon..
11/24/2012,4 star rating,Great deal. Tasty sides. Attentive wait staff who serve with a smile and refill anything you ask for. Good quality meats. A must-try!
5/14/2014,3 star rating,Just to be clear the service was excellent and the place was clean and well decorated. But who cares about that stuff. How is the meat!??!!?! It was okay but underwhelming for $18. The brisket was the best thing and it was really good but I would rather not pay that much just for brisket. The kalbi was pretty dry. The rice at the end was pretty bad.
6/5/2013,4 star rating,"Only KBBQ spot place with a stone grill. 18.99 AYCE and a very long wait. However, the food selection is vast and the quality is great which makes the price and the wait worth it. Parking is valet only and the servers are great."
5/13/2013,5 star rating,Bomb.
8/14/2014,2 star rating,"I have no idea what all the fuss is about with this place. Not only did they royally screw up our reservation for 9 people that I'd made days in advance and end up seating us at two separate tables, the food was mediocre as was the service. The banchan was pretty tasty, but the meat was just plain bad (far worse than any KBBQ I've had in K-town) and the bokumbap at the end was actually awful. Will NOT be returning! Too many good KBBQ places in LA to waste my time with this one again."
9/5/2015,5 star rating,Food is a solid win; Bon chon are yummy and the meat is a very high quality. They are my favorite Korean bbq in LA. I cannot recommend this place enough.
8/14/2009,4 star rating,"I've been to a few Korean BBQ places out in K-Town, and I must admit that this one is one of the better ones out there. Â I like ths place because they have a lot of good side dishes. Â Their meat was really good. Â I can't recall which ones that we had chosen, but they were all really, really good. Â At the end of the meal, they serve kimchi fried rice and a soup (I think), and it's really really good. Â All this food for about $20 - it was a deal! :) Â I wouldn't mind going back again!"
6/18/2010,4 star rating,"Awesome food, awesome service. I'd recommend having them make the kimchi fried rice when they clean the grill mid dinner, this way you're not super full after eating half a cow. We missed the fried rice, but everything else was great, even their water (some mild tea flavored water)! The wait staff at these late night Korean joints usually don't speak English so it can make ordering tough, but Hae Jang Chon's staff was fluent, so it helped us out."
11/1/2010,5 star rating,"The best AYCE Korean BBQ place Ive ever been to. the food is great and the service is exceptional! i come here all the time, my favorite is the spicy pork bulgogi."
5/29/2012,4 star rating,"A very unique ACYE korean bbq place...very good price ($17.99) for dinner with all the food that they provided - many selection of meat, the best is the black angus slices, beef tongue, pork belly, and squid......quite disappointed on the chicken though. Â Also like the banchan that they provided - fish cake, potato salad, kimchi, and some marinated greens. Â The most impressive is the side dishes - soy paste soup, kimchi pancake, ricecake, and kimchi friedrice at the end! Â The only thing is the waiting time at this place - we made a reservation at 7:30 but didn't get in until 8:30, but i guess it's understandable when we had a party of 13. Â The food was so good (or we were too hungry) that we immediately forgot the painful waiting time when we chow down the food...heheThe rice wine at this place is also very mild, and they serve with a bowl....very cute! Overall, it's a very good dining experience!"
7/22/2013,5 star rating,"One of the best in town and in my top 2 spot! Â If you want the real deal this is it! Â No need for a lengthy spiel. Â This is the joint for Korean BBQ, excellent selection of sides, great service, Kimchi is spot on, put it on the grill with your meat and find out about the trifecta when you wash it down with an ice cold beer."
11/14/2012,4 star rating,We waited an hour to be seated but it's worth it. All you can eat Korean BBQ. Choose from 19 items for only $17.99. This is why I like SoCal. Food is competitive so very delicious yet so cheap. The best I like there is the short ribs YUM!!!
7/19/2015,1 star rating,"There was a typo in my previous Â review. It should read, ""We hadn't gone there in over a year."""
6/25/2015,1 star rating,"SOO DISAPPOINTED!!!! We hadn't gone there in years because of our last experience , and today was worse. Got there at 8 pm to put our name on the wait list for just me and my friend. We were not seated until 9:15 pm, and we were given the worst seats in the restaurant Â near the bathroom. The restaurant was packed like a sardine can (which by the way the LA FIRE DEPT would not approve of), the service was Â slow as molasses, and Â the servers kept bumping into us while we were seated. The server didn't bring us the food we asked for on 4 different occasions. We had to ask NUMEROUS times before we got what we asked for. It was a HORRIBLE dining experience. We gave them our cc to pay, BUT they didn't Â give it back to us to sign, so we had to go to the register ourselves after 15 minutes of waiting. Never will we go back there and neither should you."
6/26/2014,2 star rating,"For starters, this restaurant misleads the customer with their published information on Yelp. Yup!! Read it for yourselves!! Jennifer Kim, the owner, says it's $16.99 per person (read the ABOUT THE RESTAURANT section), yet when you go to the restaurant, they charge the customer $18.99. Â If they raised their price, then they should be honest about it, especially if the owner of the restaurant is writing it."
8/25/2009,4 star rating,"$16.99 all you can eat, which is a fantastic price, for great meat, great service, a comfy set up, and tons of variety and nifty touches that make this place extremely satisfying. Â It's open till 2 am, which makes it a good way to close a day!"
1/1/2012,5 star rating,"My favorite AYCE restaurant, hands down. Â I love how their grill is made of stone instead of steel. Â I love how their meat selection is extensive and always fresh. Â I've introduced many co-workers and friends here, and they all loved it. My favorites: Brisket, no contest. Â Always fresh, never fails. Marinated short ribs: I have to admit I've had better, but they are quite yummy on their own. Pork belly: slabs of fatty goodness.. how can you ever say no to bacon?? LARGE slabs of bacon, to boost? Banchan: i love the fish cake as part of the banchan... I always finish at least one bowl on my own... delish!Kimchee fried rice: I always save a little bit of room to have some of their fried rice at the end. Â They hit the spot every single time...My not-so-favorite:Bathroom: Let's just say i avoid their bathroom as much as i could -- not enough for me to dock a star off, though.."
9/4/2012,4 star rating,"Korean BBQ... yum yum. Tried this place after reading all the reviews on Yelp. The place is good. When you order the food, I seriously think they bring you waaaayyy too much. It was just me and a friend, and when we ordered the meats, they brought out what seemed to be enough for like 4 people! That's all good and dandy, but I'd like to be able to try the other meats too! Overall, the meats were tasty and good. This place is also small and feels very crowded. Parking here though is truly a bitch. The TINY strip they have for parking is all paid valet parking, for any of the places in that complex. You have to find street parking, which is extremely difficult due to it being apartments and homes all around in that area. The price is not bad. You get a lot of food. I love the rice cakes to eat with the meats and the salad had good flavor. However, due to the difficulty in parking and the small eating space I think I would prefer to eat at Road To Seoul."
12/14/2012,3 star rating,Been here twice. The first time better than the second. They're under construction now so the wait is super long. I think it's a bit overrated. The meat had so much fat on it I couldn't eat it.
4/14/2009,5 star rating,"$16.99 All you can eat! I don't know of anyone who actually orders individual menu items. There's valet parking for $1.50 or street parking if you can find it.The venue is fairly well ventilated as far as Korean BBQ places go which is nice though your clothes and hair will smell delicious until you wash them. The grill is a tilted stone instead of the usual metal grill. You get a couple of the standard side dishes (with the potato salad only on weekends) + sweet potato to grill and the Korean pancakes which aren't so common. All very tasty! They have salad and the rice cake wraps along with sliced daikon radish but you can get plain rice if you ask for it. They have all the usual meats - chadol, galbi, samgyupsal, chicken (thin chuck, rib, pork) and even marinated squid! It's not the best of the best quality out there but if you consider the fact that it's AYCE it is pretty good. Â The service is decent as well! When you ask for something, it'll actually come to you even though it might take a while. If you don't know what to do, they'll explain it to you. They will finish off the meal by making kimchee fried rice on your grill along with a big pot of soup. The price to value ratio is great here! I highly recommend it."
9/19/2011,2 star rating,"Pros: The food was okay. Cons: The service SUCKS! So, I was waiting for a table inside (maybe I have blocked the way a bit, because it was really too cold to stand in front of the door). I understand that the space is limited, so I would have moved to another spot peacefully if the hostess asked me politely. I moved eventually. I moved to another spot and asked her is that okay if we stand there. She didn't actually response to my question, instead, she made a grimace and said she doesn't know. What's wrong with their hostess!And the thing that i cannot stand the most is: the hostess actually RAN AFTER US FOR TIPS! This is hella rude! First, I have an option to give the tips or not. Second, we DID leave down the tips. One of the waiters collected the tips before we leave. Overall: Cannot enjoy the food completely because of their service. Hope they will train up their hosts."
7/6/2015,1 star rating,"I called earlier today and made a reservation for 6 people. One person canceled en route to the restaurant. They refuse to seat us because we are only 5 people now, and are now ONE person short. I have been here multiple times and have really enjoyed this place but that is ridiculous. I will never be coming back after being treated like this, and none of my friends will either. Absolutely ridiculous, what crap service."
7/3/2015,3 star rating,I'm not a local nor a fan of all you can eat joints but I thought this place was ok...I would recommend either chadol or ssangyupsal. Â I didn't care for the kalbi or bulgogi. Â For an all you can eat place I would say the service was top notch - I never was waiting for the staff to come by and they were very accommodating. Â The wait is pretty obnoxious...but having said that if I could I would give it 3 1/2 stars.
12/23/2009,1 star rating,OMG HAS NOBODY NOTICED THE FILTHY WALLS. I went alone to this place and it rained dust bunnies all over my food. I was there early at 11.45am craving some k bbq and heard about this place and thought I would try it. it was hard to be objective about the food as the filth was inexcusable and hard to ignore. Â I can only imagine the dinners on yelp that gave all of these rave reviews did not notice the grime covered walls with 5 inch long dust vines dangling above their food as they were there at night or sat in the middle of the room
4/19/2011,5 star rating,"love this place, and the manager that USED to work here ;[ Â so sad she's gone. Â she was the chillest person ever and totally hooked it up.for ayce, this place is legit. Â the quality is GOOD. Â they have a good variety of ban chan (side dishes), and the last time we went the waiter who was making our rice at the end made into the shape of a heart! Â super cheesy i know, but it was still cute. Â what can i say i'm easy to please ;/i'm a huge salad person when it comes to korean bbq, so it was definitely a plus that their salad dressing was good. Â they give you the rice paper which honestly i could go without, cause that fills you up for no reason, and they give the radish which i adore.more than anything, the service here rocks. Â luckily, they've got both the service, and the food (;"
5/16/2011,5 star rating,"This place isn't perfect by any means but its five star distinction is because eating here makes me happy! Â Why I recommend this place:- The grill is different. Â They use a round stone grill, slightly slanted so the grease can drip through a hole into a catchall dish. Â This grill eliminates worry of meat fall through the crack and landing in the fire. Â Also helps to retain all the awesome marinade of the bulgogi. Â After every order of meat, the also take fresh grated radishes and clean the grill. Â Just genius.- They offer regular white rice or kimchi fried rice. Â That rice is awesome. Â It's also cooked right on the grill and also has nori in it. Â It's so delicious and I've tried to request it at the beginning of the meal but for some odd reason, they will only do it at the end.- Â The meat selection. Â The bulgogi is the best.- Â The service is pretty damn good. Â Yeah, sometimes I don't get my meat as quickly as I'd like but it's because I'm such a hungry little fatass. Â The servers have to handle so much, bringing out meat, water, ban chan refills etc.- Â The sides. Â The ban chan may leave you wanting more since there are only four offerings but the kimchi pancake they also put on the grill is delicious. Â I also like that they offer a salad with dressing that I use to wrap my meat for a healthier refreshing bite. Â They also have rice papers and radishes to wrap the meat. Â The rice papers are nice and thin.- $2 valet parkingWhy I would hesitate to take newcomers and out of towners:- The wait. Â Without reservations it can be horrendous. Â I've waited 2 full hours (yeah, I'm dedicated). Â But with reservations it's pretty stress free. Â Fairly recently on the weekends they only take reservations of groups of 6 or more. Â Better find more friends or get there early on the weekends.- Â The smell. Â If you have plans on rocking out at the club after, you might want to go home and change. Â The delicious BBQ smell will attach itself every stitch of clothing you're wearing and make you attractive to big hungry men.- Â Sometimes the meat can be not so great. Â I'm speaking primarily of the thin pork belly. Â It's thinly sliced yet sometimes there are also thin disk of bones you have to watch out for.This place is amazing, and a word to the newbies; Â don't be an ass and sit at the tables longer than necessary when you see a huge group of people waiting to be seated. Â You'll probably get more than a few dirty looks as you leave if not a good jab in the ribs. Â But come and enjoy, you won't be disappointed."
4/15/2011,2 star rating,"i dont know what happened to them. Â i used to love them. Â in december last year, i went there twice in one week. Â but this time, the meat just wasnt the same. Â it wasnt marinated well. Â the radish wraps were a bit sour and green. Â also, since december, they've shrunk the selection for ayce. Â and the amt of meat they bring out. Â at one point, it was just two of us, and they literally brought out only TEN little slivers of tripe. Â SLIVERS. Â and THIS IS WHAT REALLY ANNOYED ME: the server put bulgogi, short ribs, and samyeopsal on the grill all at the same time. Â WHAT. THE. F. Â they but marinated, wet meat with meat that should be dry together. Â thats a big no no. Â also, my korean friends tell me one should cook beef separately from pork. this isnt a big deal for me. Â but i feel that mixing wet and dry meats together was just unacceptable. Â i need to find a new ayce place. Â my recent trip to moodaepol I was nothing but disappointment again. Â i might need to just start going to park's again."
2/4/2010,5 star rating,"i've been to one too many of the typical ayce kbbq joints--manna, tahoe, mu dung san, etc etc. and some of the non ayce eat ones--honey pig, park's. Â park's is my favorite. Â so whenever i go to an ayce place, i try to look for some place that comes close...for a cheaper price of course.hae jang chon does it. Â the selection of meats is just right. Â they even have tripe. Â ive never had tripe at a kbbq place before, and let me tell you, it is not something to be missed. Â especially when one cooks it not on a grill with vents but on a flat one, so the tripe sucks up all the meat juices and somewhat simmers. Â delicious. Â oh and the meat! Â it wasn't fatty at all!! Â which is rare for ayce places. Â they also had the spicy pork in foil. Â delicous!side dishes were limited, however. Â i did like getting the thinly sliced radish wraps. Â never had that before either.service: excellent. Â given my inability to speak korean, i was impressed by how willing the servers were to talk to me. Â oh and they helped me cook sometimes. Â that doesnt happen at manna or tahoe. Â there was a wait tho, and the place is a bit small. Â valet was pretty packed, and street parking is next to impossible (i parked a couple blocks away near wilshire)"
3/2/2011,5 star rating,This is the best place for korean BBQ in my opinion...for the price and selection of meat is really good...and I love the way that the table is round with the grill in the middle...it's a great place for groups...the staff is pretty nice....the parking is ok...valet but if you can find street parking do it....and the place is pretty clean....totally recommend
4/18/2013,4 star rating,"Always a fun and inexpensive night out. Â You can stuff yourself silly here, but make sure to save room for the kimchi fried rice, which is my favorite part of the meal. Â No meal is complete without some soju and beer. Â Love the BBQ pork, beef brisket, and all the side dishes are great. Â Perfect for a group so you can try lots of different meats."
4/30/2012,4 star rating,"The meat quality is alright, not as good as oo-kook.(My friend just told me that their meat quality goes down. ) However, its good for its price. The side dishes are awesome!!! I love their sauces for doping beef brisket and pork belly. I will be back."
7/5/2012,2 star rating,"I'm surprised by all the good reviews. I thought the meat was super fatty. I had to discard so many pieces because they were about 50 percent fat. And I was really looking forward to finishing up the feast with the marinated kalbi, and I thought the marinade was basically tasteless. I was really grossed out by the fat. The panchan was fine."
8/8/2010,4 star rating,By far one of the best Korean BBQ places I've been too! I wish the staff could speak better English because it was hard explaining what I want to them. The kimchi and good! Endless rice paper! I love the stone grill and the kimchi fried rice at the end! Expect to wait anywhere from 20 mons to hours for a table. But it was worth the wait because the price is good and the food delicious.
11/2/2012,5 star rating,"super busy place. Â if you don't want to wait too long, come in a little early... i think we got there around 5 or 5:30... if you come later, you wait waaaay longer. Â all you can eat was about $20 per person. Â we tried i think 5 different meat. Â squid is our favorite. Â too bad we ordered it last so we didn't get to eat as much. Â we tried this creamy too sake. Â that was good. Â the only sake i like.service was pretty good too... thats surprising to me... asian place... super busy and good service?? Â never had that before... at least not that i can remember.would come back next time we're in la."
7/24/2010,4 star rating,"This place is simply phenomenal! The food is out of this world (or country) If you're looking for a conversation starter THIS IS YOUR PLACE! YES you do have to cook your own meat, but its not difficult. its very fun! Great place to bring your out-of-town guests! Go for the Bulgogi & Marinated Short Ribs. If you like enchiladas, try the Kimchi Pancakes! they taste just the same only with Korean spices & completely different ingredients. Â I would have given them 5 stars, but the service here is not too great if your not Korean of of Asian decent."
8/14/2011,5 star rating,There's a reason why this place always gets packed. Â This place is so pimp that it makes me wish I had tortillas to eat their meat with.
4/16/2012,4 star rating,"4 stars for the food 2 stars for the service! The food was really good! My friends all say Korean food in LA is better than SF. I was thinking what the heck could be so much better tasting with bbq meat we cook ourselves? Ohh they proved me wrong! The marinade for the bugolgi was yumo! The kimchi fried rice was yummy even after I was stuffed with meat I still continued eating. The soup was good, the pancake...ummm we asked for it 5 times literally and NEVER got it! That was supposed to be part of our meal! no bueno. Then we asked for only half a plate of short rib because a full plate was too much. The lady comes over dumps a full plate of short ribs on our grill then tells us $15 extra if you don't eat it all! WTF!! That's why we said half a plate!!! just a little! They are so trying to make us pay extra so annoying. Little does she know we are very good at hiding our unfinished food and how big appetites we have. Lets just say no extra $15 for us!"
7/29/2013,3 star rating,"This place is a solid for AYCE Korean BBQ. The selections are, for the most part, fresh and good. The banchan are exceptional. You get a huge variety with every meal. The service, as with many Korean places, leaves something to be desired. The spilled an entire dish of raw marinated meat all over my boyfriend and didn't apologize or offer to pay for the dry cleaning. So don't wear your Sunday best here - you shouldn't do that any time you go for AYCE Korean BBQ anyway since you leave reeking of smoke, fat, and fire."
7/1/2013,5 star rating,Excellent service and the food was super! All you can eat Korean BBQ lets you pick the varieties after you are done with each serving. They also throw in flour cake and kimchi fried rice. Very tasty!
12/10/2014,5 star rating,"Korea town has so many restaurants to choose from. However, this has been one of my favorites. My friend who lives in the area suggested this place since i was visiting from out of town. The service was good. The meat was incredible and loveeee their banchan."
7/5/2010,5 star rating,"Great place to celebrate with your friends. Â The meat is legit, they didn't skimp on the dduk bo sam (thin rice cakes), and they also brought out the egg in the hot pot. Â I think they brought out soup at the end too, but we were so full we couldn't finish it. Â The kimchee fried rice is delicious - remember to leave some space for it - trust me - it's a shame to leave it behind. I went for a birthday party - they were pretty funny about it. Â All the lights shut down (I thought there was a power outage), then the place throws up disco lights and crazy fob music wishing your friend ""Happy Bursday""!! Â  Our waiters and waitresses laughed along with us - it was a good time. Â Highly recommended if you want to embarrass your buddy on their birthday and/or eat some great K-bbq."

4/8/2010,3 star rating,"i like the selection of meats... the pork especially was good and the squid was awesome. Â The beef was on the small side and not the best cuts... fresh but cheaper cuts. Â I never get chicken at an AYCE so nothing on that. Â The kimchee pancake was a plus the kimchee was very sour; not my style. Â I'd go there again, but I'd probably consider other places first. Â The staff have that ""I hate working here and all these idiots asking me for meat to stuff their fat faces with"" but i like that kind of stuff. Â it makes me laugh. Â We were all crammed in the front waiting for tables. Â Some guy literally brushed shoulders with some dude to check out the dining area and the guy says ""HEY THE LINE IS BEHIND ME."" Â There was no LINE... just a bunch of people crammed together. Then I made fun of the guy at the table and he was sitting behind me the whole time."
12/28/2010,4 star rating,"A Cozy Dining Experience:Comparatively speaking with other global meat cuisines, i would NOT qualify this restaurant as a total carnivorous experience. It is rather a diverse dietary experience.Compared to top notch meat quality, this restaurant serves what i would consider average quality meats (and tender). For the price it is really a good deal. And the more meat you are able to consume the better the deal. We found street parking easy enough within 2 blocks. The valet parking was packed.As we arrived around 7:30 pm on Sunday, we noticed the line outside (make sure to go in and write your name on the waiting list notebook!). The hostess said that there was an approximately 1 hour waiting, but i think we were in after 30-40 minutes of waiting.The restaurant is divided into two sections. We were directed to the cozy inner section, with seating for 6 parties, to table #20. This inner section was being serviced entirely by our server Ms. Jina Jung.The restaurant has an interestingly unique, and rustic decor, of comfortable and laid back (almost cafe style) atmosphere. This restaurant has evolved into a place to come with friends and/or family, and chill while having dinner with familial and warm conversations. Definitely not a place for rushing, it would clash with the established culture here. We had come to strictly eat, but noticed that most other groups who had been eating well before we sat down, were still hanging as we were leaving.The service by Ms. Jina Jung was pleasant, comfortable, and to the point. Her presence was subtle (and this may be the training at this establishment, but can't be sure), which gives way to more focused and non-disruptive conversations with your party.Order in which food is served:First: Side dishes galore served immediately with complimentary ice water (which i found refreshing and delicious at this establishment).Second: Raw meats to barbecue on stone grill is brought out upon a little wait. When the server notices that your raw meat serving platter is empty, and meat on the grill is sparse, they will ask if you'd like more meat and which type. Third and last: When you are done eating meat to your heart's content, the server will ask if you'd like fried rice (korean style). And the server will make it on the grill. Though we were full, we found that we could accommodate the rice and it was pleasantly tasty and complimentary to all that we ate. The soy bean soup was came out salty -- you might want to ask that they make it less salty.If there are additional things you need and do not see your server right away, there is also a service bell (which we noticed latter into our dinner but did not make use of it).I have been as complete as i can think of. Enjoy this cozy dinning experience!!"
1/25/2011,5 star rating,"I'm shelling out one of my five stars for this place. It's that serious.Being from the east coast, a lot of the typical Korean places are rude and don't care because they know the available options are, well, not really available. All You Can Eat is even more rare back at home. Therefore, I appreciated this place and fell pretty much head over heels when I came here."
11/6/2011,5 star rating,This is my go to k-bbq place. Â We call it the pig place because it has a pig in the front. Pros: decently priced last time i went with a 17 dollar deal with 19 things to try including all the standard orders as well as a few special things to try. Â spoilers: Â they cook a nice special surprise with a kim chi fried rice with tofu soup that i always have to drink to the bottom of the bowl. there is a kyo chon on the corner !open till 2amtilted grills that empty out the oil by themselves.they clean the grills with radish. very classy. Â look up classy in the dictionary. Â it will read cleans your second round of bbq crispy burn stains with radish. Â they have hot dogs and squid.Cons:all ayce kbbq always have lines. Â may have the standard wait time. Â There is 2 dollar valet parking that is always crowded especially during dinner time. Â the hot dog is a normal hot dog. Â Ultimately:a solid choice.
11/1/2011,2 star rating,Came here right when they opened at 11 practically starving and ready to eat. I was on a time limit so I was ready to go in only to find out that nothing was ready. I was told I had to wait 30 min. Let me remind you their sign clearly says they open at 11am. I was already irritated but with the great reviews I still had hope..we finally sat down and it took another 10-15 min for us to get our marinated UNCOOKED meat. Management should really look into having cooks prep way before opening. I work in a restaurant and our prep cooks are there 2 hours prior to opening. The food here is by far the BEST kbbq I've ever had. Lacking in service though. I saw our waiter eating while our meat was just waiting in the window. When what looked to be the manager/owner came in he finally actually acknowledged me an my table. Come here an hour after opening and it'll be great!! Really good food though.

4/29/2013,2 star rating,"The WORST Korean bbq place I've ever been to!!I've decided to take my family to have a Korean meal experience and it was the worse choice I've ever made. our waiter didn't bother to greet us not explain how their menu works. Our waiter was the one with brownish hair. He was frowning the whole entire time and we know he wasn't happy providing his service to us. My husband thought he was being racist because he noticed that he did the opposite when serving others of different ethnic group.The food wasn't that bad, but the service really made a difference. When we ran out of rice, side dishes, or water, they took forever. my nephew and I had to share our rice to my brother because they didn't bother to give us more.my family believed they didn't deserve a tip, so we left without giving any!!sad to say but why would I give a tip for someone who treated us badly??? I don't normally do this but this place really needs to improve by providing quality service. I will never come back to this place again and wont recommend it!!!"
11/17/2012,5 star rating,"There's nothing I could say that hasn't been said. We got there before 6 on a Saturday, which means we only waited about 20 minutes for a table...not bad. But by the time we were seated, it was almost an hour wait,so go early or make a reservation. Outstanding food and service. Be sure to get a large bottle of Korean beer to accompany your meal...so perfect. But perhaps the best-kept secret is the kimchee pancakes...OMG so friggin' good! The only thing I didn't care for, and I know I'm in the minority here, is the kimchee fried rice. It was a bit too salty for my liking."

FOUR? ok, i guess more like 6 if you count the bean sprouts and kimchi on the griddle. oh and the steamed egg. oh, and the bindeh dduk. ok n.m i shouldnt complain hahaha- parking: like all ktown places, its valet. its $2. if youre cheap find street parkingwas this the BEST korean bbq ive ever had? well, it wasnt horrible. i think it was the horrible wait that put me off. id rather go somewhere else without the wait. but, if i wanted a lil bit of everything, i definitely know where to go."
4/19/2015,5 star rating,"This is, hands down, my favorite Korean bbq place. The only thing that would make it better would be if it was literally next door to an amazing karaoke place too. Then I could just hop from one to the other without even changing parking. Speaking of parking, $2 valet is super handy, so no worries with parking. Also there are a few nice shops in that area that I like to go to, so that's another plus. As far as food itself goes, it's so good. There is a great selection of meats, and the side dishes are plentiful and all tasty. The kimchi pancakes as the beginning and the kimchi fried rice at the end are excellent, though I am usually too stuffed to eat the fried rice at the end. I also really loved the steamed egg. It's a must try. The only downside to the place might be that sometimes there is a long wait to get a table (I have experienced anything from 30 minutes to an hour wait), but the food totally makes up for that once you are inside."

9/22/2012,3 star rating,"Hubby and I went to this place to try it out since there are always a ton of ppl at night time. This place was JUST OK. I didn't see the hype at this place. They serve normal a la carte meal and also 19 items ayce BBQ for $17.99. We chose ayce bbq. We are not sure if the place they had us sit was hot or the whole place was hot. But we sweat like crazy in there. Thus, it was hard to enjoy the meal. Service was really good but really slow. The grill was a big piece of stone (sounds cool) but I noticed the meat was just boiling in its own water, which I didn't like. Squid was awesome for me and I was too full to try the fried rice. (at the end of your meal, they cook fried rice on the stone) again, pretty cool. I would say check it out, but I wouldn't come back. If I do, it will be just to try their a la carte menu (which wasn't very $$. Abt 6-10$ for a dish)."
2/22/2013,3 star rating,"I came to this place several times throughout the years and I've seen it change from great place with good quality meat to popular venue with declining food quality. Â The service has been consistently good and the ambiance is fun and enjoyable. Â To be honest, the food is tasty and for what you pay, it's a great value. Â However, the reason for giving it 3 starts is because I've seen how great the place was before compared to now. Â Additionally, when compared against other rising kbbq places, this restaurant seems to be just average"

3/28/2011,4 star rating,"For $16.99 this place is a bargain for AYCE. Â You get to select from 19 kinds of meats ranging from beef, tongue to octopus. Â I think you can order only 4 items at a time, but service is quick and efficient. Â The waiter/waitress came around often asking if you needed anything else. Â The meats are very fresh and the side dishes were also very flavorful. Â We had to wait for about 15 mins and this was about 9pm on a Sunday night. Â All the side dishes such as pickled radish was already laid out on the table before you even get seated. When we finally left a little after 11pm, the restaurant was still packed full of people eating. Â This place a worth a visit. Â We will definitely come back again."

10/15/2010,3 star rating,"I decided to have one of my bday dinners here for some AYCE MEAT. Why, bc meat is frickin awesome. Obvious!I had a reservation for 7:45P, and of course LA traffic always manages to put a damper in your schedule when you need to go somewhere. We were about 15 minutes late and I went to the hostess and she told me she gave our table away bc I didn't answer my phone and we have to wait and put our name on the list. EXCUSE ME? I did not get a phone call! I think she was just saying that because they had a ridic line outside. Granted, yes, It's my fault I was late, but I did NOT get a call from the restaurant. My friend was nice enough to be the ""bad guy"" and ask to be seated ASAP since we had a reservation and it was for my birthday and everyone drove from afar. She said we would get the next table, but I think she just put us down on the list bc we kept going, ""waittttt, we're next"". We got seated in about 20 minutes or so.I personally think this is one of the better AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants I've been to. Great selection and the meat is one of the better qualities. They even have the kimchi pancake and egg fish as part of the menu. I think the AYCE for $16.99 is worth checking out. I would be back here if I ever had that Korean BBQ meat craving!Parking can be tricky in the lot bc this place is always crackin, but there is street parking too. Also, you should check out Haus across the street for some yummy desserts!"
10/14/2010,4 star rating,"A local Korean recommended this place to us. And boy am i grateful, thank you stranger for your great recommendation!The cons of this place: depending on the day and time, the wait can be long, and of course parking is bad during their rush hour. But hey, people know good food when they try it, so you will put up with it!The Pros: Where do i begin? Their briskett is very good, not so fatty like other ayce places. Their bulgogi, and marinated short ribs are delicious.I love the fact that they serve the radish wrap, it makes the food so much tastier. Their kimchi pancake, and egg soup is very good as well.They are one of the only places i've been to that also serves kimchi rice, and boy is it worth the wait. Save some pieces of meat at the end and have it with your rice, it is delicious.Give this place a try you definately will not be dissapointed!"
10/14/2010,2 star rating,Very overrated... Nothing really good bout this place... N I even waited for the kimchi fried rice OMG sooo greasy n the bean paste soup is soooo salty all the meat was ok... I won't be bak but I really loved the waitersI will see everyone at Road to Souel the best acye kbbq to me so far
10/14/2010,4 star rating,"My All Time Favorite AYCE KBBQ hands down. Extra Points for having figured out how not to stink up their customers.As the 400+ previous reviews may have already mentioned, the meats here are just awesomesauce plain and simple. The service seems to be very good too for a KBBQ place. Our servers are always in a good mood everytime we visit. I can't even count how many birthdays we've celebrated here. Â Our group photos are up on the wall (they do that for birthdays I believe).Valet parking is available, so parking shouldn't be an issue.Tip: It's generally difficult to reserve a table here for big groups (as it is with any really busy restaurant). So make sure your party is there on time otherwise your table may be given away. Just because you have reservations doesn't mean you don't have to wait. So, my advice if you have a larger group? - DON'T BE THE ORGANIZER."
10/13/2010,3 star rating,AYCE... Korean bbq goodness. Spent three hours here but mostly waiting to get bbq orders. Â Sevice was slow.. Loved the kalbi and pork though. Came out smelling like bbq.. Bring an extra shirt.
10/13/2010,4 star rating,"my friend and i came to this place and we went to the restaurant next door. Â upon arriving at said restaurant, we were expecting all you can eat barbecue. Â then we scrambled to leave as it was actually next door! Â that serves our lesson for the quest for ultimate korean barbecue...check where you are going, this place as a logo of a pig on it.aside from getting lost, Hae Jang Chon, a mouth full for a place to really get your mouth (and belly!) full. Â the service here is by far the best i've experienced at koreatown as the staff were very attentive. Â this could have been the result of the place not so busy. Â if you are absolutely a fan of korean food, i think this place is worth your $17.00 a person for all the food you are getting.

10/12/2010,4 star rating,"I love me a meat fest at ungodly hours of the night. Even with some of the ""goggles"" on, I'm not impaired enough to get into a crappy meal to just sop it all down. Not any food will do to night cap- has to be something good. Service is good here and makes me so happy. When all I want is to eat to maximum consumption and go home, I don't want to hussle to try to get things from them. One note- I ask them to make my kimchee rice first with a little tip....mix in the meats and it's love. Oh, Korean angel-Descends down plates of heavenMeat and spicy goods. It brings me to peaceful sleepbut gives smelly morning burp."
10/12/2010,5 star rating,My favorite Korean BBQ place hands down. It's also the only place I know that uses a stone grill to cook the meat. The meat just taste more flavorful on the stone grill.Good enough for me to plan my trips back to California around.
10/11/2010,5 star rating,"This is a really good AYCE KBBQ joint.The price is decent, the food is fresh, but what I love the most about this place is that they use a 'marble/stone grill' which retains the meat's juices and makes em' taste better. Any KBBQ fan needs to try this spot!"
5/6/2012,5 star rating,"- holy frak. this place is awesome.- understanding that AYCE places have lesser-quality meats.... hae jang chon does have really decent cuts- make room at the end (if that's even possible) for the kimchi rice they make for you right on the grill- if there is a wait, which there probably will be, there is a little divey korean bar to grab a few beers to wait it out, and build up an appetite."
3/29/2015,5 star rating,"This place was amazing and definitely worth the wait. If you want to experience Korean BBQ this is a must for eating. Good prices and delicious food. The waiter was even helpful with some of the cooking Â : ). There is Valet Parking out front, but we just parked up the street and walked over. The front door host is very polite and double checks people waiting to make sure he's not clearing a table for people who missed out by leaving. I will definitely be back."
1/9/2011,5 star rating,"This place offers up some of the best quality meats i've seen at a korean bbq that's AYCE and less than 20 dollars (17.99). this is my first experience at an AYCE korean bbq restaurant in ktown (my first korean bbq experience in ktown period was at Chosun Galbee).this relatively large korean bbq joint is the center of attention in a strip mall that also has a Kyo Chon, which my friend claims offers the best chicken ever. Â But we weren't here for that. we were here for beef. Â parking in the strip mall is impossible, and seems to be exclusively reserved for valet parking. Â the other cars that came with my party had to park in the residental neighborhood blocks around the area. Â my car, however, found a sweet spot just along 6th street, right in front of the restaurant.The number of choices of meats they offered was extraordinary. Â My girlfriend wanted squid, but I was a bit hesitant given my previous bad experiences with tough squid at korean bbqs. Â the squid itself came out in two pieces - the whole body, and all 5 tentacles connected together. Â the server helped cut the squid up after it was half done cooking, along with some of the other meats. Â because of this positive result, i went ahead and ordered the other meat that has failed at other korean bbqs - beef tongue. Â that too came out very tender! all the other standard meats were perfectly marbled, so i was too busy to take any pictures.sitting in a table with three other girls, and being notorious for being a korean bbq monster, i could not have stood out more. Â but it was a new experience for me in some aspects. Â this was the first korean bbq i've been to that offers the rice cake/noodle wrap (and thin slices of radish) to put some meat, salad, and grilled kimchi in. Â it was delicious. Â also, they offer three different dipping sauces - a typical spicy sauce, the regular sesame oil/salt, and some miso paste. at the end of every table was a working call button that prompted the waiters for service. Â each time we asked for more meat, the quantity given ranged drastically, from very little to a lot. but as long as we kept finishing it, they kept it coming. Â during the last waiter call button request, we had to press the button four times before someone came to help us. Â personally, i liked the speed of service (it wasn't too fast, so we were able to converse and enjoy the food, but not too slow that it seemed that things were dragging. Â after all the restaurant was packed when we went at 8:30PM).skipping some other details because at least one or more of the hundreds of reviews have already covered (such as kimchi fried rice at the end), i thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience here.p.s. don't bring your favorite jacket into here, or into any korean bbq restaurant, for that matter, unless your favorite scent is cooked meat."
8/8/2011,4 star rating,"The stone grill is an interesting take on KBBQ. Â The way they clean it makes a nice show each time. Â Good to go for lunch, no hassles with valet parking (park your own car), no waiting. Â However, even though their stated hours are 11 AM - 2AM, we arrived at 11:05 AM on a Sunday and the girl said ""the kitchen wasn't ready, come back in 20-30 minutes."" Â WTF? Â So we came back and were seated at 11:30 AM. Â The banchan came out but no meat for another 20 minutes... Â Wasn't until 11:50 AM the meat was on the table.The quality of the meat was good. Â The bulgolgi was soft and tender and well marinated. Â It wasn't as good as Oo-Kook's bulgolgi, but then again at $16.99 you're paying $8 less. Â The pork shoulder had a weird taste to it and was rubbery, but the squid was really good, as was the kalbi. Â Ventilation wasn't too bad, and the kimchi fried rice at the very end was excellent. Â The interior could use some good scrubbing and freshening up. Â Service was generally responsive (except for the delay in the beginning). Â But overall a nice place to have KBBQ."
12/7/2012,5 star rating,This place was GREAT. Literally enjoyed every piece of meat and all of the side dishes were delish! I am a big fan and will repeat again and again!
7/16/2012,4 star rating,"All you can eat Korean barbeque restaurant that is massively popular at the time of this writing. Expect a very long wait, but there is a restaurant in the same plaza that sells drinks and small appetizers, and it has become a tradition for my friends and I to put our name down and wait next door. Great selection of meat cooked on a stone grill. There is also several different types of dipping sauce that sets them appart from other all you can eat Korean barbeque restaurants. I prefer this restaurant over the similarly popular Road to Seoul as it feels a touch more earthy and relaxed."
10/26/2008,4 star rating,"When you're not the native of the Korean language, it's always hard to remember what the restaurant is called. I've been to Heijangchon Dolgooi for a number of times now and I finally remember their name. Ok, not really, maybe only because I actually texted myself the name of the place last time I dined there.As far as AYCE KBBQ goes in Ktown, this place is one of the best place I've ever been. The meat quality (for AYCE) is better than Manna and probably Tahoe Galbi. Pork belly was nice and thick. kalbi was well-marinated. Squid was pretty much full of awesomeness. They also serve ghimchee fried rice at the end with soup. IMO, I like the kimchee fried rice better over at Dong Il Jang, but you don't have to order pork to have it here in Heijangchon.So if you're looking for endless meat and wanted to top it off with kimchee fried rice. I highly recommend this place."
12/2/2009,5 star rating,I've been to most of the popular Korean BBQ in the area but this is the one I frequently go to. I love the main fact that the BBQ in prepared on Stone Tablets. When you cook on the gas grill at mostly all of the other places the BBQ get burned. Not at HaeJungChon...The flavor is outstanding.
5/16/2010,4 star rating,"Went back again for some ayce. Â Again, so good. Â Beef tongue, again, was bomb. Â But other cuts to note were the marinated kalbi as well as the pork shoulder. Â Guys, get here, it's good. Â Wait will probably be long, but it's so worth it. Â Oh so worth it..."
1/16/2010,4 star rating,"OK. Â I promised myself that after Vegas I would stop eating out, especially buffets. Â But I had to take my cousin to a Lasik Center down the street from this place and we decided to try it out if he didn't have surgery that day. Â He didn't.Let's see. Â The wait... they said would be 30+ minutes... it took about 1 hr 15 minutes. Â Must be a good sign. Â As we waited, we drooled watching the people inside devour the meat like t-rex's. Â It was unbearable, almost unfair. Â We had two huge parties ahead of us - which accounted for a huge part of the way. Â It sucked.But after a long wait, we got in. Â They had 19 choices of meats in here. Â That's a lot, considering I normally go to Cham Sut Gol in Garden Grove which has about 4 varieties. Â All the meats were pretty good, the brisket was definitely a let down. Â The beef tongue was my personal favorite.As others have mentioned, it was about $17/person. Â Our table of 4 had a bill of about $98ish after soju/beer. Â Not bad at all. Â Had this place been closer, I think I would have gone here for my primary kbbq fix."

9/23/2010,5 star rating,"I've been to Tahoe, Manna, Chosun all those AYCE and there is no competition. I always feel like its an experience eating here, always so fun.Price: $16.99 for 19 different types of meat ?! thats the same price at tahoe for 2 types of meat.Taste: The best of all the AYCE BBQs. SO MUCH FOOD ! you start with about 5 complimentary side dishes. There are 3 dipping sauces for your meat & 2 different kinds of wraps (sticky rice paper and tangy radish one)On the stone grill they place bean sprouts and kimchi and kimchi pancakes and all the meaty goodness you order.When the grill gets dirty after a while they bring grated radish and scrub it off. They also bring you a bean paste soup to share and place it in the middle of the stone grill so yummy. On top of that they bring you a fried rice mixture and make it crispy over the grill.Suggestion ! Order the bulgogi as the last meat and after it finishes cooking ask for the fried rice and mix it all together. (: DELISH.Atmosphere: Pretty clean and laid back. Theres an outside section for smokers. Theres korean music playing in the background not too overpowering though.Service: Â Little buttons on the table to get waiters attention. Waiters usually dont come by unless you push the button but its fun. Waiters dont speak too much english so you might want to take a korean speaking friend along with you on the first visit but who cares, we're not monkeys right ?Theres is seriously so much food you have to unbutton your pants to get up.TIP ! the bench with the lights seating towards the back of the room has no back support and starts feeling uncomfortable after a while.I used to go almost every week until i started realizing that the bottom half of my body was being hidden behind my stomach. Now i go every once in a while as a treat to myself (:"
9/23/2010,1 star rating,"Overall experience at this restaurant was definitely below average....CRAP at best... I wish I could give negative stars for this place. Issue #1: We showed up around 8:15 on a Wed night...She told us the wait would be 30 min...but ended up being 1 hour and 15 min. Didn't get seated till around 9:30pm. Why cant they just be upfront and let us know that the wait would be an hour or so? Waste of time. Issue #2 : Finally seated...I was hoping the dining experience would make up for the long wait. The waitress definitely lacked any interpersonal/service skills. Took about another 20 min before she took our initial order. Each time we made a request, it took an avg of 20-30 min before we ever got any of our simple requests (i.e. rice, additional meat, etc). Towards the very end..she finally asks ""Do you need anything else?"" WTF? She sucked at being a server. Issue #3: The meats n' side dishes were not that great. I've definitely had better selections and better marinated meats. K-town is full of MUCH BETTER Korean bbq restaurants. Issue #4: It took 20-25 min for them to bring the bill and then another 20-25 min for them to Â run our cards. After being fed-up, we just went up to the counter and saw our cards just sitting there. Again...WTF??? Issue #5: After being annoyed with the entire experience at this ""restaurant"", I didn't leave a tip. Got in my ride with my friends and two servers came out knocking on my car window asking why the tip was zero? ARE YOU F*CK*NG KIDDING ME????? Pissed me off more that they had the nerve to come out and ask why there was no tip. REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE. Never stepping foot into this place again.Thanks Yelp for letting me vent... =)"
9/22/2010,4 star rating,"I REALLY wanted to hate this place and give it 1-star. #1: Los Angeles traffic. #2. Why would I have to wait 30+ minutes for Kbbq? There are hundreds of these joints in L.A.. But I absolutely loved this place!L.A. traffic: On the way here, we witnessed a horrendous car-accident right before our eyes involving 3 cars, a head-on collision, and a fire hydrant. Drivers in L.A. are just stupid.The plaza is very small and crowded but the valet was awesome. Pretty cheap at $2 + tip.The brisket, marinated short rib, and honeycomb tripe were incredible. So fresh and delicious! You can freakin' taste the freshness.On the other hand, my table did not like the kimchi. We were also only allowed one steamed-egg per person which sucked (and was also bland compared to my preferred kbbq spot).The staff was remarkable. They were very courteous, cleaned our grill, refilled our drinks/side dishes, and remembered our [very complex] requests. And they were ridiculously quick with everything!Did I like it here? HELL YES!! Would I come here again? Only if I didn't have to drive.(To kbbq fanatics, check out Incheonwon BBQ House in Garden Grove and tell me which you like better)"
9/21/2010,4 star rating,"Yup, a solid 4 star spot. Â Maybe since I'm from NorCal my taste is kind of less experienced when it comes to Korean. Â It's either really pricey or you don't get a chance to eat soo much. Â Neither is the case here! Â Price is waaay cheaper than any other ayce spot up here and taste is still really good. Â What else sets it apart? Â The service! Â They were right on top of us whenever we started to get low on food and they constantly helped us clean the stove-grill(?)top thing. Â Perhaps one of the few things detracting from here is the lack of parking. Â Maybe kind of a wait also for a party of 2 when it comes to those fri-sunday nights."
9/19/2010,5 star rating,"It's my favorite AYCE KBBQ in LA. Hands down! It's really clean or that's the feeling I get! I've never had to wait that long because I usually come on weekdays at 5-6pm ish. There are 19 different meats for only $16.99!!!! They give you a good amount/variety of side dishes!I love how they give bean sprouts and kimchi to grill. It just works so well with the meat. The quality of the meat is pretty good for the price! Once the grill gets all gross from cooking the meat, they bring radish to clean the grill for you. When I first saw this, I was so amazed! HahaAfter you're done with the meat, they make fried rice for you on the grill and give you bean paste soup!!! It's some legit stuff!!! It completes the meal :)When it gets busy, the service isn't as prompt and I have to repeat my order sometimes for lets say water, because they keep forgetting. Parking is valet...but it's only like $2.I want some hae jang chon right now!!!!"
9/18/2010,2 star rating,"the food was decent, but we had to wait over an hour even though we had a reservation and were all there on time. seriously, why even bother taking reservations if you are going to do that? very very uncool. i'd rather go to one of the 1000 other korean bbq restaurants that don't jerk me around. also, like i said, the food was fine, but didn't blow me away at all. i've definitely had better. no idea what all the fuss was about."

9/17/2010,3 star rating,I don't like the wait (1 1/2 hours on Friday night) but AYCE for $16.99 is an awesome deal. Â Lots of meat selections to choose from. Â Hot dog was interesting so we had to try it. Â Not bad! Â Their side dishes need some work though. Â Those were just blah. Â Best part is the kimchi fried rice they make on the meat grill at the end! Â Parking is valet only.
9/13/2010,4 star rating,"Try saying the name of this place 4 times?!?! My friend (Vernice V.) did and I got spit flying in my eye.This past weekend, my drunk and obnoxious group of friends (along with Janice H.) and I dragged our butts to this place. We were starving and lured in by the cartoon piggy on the sign. Thank God for the AYCE b/c I don't know if it was the alcohol or the yumminess of the food, but I could not stop eating, EVEN AFTER they announced last call on the food, I kept ordering more! Â I feel kinda bad for the new waiter (who's only been there for a month. I'm not sure how I know this) that had to put up with our obnoxious antics. I really don't know what's the big deal with the kimchi fried rice that all the Yelpers are raving about on here. But, I HAD to try it and see for myself, annoying my tired friends (Janice H.) while it cooked. I give it 4 stars b/c the waiter was so nice! As for the food, it was good, but it's really all the same to me. Oh ya, the pan thingy they cook the meat on is pretty cool too. I think I need to get myself one of those things."
9/12/2010,5 star rating,"BEST KOREAN BBQ PLACE EVER!I wish I had a bigger stomach because they have 15 types of meat + kimchi pancakes + bomb side dishes AND kimchi fried rice at the end. All this for only $17?! WHAT!The service is awesome. Most Korean places treat non-Koreans differently than Koreans but not here. Everything was set up before you sit down, they clean the grill every time before you cook new meat, and they come back often asking if you need anything. The wait can be a bit long but it's open until 2am! They don't take reservations over the weekend so it's probably a good idea to go later, after the dinner rush. We went around 10pm and were told we had to wait more than an hour but it ended up being only about 20 minutes. Only cons are that the parking sucks and the music inside is LOUD, so loud that you can barely hear yourself think. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place!"

12/11/2009,5 star rating,"Love love LOVE Hae Jang Chon. Â LOVE that pig.Formerly a regular Kbbq restaurant with meats ordered a la carte, they decided to step it up and become an AYCE to compete with other establishments in the area. Â This was by far one of their best decisions ever, and they now have a strong lead against other Kbbq restaurants.Hae Jang Chon does an excellent job of setting itself apart from most Korean BBQ restaurants, starting with the kimchi fried rice and kimchi pajun. Â Most restaurants give you meat, side dishes, salad, and dduk (rice cake wrap,) and call it a day. Â Hae Jang Chon knows that even after eating a whole cow and then some, you still have room for a sizzling heap of kimchi fried rice. Â Call me greedy, but I want what I pay for. Â And if they give me just that and then some, I am a happy camper. Â Hand in hand with the food quantity, the food quality is superb. Â The meats are thick and portions are generous. Â These aren't day-old meats - they are fresh, and the bright red colors of the meat speak for themselves. Â Service is fast and friendly. Â Be sure to make use of that little button on the table. Â Best invention since sliced bread.You also get kind of a Benihana style show with your meal. Â After cooking several rounds of meat on your stone pan, the server comes by with a bowl of radishes to clean off the gunk. Â Pretty cool to watch and always entertaining to see the radishes remove the gunk so fast. Â Food - A+Service - A+Ambience - A+Price - A+Yep."
9/8/2010,5 star rating,"Devastated and horrified that my boyfriend hadn't had Korean barbecue yet, I Yelped around to find a good place in my neighborhood. With K-Town so close by, I knew I had tons of options, but settled on this choice mostly because of the previous reviews, and because I had to be sure they served the rice noodles. They're that important to my KBBQ experience, okay. Pros:- $17 All You Can Eat (AYCE) includes tons of meat choices including seafood- Salad side dish is delicious and plentiful- Stone grill!!!! Seriously, so worth it! The fat from the meats drains off cleanly into a small dish on the side, and gives the food a more ""clean"" taste.- Friendly service even to non-Koreans- Staff will clean the grill several times during your meal- The second time I asked for more rice noodle things, she brought me... like a huge bowl. It was epic.- Decor is really nice. It feels very open and way nicer inside than all other KBBQ joints I've seen.Cons:- Parking SUCKS. They have a valet probably for a fee. Parked down the street by the church.- The kimchi here is VERY sour, more than I'm used to- Wait to be seated can get long, as well as service when it's busy.Tips:- Put the Kimchi and sprouts on the grill. It's better that way.- Save room for the KIMCHI FRIED RICE! They'll toss everything together at the end to make rice for you, so save room!- When you ask for water, they will actually serve you an iced tea (not the American Snapple kind of shit), so if you want legit water, you might have to ask for tap or a bottle- Hit the button for service to ask for meat before you finish so you're a neverending train of meat-eating glory."
9/8/2010,2 star rating,"I love korean bbq but this place was okay. Love the whole all you can eat experience with all the pickled veggies yum :D but I felt that it was lacking in flavor .. marinated short ribs ?? bbq beef ?? bbq chicken ?? no taste whatsoever .. the side dishes and dips had the flavor .. what iritated me most was the waiter/""chef"" would come by 30/40 minutes at a time to cook our food .. I was cooking the food .. I love to cook but apparently they are supposed to cook for us .. When I would cook he would say ""so you are doing my job now ??"" and laugh at me .. errrrr WHERE ARE YOU ?? Given they have a service button to push .. I will not push that damn thing over and over just to make him flip my food .. even so .. the number one rule is not to mess with the people handling your food .. so fail on the customer service .. and what is up with the steam egg ?? ewwww .. water and egg ?? yukkk Â .. pancake kim chi ?? not bad .. so pickled veggies .. got me good .. flavorless meat .. never again ..Update: Forgot to mention that I asked for water NOT tea !! So I asked for water again and they did not give it to me. So I asked for soda and BAM magically in my face .."
9/6/2010,4 star rating,"$17 AYCE with 19 choices of meat, and a number of sides. The meats we tried were all pretty good, and the dipping sauces were great! They have delicious steamed egg and veggie side dishes, and some other not-so-yummy sides (bleh kimchi pancake & bean paste stew), but you're bound to like/dislike some. Kimchi fried rice at the end was great, especially when you let it crisp up at the bottom, but it didn't have enough kimchi in it for me. They serve iced tea instead of water!Service was the highlight of the meal, for sure. The waiters helped us cook our meat, taught us how to wrap our meat, etc. because we were a little incompetent, and were always stopping by to check on us even though it was super busy. SO nice!The hot stone grill was really cool and let the oil drip without smoking the place up (and they clean it for you between courses)! The heat was unevenly distributed though so you have to try it out and find the hot spots.I called that morning to make a reservation and was seated minutes after arriving, pissing people off who'd been waiting :P so be sure to make a reservation!"
9/6/2010,3 star rating,"I recently have gone back to this place a few times since writing my original review.I have decided to knock it down a star (really to 3.5 stars) due to the service issues I've had that differed from my original experience here. The food quality remains the same, but twice now I have gone when it hasn't been as busy in the restaurant and the service quality went down...oddly you would think it would be worse if it were busy! But no...when it is not as packed, they are LESS attentive. This last time I went, it took a long time for the meat to come out and even though I rang the service bell twice, we had to flag down the server for refills.When it is packed in this place, they walk around more and make sure to refill items and help grill the meat. Maybe because they want you to get in and out faster?My recommendation? Go when it's busy for good service, BUT make a reservation before you get there so you don't have to wait long for a table.."
4/24/2010,4 star rating,"I usually don't go to AYCE Korean BBQ places because I have a favorite place for Korean BBQ, which is not AYCE. I happened to see someones review on this when I was on Yelp by chance, and after seeing photos and such I decided to try it out.The three of us arrived around 7pm. There is valet which is 2 dollars. The resturaunt was full with a few people waiting, and we were told it would be anywhere from 30 mins to maybe an hour because they had to seat people who came in for reservations first. We ended up waiting about 20 mins. I highly recommend you get a reservation if you plan on hitting this place up on a Friday night or Saturday during peak hours. We left around 8:45 and the line was out the door and cars lined up for valet. I can't even imagine how long the people who didn't have reservations waited.....Ok on with the food. We were all pleasantly surprised! The meat was pretty good for AYCE. We ended up trying the thin brisket, thick pork belly, marinated short ribs and BBQ squid. The meal comes with so much food! Kimchee pancakes, Â salad, soup, egg dish, kimchee fried rice at the end. We were all incredibly stuffed to the brim when we finished. As another yelper mentioned, what was really surprising was the EXCELLENT service! This is pretty rare in a Korean resturaunt. They came around frequently to check meats, refilled things quickly and were very friendly. My sister pointed out that another nice thing was that most of the servers seemed to speak English well so for non-Koreans it would be easier to ask questions and such. She even said she thinks she prefers this place to our favorite Korean BBQ place and Honey Pig which specializes in pork belly.The price is very reasonable. It is 16.99 per person for dinner and considering all the great things you get with the meal it's a good deal. We will all definately be coming here again. A solid 4 1/2 stars I would say."
9/6/2010,4 star rating,"Really freaking good. Â I mean, I didn't give it five stars because some of the meats (out of the whopping number of 19 choices to choose from) didn't have much flavor, but all in all, pretty good!!My favorite meats were... the bbq pork, bulgogi, and california short rib. xD My favorite sides? Â KIMCHI FRIED RICE!! even though it was served at the end, it resparked a lot of our appetites! Â kimchi pancake was new and different from what i've ever tasted, and other than that all the other sides are pretty good too! Â They give you a LOT.They make sure you don't leave hungry!The service though... I reserved like 2 days in advance, and when I got there, my friends and I still had to wait for 20 minutes AFTER SETTLING for a smoking area to eat in. Â The smoking area wasn't too bad though, since no one really smokes when they eat in there. Â We did, however, have THE nicest waitress. Â She was working like.. 6 or 7 tables all in the smoking area, and she was still super nice to us and ready to take any of our orders (of course, as long as we were nice to her too.)food: Â pretty damn good. Â I'd definitely go back again!service: GREAT waitress but don't bother putting in reservations... Â the wait will be the same.atmosphere: awesome, better than the ayce kbbq's in orange county.highly recommended!"
8/31/2010,5 star rating,"of all the AYCE kbbq restaurants i've been to, this is my favorite, hands down!5 reasons for loving this place:1. the 54"" (or ginormous) flatscreen behind the counter that keeps me entertained while eating kbbq... you can also change channels upon request2. the staff actually serves/cooks your meat for you... nuff said3. witnessing them cleaning the stone grills spotless with vinegar-infused daikon multiple times throughout our meal4. KIMCHI FRIED RICE!!! at the end.... so save a little bit of space in your tummy for that... you can also get creative with it.. one of the waitresses cut the calamari into tiny pieces and cooked it into the fried rice for us... amaze balls5. the piggy on the restaurant sign... so cute ... and fitting :)**6. the bell you press to get the waiters to come to your table.. so fun to play withthe wait can be long, but expect to stay there at least 2 hours to eat your money's worth... .it's also open until 2 am, so if you're craving kbbq after barhopping... this is the place to be!"
8/30/2010,4 star rating,"After a summer in Asia eating small portions of tasty food, the one thing I missed was gorging myself with FATTY, DELICIOUS KOREAN BBQ. After my flight landed at 10pm, the hubby and I trekked to this place to fulfill our KBBQ cravings and alleviate a bit of jetlag. Even at midnight, the service was on point and super friendly! We got to eat a bit of everything. I loved the texture of the marinated beef rib but I thought the beef brisket was a bit dry. Pork belly was good. We even had an order of Honeycomb, which ended up being tripe!The great thing about this place are the hours. You can have your KBBQ until 2am. I like to point out that I didn't get the Kimchi Fried Rice at the end, but how can anybody save room for that thing?! That's beyond gluttony!"
8/28/2010,5 star rating,"Of all the different ayce kbbq in ktown, I'd say that this place is my favorite. Â First of all, this place uses a ceramic grill and the meat keeps a lot of ""meat juice"". Â That is yumlicious. Â Second, there is an amazingly wide selection of appetizers/side dishes/meat to choose from, and the staff is SUPER friendly and responsive. Â Our waitress was joking around with us and made many useful recommendations. Â Third, the atmosphere was pretty cozy and relaxing, and our table stayed for a good 2 hours without having the usual annoying waitress rushing you business. Â In all, it was a very wonderful and delicious experience. Â The only downside was the wait... I don't know if they take reservations, but if they do make sure you get a reservation. Â We waited a good hour to be seated, and my stomach was crying."
5/18/2010,4 star rating,cheap and good bbq. tons of side dishes !service was ok. good compare to other korean restaurants i have been to.Good to go with group of friends and enjoy a nice meal!
8/4/2010,4 star rating,"After reading the reviews, my hubby, sis-in-law, and I made the trip to K-town! When we arrived at the restaurant, I was glad that there was valet parking. I really did not feel like fighting for parking in LA. The restaurant was nice and clean. Surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded. This was a pleasant surprise considering it was 12:30 on a Saturday. The servers were very friendly and took our orders promptly. For drinks, we ordered the Barley tea, which was just okay for me. We then ordered the beef short rib, bbq chicken, pork shoulder, squid, honeycomb tripe, pork belly thin, and bulgogi. All I can say is that it was a protein extravaganza!!! It was delicious! I also loved the kimchi pancake. The banchan was mediocre, but I didn't really care because of the selection of meats!! Overall, I enjoyed my eating experience at this restaurant. You can not beat $16.99 AYCE/person!!!"
9/21/2010,4 star rating,"Yup, a solid 4 star spot. Â Maybe since I'm from NorCal my taste is kind of less experienced when it comes to Korean. Â It's either really pricey or you don't get a chance to eat soo much. Â Neither is the case here! Â Price is waaay cheaper than any other ayce spot up here and taste is still really good. Â What else sets it apart? Â The service! Â They were right on top of us whenever we started to get low on food and they constantly helped us clean the stove-grill(?)top thing. Â Perhaps one of the few things detracting from here is the lack of parking. Â Maybe kind of a wait also for a party of 2 when it comes to those fri-sunday nights."
11/13/2010,5 star rating,"Definitely my favorite place for KBBQ because of1. the quality of the foodand 2. it's all you can eatI came here with a couple friends and I was very impressed with the quality of service as well as the food selection. Â Very rarely will you ever find a place that serves Korean food this good with an all you can eat option for under 20 bucks. Â Meat options include chicken, squid, pork, and several kinds of beef among others. Â The only drawback I'd say is that you better come prepared for parking. Â Street parking is there if you're lucky. Â Otherwise, just bite the bullet and valet it up."
11/17/2010,3 star rating,"the order. all you can eat!the 4 star rating is a bit of a stretch for this place. but i can see why people would be willing to give it such. the service is pretty prompt, they are generous with the side dishes (actually asking you if you want more), the meat options are abundant, and the place is pretty well ventilated. but the banchan was nothing special-pretty generic in my opinion. the kimchi pancake was a nice touch (but road to seoul does it better). the grilled sprouts and kimchi are also a nice touch. i only had four types of meat here: brisket, kalbi, bulgogi, bbq pork. the brisket was on the lean side which doesn't do much for flavor. and i found myself dipping it into the soy-vinegar-ginger sauce (which had great flavor!). the brisket was the best meat of the night and it was mediocre at best. the kalbi was chewy and i couldn't for the life of me grill it to the texture i wanted. it wasn't me, it was the meat. medium done produced a too chewy product. medium well was more bearable. well is out of the question. possibly it was the size of the cut.  Â bulgogi had a very mild marinade. the marinade wasn't too flavorful. the cut was a good proportion of fat. some were a bit stringy but that's bulgogi for you. the bbq pork. i've had this dish at many places before and it can be done right!. this place's marinade just kills the meat taste. its way too overpowering. you can marinade bad lamb with this and it would kill the lamb aftertaste.i think your money might be better spent at road to seoul, which i myself wasn't a big fan of. but it was definitely at least a half notch better than this place, if not a full notch."
2/4/2011,3 star rating,"The food is good and the price really can't be beat, BUT, the wait is incredibly long for dinner, and service is hit or miss..And now for the best part of this review, on the night before this past Christmas Eve, my better half and I decided to have dinner here. Everything was as could be expected, long line, uncomfortable seating because all the good tables were taken by the larger parties, and the annoying cold breeze every time someone opened the door to check their name on the list. We finally got seated after waiting maybe 1.5 hours, which wasn't as bad as the previous time we had been here. Half way through our meal, some incompetent server decides that he wants to squeeze through behind me and a patron at the other table. And when I mean squeeze through, I mean, I was surprised that the seating arrangement didn't violate some fire code (it probably did). I could literally tilt my head back and more than likely head butt the girl behind me. Anyways, he tried to squeeze through, and while doing so, managed to spill marinade on me...I should probably be more specific, the server thought it would be a good idea to carry the tray of RAW MEAT sitting in its own RAW MEAT JUICES and MARINADE over my head..so when the half the juices/marinade fell off the tray and onto my hair, neck, back, jacket, shirt, and yes, my forehead, too...I didn't get so much as a ""Sorry"" or any offer to have more napkins. And everyone saw it, people at other tables were sitting there in shock that this guy didn't even flinch or bat an eye when I was then soaked in raw meat. He continued to serve the other table. I probably sat there nearly in tears for 15 minutes, before he made his way back to the table, and we were able to stop him and ask for napkins. Yes, we ASKED for napkins...to which he tossed a few onto our table and continued to help the other party--it was the other party that had to tell him that he spilled it on me. And then I got a, ""Oh, sorry, did it spill?""..yeah..just a lot...Anyways, that's my story, and honestly, the fact that the food is good really makes up for that one experience. I will probably come back, but I'll probably wear a poncho when I do.."
2/28/2011,4 star rating,The food was great! Only thing i didn't like was the long wait but it was worth it...get the bbq squid..it was delicious.
3/3/2011,5 star rating,"2nd most favorite kbbq place! for the place and quality of foood.. woww I love love love it! Great service, side dishes are excellent Â and it doesn't make you smell very much afterwards!!!"
4/3/2011,3 star rating,"Neighborhood gem. Â It's AYCE Korean bbq for a mere $18. Â Meat options include beef brisket, pork belly, boneless short rib/galbi/kalbi, bulgogi, tripe, tongue, squid, baby octopus, chicken, and hotdog. Â I tried everything but the baby octopus and hotdog and everything was tasty. Â The short rib comes with or without marinade and the pork belly comes thin or thick, your choice. Â Only four types of meats come out at any one time, but it's AYCE, so you can order any combo you desire. Â I enjoyed the brisket, unmarinaded short rib, and marinaded bulgogi the most. Â Of the four sauces offered (don't worry, you get all four and won't have to order it from the waitstaff), my two favorites were the soy sauce with pickled radish and Â the seasoned sesame oil. Â The other two sauces are the chili sauce (pretty low heat level), and bean paste. Â The menu defines the sauces and explains which sauces go best with which cuts of meat (the owners are so thoughtful!). Â You get a choice of white rice (which comes at the beginning of your meal) or kimchi fried rice (which is available only at the end of your meal). Â I recommend the kimchi rice. Â It's seasoned rice with kimchi, chopped up veggies, and nori bits (dried seaweed bits). Â  It's not something offered at other kbbq places and it's pretty tasty. Â It comes at the end of your meal because they make the fried rice using the meat fond from your bbq (yes, the more fond the more flavor). Â Parking is limited; I recommend swallowing the $2 to do valet as it's the most convenient. Â Service was above average, ""water"" consists of extremely diluted tea (it's off-white, and not yucky). Â I will be back for another visit if ever I'm in the area. Â I won't make a special trip to the place again in the future as comparable AYCE kbbq is ubiquitous in my neck of the woods (OC).Other important info: Â Good value, valet parking recommended, order kimchi fried rice, small, intimate, and casual atmosphere, you will smell like bbq during and after your meal, tables are close together, call for reservations to save on wait time, open until 2am, and menu has some pictures."
4/4/2011,5 star rating,"Uh oh, add me to the crowd. Â This is my new go-to KBBQ place. Â Open every night until 2 a.m.? Â Choice between thick or thin sliced pork belly? Â Kimchi fried rice? Â Prompt service? Â Sold."
5/26/2011,5 star rating,"One of my favorite AYCE KBBQ places! The service is great and the food is delicious! For big groups be sure to make a reservation! I love that they also have kimchi pancake as a side! and the steam egg they gave us more than they should have. Also, at the end they cook kimchi fried rice for you. I've gone here twice already and it is my new favorite kbbq!"
6/28/2011,3 star rating,"The clear upside of this place is that it's open until 2am. After a concert or when you get late night meat cravings this place is open for business. The first time I came to this place it was because of an add in LA Weekly and late night meat cravings. This place was awesome! Good quality of meats, service, sides, and the tea was tasty. Although on the more expensive side it was worth it. However, the second time I came here it was not as impressive. The quality of meat sucked and the service sucked. I don't know what happened but since then I haven't come back."
7/5/2011,4 star rating,"Wow.. bulgogi was delicious! Steamed egg was perfect.. :) well.. i'd say the line was pretty long but we waited only about 15 mins.. worth the wait? Kind of...The sauces were pretty good.. The food was great..I would of give it 5 stars if we didnt have to wait for 15 mins for raw food to come out.. But overall, it was 16.99 well spent.. cant compare to kbbq in san diego.. So jealous that LA has it all..ps. i think kimchi fried rice is okay.."
7/22/2011,3 star rating,"I came here once for dinner and I'm really not sure what the buzz is about. Â It was average at best. Â Parking was a nightmare, wait was long, serivce and food were mediocre. Â It was such a unmemorable night I'm about to fall asleep now thinking about it. Â With all the different choices in the area, I'd stay away from it."
7/31/2011,4 star rating,"The onlyyyy reason why I would mark it down is because of the wait and sometimes the wait for appetizers and drinks!i LOVE hae jong chon. Ive been to plenty of korean barbeques, and this is the one i constantly want to go back to. the waiters and waitrresses have a sense of humor, and they're always pretty fun to joke around with. The meat is pretty fresh, and I think they are marbled okay. i dont taste that weird un-freshness i taste from manna.. and it's pretty clean in there! I also like their small appetizers. there's this vegetable dish that i cant get enough of. and their potato salad.. i love the apples and pears in there haha... This is a must try..! It's pretty cheap too. Only 16.99 before tax. They have a lot of selections like brisket, abdomen, squid, pork shoulder, THIN SLICED PORK BELLY *ONE OF MY FAVS*, thick pork belly, etc etc... oh and Hot dog of course.. haha.. but ya! check it out, and if you want to avoid the wait, go after or before lunch and before dinner. P.S. dont go with a large group or you may have to wait SUPERRR LONG!"
8/21/2011,5 star rating,"This place is HAPPENING!!! I loved this place. The quality of the meat was just right, and the price for AYCE was decent! There was a lot of meat options to choose from and everything was delicious on the stone fire grill. The service was superb-- always brought out our dishes on time and attentive to everything."
10/20/2011,3 star rating,For the last 2-3 years I've been here it's been a consistently 50% hit or miss spot. On a good day it's the best AYCE kbbq and this is the memory you get nostalgic with. On a bad day the chewy old meat makes you wonder if it's even worth the gamble anymore.
10/27/2011,4 star rating,"went here AGES ago with my sis and my *other sis. Â :)love this place. Â we went later at night and so we didn't want to park too far. Â off to the valet you go, Rex! Â the wait looked so scary!!!!! Â we thought we'd be waiting for an hour, but the girl looked at us and says, ""Ok! this way!"" Â omgosh, YAY!they have a gargantuan AYCE menu. Â you can get everything. Â we ordered EVERYTHING. Â haha and it was alllll good. Â the usual faves: bulgogi, brisket, and spicy pork. Â the only drawback is that they only have a few side dishes. Â but at least they make them really well. Â my sis HATES potato salad with a passion. Â AMAZINGLY she ATE IT! Â that has to say a lot about someone who has phobias about something and manages to like it and eat it throughout our dinner! Â another highlight about this place is that it has a stone grill plate to cook off of. Â this adds AMAZING flavor. Â not a lot of places do that, so try it out for something different and delicious."
1/16/2012,4 star rating,"i am a fan of korean bbq. especially meat that is high end quality and also deliciously marinated. i am a glutton for punishment as was everyone at my table. we ordered squid, spicy pork (best thing), unmarinated galbi (which was delicious), and marinated bulgogi (pretty damn tasty). we had so many different types of meat come out. you should order your meat when you notice that the grill is getting a little empty because they do take some time in coming out to your table. you just press the button, order and they'll come clean your grill and give you your new 4 meats.at the end of your meal though is the highlight...the kimchi fried rice, holy smokes. best thing ever. i could've eaten just this and been happier than ever about my meal here. parking is nightmarish since it's limited to valet parking in a little strip mall."
1/16/2012,2 star rating,"This was one of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ spots until this past weekend. Waited 2 hours and 45 mins before we got seated for a party of 6. I know all AYCE places get packed on the weekends but almost a 3 hour wait is just ridiculous. I don't think any restaurant is worth that long of a wait. Until this place dies down, I don't think I'll be coming back here."
1/24/2012,2 star rating,"Personally I don't see what the big hype about this place is. Food was ok, but the wait alone was a bummer and the service was terrible its like I know you see me flaging you down trying to ask a simple question or pay my bill what's up I would strongly advise if going to this place go early very early to avoid the hour and a half wait outside"
1/29/2012,4 star rating,"I loved all of the choices that they had, and I especially loved the na-mool. It's not spinach which I thought it was but my mom asked and it was something else. Gotta love that fried rice at the end."
2/26/2012,4 star rating,"i love AYCE KBBQ!! the upside to this place is that i felt like i was sitting in a kbbq restaurant in korea itself, with the round table, stools, and vent right above.:) $17.99 like a lot of kbbq restaurants they went up a dollar. lol anyhow came here with my roommate since we made it a thing to try different kbbq spots after I got him hooked on this spot. Â before the actual grilling we got the egg soup, salad and banchan. Â i gotta agree with other yelpers wishing they offered more varieties on banchans. Â but either way it was yummy! we ordered beef brisket, pork belly, bulgogi, marinated beef rib meat, and chicken. so i got to say my least favorite was the chicken.im not a big fan of ordering chicken at a kbbq spot:) but you got please the others. the beef brisket is a must at all kbbq spot and this was no exception. so yummy!! and its usually the first meat to cook in the least amount of time :) super plus. 2nd i would say was the pork belly, then bulgogi, and beef rib, but all in all it was so yummy. we didnt get pancakes or kimchi fried rice like everyone else :( Â and yes you will walk out of here with a food coma wanting to just go home and sleep. :) next ayce kbbq spot?!! any recommendation?"

6/2/2012,3 star rating,"For $17.99 the food was good, nothing special though. Â The service was great and the quantity of food was great. Â The flavors and cuts of meat was typical of Korean BBQ. Â Definitely get there before 6 pm. Â We were a party of 8, arrived at 5 pm got seated and served with no problems. Â By 6 pm Â the lines were out the door with people waiting to be seated."
6/17/2014,3 star rating,"Walked into the place and got seated after about 5-10 minutes of waiting inside. The atmosphere was nice but the customer service, not so much. I'm a huge avid on customer service and It was not great here. Server had no smile whatsoever and took very long to come by our table to give us more meat. At the end we waited probably about 10 minutes for more meat waiting there with nothing on our little heating pan because we had finished it. As for tipping, I don't remember that it was a law to tip. If I clearly do not like your customer service than that is upon yourself as a server to step your game up and work for the tip. I was dissapointed when the manager had came over to my friends table asking for a tip and why didnt they get a bigger tip. Really? If you dont do a great job then thats obvious. As for my table we tipped 15% no more no less. and we were finishing our last bits of meat when the server came by and asked to collect our tip RIGHT IN FRONT OF US WHILE WE WERE EATING. Regardless of how the food tasted, I was fairly dissapointed with this place and would have rather went somewhere else."
11/1/2012,4 star rating,The only complaint that I have about this place are the lack of English speakers working here. Â Other than than that this place is awesome! Under $20 for all u can eat Korean BBQ AND OPEN UNTIL 2 am... Perfect post party snack for the hungry person!
2/17/2013,1 star rating,"There are at least half empty tales there, but they don't want get us seated. They claim they don't have enough chairs. It's a really bad marketing strategy. Letting people see a lot of people waiting outside doesn't get more business for you! Customers will leave once they realize that!"
2/15/2015,1 star rating,Employees treat customers very disrespectfully. Asked to speak to a manager and was told by the host to speak to the manager in your head. This is the bad thing about family owned establishments most employees related and think they can do whatever they want. No place should be ran with out a manager on duty. Avoid this place
10/22/2012,5 star rating,"I can't believe its taken me this long to write a review for this place. I've been going here for over a year now and I have to say, it is hands down the best Korean BBQ in Los Angeles. I have not found anything comparable. Great quality meat, great price., and ALL-YOU CAN EAT! The food is absolutely amazing and people know it to, because 9 times out of 10 you can expect a wait, especially if you go at night. I have waited 2 hours before to get a table for 3 on a Saturday night but it's worth it! Once you get a table though, the service is quick and extremely helpful. I highly recommend this place"
8/24/2014,5 star rating,"Lets get meat wasted! You can't come to k-town and not eat kbbq. This place stays open into late hours. There's always a wait but trust it's worth the wait. They give you kimchi pancake to start. Then unlimited meats but wait there's more! In the end they make kimchi fried rice, so bomb! Great place they have here."
8/15/2012,5 star rating,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! This is probably the most satisfying AYCE KBBQ I've had. I highly recommend the Bulgogi and Marinated Chicken.
8/9/2012,4 star rating,Wait on a Tuesday night in the summer was over an hour long .. but! the food and service was really great. I'd say it's better than most KBBQ places anywhere. I think if you come after 10 the wait shouldn't be too bad.
9/23/2012,5 star rating,"Hands down this is by far one of the best Korean BBQ restaurants I have ever been to. So who cares there's a wait, of course a place with such great, and delicious food, there are going to be many people wanting to eat there, and OBVIOUSLY you are going to have to wait. Well it's okay, a lot of people are impatient, and ignorant knowing they had to wait, it is those type of people who had to wait that would eventually write a bad review about it and then say about how terrible the food was. And not even one employee nor manager has been rude to me nor my friends at all. I been eating eating there for a year now, and til' this day I have NOT had any problems with this place at all!I always had been given great service, great quality of food, and always felt such a great atmosphere, even when it's full. It's just simply great that every time I go there, all the waiters know me so well that they already know what I am going to order haha. Every time I go there I always bring family members or friends along, and they are just so pleased with this place, they would end up taking others and even recommending others there too.It's truly a wonderful place to eat, and hangout, but if your friends are coming along just to say hi and not eat anything at all, sorry but they're are not needed to take up space for hungry customers.Of course the maximum capacity is 49 and obviously the restaurant has to obey the fire code. Sometimes you may see the restaurant half empty, well it's because just like other places, sometimes there may be a lighting or gas problem and in this case since they use gas, sometimes the gas lines won't work and when you see the place half empty don't assume that the waiters don't know how to count, just think next time that there may be a little problem that they will fix right away.So for those who write bad reviews about this lovely restaurant, think twice about writing a review about another restaurant, or any other food facility, because you may never know, or understand why, or how a restaurant would have 5 stars from other different people.I highly recommend Hae Jang Chon for a place to settle down, unwind, and eat the many flavors of the mouth watering meat, and the surprising delicious taste of the many dipping sauces. :)"

12/30/2008,4 star rating,What can i really say that hasn't already been blogged by others. This place is great. The kimchi fried rice at the end was good. Food coma and the meat sweats are overpowering me now so i have to end my review here..
6/7/2009,2 star rating,"This place disappoints.I came here two years ago and the food was great. The side dishes were more in number. Now they just have potato salad..which is not creamy. It's so damn powdery, it's lacking in mayo. It tastes like it was made a few days ago.. it probably was since there weren't that many people there during lunch time today.They claim to have 19 different items to choose for all you can eat...but honestly, all of it is tasteless. The angus beef was too thick..didn't taste fresh.The chicken was bland. It claimed to be BBQ chicken on the menu, but there was no hint of sauce whatsoever.Beef Brisket--normally the best thing at korean bbQ. They gave us slices that were 95% fat and 5% meat... what the hell is that? They show you a lack of hospitality if you're not korean as well. They kind of just brush you off and give you the crappiest cuts of meat. Maybe that was the case here.. or maybe they just really suck altogether and the quality has declined significantly since the last 2 years...Sure the economy is going down the hole and maybe food costs you more to acquire, but damn.. you can't play your customers like that..giving them crap to eat.Bulgolgi was the best item.. I mixed in the sauces while cooking. It really helps the flavor when you mix in the sauce while cooking, rather than dipping it after your meat is done.BBQ Pork.. again, tasted like nothing.Bean soup-way too salty.The kim chi fried rice has maintained its standard though. i find if you mix in the seasoned/marinated lettuce drenched in sauce with the fried rice, it makes it even tastier.All in all, disappointed with this visit.Won't come here again, that's for sure"
10/22/2009,4 star rating,"I love this place so much. The meat is high quality and its so affordable- $16.99 for all you can eat! They sell soju, beer, and wine too. What I love about it most of all though, is the stone that you cook on and the kimchi fried rice at the end. I would give 5 stars but the wait staff can be a bit pissy from time to time and I have definitely been yelled at by one of the older women in Korean before. But, bottom line, it's great AYCE bbq and super fun with a group of friends."
6/25/2010,4 star rating,"nom nom nomwhy can't we have these all you can eat korean bbq places in san francisco?! Â we went on a sunday night and the wait was 30 minutes. Â whats good about this place is that the meats are actually of pretty good quality, the kalbi comes cut w/o the bone on it, and its cooked on what looked like a marble slab.the service was pretty good, they'll even cook the food for you if they think ur wasting time =) Â it comes with all the usually goodies toobonus open till 2am and its cheap!"
9/18/2010,2 star rating,"the food was decent, but we had to wait over an hour even though we had a reservation and were all there on time. seriously, why even bother taking reservations if you are going to do that? very very uncool. i'd rather go to one of the 1000 other korean bbq restaurants that don't jerk me around. also, like i said, the food was fine, but didn't blow me away at all. i've definitely had better. no idea what all the fuss was about."
9/29/2010,4 star rating,I live in San Francisco and I crave for this place so much that I'm trying to talk the hubby into flying into La just to eat here. For about $17 you get to try 19 different meats and did I mention it's all you can eat? Ohhh emm gee! They bring out 4 meats at a time and cook it right before your eyes on a stone grill. You will come out smelling like BBQ for days but it's worth it. They give you all the condiments you need and keep restocking as you go. My favorites are the short rib and bulgogi! Keep in mind they have kim chee rice but it comes at the end. I was too stuffed to even try it so pace yourself when you come here!
11/23/2010,5 star rating,"Umm, I LOVE this place! Â One day I plan to spend an entire day just eating until they have to roll me out (^_^)v Â You've been warned Hae Jang Chon Restaurant! Â Seriously though, I love the All You Can Eat menu! Â You can order up to four different types of meat at a time (which is a great way to pace yourself so you don't just order a bunch of food you end up not being able to eat). Â And save room for the Kimchi Fried Rice at the end! Â **Drool** . . . anyone wanna go? Â Let's go!"
1/4/2011,5 star rating,"One of the best i have tasted so far, the service food and selection is top notch for a AYCE place, not sure what the other people who gave 2 stars were thinking, but on average this is above par. Thanks for keeping it nice and clean for all to enjoy. Â Looking forward to coming back with all my buddies to enjoy and eat like crazy."
4/11/2011,4 star rating,"I have been here about 10 times already. Every time I am here the wait has just getting longer and longer. Prepare to wait for more than 45 minutes if you arrive at 6:30pm, 60+ minutes after 7pm. If your party is huge (8 or more) expect a longer wait, and most likely seating at separate tables. Make a reservation before 12pm the same day will clear you out of this hassle. Food is always great, and kept fresh. Service is wonderful, as the waiters and waitresses frequently as you for your second orders. Also, they do have of the cooking so that you can spend more times with your friends. Servers will clean your stone grill between orders with reddish.For the price of $16.99 per person, you will get a great deal of food (Kalbi, Bugolgi, Squid, Chicken, Pork, Briskets, Tongues, Pork and Beef Belly, and Honeycombs) and unlimited sides, drinks extra. Do not forget the Kimchi Fried Rice and Soybean Soup at the end. Although it is a bit salty, yet is a perfect combination to end the meal.This place is truly recommended for groups and a perfect hang out spot for late night eaters as they open til 2am everyday."
5/7/2011,3 star rating,Food was good..I only gave 3 stars bec of HORRIBLE service. People seems to be angry when you ask for additional meat . The waiting time to get additional food takes a long time. The staff seems irritated when you press the call button. Its not a very friendly place to dine in. This is going to be our first and last time to eat in this place!
6/17/2011,5 star rating,"Extremely friendly and quick service, delicious food, and overall great experience. I'll be coming back with more friends and a bigger appetite. Pretty good price for all you can eat and I love that it's open late!"
8/5/2011,5 star rating,This is hands down my favorite k bbq in LA... They are super attentive as long as u know how to work their bell and have someone who speaks Korean... My best part of this place is the kimchi pancake and kimchi fried rice that comes at the end with the fermented soy bean soup... One set price no bs... Love it!!!
9/1/2011,3 star rating,"Not the best, we all burned our arms thanks to the stupid huge stone Â in the middle of the table (not ideal for your young kids) had much better but I will admit the pork brisket was amazing, but definitely not worth the price. The stuff they give at the end is pretty pointless and disgusting too."
9/2/2011,1 star rating,"The service at sign in was sooooooooo bad that i didn't even end up eating there. I don't look korean so they must have assumed that I didn't understand. They were rude rude rude. The reviews sound great but I cannot tolerate ignorance. I arrived with a friend on a sunday night around 5pm. There was a wait even though half of the restaurant was empty. So I asked the lady how long the wait is going to be. She rolls her eyes and says something rude in Korean under her breath and says 20 minutes. Then a group of 4 Korean young adults walk in, speak to her in Korean and proceed to be seated down immediately. The lady at sign in should realize that this is California. People who don't look Korean could easily be Korean and understand everything she says. HORRIBLE that this still happens in 2011."
12/30/2011,5 star rating,Hae Jang Chon you are the best ayce kbbq place I've tried thus far. Your service is impeccable once we are seated. Although the wait is definitely not. Your sauce also has jalapenos in them and I love it! Until we meet again...my stomach misses you!
1/24/2012,5 star rating,"One word!! Heavenly...I've been to a few all you can eat Korean BBQ place and this is bay far the best place I've ever been to and guess what its only $16.99. I've been a firm believer of Â ""You get what you pay for""... For the 1st in my life I have been proven wrong, this has been the 1st and only Â restaurant that has shown me you can get a quality meal without Â breaking the bank. Â There are 19+ items to choose from, I tried going through the whole list but was full by the 5th item :), I know Â I eat like a beast :). Not a single Item was disappointing, I will have to go back again when I visit L.A. and continue where I left off. The only thing That I was bothered by was the very long, long wait to be seated. I nearly left and was so very pleased that I didn't. I would have given this place 4 stars because of the long wait but after I sat down and started eating It instantly changed my mood and I realized that it was worth the wait."
1/25/2012,4 star rating,"My husband and I were craving KBBQ at 10:00pm. We went to Castle, Sanya, etc and no one would serve us bc they were closing. Then we finally found this place...open til 2am! The price is slightly higher ($16.99) than the more divey places we usually go but it is so good and worth it!! Prob the nicest KBBQ place we have tried. The staff, cleanliness, and atmosphere is really great! Great music! We will go again when we want to ""splurge"" a little more on KBBQ."
3/1/2012,5 star rating,"We waited a hour but it was worth it! Dont expect great service, they are pack and under staff but the food is delicious! I highly recommend the cow tongue! Its very thinny slice and melts in your mouth! Save room for the kim chii fried rice!"
4/7/2012,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is my favorite kbbq place! There is a large variety of meat (and squid!) and it is of good quality! The side dishes are delicious as well. Also the customer service here is amazing! They always come ask if you need any more meat and they always come help you cut meat! They also come clean your stove at least 2 times, where at other kbbq places, they don't even clean it at all. I love it here! I would give it 5 stars, but it is very crowded at night. The wait is sometimes 2+ hours, but it is not their fault. I wish there was another Hae Jang Chon location. By far the best kbbq I ever had!"
5/3/2012,4 star rating,Stand out was definitely the thin sliced pork belly. And that kimchi rice is just as good as everyone says.
5/14/2012,4 star rating,"Good all you can eat korean place. The bolgogi wasn't as great as other places, but the sides were good and the service was great."
5/22/2012,5 star rating,"This is what I hold all standards of Korean food up to. Glorious, savory all-you-can-eat meat with loaded dipping sauces and pickled sides. Well worth the wait & valet parking. My taste buds are awaiting my next west coast visit!!"
6/5/2012,1 star rating,"The rude Â waiter just took the tip money right out of my hand , not a good experience!!!! This place sucks"
6/8/2012,4 star rating,"Very good selection of all you can eat meats: galbi, brisket, cuttlefish, organ meats, and more. Â The banchan they serve is very tasty. Â The kimchi pancake is a must. They will come around and flip the meat around and help you cook it. Â I LOVE the way they clean the grill too. Â It's like dinner and a show. Â They also have raspberry wine which is a plus in my book."
2/13/2017,1 star rating,"Alright everyone this is a really long review so sit back enjoy your 10-15 mins of my fast-action-packed life of Korean BBQ dining. I am writing this right in front of the restaurant because I am extremely furious. Only because this place has gotten on my nerves, upon seeing the place on yelp I was interested and the food looked extremely appetizing on the pic. I decide to visit because their hours were great for my friends that get out at work late. Let me start off withThis guy named Â Tiger is one of the worse server I have seen. He totally forget our order of rice for two. We then asked another server for two orders of rice, he forgot them too! Like, WTF, OMG. Later on, this guy came and kept on asking us if we wanted any more meat. We told him that we are fine but no less than 5 minutes later he came back and ask us again. With the same reply, we told him we were fine. You know what happens next, in no less than 5 min, he asked us the same question and we then told him we wanted to order the rice. Tiger then remember our order of rice (about time) and finally gave us rice."
11/11/2012,5 star rating,"Went with my friend on a Sunday night around 6:30pm and it took us 5mins to get seated, granted there weren't any people waiting when we arrived! It was our first time in a Korean restaurant, but they were soooo nice. They even helped us grill the meat and told us how to eat the dishes they had served us! Valet parking was also great! The only thing I'm if-y about is whether we're supposed to leave a tip? I did because that's what I was taught to do at nice restaurants, but I don't know if it's considered rude? Anyone know? If it is, I feel bad, I only had good intentions and I even asked to people next to us and they said it was okay. Can someone plz let me know? Thanks! Oh and try the SQUID!!!!! So yu~mmy!!!"
9/9/2012,3 star rating,They advertised that brisket they used is kobe beef. I don't think so.
7/18/2012,5 star rating,"My friend showed me the light once again. Â This place has good meat quality and is cooked on a stone grill, which I liked. Â One of the top K barb places I've been to. Â The service is also really good compared to other places."
3/21/2014,5 star rating,"If you are looking for an epic ""all you can eat Korean BBQ"" in LA this is hands down the number one spot to go to! Although they are super busy at night and took forever to seat my gf and I ( close to an hour wait sometimes), its most definitely worth the wait! I was a little frustrated my first time when I had to wait so long but once you start eating all your frustration just goes out the window. And for a place that is super packed all the time their service is very impressive! They would constantly come and check up on you just to make sure everything is going well with you and your desires. It might seem like they are rushing you but its only because they are trying to serve everyone as fast as they can, which totally makes sense. My favorite would be the beef kalbi! It is soooo good I ordered about 3 courses of them haha. And the kimchi pancakes are something you def. have to try because they are surprisingly very tasty! Also there is a lot of side foods right in the beginning so you can start eating right when you sit down! Which is a great thing because the wait makes you that much more hungry ! :) Well its quite clear that this is my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ in LA, and without a doubt i will be back! and hopefully soon !"
10/28/2012,1 star rating,"If I could put a negative star rating I would put it times 100. The worst possible service ever. I went to this restaurant with a party of 6. Being the only vegetarian of the group, I ordered Bibimpap. After my friends being served about 5 times, which took about 40MINUTES. I was brought the Bibimpap. I refused to take the plate and the server just walked away with the plate like nothing had happened. Not even a change if facial expression. I would not recommend this place to anyone who like good service."
8/30/2012,4 star rating,"Love the food here, especially the fried rice at the end. Mmm...one of my favorite korean bbq places. The cons, however, is there is always a long wait (sometimes over an hour), and they dont take reservations. Also, the service staff is just bleh. Never smile, korean style I guess. I can say that because I'm Korean. :) There is one older lady, though, who's super amicable and helpful!"
5/27/2014,4 star rating,"Last minute kbbq plans and this is where we ended up. We got here around 11pm on Memorial Day and it was surprisingly pretty packed. The food was pretty good. I judge places based on their beef brisket so when we cooked it on the stone pan/grill, it was just the right amount of flavor. The meat was tender and savory while the stone pan retained all the juices. After a while, the servers will come by and clean up the grill with shredded vegetables (no, they don't make you eat the burnt remains lol). The sides they offer are an abundance of flavor - love the greens. The servers were really polite but it was inconvenient trying to get their attention (I know they have buttons but I feel rude when I use them). I don't like that you actually have to ask them to constantly refill the sauces and our waters but what evs I guess... It was kinda busy. The environment is really nicely decorated with fancy ikea decor hehe Â loves. I don't like that you have to pay for parking even though it was 2 bucks (sorry... I'm a cheap Asian haha). Overall, it wasn't too bad. I really wish they had a dessert menu but I guess you can drop by the dessert boutique across the street (haven't tried... It just looked really pretty heh)."
7/3/2014,5 star rating,Great food at great price. Probably the best ayce kbbq place around. Â Price is awesome too at 19 bucks. Â Of course there is a wait.
10/16/2014,2 star rating,"This place has been on the decline for the past several years. Â I use to think it was one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ because of the stone grill. Â I don't mind the price increase because of the cost of beef but the quality has gone down significantly. Â Your first batch will come out ok, but you could've gotten this for 9.99! Â Then the next batches the meats are just horrible."
1/10/2013,4 star rating,Spicy pork and brisket were delicious. Be ready to eat your months worth of meat. Better to go with 3-4 people.
11/28/2014,3 star rating,Not entirely sure why the ratings are so high. Service is super slow. We ordered the Bulgogi lunch entree. Side dishes are good but the meat was too sweet for my taste. Buffet lunch is $19.99 v. $11.99 at Bud Namu where the meat was fresh and I really liked the salad and side dishes.
4/25/2009,5 star rating,Couldn't tell you if this is the best Korean BBQ in K-Town but its certainly the best on my list AND its open way late.
6/21/2009,2 star rating,"You guys are kidding me. Â This is a weak link in the KBBQ food chain. Â After the fab reviews here on Yelp I made the jaunt to Koreatown from the westside, and was really stunned by how sub-par this place is. Â The panchan and rice were really, really unenthusiastic and bland, and had the vibe of being re-used (though I did not see that, to be clear). Â The main course, the bulgogi, was tasteless. Â I had to blast it with sauce to be edible, and ended up leaving half on the plate (a rarity for me and my beloved KBBQ). Â And as a white dude, I got the ""what are you doing here?"" look from the staff. Â Not cool. Â Chosun Kalbi, Road to Seoul and others are Â infinitely better."
8/10/2009,3 star rating,"I'm not a meat connoiseur, so all the Korean BBQ meat tastes the same to me. Â The thing that stands out are the side dishes! Â This place was weak on the side dishes and they were average. Â I love the glass noodle one, but it was too soggy and lacking in flavor. Â Even the fish cake dish (my second favorite) was blah. Â I liked how they cleaned the grill after a round of meat. Â I wonder if I could clean my grill with daikon radishes..."
1/14/2010,3 star rating,"I rarely eat buffets cause it's too filling and I always feel like I have to get my money's worth. Service is good, nice people. Â Buffet was just okay. There is one meat I really like which is the thin sliced pork belly, it was surprisingly good. Â They gave you a lot of food, but you have to eat all your meat or else they will charge you extra It's $16.99 all you can eat, but literally you have to eat all the meat. Â They over sides like Kimchi pancake, rice cake and bean paste soup. Don't bother with the kimchi pancake and rice cake. They were not very good. The kimchi pancake was very soggy and weird looking color and literally nothing on there except flour. Not good at all in my opinion. Â The rice cake, not good either. Â Bean paste soup was just so so."
4/10/2010,4 star rating,"This place is great. 16.99 for all you can eat with a choice from 19 different types of meats with all of the fixings to go with of course. The meat comes out fresh and marinated oh so yummy. Â Also, the restaurant is well ventilated, so you won't leave smelling like BBQ so that is a plus! Â At the end of your meal you have the option of getting plain white rice or a server can make kimchi fried rice, make sure to ask for it. Â All of this is included within the 16.99 all you can eat. Â What makes this place better than other KBBQ places is that the service is great, no rude servers."
11/4/2010,5 star rating,"I'm torn whether this or Road to Seoul is my fav AYCE KBBQ place.For $16.99, you get a good assortment of meats, which seem to be pretty good quality to me. The service is pretty snappy; I don't think I've really had problems getting more plates of meat or refilling the rice paper. The side dishes are average fare, but seriously, who goes to KBBQ for the side dishes? On the plus side, they do serve steamed egg and kimchi pancake. When you finish your meal, they come and mix kimchi rice on the stone grill, although I'm usually too stuffed to eat much.They are opened decently late, however expect to wait in line, especially on weekends and during the dinner rush.The fobby happy birthday song they play is also annoyingly catchy :]"

This place is absolutely phenomenal!! The food is yummy and the communal cooking station is a great way to socialize and eat with your friends!! Just make sure to make a reservation b/c this place gets packed!!"

5/16/2010,4 star rating,"I had the $16.99 all-you-can-eat dinner here after a creepy photo event with a group of other Yelpers last week. I have to admit I'm a total KBBQ rookie (if you don't count the Kogi truck and Freshia). Heck, this was my 2nd ever visit to any Korean restaurant. As far as I could tell though, just about everything I ate here was delicious. We had heaps of brisket, spicy pork belly, cattle tongue, and some other thinly-sliced meats all cooked at our table. They were complimented by some small relish dishes, rice, steamed egg, potato salad, and green iced tea.Parking in front of the place is valet-only, so I went the cheap-o route and tucked my car away into one of the side streets. Our party of 10 finally got seating after about a 1/2 hour wait, but I personally think it was worth it.I'm definitely gonna be on the lookout for something like this closer to home."
5/16/2010,4 star rating,"Went back again for some ayce. Â Again, so good. Â Beef tongue, again, was bomb. Â But other cuts to note were the marinated kalbi as well as the pork shoulder. Â Guys, get here, it's good. Â Wait will probably be long, but it's so worth it. Â Oh so worth it..."
1/16/2010,4 star rating,"OK. Â I promised myself that after Vegas I would stop eating out, especially buffets. Â But I had to take my cousin to a Lasik Center down the street from this place and we decided to try it out if he didn't have surgery that day. Â He didn't.Let's see. Â The wait... they said would be 30+ minutes... it took about 1 hr 15 minutes. Â Must be a good sign. Â As we waited, we drooled watching the people inside devour the meat like t-rex's. Â It was unbearable, almost unfair. Â We had two huge parties ahead of us - which accounted for a huge part of the way. Â It sucked.But after a long wait, we got in. Â They had 19 choices of meats in here. Â That's a lot, considering I normally go to Cham Sut Gol in Garden Grove which has about 4 varieties. Â All the meats were pretty good, the brisket was definitely a let down. Â The beef tongue was my personal favorite.As others have mentioned, it was about $17/person. Â Our table of 4 had a bill of about $98ish after soju/beer. Â Not bad at all. Â Had this place been closer, I think I would have gone here for my primary kbbq fix."
5/16/2010,3 star rating,"Came here at 6:30pm on a Saturday and surprisingly the wait wasn't too long. Valet was just $2 and they pull up your car pretty quickly.On with the food. For an AYCE korean bbq the meat here is just the same as any other place. You cook on a stone top that has a little hole on it to drain out the oil. For us, the entire top slide off the fire. A waitress used a pair of wooden chopsticks to hold it back in place.Overall, just another average AYCE Korean bbq restaurant. Great if you're looking for a quick fix for your bbq cravings."
5/12/2010,4 star rating,"I love HJC! Â My husband took me there a few weeks ago and I swear my waistline has not gone by to it's original circumference since that night. Â Initially we thought about going to O Dae San upon recommendation from a friend, but we saw that HJC had better reviews. Â My husband also knew that I love Korean BBQ but don't like leaving smelling like I'm still rolling in pork belly bbq nor do I like dirty and cheap Korean AYCE joints. Â HJC did not disappoint. Â Not only is the stone grill amazing and doesn't end up burning most of your meat, the lady comes by constantly to clean the stone grill with some radish. Â We ordered the beef brisket, bbq chicken, bbq short ribs marinated, pork belly, and bbq squid. Â The best by far has to be the angus beef brisket. Â To top it off, they give you the steamed egg, kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice. Â Overall the food is a 4star, ambience a 3 star, and service a 4 star."
5/11/2010,5 star rating,"Seriously, I have not even bothered continuing my kbbq journey because this place is so good. Instead of risking trying a new spot, I keep coming back here for more. Consistency is key and this place is like a perfect straight line. All other kbbq spots seem to be nonexistent when I think of where I want to go for kbbq. My late night tricks of coming at 10pm-11pm doesnt even seem to work anywhere! Why is there still a line! I think I gave that tip away. There has never been one single complaint whenever I wanted more meat and that is a whole lot of meat. No dirty looks. No old meat. Ever get your grill cleaned like 10x without even calling for the grill to be cleaned!!??This is my fave spot. Catch me here every other week for some delicious chadol and thick pork belly!!! God, this place is great, cant wait to come back asap."
1/23/2010,5 star rating,"Remix babyyyyyyyy! (Lil Wayne voice) I fucking love that this place is opened till 2am! When you get that late night urge for some good kbbq, well now you know where to go! Â Its never too late for kbbq, unless you want to go after 2am....Its been a while since I have been here. I knew the first time I reviewed this place, I thought it could have been better. After all the service was great, but what was lacking was a more personal experience with my food. Something just drew me back here to give this place another try, another deserving review. The last time I was here, it was a big party, and god I just hate sitting in big round tables with no leg room or arm room. Call me picky, but I prefer to enjoy korean bbq with a max of 4 people on any table. Its also nice to order a bottle of soju....then as the waiter is leaving our table he turns around and stares at me like I was some under aged youngin trying to get away with a bottle of alcohol. Call me McLovin.. Did I miss the memo? DId these grills get a upgrade? Picture a marble.....................GRILL! WTF RIGHT? From that point on I thought it was pure genius. In my head I was thinking, would we ever need to do a grill change? One thing for sure is, the grill is able to handle longer periods of cooking than on a conventional grill. Picture the first order of chadol touching a freshly clean grill, the noticeable but quiet sizzle, and that aroma of smoke that lifts through the air.. I know your getting jealous and wish you were here...A quick breakdown......Chadol, pretty fatty, but all things that come fatty come mighty tasty. Marinated short ribs..yum.Pork belly...disgustingly delicious..Bulgogi....marinade was on the sweet side, damn that sugar. Other stuff on the all you can eat menu include octopus, etc etc etc The sides: salad, apple salad, some other side dishes that I can only tell you I ate from pictures, were all very good. Ask for the fried rice at the end if you still have room. Seriously, now a days, there are so many great kbbq places in K-town, its hard to choose...But again that 2am close factor and the fact that I could have a late dinner with little to no wait time would sway me to come to this place over and over again. Â The service as soon as I walked through the door was absolutely excellent. We waited about 5-10 minutes before getting seated. As my cousin and I were talking, we noticed that there was a empty table and were wondering why we we still standing there gawking at other peoples grills. The hostess later on informs us that we are not being seated in that table because it is right in front of the door and it is crazy cold and windy which could also blow off the fire on the grill. On a damn cold night like this, it was damn nice to know. Tip these waiters/waitresses well because they have to manually clean your grill with magic radish that seems to lift dirt and grime off the grills. I do have a tip for everyone. Come here during odd hours of the day or night.. If you dont, I guarantee you will be waiting a long time to be seated since this is one of the more popular kbbq spots in K-town. People seem to eat here for hours! Wait, was I talking about myself? Time seemed to fly by quickly when your having such a great time."
12/20/2008,3 star rating,"Another kbbq joint added to my list. One down, many more to go. This place was different from all the other kbbq places that I have been to. First the grill used is not your typical kbbq grill. It was more of a big stone grill with a hole on the side tilted towards the hole so that any collective fatty oils from the meats would be flowing out of the pan onto a small tray. Â Second the tables were round. They were way too small because of all the side dishes, condiments, salad, and your plate taking up all the space. I had to stack the salad and we couldn't fit our meat platter on our table! Lastly, the AYCE included squid/octopus and korean style pancakes which was something new that I was introduced to today. Rice not the usually white rice came at the end of the meal and AFTER your done eating all the meat you possibly can. Where the hell is the WHITE RICE?! Â The service was exceptional and so was the chadol (beef brisket). Only knock on the chadol was it was fatty, but still so so good. If you want to try chadol out for the first time, this would be the place to get you hooked! Good luck finding parking here at Serrano Plaza. Just valet your car because this lot looks like it always reaches max capacity + an additional 10 cars blockading the parked cars. $2.00 valet will save you the heartache of trying to find a spot somewhere else. You have to probably wait to get a table here because this place is so small. We waited 30 minutes to get a table for 5. I also learned something new today. Radish + water helps to clean a burnt grill. I thought that was interesting and it worked! The verdict at the end was a 3 star rating for Hae Jang Chon. Honestly if the service had not been exceptional, I might have gave this place a 2 stars."

You can see it driving by.Tip: Ask to have your stone grills cleaned regularly. It's quick and easy. They clean it with raddish and all the black residue scrapes right off right there in front of yoTip: Ask for Kimchi Fried Rice in the end.Bottom Line: Hae Jang Chon is one of the few places that serves Korean BBQ on Stone Marble Grill. It's definitely decent, but not great. Definitely not the best AYCE in Koreatown. At $16.99 it is a pretty good deal, but there are plenty of $16.99 AYCE Korean BBQ's in Koreatown with the same selections of quality meat."
5/6/2010,4 star rating,"I ate here yesterday for the second time. You will not find a better deal anywhere for Korean BBQ that you cook yourself. $16.99 gets you all you can eat. Of the meats to choose from are marinated or unmarinated short ribs, brisket, bbq chicken or pork, thin or thick sliced fresh Canadian pork belly, squid, tripe, etc.. Plus, after you finish the meat they will make you kimchi fried rice at the table. The only thing I had a problem with was the chicken was dark meat and was not trimmed well. It had a lot of fat on it.If your in the area I highly recommend giving it a try for luch or dinner. I said no to being a good place for kids just because you cook things on a hot stone and your kid could get burned if they are acting up."
5/4/2010,4 star rating,"You have no idea how excited I was to try this restaurant. It has been on my list of restaurants to try but for some reason, just never had the opportunity to. There are just too many all you can eat Korean BBQ places within the vicinity of Koreatown. What differentiates one from the other is obviously the quality, service and anything extra that the restaurant can throw in. The brisket, bulgogi and kalbi were all wonderfully tasty. The only meat I did not care for were the pork slices, which you can chose whether you want thin or thick slices. We opted to try out the thin ones because many other places come out with only the thick slab of bacon. What I love at the end of our extremely satisfying meal was the kimchi fried rice. Even though I was stuffed to the point where I couldn't even get up from my seat, I absolutely had to have the kimchi fried rice. It was so good. It was the icing on the cake. To top it off, there was also a piping semi-spicy soup served to us as well. This is a great place for the decent meat, attentive service as well as the awesome fried rice. My only hesitation to give this place 5 stars is the overly salty beansprouts and kimchi that were serve grilled on our stove. In any case, it was still better than many others I have tasted. Valet parking available for $2 right outside the restaurant."
5/4/2010,5 star rating,"If you've ever stepped into K-town in LA you should know that Korean AYCE BBQ is major bullet point right along with froyo and cafes.I've been a regular with AYCE joints since birth, so I know a thing or two.Having been to several Korean AYCE BBQs in Ktown, this is by far my favorite. Â Reasonable price and probably the best quality and experience.The stone cooking surface, fried kimchi, kimchi fried rice, and the fact that they clean your cooking surface with radish shreds is unmatched anywhere else.I recommend this place to everyone I know."
5/2/2010,4 star rating,"one of my favorite korean bbq places in ktown by far. Â manna is great if you're in a group and it's someone's birthday and you want to see them doused with a bottle of champagne. but if you want the down home quality feel of korean bbq, i'd highly recommend hae jang chon. Â be careful of the wait on weekends..it goes upwards of an hour. so if you're starving yourself for korean bbq (as everyone should), get there an hour before you're ready to eat.hae jang chon is known for its pork and i'm not a huge fan of kbbq pork but even i'll admit that its quite tasty. Â the beef is great - the marinated kalbi is so delicious my mouth is watering right now and the unmarinated brisket equally as delicious. Â so thinly sliced that it practically melts in your mouth. Â after my extensive korean bbq research, this definitely hits as one of my top 3 in california (palace bbq in the bay still ranks first). Â i also love how the tables and vents are set up to minimize smoke in the face and burnt char on the meat. great place."
3/4/2012,4 star rating,I used to come here a lot and I still would but Road to Seoul took the place for now. Meat is good but the quality of food and service do not have a constancy. Sometimes it's super good sometimes it's disappointing.
4/5/2012,4 star rating,The service was very attentive and the meat was generally very tasty. Â I would recommend starting with something less fatty and going fattier as you eat so you can sample more variety. Or going in a huge group of 4 and up would be great as well. Â So you'll get to try them all. Â All in all the kim chi pancakes were slightly weak but I think it was edible. Â The best tip would be too monitor the heat on the stove and the meat on it. Â Cause even though the service was attentive you can still end up with some inedible beef due to overcooked items. Â For the price you cannot beat this place for the selection and impeccable service.
5/28/2012,5 star rating,"I usually go to tahoe a couple blocks ago, but my friend and I came here one night after practice. He always come here, and told me to try it, and you don't have to try to convince me to go to kbbqWe showed up and a group of 3 of us had to wait for about 45 minutes, and the second time I came a group of 5 of us had to wait about the same time to be seated. Not too bad, but it is really good so let me tell you right now, it is worth the waitThe food is excellent. The little dishes they have on the table are standard, but the spinach one and the spicy tofu strips are my 2 favorites but the spicy bean sprouts are pretty good too. The meat is your usual kbbq meats (chicken, different cuts of pork, squid, intestines) along with their kimchi fried rice. The one thing that really stuck out to me here is the grill is a stone grill instead of the metal ones like at most kbbq places and they clean it in front of you at the table with radishes between plates which is pretty cool. The meat is well marinated and tastes great, I usually never have a problem with the meat so I can't go much more into it other than saying the meat is very flavorful, and tender. The kimchi rice they tell you is the last thing to order because they cook it on the grill so it gets stuck and they don't let you make more meat after. But it is very good and I highly recommend you save some room at the end to order it because it is just as good as the meat they offerThis is probably my new favorite place to come, but the drive sucks for me coming from la Crescenta, but being in the area or going down their with a group makes it the best choice in the area. It is my new favorite over TahoeThe service here is excellent and is the one thing that makes it top notch. They always have a lot of staff so you don't have to wait around very long for more meat, water, and anything else you need. The staff tries their best to help you cook the food and make sure you get everything you needTop notch food, top notch service, loud but fun atmosphere. I will keep coming back"
1/6/2013,1 star rating,"Tried this place for the first time and it was not good at all. I really don't understand why this place has 4/5 stars and so many reviews. Drunk people must come here and write reviews, or maybe this place was good in the past. I want to give this place two stars because of the service, but the food is no bueno. Â The meat quality is a D-. I've had MUCH better korean bbq (in LA and in Korea) and for a much better price. Korean BBQ makes you and your clothes smell as it is. The quality of the meat was so bad I had to febreeze myself and the room 4 times when I got home. If I was really drunk I might give this place 2 stars."
11/23/2014,5 star rating,"All you can eat BBQ for $21.99! We went on Friday night and this place gets packed fast! Everything is so delicious and the kimchi fried rice they cooked for you at the end is amazing! Service is good, too! Would love to go back!"
12/29/2016,4 star rating,"This place is a little pricier for lunch than I'm used to, but it's still a great deal for AYCE. There was virtually no wait at all, my friends and I waited 3 minutes for a table, then 2 minutes for our meat to come out after we ordered. Our server was out of this world, like there's no way to describe the experience, he just made my friends and I want to be better people.. he was so active and present. Unfortunately, we didn't get his name but he definitely made the experience worth it. What I noticed though, was that servers would come by and help cook your meat for you and dump everything onto the grill. I'm a bit picky with my food so I usually prefer to cook my food myself and I also HATE when my cooked meat touches raw meat on the grill. Whenever our server came by to put another plate of meat onto the grill, I cringed a little when the meat he poured on touched the meat already on the grill. But other than that, the food was pretty good, not AMAZING but definitely above average."

4/18/2010,3 star rating,"We went there last night in search of a different dining experience. Located in a mini-mall with valet parking in Korea Town, the restaurant was busy (which I like) and a quick scan of the clients revealed a mix of about 75% asian (also a good sign) and about 50% students (not such a good sign).The $16.99 buffet was universally ordered so we did the same and what we received was a nice salad and plenty of fatty meats. The meats themselves were pretty bland and chewy and the peanut-type oil with some chili paste (part of the side dishes) made it more palatable.The service was actually excellent with the big ""call"" button summoning immediate help and the end of meal fried rice was not terrible. We even got to experience the Korean version of ""Happy Birthday"" at least 3 times during our meal which was entertaining.Overall there was either too much or too little taste to the food but a bill for two for under $40 meant that it was good value though I would not return."

8/6/2010,2 star rating,"Regardless of the food quality (which was better than average) this place does NOT honor reservations. We made a reservation about a week ahead of time, showed up 15 minutes early and still waited an hour AFTER the original reservation to be seated. Very disrespectful. We will not be returning here."
8/14/2010,4 star rating,"Love this place. Â They have the best bbq beef short ribs and the price is decent. Â It's in a small plaza and parking is limited. Â Lots of tables but when it's crowded, you'll have to wait. Â Minus one star because service can be lackluster at times. Â They forgot to bring my salad once and the other time, they didn't even bring me water until I asked for it.Overall, one of the best korean bbq places and I would come back again. Â I just wish I ate enough to take advantage of their all you can eat."
8/17/2010,5 star rating,"Their food is amazing and their service is off the top!!!!!The servers were so great it made my ""already the best bbq"" taste even better!!! The price 16.99 for all you can eat bbq. There are so many choices you can have!!!!! I would go to this place again and again!!! So worth the drive!!! P.S. I really would like to compliment this one server.. but he was keep hiding his name tag... T_T"
10/14/2010,4 star rating,"A local Korean recommended this place to us. And boy am i grateful, thank you stranger for your great recommendation!The cons of this place: depending on the day and time, the wait can be long, and of course parking is bad during their rush hour. But hey, people know good food when they try it, so you will put up with it!The Pros: Where do i begin? Their briskett is very good, not so fatty like other ayce places. Their bulgogi, and marinated short ribs are delicious.I love the fact that they serve the radish wrap, it makes the food so much tastier. Their kimchi pancake, and egg soup is very good as well.They are one of the only places i've been to that also serves kimchi rice, and boy is it worth the wait. Save some pieces of meat at the end and have it with your rice, it is delicious.Give this place a try you definately will not be dissapointed!"
11/10/2010,4 star rating,AYCE Korean BBQ! Â Very good selection of food and kimchi friend rice! Â We got here early and got seated right away which was a good thing cuz the line got really long as we were there eating.
2/27/2011,5 star rating,Absolutely delicious - no complaints at all. Service was good but food was even better. Some KBBQ places I've been have had more selection of the small plates but honestly all of the meat was so good it didn't matter.
5/12/2011,4 star rating,"I would give this place 4.5 stars bc our service was not so great this time around. We were placed in the forgotten corner, but maybe that is a good thing. Anyway, we loved the octopus, thinly sliced pork belly, brisket, bulgogi, potato salad, pancake, and pretty much everything else we ate. Got there mid afternoon so there was no wait and left at 6pm. Long line started. It was by far the best place to go for mom's day!"
5/31/2011,5 star rating,Holy cow! Â This place is great! Â AYCE for only $16.99!!! Â Meat! Â Meat!! And more meat!!! Â Even the water tastes good. Â Its got barley tea in it. Â We drove to KT from Ventura County to experince this meat fest and it was well worth it!
5/31/2011,4 star rating,"After my disastrous experience at Jinju BBQ (Koreatown as well), I came here with a friend with lowered expectations than the number of stars suggest. Â While heating up the pan is rather slow, the awesomeness of the side dishes like kimchi, potato salad (w/ apples!), fish cakes, pancakes etc more than made it up for the wait. Â We ordered bulgogi both pork and beef, short ribs, chicken and they were all well marinated and tasty, but not overly greasy because of the positioning of the pan (it got a small hole on it that allows the grease to be contained in the aluminum pan). Â The place is rather small and ventilation is so-so, but service is pretty good. Â I would definitely come back to try out other stuff and bring along more people too."
6/3/2011,4 star rating,I call this place Mr. Piggies because of the pig logo for the shop. Â Love this place. Â Service is not so bad. Â They are really buzy but they do okay to keep up with everything. Â I get so stuffed by the end I can't even eat the fried rice.
6/4/2011,4 star rating,"Great selection for ayce bbq which includes brisket, pork belly, short ribs, bulgogi, and squid . Â They make you kim chi fried rice and have a great selection of banchan."
6/22/2011,4 star rating,"Went here for early dinner at probably 5:45 pm with my friends. Luckily there was no line. Yay! We ordered the All You Can Eat (beef bulgogi, galbi, thin pork belly, spicy pork bulgogi). Everything tasted good. I can tell that they have good quality meats, unlike any other AYCE Korean BBQ places in K-town which charge the same price like HaeJangChon but have poor quality meats. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they become so crowded during peak hours that the wait is quite ridiculous. It's probably not their fault for being so popular, yet have limited space. I would suggest them to rent a bigger space to accommodate more customers."
7/23/2011,5 star rating,"Went there for lunch.There's a great selection of meat. Â The grill is a hot stone which is good for dol sot.

9/13/2011,5 star rating,"OMG.yeah this place deserves 5 stars!This is the place where i lost my korean bbq virginity and im proud to have so. many choices from the menu to pick! i think the popular one we ordered the most were the short ribs and the marinated short ribs. but theres also octopus, pork belly etc. as well a large selection of appetizers they bring out that you wont find at other restaurants! like RICE PAPERexcellent customer service. various waiters would come check up on you and see what else youll want. theyll also clean your bbq stove often so you wont have any burnt on your food.came during the weekday around lunch time so got seated right away.definitely a great experience and would most def come back when i visit socal"
9/29/2011,4 star rating,"Nice place, not the best. Service is a little slow but great quality meat. I was really disappointed that they stopped serving intestines(they should really take it off the menu). A little costly here. And a bit crowded too. Overall I'm happy because of the meat, the fried rice at the end was nice too. I'd come back here if I got the chance."
10/12/2011,4 star rating,"this isn't the best place i've been to. but a very good deal for the $16.99 AYCE.this place is probably more popular for it's late night hours and clientele. you might see a celeb or 2 depending on what time and day you visit. the last time i was there Andy Milonakis rolled in with his entourage. i know, not an A-list celeb. heck, not even a B or C list celeb. but if i know his name then he's famous enough.the meats were pretty good. nice selection of meats too. the brisket and bulgogi were average, but the pork belly was pretty good.nice friendly staff. clean. good ventilation. the only thing that could improve it is if they offer ice cream to top off your meal. the parking kinda sucks too. the valet seemed shady but at least nothing was stolen from my car.i'd go here again if i was in the area."
11/10/2011,4 star rating,"Came here with 4 other friends, so 5 people total on a Weds night. There were A LOT of people outside. We wrote our names down at 8, got seated at 8:40p. To pass the time, we went to the bar next door for some pre-drinking. Perfect time wasting.The meat quality was good, ordered a ton of food, more drinks. Service was average compared to some of the other AYCE BBQ places I've been to. We did have to ring the bell a couple times for them to give us more radishes and to get more steamed egg for us, but it wasn't an urgent issue (we still had plenty of food to stuff our stomachs with). Ordered a variety of meat, but the squid really stood out to me. I typically don't like eating squid at KBBQ, but this one was really tasty. Wasn't a fan of most of their side dishes though. The fried rice is really good, and for the price, I can't complain at all. Definitely worth coming here if you're craving meat. I still smell like KBBQ, so try not to get too close to me."

12/29/2011,4 star rating,Now I'm not a professional eater but I've had so much Korean BBQ in the recent years to be able to distinguish the good and the bad. Hae Jang Chon is my go-to Korean BBQ restaurant (all you can eat). My girlfriend and I got stopped going to other all-you-can- eat Korean places when we experienced the difference btw a stone pan and a regular cheap pan. The meat all the sudden has more flavor and less grease perhaps bc waiters always clean the pan for you. The smell doesn't get too overwhelming thanks to the effective ventilation system. You don't always have to go home and shower immediately; you can actually go for a drink afterward. Customer service deserves tips.
1/5/2012,5 star rating,"I brought my friends to Hae Jang Chon and it was their first Korean BBQ experience. It might be a good idea to come early to avoid the line. Anyways, the service was rather pretty good as they would come over to help out with the meat. There were a lot of good choices and my friends and I left feeling more than satisfied. A simple $16.99 menu. Definitely would love to come back."
8/14/2012,4 star rating,"I only gave this place 4/5 star because of the long wait for a table. However, this was the best Korean BBQ I ever had! Did I mention its all you can eat as well? Definitely give this place a try and make sure you go hungry!"
6/15/2014,4 star rating,"if I'm in LA, this is the ayce kbbq place I go to. their service isn't stellar but Koreans aren't known for their customer service skills. the meat is always top quality and the kimchi fried rice at the end is icing on the cake! the stone grill is my husband's favorite part. he says it makes the meat taste better. try to get there early, like 11, cuz in the afternoon they only have valet parking or meter parking available. by that time, there's usually a wait to be seated as well."
8/7/2013,4 star rating,"Solid all you can eat Korean BBQ place. Â Lots of meat options including kalbi, bulgogi, chicken, spicy pork, beef tongue, intestines, shrimp, octopus and probably more.

I took the table just in 15min! the server eric is very kind, he asked for what i need in every 10min. also another server jena(i think she's host) is very nice and kind! i couldnt hear her calling my name so i missed my turn at first time, and i waited my friends who were late. She tried to check me up more than twice and when my friends came, i can seat in right away!! She's ready my table! Also Thanks for candy:) this place is one of high ranking AYCE restaurant in k town!Does not matter lunch or dinner,the price is 17.99per person only for 19 items with fried rice and kimchi pancake and den jang stew!!

2/15/2014,4 star rating,"a place i go regularly with friends... great service and great food... made a reservation with a large group of friends but were running 30 min late. they graciously understood & kept our table till we got there. because our party was large, the very end of the table didn't have a grill that was accessible. instead the owner comes with a small food heater and hot plate so we could cook food from one grill and transfer it to the hot plate for those that couldn't reach to the grill. WHAT SERVICE!!! side dishes are plentiful & refilled without being asked... will be going there again soon!"
5/19/2015,2 star rating,"I've been here twice now. The first time was a fantastic experience. I consider this place a good, reasonably priced, decent-serviced Korean BBQ restaurant. However, the second time I went, almost a year and a half later (December 2014) I got food poisoning. It lasted 24 hours. I reported this to the health department, and after the inspection they weren't able to tell me what it could've been. It might've been one of the sides, since my side of the table (party of 8) had 2 different sets of sides given. Toward the end of the dinner, my kimchi was refilled and I was the only one who ate it, and the only one who ended up sick. I thought it could've also been some kind of cross contamination since the rare meat is scooped with the same set of tongs used to cook, but the inspector said that would be unlikely. I'd imagine food poisoning would be common at Korean BBQs if that was the case. No idea what happened, but beware!"
7/8/2012,4 star rating,"Thought this place was pretty decent for AYCE. My favorite meat was the brisket, by far. Thinly sliced and yummy. There was a nice little selection of banchan.I like how they clean the grill with the daikon radish. It's very fast and and efficient. We saved room for the kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal, after reading all the glowing reviews for it on Yelp. Not sure what all the hype was about. Really not that flavorful and just seemed like filler to me. We arrived early at lunch time on a Saturday so it wasn't crowded at all, yet. We were a party of 6 but two of our members hadn't arrived. They still made us wait for our friends before sitting down, even though there were tons of empty tables. Seemed kind've silly to me. Overall I felt like it was good value for what we paid."
5/14/2013,1 star rating,"Not only do they have B rating on their front door and are quite empty inside, but they rip you off hard. They kept adding on rules not specified in the menu after we've already ordered and added lots of fees. We expected to pay $18 to $24 each based on the prices in the menu... but when the bill came they charged us $30 each. Then after we paid, they have the nerve to ask for tip after including outrageously high gratitudy for just 2 people in a nearly empty restaurant. These people are not honest about their prices and the food was mediocre. Go anywhere else but here for Korean BBQ"
3/14/2014,4 star rating,Cooking on the stone grill is really fun and they make fry rice at the end. Great BBQ place!!
9/29/2012,4 star rating,I took 4.... 17 year old guys to an early dinner tonight and I wasn't sure what to expect.One of my son's had been to Korea last year and I wanted authentic. He liked it! And his friends LOVED it. I liked it too. Good service...good food...good price...easy location. Â We are lucky to have so many good and affordable places to eat in L.A.
8/16/2014,4 star rating,"First time eating at this place today.The place is very is very clean and nice. The problem is that it is very hard to find a parking spot because its so crowed, other than that; everything is very good. Loved the kimchi pancake, the squid, octupus, pork belly, the side dishes, and the bowl of vegetables. ^_^ I would recommend this place to my friends."
8/16/2014,2 star rating,Would have rated it higher in the past but going downhill. This last visit the staff was rude and trying to rush us out the door. KBBQ is not a 30 min or even 60 minute meal. It is a communal process which this place seems to have forgotten. Mid range pricing for 9.99 AYCE atmosphere and quality.
1/21/2014,5 star rating,best ayce place hands down!! for a set price you can get over 18/19 things! i like that octopus and squid were on the menu! and kim chi fried rice!! amaze balls. would def recommend this place to anyone looking for an ayce bbq
1/12/2010,3 star rating,"Food: delicious array of meats with salad, four sauces, and many banchanService: less than delicious, had to ask for multiple items, multiple times even though we went early and their was plenty of idle staffPrice: all you can eat for less than $20, reasonable enough for me to return someday"
11/23/2010,2 star rating,one word: MSG.i always feel like ass eating here. o daeson is much better..they quality of meat is way supurb!i just dont care for this place. from one korean to another or an aspiring one.. skip this one and head somewhere else.
1/24/2011,5 star rating,"BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT KOREAN BBQ EVER!I kind of wanted to just end with just that but I feel like I need to write a little more since I've been to this place about 20 times already.It is a little more pricey then the average 10 dollar AYCE KBBQ places but its well worth it. The quality of meat is just amazing and their selection is awesome. I love the marinated beef the most and their sides are delicious also. I plan to keep coming back to this place basically forever. The only issue I have with this place is the wait is retarded during dinner time so I suggest you stay hungry until like 9 or 10 and the place starts to die down. You get the best service after it dies down anyways. Give it a try you won't be disappointed. Oh and BTW you don't have to be Korean to get great service here, they actually serve everybody"
4/7/2011,4 star rating,"Now one of my favorite AYCE korean bbq places along with road to seoul! For $16.99 its all you can eat bbq with a decent amount of side dishes along with bean paste soup, steamed eggs, kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice at the end!! One thing I noticed about this place is that they use stone plate grills instead of metal grills like many other places and they clean it really quick with radish. The beef brisket and beef tongue are really good quality and are my favorites. They also have squid, marinated and unmarinated short rib, pork, chicken, hot dog, and more!! The service here is really good! Our servers were really nice and replaced any side dishes and meat if we needed it without having to ask. Overall this place is great for AYCE korean bbq with a good selection of bbq. Highly recommended!!!"
4/15/2011,5 star rating,"i love this place. it's open up to 2am and their AYCE (All You Can Eat) is sooo good. worth the value!we came here at around 10:30pm on a sunday night and it was packed. we had to wait 15-20mins to be seated but it was worth it. their salad was good. i don't know what kind of vinaigrette they put on it but it was tasty. they also give you different sauces (ranging from pickled to spicy), an egg soup, potato salad and other side dishes like radish and sprouts. my bf wanted to try the beef tongue but i wasn't feeling adventurous that night. our server did say that we should try it because it's good. perhaps next time. :)btw, there were times that our next round of meat took a long time until they were brought to us. (i suppose it was because they were really busy). at the end of your meal, they -will- cook kimchi friend rice for you so just a heads up! save some space for that."
6/29/2011,4 star rating,"I've been to a couple of korean bbq's and this is one of the better ones. Â Here's why I like it:1. Good price2. Good quality and selection of meats (squid too)3. The ban-chan is good4. Friendly serviceHere are some things I don't like:1. The one hour wait2. Valet parking costMost of the bad stuff can't be helped. Â But then thats why I gave it 4 instead of 5.I like the brisket and pork belly, the pork shoulder not so much (a little tough and chewy, but then its shoulder).All in all a great place."
7/6/2011,3 star rating,"I went during the daytime and ate here without drinking soju. Â For some reason, the meat didn't taste as good as before...lol"
1/30/2011,4 star rating,"This is a great place for K BBQ in LA. Â The value for price is outstanding, and the quality of meats is excellent.Like others have said, the wait is looooong. Â We signed up on the waiting list and then went to the cafe in the same minimall to pass time for an hour or so."
8/1/2011,4 star rating,MAKE A RESERVATION!!! My boyfriend and I ate here on a Saturday night and waited an hour and a half for a table. Once we were seated everything was great. We got the all you can eat menu for $16.99 each which was WAY more food than anyone could need. And it was all delicious! The atmosphere was cool and all the servers were very nice and helpful. I would absolutely eat here again. Of course with a reservation next time.
10/10/2011,5 star rating,"People here were not kidding when they said there were long lines. Â Luckily, we had made reservations and were seated within 30 minutes. Â We ate like pigs. Â Everyone enjoyed the food. Â We were so stuffed that we passed on the kim chee rice. Â We tried Galbi, Bulgogi, Brisket, Chicken, Squid, Beef Tongue and thin Pork Belly. Â Everything was good. Â Was about $24 per person including soda, tax and tip.We would definitely recommend this place."
12/2/2011,3 star rating,Very good but not necessarily worth the long wait with so many other good options nearby.
12/11/2011,1 star rating,"Too bad nothing I can say here can erase the memory of this place out of my mind. This has got to be by far one of the worst Korean places I've been to eat at. I think it's turned me off of trying any other Korean restaurant Â in general.First of all, with a 45 minute wait to be seated for a party of two, you'd think that they'd have good food....WRONG.! Ordered the 16.99 AYCE of bulgogi, galbi, brisket, and chicken, and unfortunately NOT ONE PIECE of the 4 meats we ordered had any flavor to them whatsoever. The sauces they provided didn't even help salvage the meats' bland flavor.The service was horrible, not uncommon to some of these busy restaurants, but they couldn't even bother to refill our waters when asked, they just dumped a pitcher of water at the table then walked away. There were some things that I didn't think were too horrible though. I liked how they had food already set at the table before we were seated. The salad and fishcake were okay (I liked the spicy kick to the fishcake), but nothing special to make me want to ever reconsider giving this place another chance.Overall, there's no way I'd ever come back to this place."
12/27/2011,5 star rating,"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in LA! Â My friends and I would come here almost every month. Â Quality of meat is good, service is quick, and you just can't beat the kimchi fried rice at the end of the meal. Â Try to come before 6:30pm, otherwise the wait will be about 45 min."
2/27/2012,5 star rating,"Excellent food & service. Â I especially like beef tongue, squid & pork belly in thin slices. Â They'll keep on refilling the side dishes & sauces even without asking. Â They'd frequently checked on us & cleaned the stove. Â The vent was working pretty well. Â Make sure to leave some room for fried rice & soup. Â It's totally worth it even if we have to drive a bit here."
11/19/2013,1 star rating,"Food is nothing great, service is slow. Â Came with a party of 20, you can tell the servers were talking shÂ°t about us. Â Took forever to get a refill on the meats or to even get a glass of water. Â Mind you, they weren't even busy that time!"
12/25/2013,5 star rating,"great service!!! Â could be taken as overbearing by some, but i certainly appreciate it. Â the staff is tentative and friendly and the food is yummy and plentiful. Â best all you can eat kbbq there is in mid-city."
3/11/2013,3 star rating,"Well it was worth a try. The service was really good, I like how they kept coming by to cook and cut the meat for you. The biggest reason why I didn't like this place was because of the grill. It's a stone grill with a tiny hole on the side for the oil to drip down which isn't very effective versus a metal grill. So because of that, food was super greasy. All the fat melted and soaked up into the meat again, and then into your mouth. Imagine that. The waiter that cooked for us used a piece of meat to push all the oil down the hole and then tossed that same piece of meat back into the pile to cook. I guess all the pieces are greasy anyway but I didn't want to eat the one used to push and scrape the fat. Right?! I usually don't order the bean paste soup because I'm not a fan but it was really good here. Â The steamed egg was not as good. I didn't like the kimchi either and the short ribs were too sweet. I like tongue and I order it at Korean bbq all the time but the one here tasted dirty. What has this cow been licking? And they gave us so much of it. So out of everything, I would say order brisket and bean paste soup. I would not come back, the grease was just too much."
4/30/2014,5 star rating,"One of the best Korean BBQ places I've been to. Â  I've been coming here for years - the food is delicious, service is on point, and rarely have I seen an owner helping around the restaurant"
1/8/2014,5 star rating,"This k BBQ is the best I've had in ktown! There's always a wait, but u might Â be luckier if u come around 4 on a weekday evening. Get their squid, it's DELICIOUS!!! I'll definitely go back!"
2/12/2008,3 star rating,"This place is the real deal. Â I swear I'm back in Seoul when I come to this place. Â The chadol (beef brisket) is absolutely awesome here...just the right amount of fat and meat on it. Â And the condiments are first-rate. Â They give you both the dukbohssam (rice wrapping) and the radish wrapping, as well as four dipping sauces. Â Plus the kimchi pancake. Â And the fried kimchi on the skillet. Â And the kimchi fried rice at the end. Â Plus the refreshing, cold radish soup. Â And their denjang soup is pretty good, too. Â Seriously, this place rocks.Two downsides....first, the hot stone skillet they use cooks the meat nice and crispy, but it doesn't drain all that well. Â You end up getting splattered if you're not careful. Â The ventilation isn't all that great either. Â Second, the wait on Fridays and Saturdays can get CRAZY. Â If you get there after 7:30 pm, be prepared to wait. Â But hey, you know its good when you see korean people young and old standing outside waiting their turn to get in. Â Its worth it."
11/25/2008,5 star rating,"The BBQ here is one of the best, but not the best. The reason for this is; as an AYCE place there really aren't many selections. The meat choices are simple Cha Dol, Galbi, and Sam Gyup Sal.I do have to say the quality of their meat is very high, along with their kimchi that is cut in front of you on your pan. Another thing they are known for is their fried rice at the very end. The fried rice itself is one of a kind, and the whole experience would not be complete without it.All in all I urge anyone, who has not been here to come. You will not be disappointed."
3/3/2009,5 star rating,I've been to more than 30 Â Korean BBQ restaurants in Ktown and this is my favorite one ( next to chosungalbi). Â The meat is fresh.. its clean and I love the rice they make at the end!!
9/18/2010,4 star rating,"great bbq, great kim chi fried rice hmmmm....long wait on weekend,rsvp s not really gonna help"
10/28/2010,4 star rating,Thanks to the yelpers for this recommendation. We ate there last night and the food was delicious. Â The service was excellent! Â It was one of the best service experious. Â Courtious and smiley and not pushy. Â They kept coming to clean the grill so our meat was never burnt. Â The suction power was great so it was not like Star BBQ. Â We could actually see others! Â We were never without meat or food. Â It's AYCE for $16.99. Â I would definitely come back.
5/18/2011,5 star rating,"Great place, I went there twice. once with my boyfriend and once with some of my coworkers. Both times we waited for about an hour, but it's totally worth it. The AYCE is great, with 19 items you can choose from. Each time you can only order 4 items (bc the waiters dont write them down, so you order too much, they forget) and in between the BBQ, the waiter comes around and cleans your grill. Sometimes you do have to remind them more often, since they are too busy. This place is packed with people. The korean pancake is the best! So is everything else."
6/7/2011,5 star rating,1of best service at LA. Â  Â Thanks for last nite Tony

12/29/2011,4 star rating,"Best all you can eat Korean BBQ. Not only meats. Kimchi fried rice will come up at the end, taste so good.Better to go earlier before 6:00pm otherwise wait time is around 2 hours or even longer. Services is just ok not friendly enough, maybe they are too busy, that is what I think."
3/13/2012,4 star rating,"I must say i love this place! OKAY Â so yea the wait is hell. If your with a group of friends its well worth it. I always come here with my girl friends and were their for over 2 hours. yea i know ""hey its all you can eat"" lol. Few things if you like all your meat marinated,make sure to tell your waiter! The house salad is awesome!!!! I love the the brisket,bulgogi and chicken. Â The short ribs are good but a little tuff! A few shots of soju ! overall once again love this place!"
4/28/2012,4 star rating,"I've been to this place twice and they have been very good both times. It is a little difficult when they are busy to get a table when you want, especially if your friends are late. If your whole party is not there yet, they won't seat you. That probably is my only complaint about the place. The thing that sticks out most for me is that instead of being a grill plate that sits on top of a gas stove, this place has what seems to be a stone or aluminum surface where everything cooks. So your meats feel more like they are fried and less like they are grilled. It does have a nifty system for draining the oils.The menu is a served up on a light box and easy to order from. Most of your orders are fulfilled promptly. The wait staff, once you sit down, are very nice. The soju was brought out very promptly and we enjoyed many bottles without much issue. The makkoli, is still my worst enemy. But we had to do it since we had out of town guests again and they never had makkoli. The marinated meats were up to par with most of the places I've been to. We didn't spend too much time eating the un-marinated stuff. I was hoping to get some chiterlings there but they don't have that on the menu. Water was refilled on a timely manner, even when the restaurant was busy. I would go back again if given the opportunity. Though I think you can get more selection for the prices you pay for AYCE at this place at other places within walking distance."
7/6/2013,1 star rating,"Very bad service today plus the meat was not great. WAs told to split tables for a party of 8 or else had to wait much longer. While waiting for the second table, a large table opened up so asked if we can sit there instead in the same table. They told us we can't cause it was reserved for another party of 8. Then only 5 people sits down at that table. Wtf!"
4/7/2014,5 star rating,"Service here is impeccable. They were attentive and friendly. With that note, food was great. The hour wait was worth it. Valet for $2 was great , especially in LA."
7/6/2014,2 star rating,"Second time to eat hereãSame food, worse experience. They have to much service trying to let you finish everything in 40minutes. I want to say that I am here to enjoy the meat, I do not want to eat like a refugee. My mouth and teeth are super tired after eat there for 40 minutes. Never stopped since we entered there. I will find another BBQ restaurant to eat Korean BBQ in the future."
11/2/2013,5 star rating,love this ayce place!!! the meat is so good! only complaint is - be prepared to wait if you go at peak weekend dinner times!!!
3/25/2014,5 star rating,great service and food! i dont mind driving from long beach to la and dealing with traffic just to come eat here.
9/3/2013,5 star rating,"One of my all time favorite Korean BBQ restaurants. Love the banchan, quality of the meat, service, and kimchi fried rice! The only thing I dislike is the wait... This is definitely THE place to go for AYCE KBBQ in Ktown."
7/13/2009,3 star rating,"I went here cuz I wanted Korean BBQ but it was already 11 and Manna was about to close soon. This place is opened til 2am, which gave us a lot of time to eat and enjoy the Korean food.The meats taste a lot like the other Korean places in Korea Town, but the grill was definitely different. I liked that the grill was slightly tilted and it was a stone plate. There weren't as many side dishes as other Korean BBQs that I've been to. The service was pretty bad. If you're sitting inside the restaurant, there isn't a button to call for a waiter. We ordered beef briskest and marinated ribs, and they brought us a plate with those two types of meat and beef tongues. Luckily I asked which meats were which before digging in. There's a charge for left over meat, so I'm glad I asked. No way I would have been able to finish the beef tongues. I guess being the first restaurant I've seen have this, was a huge shock to me. All in all, the food was good, the service was bad. Make sure you double check your order or you'll end up with meats you never order and can't finish."
12/21/2010,2 star rating,"After all of the reviews and hype about this place, I really wanted to check it out. I've been eating Korean BBQ all my life and tried many AYCE BBQ in koreatown. I have to say that I was disappointed at the food and the service. First, the stone grill did not really add any more flavor to the meat. The short rib we ordered tasted like the meat I would cook on a pan at home. Second, we found a bug in the lettuce and was soooo close to eating it before my friend pointed it out. That totally turned off my appetite. Third, I noticed that when you order the beef brisket again, they'll bring the cheaper kind that was previously frozen and not the black angus they advertise. It was definitely tougher and dry. Lastly, they took at least 10 mins to bring the meat everytime we ordered. I have a feeling they might do that to get you full faster. Who knows. Anyways, I won't be going back since there are better places in ktown."
1/2/2011,1 star rating,"WORST PLACE EVER. The quality of the meat was so bad to the point we couldn't even chew it. So we asked for something new and they said we had to finish the plate first in order to get a new plate of meat... The waiters were also very rude especially the tall pale guy that works there. We asked him for water and he didn't even respond back (which we never got that water). When he brought a plate of meat, he threw it on our table and walked away without even placing any of it on the grill. So many times we called for assistance for service we were ignored.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."
4/21/2011,4 star rating,"I came here for 3 times for dinner. Â Its very nice atmosphere. Â The food was great! theres alot of choices of meat but not so much on seafood. Just squid. Â Decent price. Â The staff are friendly and accommodating. Â All in all a great place to have friends pig out on grilled meat. I wish they could have more selection on seafood , like fish and shrimp and mussels. Â That would be excellent! Â My suggestions is to make reservations before you go coz they do get packed and sumtimes they have long waits."
8/30/2011,3 star rating,"LONG LONG LONG WAIT, i had been waiting in line for more than 1.5 hours, that's not that bad for a Friday nite.....but that's not the reason I gave them a 3 star, the thing is instead of calling the party according to the order they signed up, they just called up random party ...that really pissed me off....other than that, Â the food there are pretty good, most side dishes are good except for the kimchibtw, we got food poisoning after that, and my bf went to ER the next day"
1/7/2012,4 star rating,"Good Korean BBQ that is ayce. Thank you Yelpsters. Come here hungry or its not worth it. The oly complaint was the seating in which we were place next to the door, not a big deal given how full the place was."
1/12/2012,5 star rating,"Definitely my favorite AYCE BBQ! Friendly service. Clean restaurant. Great selection of meats. The sides dishes are yummy and always taste fresh. The only con I could come up with is the wait. I've been coming here for over a year now and it's been getting super busy lately. Sometimes we head over and I'm super hungry and don't really want to wait an hour so we try other places. Never as good. So! Don't show up super hungry, plan ahead and time it when you will be hungry in 30 minutes. ohh yahh parking is hit or a miss. I have pretty good luck finding street parking but sometimes I have to drive around the block ones or twice."
4/25/2012,4 star rating,"I absolutely ADORE this restaurant. Â Say it loud, say it fast three times. Â Get your tongue tied. Â Hae Jang Chong is amazingly delicious! Â The wait is so totally worth it. Â The wait IS incredibly long, which is why they did not get my full 5 stars. Â However, if you reserve ahead of time you will only wait 45 minutes instead of 2 hours, yay! Â Beef brisket is amazing. Â Love the raspberry wine. Â And last but not least all of the kimchee sides are yummy. Â  Try the kimchee pancake, spicy, sweet and of course fried. Â See you at the Chon."
3/12/2016,4 star rating,"I rarely go to Korean bbq restaurants. The very few times that I've gone, none of the restaurants have really stood out to me. We came here for my bf's bday. They don't seat unless ALL members of your party are present. We arrived at the restaurant at about 8 and didn't get seated til 9:15 ish. The restaurant isn't very big and the tables are small and are close to each other. There is a bar in the same plaza so we got drinks there until our table was ready. Parking is pretty bad. You can either drive around and find parking or get valet ($2) across the street. When we got seated, you are allowed to order 3 meats at a time. Its $24 for all you can eat. Since I don't eat red meat, I only tried the chicken, veggies and shrimp. They were all very good. The BBQ CHICKEN was very tender and juicy. The sides were also good. Service was pretty good. They are very fast and help you cook the meats."
10/7/2013,4 star rating,delicious! just be prepared for a long line that and the difficulty finding parking so valet is a must here.

7/1/2011,4 star rating,"this KBBQ place is great! They have an unusual grill that is a round stone so the flavor really sticks to the meat as oppose to standard grills. It can be a mad house in there but this place is well worth the hassles of ktown. They also fry their kimchi, which i have never seen before adding a great spin on it. Awesome place to take a bunch of friends or family who have never experienced kbbq. This place will absolutely make them like kbbq! Don't be afraid of the piggy when you get there!!!"

5/16/2012,3 star rating,Used to be my favorite Korean BBQ. Now it's over crowded all the time. 2 hrs waiting line. No reservations.
6/6/2012,5 star rating,"5 stars! Hands down one of, IF NOT, the BEST Korean bbq restaurant in SoCal. I've been to quite a few KBBQ restaurants, but this one is without a doubt my favorite. $17.99 all you can eat! I know there are some that are $10 but Mr. Lee's and Castle bbq? I've been to both and its good.. for $10.Hae Jang Chon has the best quality meat I've had from all the KBBQ joints I've been to. Â Service is mostly great, just ring your buzzer and they get to you in a short amount of time. Although I do admit my first visit here I had some lady serving my friends and I and that almost lost our interest in the restaurant about to give negative reviews, but once we got our food we had no other choice but to come back another time to give it another chance. Unfortunately the lady still works there but thank God we never got her as our waitress again. Other than that the staff is great! Price is more than good enough for the quality of meat they serve. If you've ever been to Shik do Rak, think their quality of meat.. but ALL YOU CAN EAT! Shik do Rak is delicious but far too pricey. Strongly recommend Hae Jang Chon to anyone looking for some great Korean BBQ!Another thing and LAST thing I would like to add is heads up for the wait! Anytime after 4-5pm the place will get PACKED almost every single time and waits can last to 30min - an hour of waiting time depending on your party size. If you're looking to eat right away I suggest arriving before 4 or 5 pm otherwise prepare for a long wait."
7/11/2011,4 star rating,"I think I came here at least twice in the past month. I love coming to this place for a good fix of AYCE Korean BBQ. For $16.99 you get all the meat your little heart and stomach desire and I have a big big desire for meat. The quality of meat is real decent for AYCE. The brisket is good and you have a choice of thick or thin pork belly. Also, all the tongue, bulgogi, and galbi you can eat. This is all cooked on a stone grill and they also clean the grill with radish. Not sure if it's a big thing but it is to me because I've never seen my grill cleaned off with radish. I eat the radish not use it for cleaning. I thought it was a pretty cool cleaning presentation. The usual banchan were present and were good as well. At the end of the meal we ordered the kimchi fried rice. The kimchi fried rice was really good. It was spicy, had kimchi, seaweed, sesame oil, and there was a little layer of crispiness on the rice from sitting on the grill. There's always exceptional service when I come here. Service is quick and friendly. There is always a wait and I definitely suggest making reservations. There is valet parking available but I hate valet so I park on the street. I will definitely be back for more."
5/3/2011,2 star rating,"The quality of the food is pretty good, the service is just piss poor. Â We ate there at 5pm on a Sunday. Â It was 40% occupied. Â The servers were all standing around talking, not really in tune with the customers. Â There was a table seated next to us and they had a small kid, maybe 4-6 years old and the server was grilling the parents, ""how old is she??!!"" Â I mean real aggressive dude and then a women came by, maybe a manager and asked the kid how old she was and the little kid threw up 4 fingers. Â I looked down at the menu and read kids 8 and younger are charged $8.99, so WTF, this kid was not in a carrier, not rocking a bottle or a titty in her mouth so the inquisition was kinda fucked up, she was under 8 fo sho'. Anyways back to the shitty service, yeah I almost blew up the bell on the table, the homies never acknowledged and again it was NOT even busy there. Â Bottom line, price is right, food is good (if they ever come by), service sucks massive ballsacks. Â Another thing the homies that work there never smile, training? Â Smoke in the eyes? We not return for sure, too many other places to try out."
2/9/2014,1 star rating,"The food was great!!! But the servers were terrible in comprehensive!!! I only eat pork, chicken and seafoods... But the rest of my friends at the table eats beef... I told the servers 10x not to mix the beef and pork together because I don't eat beef... But for the nth time they keep on mixing our food!!! They said 10 sorries but still doing the same... I will never go back to this place at all!!! They should be sensitive enough!!!"
10/1/2012,3 star rating,"Meat and the side dishes were decent here, nothing special about it. We got the brisket, bulgogi, squid, rib meat, beef tongue, and the pork belly. Pork belly sucked, so don't get it! Â Service was decent as well, but we had to ask for water 3 times. The best part of the meal was the kimchi fried rice at the end! It was delicious because we were all tired of eating the meat. For what you pay for, it's on par to other AYCE places like Road to Seoul."
7/23/2013,3 star rating,"The meats are delicious and the sides fantastic. I found the service to be a little standoffish and we got the vibe that the servers were not enjoying their job, which I don't blame them for, but it was a bit of a moodkiller. For me, I'd rather go to a regular Korean restaurant than a BBQ one just because I feel like you get better bang for your buck, but this place is really delicious nonetheless. We really enjoyed the kimchi fried rice and the kimchi pancake. YUM."
1/10/2010,4 star rating,"hmm where do i begin? Â the AYCE korean bbq is really good! Â They prepped the table for us with all the banchan and everything ready for us except for the MEAT! Â They only allow you to order 4 items first, and then as you keep eating you can order more. Â Their selection for ayce is pretty good. Â They have things like beef honeycomb and hot dogs? Â I have never seen hot dogs at a korean bbq joint, and was tempted to try it thinking it was going to a different kind of hot dog then the ones we normally eat, but i guess ill never know. Â we didn't order it, and Â i looked around at other tables and no one ordered it. Â Now the beef honeycomb is not beef with honeycomb marinade like i thought. Â apparently its some sort of beef intestine? Â haha. Â All the meat we ordered was good... chicken, galbi, tongue, and bulgogi! Â I wish i had more room in my tummy to try more items esp the squid, but i was so full we didn't Â even get to the kimchi fried rice! =( Â oh well, next time! Â This is a great spot for korean bbq. Â It was Caren C.'s birthday so they played this very loud, very interesting ""happy birthssday"" song and took a group photo for us. Â haha it was pretty funny because the song is just a little bit embarrassing! Â The nice part is they gave her a framed photo of our group for her! Â This is a great place if you have a big group. Â They really take good care of you and the food is pretty delish too!"
11/29/2013,4 star rating,"Hae Jang Chon is definitely a cut above the rest of the AYCE places I've been to in the Ktown area. They have great service and great food but don't expect to be as blown away by the quality of meat as non AYCE places such as Kang Hodong, Genwa, Park's, and etc. If you want quantity over quality but where quality is not sacrificed like alot of AYCE places then this is the place to be. The late night hours are definitely a plus too."

9/10/2012,2 star rating,"This place is overrated. It wasn't all it's hyped up to be, I love kbbq so of course seeing the reviews I had to try this place. I went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait so I didn't deal with these ridiculous 2+ hour waits. I would not wait that long for this place. The service was okay nothing special. It was my first time here with my gf and we were hoping to get more information instead we were handed the menu and the waiter wandered off. Oddily, towards the end of ths meal we were finally given our salad, i was wondering where it was. When we were seated and the banchan was brought out I was quite excited to see how good they looked. The taste on the other hand, was below-par. I am a Kim Chi freakkkk, I love it but this Kim Chi was sooo sour and unpleasant. It had a taste like rotten lemons, also the bean sprouts, my gf typically loves this dish but here it had a very off, sort of plastic taste? At other kbbq places we inhale these, here we hardly touched them. Now the meats, the beef and brisket were okay, nothing special...the short ribs are usually one of my favorites but here they were tough and chewy. The octopus was very very tough and rubbery. Although, the squid was very pleasant it was marinated nicely and tasted great off the grill. Also the grill!!! I'm not a fan of a grill where the fat doesn't drip away, this makes the meat boil in its own fat rather then have it a nice char on it. I've had kbbq all over k-town but I would say this restuarant is in the back of my list, and I doubt I'll ever go again. Sad to say this but, there is some $9.99 places I consider better. Sure, the service isn't going to be as good, but this place's max cap. is only 49 people!?! Why? Ithas much more room then that. Also, there were a couple of open tables without chairs, do they not want more business? I dont get it. Back to my point I believe in overall taste, other kbbq spots are much better. Don't wait hours for this place it's not worth it!!! I don't see what the deal of this place is either, it may offer more, but the overall taste is simply not there."
10/12/2013,1 star rating,"The worst Korean BBQ restaurant I have been to! First, the meat was of very poor quality. This was evident from the smell, texture, and the stomach pain I went through shortly after my meal. Second, the meat had no flavor! They don't marinate their meat! It tasted very bland. Lastly, the service was even worse than the food. We got a very rude waitress, which left me no choice but to complain to the manager. I'm never going back to this place. Please save yourself the stomach ache and avoid this place."
9/23/2009,4 star rating,"ok i just went back on monday for a special dinner w/ boyfriend and was NOT impressed by the service. dduk, salad and waters were never refilled. we had to keep asking for things. they'd randomly stop by and stir our meat for no good reason just to look like they were helping out. they wouldnt even flip it, just meh-ly move it around. i HIGHLY recommend the thinly sliced pork belly and chadobaegi (sp?) -- sooo good. some of the best ive eaten. and their banchan has gotten better, in my opinion. so still 4 stars and im going to account the shoddy service to an off night."
8/30/2009,4 star rating,"went here for dinner the other night and have decided this is my new favorite kbbq joint in koreatown. first off, i know for a fact that certain places do treat non-koreans but especially non-asians differently. not necessarily poorly, but differently. Â this isn't true of all places, but it is true of some. and it makes sense. the language barrier is difficult to overcome and a server can smile all day at the patrons but good service is often characterized by servers/waiters who will speak with you and chat about the food you are devouring happily. hae jang chon is full of servers who will speak with you. who will make jokes with you and answer your questions. in english. fluently. for us non-koreans, this is nice. a place that can have amazing food and still offer a pleasant experience is far superior to a place that has amazing food but you leave feeling like you really didn't belong there in the first place. service is friendly, quick, efficient. waters are refilled before you have to ask. the grill is automatically cleaned when you've gone through about 3 rounds of meat. (the cleaning is efficiently accomplished by using daikon and water - it's so cool to watch.) and dduk? they load you up with dduk. you don't have to beg them for extra dduk. they dont give you dirty looks when your dduk empties out. they HEAP that stuff on your plate. it's fantastic! and they provide this daikon wrap as well that you can use as an alternative to the dduk. it's delicious and crunch and goes perfectly with the meat. so let's talk meat quality. im all about soft, tender meat. but the softer and more tender the meat, generally the fattier it will tend to be. the stone grills at hae jang chon are, as my boyfriend put it, the george foremans of kbbq. they have this little hole that allows the fat to drip out of the grill so that you're not eating 2490 pounds of fatty fattiness. it's genius! and the meat itself is delicious. they have a fairly decent variety and i LOVED their chadobagi. some of the best ive eaten in a while. panchan selection was a little lacking but they made up for it by having delicious puchinge, which theyd cut up for you and put on the grill so it was crispy and warm. perfection. finally, as other reviewers have mentioned, they do make fried rice for you at the end. it's a nice touch but it was a little oily for my taste. honestly the only reason they got four stars instead of five is because of the cramped placement of the tables and the utter lack of ventilation. fix these minor things and honestly, hae jang chon will be one of the best restaurants in LA. great service, great food, good prices, and a warm, welcoming vibe. warning: because this place is so small, it may not be the best for large groups. they do have an outdoor patio seating area, but i dont think it can fit too many people at one table."
6/22/2010,3 star rating,"Took my daddy here for Father's Day. Â The quality of meat is ok...not great. We ordered the Kalbi, brisket, tongue, honeycomb, squid and octopus. Â The Kalbi wasn't very flavorful and was fatty...they didn't trim the fat off very well. Â The other meats were decent...I don't think the stone grill really brought out the flavors of the meat like other grills I've used before, however I do give them credit for being unique in comparison to the other Korean BBQ places around. Â They are the only one I know of that use a stome grill. Â The sides are what made my meal. Â I really enjoyed the large variety of sides especially the Kimchi pancakes, fishcake, spinach and the kimchi fried rice (cooked on table side on the stone). Â I also really enjoyed their version of ""water."" Â The ""water"" is actually a tea...I think the lady said it was a rice tea. Â Don't forget to stop by the register to pick up your Korean melon gum stick! Â Also, it wasn't that busy during lunch time, but I hear it gets REALLY busy during dinner and late night (they are open until 2am)."

2/3/2007,3 star rating,I visited my friend at work and we stopped by this place for lunch. Â Not bad. Â I had their dongchimi gookso (cold noodles).

2/13/2012,5 star rating,"My FAVORITE korean bbq in LA... potentially anywhere. The price is about the same as most Korean bbq places with the same selections, but the the difference is in the quality of meats. My second time coming here was yesterday, and we had only one order of kalbi, bulgogi, beef tongue, and thick pork belly before ko-ing... the portions they gave us were huge! My absolute favorite was beef tongue -- it paired so well with the 4 dipping sauces they gave us (which were EXCELLENT btw). The bulgogi was so well marinated that it didn't even need to be flavored with sauces/pepper paste and so tender! I didn't get to see them clean the grill with radish since we didn't order enough *sniff*. We were actually too full to even eat the kimchi rice... but I had it the first time I went and loved how they stir-fried it right on the same grill! The kimchi pancake was also great after letting it heat up/get crunchy on the grill in between bites of delicious beef tongue. All in all, it may seem like a standard Korean bbq place based on the selection, price, etc but sometimes the best parts of a restaurant can't be described by words :'] Choose hae jang chon if you're craving Korean bbq!"
10/21/2013,2 star rating,"Not high quality meats. Spicy pork almost all fat & bulgogi was chewy. Lackadaisical service. Decent sides, lots of food, but I suggest going elsewhere, better options nearby."
7/29/2012,1 star rating,"I visited this place twice. Â First time, I ordered from the menu. Â Second time, I tried AYCE. Â The wait was too long. Â The quality of meat is nothing special. Â Very noisy inside. Â The 2nd serving size for ayce was so small, we had to oder several times and each order took long time. Â Everyone I went with said that it was worst KBBQ place and I agree."
1/1/2013,4 star rating,"The food and the people are awesome. You are surrounded by workers, so you are constantly being helped and serviced. The only problem is getting a table without reservation; so I highly advise you call in before showing up. My friends and I (5) dropped about 150$: 3 bottles of soju, countless services of meat (~3 servings of Beef Short Ribs, ~4-5 Beef Brisket, 8 hotdogs, 2 Pork Bellys, 1 Honeycomb, 1 Squid), 2 Pancakes, 2 steamed eggs, kimchi fried rice, and miso soup. It's so worth it. If you dine here , must get the briskets and lots of it. The squid was really good too, I wish I had ordered it sooner before I hit food coma. We ordered pork (skinned pork belly) so we can attempt in making bacon wrap hotdogs =P (pretty dammmmm good). Didn't bother with the chicken, because I assume they would take too long to cook. Love this place, would definitely go back, with reservations of course. (made a reservation at 8:00 pm, Showed up at 7:50 pm, was still waiting behind 2 parties with earlier reservations, but still in front of about 5-6 parties from drop-in."

1/17/2012,5 star rating,"Being a big fan, literally, of Korean BBQ, we've tried our share but no one comes close to Hae Jang Chon. I have about half a dozen places that are a lot closer, yet we will make the drive to K-Town for good Korean BBQ!!! It is a very popular place and always cranking with people so there's always a wait, and a $2 valet fee, but it's worth every penny!!! There are 19 items to choose from and the sauces we use to mix are the best in town. I think what sets Hae Jang Chon aside from the competitors is the level of service. They offer exceptional service and are very quick to respond to the service bell @ your table. Anyone and everyone is willing to help you, not just your server and they'll clean off your grill with a radish vinegar mix to keep everything cooking better. If you like Korean BBQ, this is definitely one to try. I would highly recommend it to anyone, except now my wait just got longer!!! :)"
10/21/2013,4 star rating,"Came here on a Tuesday night. No line got right in. Service was decent. We got all of our drink and requests answered quickly. The price was $18.99 for all you can eat which included pork belly, spare ribs, bulgogi, etc... even shrimp. At a place with such delicious marinade and options, do waste time ordering anything plain. Tastyyyy. I definitely recommend this place for anyone with a big appetite."
7/9/2010,5 star rating,"so far my favorite place to come for AYCE KBBQ. the place is chill (not crazy loud like manna). good for small groups. seating/service is fast (mostly because of the buzzer). meat servings are generous and quality is good. i like the brisket, short ribs and bbq pork. they also have HOT DOGS!! :D i like their banchan a lot: the usual pickled stuff, greens, potato salad, rice paper, egg pot, kimchi, these spicy tofu strips that are yummy. they put some kimchi and marinated bean sprouts on the grill for you to pick at as well while waiting for your MEATS to arrive..also they have kimchi pancakes (so good) and kimchi fried rice at the end (be sure to ask for it, because sometimes they forget to ask you if you want it...it comes w/the AYCE)...really yummy IF you have space in your belly for it. i like how they clean your grill in between meat orders. parking is kind of a bitch, the lot is always crowded, but just circle around a few times and something will open up. also street parking is ample. the only thing that kinda bugs me is the yellow looking water they serve, but they steep tea in it or something...has slight tea taste...but when we got it we were like ""UHHHH WHO PEED IN MY WATER?!"" but once you taste it you can tell they put tea in it or some kind of flavoring.so yeah, i will definitely be returning here...over and over and over and over again...MEEEEAAAT IN MY MOOUUUFFFF hehe :)"
10/13/2015,3 star rating,"great food, difficult parking in korea town. the entire plaza for some reason is valet parking (has about 30spots). not worth the one hour wait as i didnt find it phenomenal. felt like any other kbbq to me. shrug"
9/23/2012,4 star rating,"Most people that give bad review to this place is because of the wait. Good thing those people won't be back as it help cut down the waiting time for others. but still the wait is ridicilious, so plan ahead. The food is pretty good. I would put this place along with road to soul and Gen but its much smaller place then those other two. As with any good place, please don't bring your kids. Why would you bring your kids to a AYCE place that you have to cook yourself. I just can't believe ppls give bad review to the place because of the size. Yes, restaurant do need to follow the fire code especially when it come to cooking it yourself place even thought the place look big, if the vent is not there, you cannot just fit more people in the place. They get fine alot if they get caught."
4/30/2013,5 star rating,I have been here a few times and I think it is time I wrote a review. This place is awesome from the quality of food to the service.My favorite is the bbq beef and the brisket. This place is open till 2:00am and there is a wait usually but its worth it.
10/7/2013,1 star rating,"This was our first time trying Korean BBQ, and the experience has been horrible. No one greeted us, just asked how many were eating and pointed to the table right next to the main door, the gas was blowing on our face, nobody explained anything to us about the one menu they gave my friend and left. One server just dumped plates of spices or something, which we had no idea what they were. We rang the bell to order drinks and discuss about the menu and the options and in the middle of discussion with the waitress just left and went to do something else. The ordered meat was just dumped on the other side of the table, again the server did not explain anything how long certain foods we ordered would take to cook etc. Later on we noticed a long black hair on top of the what appeared to be a potato salad (?), I handed it to the waitress girl and she asked if we wanted another one, we declined. Little later on I found another black curly hair in my food as I was chewing on my octopus, this time the waitress took the hair to her manager. He came and apologized and said ""it happens"" and offered to buy us drinks. We were SO done eating and wanted to get out of there that free drinks at that point were pointless. The manager gave us $8 employee discount. I will never go back, nor will I ever recommend this restaurant to anyone!! I will try to post a picture."
1/9/2012,4 star rating,"the quality of the meat was great, they had a pretty wide selection, and the service was pretty good.

Â The marinated spare rib was amazing!! Â The bbq chicken was full of flavor, and the pork tasted like adobada with a hint of spice. Â There was another really good meat we tried, but i completely forgot the name. The fried rice at the end was also super good. Â For 16.99 this place is the spot & it's open til' 2am!!!! Â I'll definitely come back here, and definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good affordable AYCE korean bbq. Â I'm glad we took the metro there, cuz we were stuffed!!

8/10/2009,4 star rating,"Probably the best AYCE KBBQ place I've tried so far. Â $17.99 gives you a choice of about a dozen choices of meats (beef, pork, chicken, squid). Â Included in the meal are kimchi fried rice (at the end) and doenjang chigae. Â The chadol, pork belly, kalbi, and squid were all pretty good. Â Ventilation could use some work but I'd definitely come back. Â They also have an outdoor smoking section. Â It's valet only - $2."
8/5/2009,4 star rating,"I'm not a big fan of all you can eat korean bbq places because I get full after only one round but when I came here with my family to celebrate my cousin on graduating from grad school I think I ate more than what I had expected....the galbi was not that good, it wasn't as tender as other places I've been to. Â the bulgogi was meh but the chadolbaegi(brisket) was AMAZING, I couldn't stop eating it, had to force myself to stop. Â I like this place because it also comes with duenjang jigae and the saam(rice paper wrap) in place of rice because at the end of eating all the beef they make you fried rice right in front of you....and there's so much variety of meats....oh I love how they clean the stone grill/iron cast skillet whatever you call it...who knew that radish/horseradish cleans off burnt residue on a stone grill...i didn't...this place is good eats!"

7/28/2009,4 star rating,"4 stars for the food, 5 stars for service.MEAT: Pork Bulgolgi, Beef Bulgolgi, Pork Belly, Brisket, Short Ribs. Â I wanted to try other stuff but my other tablemates weren't too down for squid , honey comb or anything like that. Â Bulgolgis came premixed with sliced onions, but a little too bland for my taste but the meat cut was delicious. Â Brisket was paper thin and the short ribs came without the bone and lightly marinated (not too heavy - darn it). Â Pork belly was SUPER thick and white as Matthew K mentioned, it wasn't to my liking since I try to get my pork bellies extra crispy. Â I won't be ordering Pork Belly next time.I've had a circular style KBBQ grill before but I felt that the kimchi and sprouts on this grill was totally yum here in comparison to HoneyPig in GG. Â Normally I'm not too keen on that stuff. I really liked the kimchi pancake (yes I know fillers, but it was SOOOOO good). Â  BANCHAN:They just had potato salad and green veggies with some egg but the potato salad was good. Not too dry and not too bland. Â Refilled without me asking. Â I asked the server if they had japchae but he said they were a ""different style"" of KBBQ? Â Bummed there wasn't a variety but oh well.Ricepaper wrapper was yummy, radish wrap was pretty sour for my taste. Sauces were just ""aight"" but they gave you plenty of fermented soybean sauce..mmm yum! Kimchi Fried Rice was delicious - better than at Honey pig with nice slivers of seaweed. Â SERVICE:We made reservations for a party of 12 for 7PM. Â They called us at 6:00PM and reminded us that our reservations were for 7PM and if we can't make it on time, they'd give away our table - YIKES! Â Don't do the Asian lag here folks! Â  When we got to the restaurant - and were shown our table. Â Our salad bowls, banchan, wraps and dipping sauces were all ready on our table. NICE!!!! William our server was an absolute effing doll. Â The bday girl was trashed beyond all belief and he was totally cool and accommodating with our questions. Â He was pretty amazed by her drunkiness too and almost looked like we were pulling his leg when we told him she never had Soju before, I could see him chuckle and shake his head.It was kinda cool how when your grill is dirty, they use freshly shredded radish to clean the grill. Ingenious! At first I thought he was gonna feed us that as our ""intermission"" dish.BONUS: They didn't add gratuity to the bill. Â WTHeezie? Â For that, we left a 30% tip. Â Any server (he was pretty much our dedicated server the entire time) that can deal with a bunch of drunk non-Korean speaking group of people deserves to be tipped well.CON: Â They brought out the belly first and it took forever to cook. Â The short ribs were pretty much brought out last during the first round of meats and so we got to grub on the ""cheaper stuff."" and got full by waiting around for the ""good stuff."" Â My tip would be to ask for what meat you want first. Â BTW, don't wear shorts (I came from a pool party), the grill was flying and I got some on my thighs at first until the server was sweet enough to hand me a bunch of napkins to cover my legs. Awww.. what a sweetie!"

7/13/2009,3 star rating,"I went here cuz I wanted Korean BBQ but it was already 11 and Manna was about to close soon. This place is opened til 2am, which gave us a lot of time to eat and enjoy the Korean food.The meats taste a lot like the other Korean places in Korea Town, but the grill was definitely different. I liked that the grill was slightly tilted and it was a stone plate. There weren't as many side dishes as other Korean BBQs that I've been to. The service was pretty bad. If you're sitting inside the restaurant, there isn't a button to call for a waiter. We ordered beef briskest and marinated ribs, and they brought us a plate with those two types of meat and beef tongues. Luckily I asked which meats were which before digging in. There's a charge for left over meat, so I'm glad I asked. No way I would have been able to finish the beef tongues. I guess being the first restaurant I've seen have this, was a huge shock to me. All in all, the food was good, the service was bad. Make sure you double check your order or you'll end up with meats you never order and can't finish."
7/6/2009,4 star rating,"First thing I noticed was that they used a tree in the middle of the restaurant to hide the gas line running in the middle of the restaurant. Pretty good tactic to make it look less industrial. They were nice enough to take my reservation considering our part was small and I only called 2 hours in advanced. Any KBBQ place that takes reservations is awesome to me. My parents gawked at the grill thinking that it was broken because it leaned to one side, but we figured out that the hole and the leaning let oil drip out onto a pan which gives you the false illusion that you aren't eating that much fat.The ban chan was ok. The chewy yam noodles were sour and not really my thing but tasted ok with the meat. The kim chee and the bean sprouts were a bit sour too but tasted good on the grill so maybe they purposely made it more sour than is typical. The boiled spinach? some kind of green was good and so were the shredded radishes. I love that they gave us 4 different dipping sauces: fermented bean sauce, vinegar and soy sauce, chili sauce and sesame oil with salt. The salad here was pretty good since it had a tart dressing that went well with the rich meat. The kim chee pancake was greatly improved when put on the grill and slightly burnt.So onto the meat! There were a lot of choices and we had the marinated short ribs, squid, brisket, beef abdomen, and pork belly. The marinade on the short ribs were pretty good but the cuts of meat were a bit random so some were really good while some were really chewy. The squid was good with the char from the grill and the tentacles were especially good. The brisket was better than some places, not especially fatty so they were pieces of meat vs. fat with some meat. The beef abdomen was definitely different, a bit chewy with a real intense beef flavor. The pork belly was also good, nicely cut with out random bits of cartilage, etc. The kim chee fried rice at the end was awesome with the dwen jang chigae (fermented soy bean soup). At first I was like this is not that special, but as I kept eating it was so addicting and I almost finished the whole thing despite being soooo full and the saltiness of the soup complemented the sour spiciness of the rice.Lastly, the service was also really good. I was surprised since our call button was broken, but they still came to regularly check on us. The cleaning of the grill was intense and done really well so I felt like our meat was sitting and cooking in an sh*t load of carcinogens. Overall it was definitely worth the 16.99 but next time I am not getting the soju at 11.99 a bottle it was a def. ripoff. Meat to try next time: the beef tongue, marinated chicken, non-marinated short ribs and the tripe."
6/28/2009,4 star rating,"great value - there's a nice selection of different types of meat for the ARCE k bbq. Â The kimchi pancake is a great way to start and the ""dirty water"" tea is refreshing. Â The service can be spotty but the amount of food and the taste is great. Â I recommend the pork (the pork belly is too fatty for me), the brisket, and anything marinated. Â The kimchi fried rice is great so leave room for that at the end. Â not a huge fan of the soup that comes with the fried rice. Â if u have big friends with big appetite, this is the place to go. :)"
6/26/2009,3 star rating,"Yeah so, the food was great. The service was really nice. But there was something off:Friend: what is that? *pokes something off her dish and points*Me: Eh, it's nothing. *thinks it's a flower bud for some reason*Friend: I think it's a bug.Me: Noooo, it's not a bug.Friend: Yeah, I think it's a bug.Me: It's not a bug! *picks up and squeals, dropping it* IT'S A BUG. I TOUCHED A BUG.Bleeeggh. Even thinking about it grosses me out.Thankfully they gave a twenty percent discount and a free bottle of Soju plus extra VIP service. They even offered to replace all the food (we declined since it was just the salad that had that bizarre bug in it).I don't think I'd come back here though just because I now associate the place with dead bugs. Which sucks since like I said: great food, extremely generous portions, fantastic service... I guess just avoid the salad."
6/22/2009,3 star rating,"RECOMMENDATION: your fave korean bbq choice.I thought this place was okay.. let's keep it simple..it wasn't all that great, but i liked it. Â the waiters there are attentive, but they don't smile much. Â but overall the quality of the meat was pretty good and the soju of course is great. Â the only thing is that the parking sucks (only valet or on the street) and the place is pretty small. Â I recommend going to Road to Seoul..it is the best i have ever been to. Â Until then, I'll wait and tell you if I find another great All You Can Eat Korean BBQ place in K-Town."
8/10/2013,3 star rating,"I wish I could give this place a five star review. Â The food is good. Â No doubt. Â The service is ok. Â The reason is many of the staff can't communicate. Â If you are persistent in asking for what you want you will eventually get it. Â But, you may have to wait if you want to eat with a party of six on a weekend. Â Reservations are only taken for parties of 8 or more (I was told this on the phone and it is on several signs in the restaurant). Â We showed up at 6:30pm. Â We were told the wait would be 35 to 45 minutes. Â At 7:15p we were told it would be another 35 minutes. Â We were given a table at 8:30p. Â It would be great if staff could at least be honest from the start. Â Sadly, not one staff member apologized for this. Â I am not sure they even understood when we complained."

2/13/2013,4 star rating,Good quality meat and best of all kimchi fried rice at the end! Â They take reservations for 8 or more on the weekend BUT make sure all your people are there or they won't seat you AND make sure that you are there a few minutes early because if you are 5 minutes late they will give away your table.
6/1/2015,1 star rating,"Worst service I've ever had in my life! OVER PRICED AND OVERRATED! Don't be fooled by all the great reviews! If I could give 0 stars out of 5, I would, but Yelp doesn't allow that! My friends and I unfortunately we're the fools that night. Went from sushi, to wanting Korean BBQ. I've only had Korean BBQ once, but have heard all the hype. So I was more than willing to give it a try. Wait was lengthy, as expected, so I'm glad I ate half a sandwich before leaving the house, or I would have been grumpy, only have eaten once all day. We got the all you can eat. Meats were mediocre, nothing special. Marinated ribs were the best. Nothing I couldn't get @ a Panda Express, or else where. Service was REALLY BAD! Wasn't even offered the kimchi rice or any extra sides that we may have been entitled to under AYCE rules. Which was a huge turn off. I literally had to raise my hand and ask for another beer. The waiter even walked away as I was ordering more meat. They were fast and glad to turn off the flame on our grilled stone though. Then to have the audacity and say 1 of our party left 0 tip, was just rude. We split our $140 in 4 cards, 3 of which left $2 each, and the other 0. Hey, you get tipped for how the clients are serviced. Can't blame customers for being mistreated. I will NEVER go back to this place. I don't mind paying over $20 for a meal, but getting treated worse than a dog, I won't have it."
4/3/2013,5 star rating,"LOVE this place!! My favorite Korean BBQ in LA. You get a lot for what you pay... soup, kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice all come with the AYCE BBQ. The only downside is that if you come on a busy night, you'll be waiting for 30+ mins. I should also mention that it can get pretty loud too."
2/13/2010,4 star rating,"$15.99 for all you can eat bbq!!! i think we only ordered 2 rounds and i was stuffed...so many delicious side dishes like the spicy tofu, spicy bean sprouts, kimchi pancake, egg custard, kimchi...ohhhhh...my favorites were the pork shoulder, beef tongue, and thick sliced pork belly. we also had the hot dogs and squid, but that was towards the end, and i already had bbq comin outta my ears. :)"
1/14/2013,1 star rating,"Worst service ever!!! this happened few months back when I didn't Yelp... but the had lunch, no bbq, just the lunch special... the waiter came to next table who was having a bbq, scraped the bottom of the grill and splash the burnt meat and grease all over my suit!!!! He didn't know that he did that and when I let him know... he wasn't all that apologetic! so I've asked for the manager and he didn't seem all that apologetic also... when my friend finally asked and said ""don't you think you should at least give dry cleaning fee's or something for the mistake that your waiter did?"" and the manager had the bill for our food and just crushed it in his hand and said ""you don't have to pay so that's fine, right?!?!""... I was amazed at how they responded. Â so my friend got mad and threw $20.00 bill on their counter and just left. Â I don't know what type of service they provide here but they made a mistake and they weren't being real!!! I DO NOT recommend anyone going here or supporting a restuarant that can't even apologize for their mistake."
4/28/2013,1 star rating,"Beware!I hear from my friends about thiew restaurant, I am a big fan of Korean BBQ. I want to try a new Korean BBQ, when I see the price $17.99, it was real good deal of all u can eat but when I star eatting, it wasn't as I expact. The meat is what u paid, poor quality, for me I will add $8 to eat other better quality Korean BBq. The worse thing is about after I check out. They chaged me $46 for tip (we are two people, the amount we have to pay which is $35.98) but they chaged me $46 for their tip. My frind said its a mistake, they got wrong. Ok! So when I called the restaurant the boss was kind and said sorry to me. But their sound its not first time happed. It took me three weeks to get my money back but they didn't return to my bank, and they wish me go to the restaurant to get my money because its difficult for them to return the money to my bank. I will not tell my friends to go this restaurant, and many people who wnat to go this restaurant beware after u check out, I don't wnat to this kind restaurant to get the extrat tip from u."
1/25/2014,1 star rating,"i normally dont write reviews but this was a must. when we arrived the servers seemed fine until i started pressing the button for someone to take my order. the server came back and told me to never press the button again because the manager was getting mad at him. SO I CAN'T PRESS A BUTTON TO ASK FOR SERVICE WHEN NO ONE WOULD SERVE ME WHEN I RAISE MY HAND? To make matters worse, when the server came back to take my credit card slip, he had to look at how much tip i gave him. WHAT IS THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE? good food but would never come back for a service like this"
7/25/2012,5 star rating,i've been here a couple times and i love how the meat cooks on stone rather than aluminum. they also cook a very tasty fried rice at the end and have my favorite radish wraps.
5/25/2009,4 star rating,"Got there about 8pm on a Friday night. Â We were able to find parking on the street so to avoid the valet parking fee. Â I think it was $2 or something. Â We've waited about 10-15 minutes, but that was ok since our entire party was still on their way. Â They sat us in the patio. Â I liked it because we sat next to the windows and it there was a cool breeze throughout our dinner. Â Not to mention, it kept the room from filling up from smoke from the grill and the smokers. Â Yes, that's right!! Â Apparently they don't care about the smoking indoor laws in California. Â A couple of people in the patio area lit up a couple of cigs. Â Didn't bother me because of the breeze that was blowing the smoke in the other direction. Â On to the review. Â They brought out this big stone grill thingy. Â Looked pretty heavy. Â The waitress started to put on some bean sprouts, kim chee and kim chee pancake on the grill. Â I didn't care too much for that. Â I'm here for the meat dammit!!! Â We ordered the usual fare of pork belly (thick cut), bulgogi, kalbi and pork. Â Apparently, you can only order 4 kinds of meat at a time. Â The only thing that put a damper on our dinner was that the food took a while to cook since the grill was so thick. Â Good thing we had some soju and hite to calm our nerves a little. Â Not to mention good company. Â They also laid out some banchan. Â They were pretty good, but you don't get the whole repertoire of the usual banchan's they usually lay in front of you at other koreann bbq's. Â But once again, I'm here for the meat dammit!!! Â The pork belly was good, the meat was marinated quite right and there was alot of food to go around. Â We also had the brisket and thin cut pork belly. Â I have to say that I like the thick cut more. Â Oh, we also tried the intestine. Â I don't think I will go back for that. Â It was very chewy and didn't really have much taste. Â I have to say that my experience at Hae Jang's ended on a very positive note. Â Good food, great staff and the price of $16.99 for all you can eat, can't complain. Â Next time, I think I'll go for the other items. Â I would definitely go back to this place. Â  They take Mastercards & Visa and they stay open until 2am. Â Something to think about when you are stumbling out from the club early to get your munchies on."

9/29/2012,2 star rating,"Was so excited to try this AYCE buffet, but was left disappointed. The pork belly was paper thin not like the photos here on yelp. The galbi meat was cut up so small, and the meat quality was so-so. We never got any dengang jigae with our meal and where was our garlic and peppers?We had 6 people buy the buffet, but they did give us 2 steamed egg pots. For $18 a person I have had much better. Didn't live up to all hype and probably won't go there again."

3/14/2009,4 star rating,"after reading the reviews on this place i decided that i had to check it out for myself. an AYCE korean bbq open until 2am and includes squid??!and they have a super cool pig on their sign,so its a hard place to miss.i actually went here with my former english teacher, her husband and a friend, last week.i was pretty satisfied with my experience here...it was pretty different from all of the other kbbqs i have been to. you cook your food on a stone grill and they use radish to clean the grill instead of just changing it.the service is fairly fast and friendly...they start you off by bringing banchan and kimchi pancakes,etc. even though im not a kimchi lover, i did like the pancakes.we all ordered the AYCE and started off with the brisket, bbq cuttlefish (squid) and marinated short rib. the first plate of brisket and marinated short rib and squid was all delicious. but from then, it seemed to me like the quality started to go down :/of course when you order brisket,you don't expect lean pieces of meat, but these things were at least 90% fat ]: and the short ribs weren't very tender after the first plate...oh and there's also some special sauce for the squid that you can get if you ask for it and they serve bokumbop...kimchi fried rice at the end if you ask for it, also.when my friend decided to put some hite on the marinated short ribs, we got weird looks around the restaurant. Â but i thought it made it taste better. hahayelping about this place is making me hungry again...im definitely a fan and im definitely going back..but the quality doesn't beat tahoe's..."
4/1/2009,4 star rating,"i instructed everybody to come unbathed and wearing dirty clothes. we were not a lovely sight to behold. we had a long brunch and they were very nice about it. great service! generous with the banchan and mounds upon mounds of raw meat.

12/7/2009,5 star rating,"what can i say.. i love KBBQ and this place is great. kinda small and the wait can get insane but its worth the wait. unlike other ktown joints, most of the waiters can speak english and speak it well.. in fact like more than 1/2 are just americans and it works out since im chinese and only know like a dozen korean words like thank you or something.first off the price is great at 16.99 but after taxt and tip you're looking at $20 easy. for yous we each ended up paying $33 because got 4 HITEs and 1 soju. First off they give AMPLE sides and pile on the kimchi on the grill with kimchi pancake. the 'salad' is great and not drenched in the vinaigrette. the 'rice paper' is punctually refueled whenever we asked for more meat. its great when the waitress takes notice of whats left on the table and provides good service. plus she was super nice and really accommodating. the meat itself is also awesome. they dont make you wait between rounds to get you full but instead are quite speedy. it's also interesting how they use a GIANT piece of kimchi to clean the gril when switching between the marinated and non marinated meats. at the end you get kimchi fried rice where they make it off the gril and you just spoon right off the grill. I've been here twice and have yet to have a poor experience with this place. i wish there was more parking and not have to valet for $2 but hey its LA.. what do you expect?"
4/24/2011,5 star rating,"Oh this place, I have had many good memories dining and drinking here. All those late night munchies and soju were probably the death of me, but it was so worth it. I enjoy the atmosphere here; the service is always friendly and consistent no matter what time it is, the meat selection here is better than most places, and the kim chi fried rice at the end is just addicting! Other yelpers were right on with the parking situation here. Don't be cheap, just pay the $2 for valet! The parking lot is insanely small so bring your change. Love that this place is open til 2am, more of an excuse to eat and drink to our hearts desire!"
9/10/2012,5 star rating,Fun to go with a group (especially folks that know what they are doing). Â Lots of tasty food and not expensive. Â One of the best AYCE experiences I've ever had. Â I look forward to going again!
10/28/2014,5 star rating,"My family and I recently dined at Hae Jang Chon for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Â I loved the fact that I was able to make a reservation ahead of time and that we were seated promptly upon arriving. Â The staff was very accommodating and took the time to explain the menu and how everything worked. Â We had the bulgogi, kalbi, shrimp, spicy chicken and one other beef item which were all delightful. Â The meat quality definitely stands out here when compared to other AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants. Â The sides were all great and we were even offered the specialty, kimchi pancakes as an option, which I personally am in love with. I think I prefered the marinated items in general, but the family really enjoyed their experience as a whole. Â It was nice that the wait staff came around and helped cook the meat too. Let's be honest, sometimes cooking over the hot grill can start hurting your hands when you have excessive amounts of meat to cook for an eager table of friends and family right? We topped the meal off with kimchi fried rice. Â Thank you to Hae Jang Chon for taking such good care of us. Â We will definitely be back. Â P.S. Have you considered maybe opening a location in Orange County? If so, we'd definitely visit more often!"

1/29/2013,5 star rating,"Had to try out one of the most highly rated Korean BBQ joints in Koreatown, LA. You will not be disappointed if you are into korean bbq- All you can eat 19 items to choose from. On top of that, you get many side dishes as appetizers and those were delicious. I can not describe each individual items we ordered, but I can say my experience surpasses my expectation."
6/21/2012,3 star rating,"Great place for all your eat barbecue. Â Valet parking is only for $2 so it is very convenient. Â Food is only so so, however. Â The place is also rather small and very noisy."

Â This is my second korean bbq experience in LA so I'd have to wait to see if it does indeed deserve 5 stars. Â I guess 4.5 stars for the food and service. Â The meat was delicious...and I guess the biggest draw was the kimchi fried rice at the very end of the meal. Â Oh why does it have to be at the end of the meal...I was waaaay too full to eat more than two bites of the fried rice. Â Everything was delicious and it was such a bargain. Â Service was really good."
5/2/2010,4 star rating,"one of my favorite korean bbq places in ktown by far. Â manna is great if you're in a group and it's someone's birthday and you want to see them doused with a bottle of champagne. but if you want the down home quality feel of korean bbq, i'd highly recommend hae jang chon. Â be careful of the wait on weekends..it goes upwards of an hour. so if you're starving yourself for korean bbq (as everyone should), get there an hour before you're ready to eat.hae jang chon is known for its pork and i'm not a huge fan of kbbq pork but even i'll admit that its quite tasty. Â the beef is great - the marinated kalbi is so delicious my mouth is watering right now and the unmarinated brisket equally as delicious. Â so thinly sliced that it practically melts in your mouth. Â after my extensive korean bbq research, this definitely hits as one of my top 3 in california (palace bbq in the bay still ranks first). Â i also love how the tables and vents are set up to minimize smoke in the face and burnt char on the meat. great place."
8/17/2010,5 star rating,"Kick ass korean bbq place. There price is 16.99 and it's got so many choices of meat to eat and most of them are delicious. They have a hot dog, but uh it's a hot dog. At the end of the meal they give you kimchi fried rice and soup. The soup is alright, but the rice is super bomb. If you have room in your tummy to eat it that is. This place has really good sides too, and the service is great. You never have to wait too long to get meat. One of the best parts is how they clean the grill. They use grated white radish and vinegar and they just clean it up the grill in a jiffy. The tea water they serve is also really good. It's like the perfect combination of tea and water, and it really quenches your thirst. The wait is long because the place is always packed, but the joint is open to 2am. Unlike other places that close early, when you go here you can really just sit and eat and eat eat. 5 mega million stars for this place. This is my absolutely favorite place to eat at, I've been here 3 times, twice in one week and it was still good. If eating all that meat was good for you, I'd probably eat here once a week."
9/22/2011,3 star rating,Yea its pretty good but the guy working in the front looks like he wants to punch you. They need to work on their greeting anf fix that damn front door.
1/4/2013,4 star rating,"you really have to wait for sometime before you get seated. the service is fast. they have the initiative to refill our sides. the meat were tasty even without the dipping sauces though the bulgogi is quite salty. i would agree with one yelper (Erika M.) who said that ""an ""excuse me"" or ""watch the grease"" would have been nice when cleaning our grill."" overall, i would recommend this to a friend and would come back."
1/2/2013,1 star rating,"This place is terrible. Don't ever listen to the reception lady in the front; she told us it'd take 30 minutes, but it took us about an hour and twenty. We should've listened to the valet parking dude, he knew what he was talking about."

10/12/2012,5 star rating,"This is my first review at Yelp! And, hopefully, this will be helpful. Â With iOS 6, it is so easy to do this :).I have been a customer of this restaurant for a long time. Â And, I have to tell you that I know of no other place in K-town where you can have such delicious food at $17.99 Period! Â Yes, their galbi probably is not the best but still good--for best galbi you can go to other places and pay $30 for one order. Â Other than that, all other meat--I usually order chadol and pork belly--are top notch. Â You will usually pay $20 for a single order of these at none AYCE restaurants. Â They don't give many kinds of banchan, but what they give are really good which is the way I prefer. Â Just like Apple (you can tell I like Apple products), I want restaurants to focus on what they do well. Â And Haejangchon does that...while keeping the price more than reasonable. Â Other two highlights are kimchee pancakes and...fried rice at the end!!! Â Fried rice is just fantastic and no other AYCE offer this as far as I know.Healthy ""stone grill""...few but good banchan...mouth-watering fried rice at the end. Â Things just go well together! Â Go and try and review the restaurant for yourself! Â @17.99...wonderful food and fantastic price!"
8/12/2014,2 star rating,"I've been to Hae Jang Chon many times. In fact, I normally recommend this place to ppl but no more. As long as ""Justin"" is there, yes, I'm putting him on blast because I don't appreciate being treated like a second class citizen for NO REASON, I will take my business elsewhere (e.g. didn't appreciate the discrimination, the attitude, the obvious talking shit in Korean). There are too many KBBQ places in Ktown for me to deal with the bullshit here. I was with two other friends and we ordered plenty of alcohol so obviously we weren't penny pinchers. Â At least, the manager or the owner, recognized that we were there to spend $$$ and served us herself. Â But too late, asked for check, and got out. Â Reason for 2 star is for the manager - she tried to smooth things over. I've been a waitstaff and worked at busy restaurants, so I know it's a tough job - but hey, Justin, learn to read your customers. If a table is willing drop money, it's more tip for you - it's elementary math. Too hard? Then GTFO service industry."
8/2/2010,4 star rating,i identify this place as the one with the pig on it. all you can eat. nom nom. the beef brisket is really good. the slices are thin so it cooks fast. Â the beef tongue sliced so thin it melts in your mouth. kimchi! unlimited kimchi! although i have to say i was disappointed with the kimchi fried rice. im not a big fan of sesame oil. and they put a lot in the fried rice. the short ribs are good. pork belly nom. i would say overall this place is really good for its price. just come here hungry! and eat slowly ahahah.
9/27/2010,3 star rating,"almost 4 stars.friends gathered here for the eve and since the wedding we were supposed to go to was called off, we detoured to hang out, drink, grub and had a pretty darn good korean bbq meal. Â (despite the fact that i don't eat meat - reference my porto alegre review.)standard fare, all you can eat $17 bucks a head rounded up - it was pretty cool. Â the 2 asian kids at the ends of the table got stuck with cooking duty which was fine by me as it catapults me back to being the good, obedient asian daughter -- yes folks, it is a pretty annoying syndrome to have to feud with. Â nevertheless, the meat was cooked, served sizzling and the shochu was a-flowin'. Â i'm impressed with the quality of flesh they serve here given that it is an all-you-can-eat joint...kudos HJC.

12/21/2010,5 star rating,this place....is AMAZING!!!! since ive started coming here i have NEVER EVER been to another korean bbq place. other places just dont compare. the food is excellent and the service is astounding. you never get ignored and they always seat you in a timely manner. oh and the kimchi pancake????! to die for! and dont forget the kimchi fried rice....and sometimes the waiter will turn your kimchi fried rice into a heart =D

4/1/2011,4 star rating,"I come here only for the Chungyupsal. Â I think it is the pork shoulder or neck. Â So delicious and I don't know any other place in koreatown that serves this type of meat.

Â But overall everything is pretty good and I love the rice in the end."
10/4/2011,4 star rating,"Time for my second Yelping! Its that time of week again and I am back at KBBQ with the same group as my last review. When CJ told me we were going to AYCE KBBQ again, I said, ""Not that same place we went last time, right?!"" Thank heavens no. According to my friend, Hae Jang Chon is owned by the same peeps as Park's BBQ (my fave KBBQ). Parks isn't AYCE and is considerably more expensive, but well worth it. However for for 16.99 Hae Jang Chon can't be beat! Delicious bahnchan (we requested many refills), awesome miso soup, and tasty meats. I recommend the beef and pork with marinades. Yum yum yum! Also, the service was outstanding! They cleaned the grill four times (without us having to ask) instead of a begrudging once or twice as is customary. They also came around and refilled our dipping sauces early in the meal. Also, the grills here are slanted and run off into a shallow pan (George Foreman, Hankook style), which is kind of cool and makes you feel like the meal is way healthier. (Emphasis on ""feel"", lol).PLUS, they prepare some super bomb fresh kimchi fried rice on each grill at the end of the meal! Tonight's feast more than made up for our group's last disappointing KBBQ outing. And our group has resolved to start coming here now as our go-to AYCE. Yesss! :D"
1/11/2012,5 star rating,"If I ever want to eat sam-kyub-ssal (pork)...my first choice is this place! I love their pork and pig shoulder!!! I never knew pig shoulder can be this good and fairly soft!!! My fiance was shocked when he first had their pork shoulder....he expected something tough but it was surprisingly tender. All their other meat is pretty darn good too...but I seriously prefer their pork meat over beef... I think this place also has the best kimchi fried rice. It's extremely well seasoned and goes great with their gwen-jang gook...plus, I have never had a problem with their service...I'm just drooling thinking of this place..."
6/4/2011,4 star rating,"This place was a really good AYCE place. I thought it was really cool how we cooked on stone grills, and unlike most AYCE places the service here was really good.The interior was also a lot nicer than other KBBQ restaurants I've been to, and would actually be a good place to take someone on a date. The servers were really nice and attentive and even cook for you in the beginning to get things started. They also clean the grill consistently with I believe to be daikon shavings, which was another plus. The meat selection had a nice variety and of good quality. The only thing that slightly bothered me was the amount of meat on the platters they give you. They tend to give you a small portion of the meat, and they tend to take a while to give you the meats. The appetizers were really good. I enjoyed the sliced fish cakes, the kimchi pancake, and the steamed egg. Something new that I've never done was had the kimchi and sprouts grilled, which I liked a lot. Sadly, I didn't get to try the kimchi fried rice, because by the end of the meal my friends and I were just too full. Overall it was a good experience and a good way to introduce people who have never been to a KBBQ restaurant."

Â Food was ok... Nothing really wowed us. Â The pork belly, ribs, and fried rice stood out. Â Everything else tasted pretty normal. A lot of people mentioned this place lacked customer service. Â Personally, I thought the service was pretty good. Â Our waiter was really nice & attentive (and pretty cute too). Â All in all, would I go back? Yes. Â Would I wait? Â No. Â Food is alright, but really not worth the long wait."

11/25/2008,5 star rating,"The BBQ here is one of the best, but not the best. The reason for this is; as an AYCE place there really aren't many selections. The meat choices are simple Cha Dol, Galbi, and Sam Gyup Sal.I do have to say the quality of their meat is very high, along with their kimchi that is cut in front of you on your pan. Another thing they are known for is their fried rice at the very end. The fried rice itself is one of a kind, and the whole experience would not be complete without it.All in all I urge anyone, who has not been here to come. You will not be disappointed."

11/21/2008,5 star rating,"My personal favorite Korean BBQ place. All the beef is fresh, red, and tasty. I like their Kalbi the most. Sweet tender meat ... and I just get 5-6 orders of this stuff for myself. And I am set. My average meal here takes about 3 hours. For 16.99 I eat about a good few pounds of beef.I'm not big on the side dishes. I go and attack the most expensive cuts of beef, which I think the Kalbi is. Pork belly is nice too but way too unhealthy for my taste, but still good if you let it sit and get crispy.The rice wrappers have been a little bit dry, they need to do a better job of wrapping those things up before they store them in the fridge.Kimchi fried rice is the way to finish the meal. I wish they used the 'flavored' grease and dump it back into the fried rice, thats what I would do. I bet it would taste so good from all the Kalbi fat. Just like what I do with my george foreman grill, pour the 'flavor' back in."

Brisket was a little fatty, kalbi was well-marinated and though it's usually my favorite I think the toss up of the best meat of the night was the pork belly or the squid for me.e) they gave us four different sauces and then another sauce for the squid when we asked for thatf) our waitress spoke English wellg) it wasn't that smokey but then I smelled someone smoking a cigarette..ugh!h) decor was kind of trendy fobby country if that makes any sensei) it's in a larger shopping center with a valet but I easily found parking just after 7 on the streetj) I liked the kimchi fried rice quite a bit and the tofu soup was okayk) I found our grill very interesting but I think ours was toppled over a bit in comparison to other grillsl) They cleaned the grill by dumping radish on the grill and scraping it about.

10/26/2008,4 star rating,"When you're not the native of the Korean language, it's always hard to remember what the restaurant is called. I've been to Heijangchon Dolgooi for a number of times now and I finally remember their name. Ok, not really, maybe only because I actually texted myself the name of the place last time I dined there.As far as AYCE KBBQ goes in Ktown, this place is one of the best place I've ever been. The meat quality (for AYCE) is better than Manna and probably Tahoe Galbi. Pork belly was nice and thick. kalbi was well-marinated. Squid was pretty much full of awesomeness. They also serve ghimchee fried rice at the end with soup. IMO, I like the kimchee fried rice better over at Dong Il Jang, but you don't have to order pork to have it here in Heijangchon.So if you're looking for endless meat and wanted to top it off with kimchee fried rice. I highly recommend this place."
10/14/2008,5 star rating,"Now Chris Kim has been to many a Korean BBQs but he'd have to say that this restaurant is the best AYCE Korean that he has been. First off, you order the special(16.99) which is the choices of chadeulbaegi(sliced beef), ssamgyupsal(uncured bacon), kalbi(marinated steak) and marinated chicken and it also comes with fried kimchee and kimchee pancakes at the beginning and bi bim bap(Korean fried rice) and tenjjang chigae(soybean soup) at the end. Panchan(side dishes): What they have here is always set so expect to see the same things every time. Now Chris Kim's Korean aint the best so he'll tell you in English what they have; Steamed egg, radish kimchee, regular kimchee, stem kimchee, mild radish kimchee with the juice( sort of like a cold soup) and the rice and radish wraps. Yeah that's about it, nothing fancy. Now to the real deal, the meat. First off, they have this big kimchee stalk on the grill and add kimchee pancakes when you get there. That fried kimchee idea is a really good one. The meat is of pretty good quality especially for an AYCE. It's actually the best quality of a AYCE hes been. So usually you order the chadeulbaegi first and cook that. Chris Kim gives a Chris Kim tip on cooking that one. Lower the heat to a medium and instead of what people usually do(fry it on both sides in which it becomes chewy), do what Chris Kim does which is stack them close and steam cook it constantly keeping it on the move and just before it's done set it on your plate. This makes the beef of a sukiyaki consistency so its more tender and juicy when you eat it. The rest of the meat is self explanatory. The kalbi is very juicy so watch out.Service: Since everyone usually gets the special anyway, the service for an AYCE is exceptional. The waiters constantly come by and give service and replenishes things( if you can stop stuffing your face and run out of items before they can get back to you). A cool thing that Chris Kim hasn't seen anywhere else is how they clean the grill. They take those shredded radishes and cleans the grill using them. People usually tip buffets less, but these guys deserve the regular tipping standard if not more for their service.Downsides: Get here early or call to reserve because if you come here when its a full house, expect to wait around 30-60 minutes for a table mind you this place is pretty small. Chris Kim says if you come with a group of more than 5, split up your group to reduce the waiting time. They charge extra for rice.So all in all the best AYCE Korean BBQ Chris Kim has been to and this place would be his #1 choice to go thus far. Don't give the servers a bad attitude because they'll give it straight back. I mean think of how you would feel if you were in their shoes."
10/10/2008,4 star rating,"eating korean bbq at 10pm is really not a good idea... especially if its AYCE. but aside from my glutenocity (if thats not a word, it should be) i enjoyed the experience. for only $16.99 you can stuff your starving fat face.we were seated along the wall at a non-round table. i later found out that the seat i had taken had no back rest. shit... i was forced to sit upright and support my increasingly large stomach as the meal progressed, but i'll get back to that later. sauces and accoutrement were brought out, and we sat there tasting and asking ""whats this"" to each other while the grill warmed up.then the good stuff... kimchi and kimchi pancakes we placed on the grill after being sliced up with scissors. the best tasting kimchi-anything ive had because i actually dislike the taste, but it was so delicious! next was the brisket; the grill was then covered in meat. we started flipping over pieces with our chopsticks but we were interrupted when our waiter came over and just mixed the meat up with his tongs. i thought that was odd because ive never had any waiter tend to our grill like that. and it was the same when we asked for galibi, pork belly, and chicken. he put it on the grill, came back once to flip them over (even tho we were already doing it), and cut up the pieces with his shamancy scissors. halfway thru the meal, i noticed that everyone in the restaurant was allowed to place their own meat on their grill and cook it by themselves. and everyone that was allowed to cook themselves just happened to be korean. im not complaining about having full service, because i didnt have to really guess when the meat was done. but its slightly irritating that there was an assumption that me and my friends couldnt and wouldnt know how to eat at a korean restaurant.the meat was tasty, i love meat that marinated, but it was also 40% fat. i would have preferred to have just the trim of the meat be fat, because a little wont hurt. the pork belly was fun to watch cook on the grill because it reminded me of caveman bacon... fat sizzling slabs of meat. i was a little pickier about the sides... i didnt like that egg curd (looks like tofu), or the white chunks of something swimming in kimchi sauce. nope, not at all. its ok that there were only 6 or 8 different sides because i only touched half of them. we didnt even make it to the kimchi fried rice because we were all in food coma status before the grill was even empty.aside from the ignorant assumption that we didnt know what to do and the slightly fatty meat, i was stuffed and happy and a little drunk from the hite beers we sucked down. next time i come back, i'll opt for ordering the 2 person meal because it comes with soju and a better portion of meat... diet saver!"

Â A friend had told me about the ayce galibi, the fried rice they had the end and also their sesame dipping sauce was so good there!The Meat - It was good but it was too marinated to my taste. Â I actually enjoy the non-marinated galbi. Â The meat they had available were good and pretty good quality, just the galbi marinade was a bit too sweet for my taste. Â The sides - I was disappointed to see that they only had 3 small sides for you to eat. Â I'm used to seeing like 10 different ones.The sesame dipping sauce - YUM!!!The fried rice - I didn't enjoy too much. Â It had a tangy taste.The soup at the end wasn't very enjoyable to me eitherAlso, their kim chi was very sour and tangy, not what i'm used to.It's pretty cheap, 16.99 AYCE dinner compared to other places.

9/28/2008,4 star rating,We went here last night recommended by a friend in our party and I would give this place my 4 stars. You cook on these iron skillets and the meats are savory. I know two friends who weren't in this party would Love the Pork belly's here because they are thick and good quality stuff. I for one liked there Galbi and enjoyed their sides and this fried rice they have at the end with seaweed and diced onions. Â It had this kick and very flavorful. Â Our waitress didn't seem to speak a lick of english but we got her to laugh when another person in our party tried to make a volcano with the onion that was served. It was all fun and the waitress and all of of got a kick out of the whole thing.
9/8/2008,3 star rating,"My friends just live right around the corner. They saw this place always pack with people, but they never try it. So last Wednesday, we decided to give it a shot. Probably it was the weekday, we only waited for less than 10mins to be seated. Okay. in here you can order $16.99 AYCE which i think is the best choice. LOL Just because there are not much other choices. The only thing i really like is they use stone grill. They don't have any small dishes, but cold steam eggs, and bean-sprouts. Besides, they'll give you a little kimchi and kimchi pancakes on the grill. 4 of us had the 1st round - EVERYTHING - which included Beef Brisket, Pork Belly, Marinated Short Ribs. Â Yup. they don't have much choices as I said, that's bascially all you can get. Beef Brisket, the best among the others. pretty good quality. Pork Belly, hmmm a bit too fatty and also a bit of the pig smell... Marinated Short Ribs, not too bad, but not the best. Â We ordered for the 2nd round with EVERYTHING, and the waiter looked at us like... huh? EVERYTHING again?? Â geez. what's wrong with that!! Compare with the 1st round, 2nd round came with smaller amount of meats. While our wait, another waiter came to help us clean the stone grill. He was pretty good and professional. I like how he cleaned the stone grill by using some water n' sliced up radish. v. smart! We'd like to have more meats but then we deicded to try the fried rices and tofu soup instead. well just because we don't want to be stared like we eat big. ~_~ Â The fried rices was mixed with seaweeds and kimchi, pretty good. The tofu soup was a bit too salty. Meat quality was just okay. But the kimchi pancakes are pretty unique. The smoke vents here were okay. Probably because there were not too many tables that night. Overall the experience was okay."

They said that they had reserved 3 days ago. What a crock of s!!t. I ended up waiting 1 1/2 hrs. Food was good, service wasn't all that great. I asked for chicken and I didn't get it til the 3rd time I asked for it. I asked for Sake and Steamed Rice and didn't get it til the 3rd time. Like they say,""3rd time is a charm.""

And i was feeling a little sick, so i decided to go for their lunch menu and have a nice hot soup. My friend and my boyfriend both ordered spicy pork soup and were half done with theirs. I ordered beef soup and when i was done with 1/3 of it, i found a cockroach floating right in my soup. I immediately ran for the bathroom. Meanwhile when my bf confronted the waiter he did not apologize and just said 'ok, ok! I took that one off the check!' Like all we wanted is. 5.99$ free soup!!!! It was so disgusting!!! I always see lines of people waiting outside. Been there a customer for many times. And i am soo disappointed! I have no idea how they got an A on health department sheet thingy. If they get an A with roaches, what can we expect from B establishments? I actually regret not calling the health department right away. I still have the image of the roach in front of my eyes!

Â the price is great for what you get- lots of meats to choose from, although i usually love the spicy pork bulgogi and beef bulgogi..... but you get steamed egg, kimchi pancake, and kimchi fried rice at the end! the only downside is it's the flat plate cooktop vs actual grill.... but i guess then you wouldn't be able to get kimchi fried rice at the end so it's a trade off.... also, when i've gone there with larger groups, we had to sit at two tables and one didn't have a real cooktop but a plug in strange grill that didn't grill things very well........ but other than that, this is a good go to place for korean bbq happiness!"
