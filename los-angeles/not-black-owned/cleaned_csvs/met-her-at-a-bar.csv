7/9/2017,20170709,5,5.0,"Great little breakfast nook right next to 2 other good places to hang. So I've got mornings and evenings covered!They are just opening up but the new owners have put a lot of work into the place and I love it! Their waffles are fresh crispy and TASTY served with REAL maple syrup! My friend had bagel & lox and that is the next item I will try. Being a native NY foodie, I know it's really hard to find supreme bagel & lox here in LA..Meanwhile, the other priority for my morning: the coffee is great and can easily be a daily pleasure! Will relegate my Keurig to days I am too lazy to go out..Really happy to see this new place in the neighborhood :)The menu selections they are talking about sound interesting and try all of them. Little businesses like this need our support to compete with the artificial flavored overpriced mega corps offerings and I will be a regular here ! Two Thumbs Up!"
7/14/2017,20170714,5,5.0,"Remember Muse on 8th? Remember thinking, it's great that there's a quaint little local coffee spot in chain-heavy Mid-Wilshire, but I wish this place had more charm and character? Look no further than Met Her At A Bar. This place is everything Muse should have been. The new owners, first of all, are a charming young couple who could not have been friendlier on my first visit. They came in and jazzed the old place up from top to bottom. Gone is the outdated, incoherent, dirty vibe from before and in its place is a clean new look that is trendy but with plenty of rustic charm. The owners relocated the front door to its rightful place on the building corner, and have opened up the storefront windows to really let in the sunshine. The color palette inside is natural and muted to balance things out, with pops of color from the condiment table to the pastel yellow espresso machine next to the register. Muse's open kitchen is retained, but looks more enclosed and separated now without making the space feel claustrophobic. Ivy runs along the wooden ceiling beams. Books of all sizes and topics are stacked on communal work tables and window-facing bar seating. The upright piano from before is still here!Part of the selling point is the house-made Belgian waffles they offer. I ordered a coffee to go, and the owners were kind enough to give me a small golden brown waffle to try out. Perfectly garnished with a dash of powdered sugar, the waffle was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside - absolutely delicious. The size of the kitchen space leads me to believe that they have many food items available, but I didn't have time to look at a menu and they haven't put one up behind the coffee bar just yet. Which leads me to say...The place is, of course, brand new, and the owners acknowledged that they're still getting it fixed up. Even so, Met Her At A Bar is already a bright spot in the neighborhood, in many ways that its predecessor should have been. So if you live in this area, or frequent it for work, and you're looking for an alternative to Starbucks/The Coffee Bean--go visit Met Her At A Bar. It checks all the boxes of a perfect, locally owned business that deserves patronage."

7/22/2017,20170722,2,4.25,"Well not off to a good start. Take the two star rating with a little grain of salt, but it says they are open until 3 so we walked over only to learn the chef was leaving at 1:45 and they could only make a few of the waffle menu items and nothing else. Will come back to update my review once I get to actually try the food. The ambiance seemed nice though."

7/22/2017,20170722,5,4.0,Cute! Great iced coffee. I really like what the owners have done with this place. It's well decorated and put together. You can tell the owners really care. They got a really good air conditioning system which is such a relief.I'm so excited to have this place open in the neighborhood. They are a welcome addition. They had a soft opening and had plenty of people to service and I thought all was running really smooth.
7/22/2017,20170722,5,4.14,Very cool new place and the coffee is great. They have these glorious large Belgian waffles and the maple syrup is unbelievable. The place looks good and feels clean. They did a great job setting this place up. Can't wait to come back and chill with a cup of that delicious coffee. Calm and perfect for a little mid day reset.#realla#buylocal
7/23/2017,20170723,5,4.25,"Definitely a great place for Breakfast and Lunch. The staff here are the nicest and friendliest. Everything on the menu sounds delicious, it was a difficult decision, but ultimately decided on some Eggs Benedict which were amazing. Can't leave here till you have some of their waffles."
7/30/2017,20170730,5,4.33,Cute little brunch spot. Cold brew was on point. Ordered the Wake up Happy and my friend ordered the Waffle with Berries. Food was great! Nice portion sizes and the staff was so friendly. Only downside is parking but that's pretty standard for the area. Will definitely return!
7/30/2017,20170730,5,4.4,"Went on soft opening weekend, and I'm definitely impressed. Super cute menu.  Ordered the lox and cream cheese bagel which was absolutely perfect. My girlfriend ordered the waffles, eggs, sausage and bacon....everything was great, but those waffles!!!! So light and crispy, with the perfect amount of (real) maple syrup. She said it was the best waffle she's ever had. The coffee was LaColombe, and it was NOICE!"
8/2/2017,20170802,5,4.45,"People work there so nice, service was amazing, the food mmmmm can't say more It's a place you must try if visiting LA, try the cold coffee it's a heart breaking coffee & the waffles just amazing"
8/4/2017,20170804,5,4.5,"I love Met Her at a Bar! This is for sure my new go to local coffee shop in Mid-Wilshire. I've already been four times since their soft opening. The food is excellent, really light waffles and fresh ingredients. The owners and staff are super friendly and thoughtful too, which makes the experience so much better. They did a wonderful job decorating, the place has a great environment, which makes it ideal to get some work done (brownie points!). The place has been very busy since day one, which tells you a lot!"
8/5/2017,20170805,1,4.23,"In almost the best sense of irony, Met Her At A Bar is like that one girl you meet at a bar. Cute esthetic, but an absolute train wreck. Save the morning after walk of shame and pass on this and stay at home instead. My partner is vegetarian but the cashier wouldn't change the eggs Benedict to eggs Florentine when politely asked. In retrospect, they really weren't worth it. My other friend, who got the eggs Benedict, was presented with cold cut ham with basically a hard boiled egg on top- a cardinal sin in the LA brunch scene. I got the breakfast sandwich and again, kinda fitting with the horrible decisions we all make after meeting someone at the bar, I immediately regretted it. It resembled something I would make hungover if I only had one piece of bacon, two eggs and a forgotten frozen eggo waffle permafrosted to the side of the freezer. I will speak positively to the cold-brew. Nice tones and not watery. This place will be closed within two months, but don't worry it's not worth the drive even if you live across the street"
8/5/2017,20170805,2,4.07,"I really wanted this to be a picturesque Los Angeles brunch, but I was sorely disappointed at the customer service, quality of food, and overall lack of consideration for our dining experience.I brought my prima from out of town and wanted to try some place new, and as soon as we got up to the register I regretted it: the cashier was contrite and rude to us, our meals (three of us) were staggered so badly that there was no way to eat together, and the food was mediocre at its best.Sure, I understand missteps because of openings, but uncooked/raw bottoms on quiches (that I waited an additional 15 minutes for), overcooked eggs on a Benedict, and hardly a strip of bacon in a bacon/egg sandwich is not up to par.I'm sure there are nice people that work there, and that the place could improve--but that first interaction with the cashier set the tone for the entire meal: unpleasant and disappointing. I wish I could say different, but sometimes a bar isn't always the best place to meet."
8/5/2017,20170805,5,4.13,This is the best Eggs Benedict I've had in town. I don't know what Chris S is ranting about. You must also try their strawberry waffles and peanut butter granola
8/6/2017,20170806,5,4.19,"First, to the people that left the low star reviews: I'm not sure if we dined at the same restaurant. I absolutely loved this new neighborhood joint! The interior is very well decorated and the food was just as good. Even after reading the poor reviews, we still decided to give this place a shot since it's within walking distance from my apartment. I'm so glad we did bc it's now my new favorite place to go for rice bowls. I got the Met Her Rice Bowl and he got the eggs Benedict but on a waffle. It was super delicious, fresh ingredients, and great plating presentation. I will definitely come back and hope to bring more of my blogger friends here as well bc it's super charming."
8/6/2017,20170806,5,4.24,"This place rocks. The food is great and they made a crazy good waffle benedict! Who knew these would ever be so good! Service was great and the staff is super friendly.What was ordered: waffle benedict - woah. Super good. The hollandaise sauce is excellent. The waffle is perfect, the eggs were poached well and the greens in the side were just as good as the rest.Met Her Rice bowl - perfect portion size. He ingredients were all high quality, the mushrooms tasted great and the avocado adds a great creamy texture to the bowl.Iced americano - solidI'm going to be torn the next time I come here because I won't know if I want to explore the rest of the menu or stick to what I already know is awesome!"
8/6/2017,20170806,4,4.22,Soooo cute inside and The staff is so nice!! We got the waffle breakfast sandwiches. I loved it!!! Parking was easy to find on the street on a Sunday morning. We got here around 9:30 and it wasn't busy at all but started getting busier around 10/10:30.
8/9/2017,20170809,4,4.21,"I can only review the coffee, service and ambiance - we did not eat anything.We walked in and the setting is cute. You can tell they put effort into. The kitchen is open and right behind where you order so it can get noise-y and a little fragrant while you are sitting at your table.I'm a real stickler for good coffee. I ordered an iced almond milk latte and it was fantastic. I love the glasses they put them in (like wine glasses without the stem).I ended up getting another because it was so smooth. Service was nice. They are working out kinks still, but no reason for worry here.I live in Burbank, so I don't see myself making the drive to get here, but if I am in the area and need a place to meet someone, this is as good an option as any."
8/12/2017,20170812,5,4.25,"First time here and surely won't be the last one! Great food, great service, great presentation!! Loved everything, thank you!!!"
8/12/2017,20170812,5,4.29,"Here's a story for you ""A Guy Walks Into A Bar"" and meets a girl and opens a restaurant on La Brea and 8th. Future husband and wife open a new breakfast/brunch/lunch establishment - no pressure there, lol. Creative names on the menu ""wake me up happy"", lead to great food and service with unique dining experience. Enjoy!"
8/13/2017,20170813,4,4.27,"Cute Brunch Spot with Lots of PotentialThe Wilshire/Miracle Mile area doesn't have a whole lot of trendy brunch places IMO, so Met Her At a Bar is a welcome addition to the area. The interior is pretty cool and has a nature loft/outdoor terrace kind of vibe, even though everything is indoors. In terms of the food, waffles are their go to specialties and they have an excellent array of options here. I ordered the Turkey Waffle Sandwich and it was pretty stellar. A tasty combination of flavors with a nice siracha kick. Nom nom nom. I also ordered their chai latte which was also extremely well done. When I came here, the place had literally only been open for less than 2 weeks so I think they were still ironing out a lot of their kinks, specifically when it comes to order work flow. They didn't mess up my order or anything, I think it just took them some time, but this is an issue that most new restaurants face so I don't knock them for this whatsoever, especially since the employees were very friendly and apologetic about everything. My only slight gripe with this place is the hours. As of right now, they're only open 8am - 3pm every day. This can be a bit limiting since I feel like the brunch crowd doesn't usually show up until like 11am or 12pm. Maybe they will expand their hours once the place is on more firm footing? I could also see myself coming here and just plopping down and working on my laptop, but doing that might be hard to do with their current hours... Regardless, Met Her At A Bar has amazing food and beverages so it's definitely worth trying and supporting!"
8/13/2017,20170813,5,4.3,"I'm super picky with the spots I love and I LOVE this place! It's my second time here in 2 weeks, and the service, atmosphere & food is consistently on point! I ordered the overnight oats with berries & chia seeds, a flat white () and avocado toast the 2nd time.Each time we've been here the owner came by the table to ask if everything was good, & you can just feel how much they care about every customer & every plate of food that goes out. In a city were people are just wanting your business, Met Her At A Bar is so much more than that. We will be back!"
8/18/2017,20170818,5,4.33,"I ordered a power chai latte, a breakfast sandwich, and the strawberry ricotta toast. My bestie ordered a black bean wrap and the cold brew. Everything we ordered was AMAZING and I'll be coming back very soon. The owners are super personable and actually met at a bar! I love the concept of this place. Super casual and lowkey. Definitely somewhere to meet someone you've never met, someone you're acquainted with, or someone you know!"
8/19/2017,20170819,4,4.32,I passed by this place out of curiosity on my walk and the photographs attracted me.. the ambiance is comfy and inviting . It has an open and airy feeling.The coffee is fantastic! I did not have the waffles but after looking at their menu it is clear to see that is what they are known for ! When I am in the mood for a sinful treat I will go back and have them . I opted for a simple to the point chicken salad with arugula and it was good. Order at the counter and they bring your food for you . The owners and the staff are all pleasant. Will I go back? Absolutely
8/21/2017,20170821,5,4.35,"Came here this past Saturday with my girlfriend and we both loved it. Had the Avocado Toast and Berry Waffle along with an iced mocha and orange juice. I can't speak to the previous reviews of the poor service, but it seems like they got their act together. Even had employees check on us a few times after we got our food. It is a bit on the pricier side, but everything was great so it's hard to complain. Will definitely be back since it is in walking distance."
8/24/2017,20170824,5,4.37,"Came here on Tuesday before heading to a meeting down the street and fell in love. The owners have done such a great job at decorating the space. The register/coffee bar is so cute, the space is extremely cozy and the service was great. They just opened and are still trying to work out some quirks but the waffles were great (honestly every waffle item they had sounded great) and their coffee was better than other I've had recently. Will definitely be back to try the other waffle sandwiches! Really hope this place will make it. It's just what La Brea needed! PS- the owners are extremely sweet. Made everything that much better."
8/26/2017,20170826,5,4.39,"First visit, excellent service and food. The presentation was outstanding. It was very busy on the Saturday I came but as long as the wait seemed and worth it. La Colombe drip coffee was on point, I highly recommend this place. Hands down better than the place it replaced."
8/27/2017,20170827,5,4.41,"Been here twice now and both times the food has been great. The breakfast burrito really knocked my socks off! Only downside: it can be difficult to find an open spot to sit for weekend brunch. Looks like some early negative reviews must have been before they hit their stride, because I've had nothing but positive experiences so far. Really glad to have an upscale but still casual place like this in the neighborhood!"
8/28/2017,20170828,3,4.37,"A typical petite-sized, fancy brunch place in LA with cute decor with wooden theme and greeneries inside the store. Parking was such a hassle around this area, we had to park 2 blocks away from the place and since there was a lot of constructions these days on Wilshire, traffic was also bad. We got lucky because we immediately got a long table for the 7 of us. After we ordered, the place got super crowded and the line was long. We shared 4 dishes between us: waffle benedict, strawberry ricotta toast, bagel & lox, and waffle with berries. The food was presented very beautifully, excellent details on the aesthetic, but there were some problems with the taste and texture.The poached eggs on the waffle benedict were too overcooked, which were basic failures for eggs benedict. The strawberry ricotta toast was also a bummer for me, I didn't like the ricotta spread on the toast, the combo just didn't work. The only thing that satisfied me was the bagel&lox. My bro also got the espresso and he had some trouble with the beans not filtered properly. I might not recommend this place to my friends because there are other great brunch places around that area."
9/2/2017,20170902,2,4.29,"This place reminded me of Alien: Covenant. The crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escapeI had just picked up my friend from the airport and we were on our way to a tried and true brunch spot when we came across the waffle sign. Looked at pictures on yelp and it looked inviting. Here's what was ordered...1) Liege Waffle, $3... It was okay. Tasted like the packaged variety sold in Costco.2) Americano, $3... Despite using good quality La Colombe beans, the coffee tasted dirty. 3) Breakfast Sandwich, $10... I don't have enough time to describe how insulting this sandwich was. The bread was dry, no butter, no spread of any kind. On top of that, it wasn't toasted right. Soggy and chewy... Frozen? The scrambled egg was terrible on all counts. Over cooked and rubbery with some melted cheese that added no flavor. The arugula was partially wilted and mostly fell out because there was nothing holding it together. Lastly, the avocado that was mentioned as an ingredient was hiding out as a sliver on the edge of the bread. Closing comments... $20 later, what looked like a very promising new find was actually such a disappointment that I could never recommend anyone coming here. The food has the execution of a bus stop restaurant stuck in the 90s."
9/2/2017,20170902,5,4.31,"Great addition to the neighborhood. Met Her at a Bar is cool , hip and well.. darn good! So far we have enjoyed their eggs benedict and the waffles. Their espresso drinks are tasty and just right. The owners have really upgraded the spot from the previous Muse cafe - which is a huge improvement. Weekday mornings are pretty chill as you can see in my photo but weekends and mid-day it gets busy. We will most definitely be back soon."
9/6/2017,20170906,5,4.33,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place. Stopped by today for the first time after dropping off artwork at Liz's gallery. The capers/lox/cream cheese/waffle dish was sooo delicious. Just a wonderful blend of flavors that works super well.
9/13/2017,20170913,5,4.35,Needed to have breakfast before going to the Argentine Consultant nearby. Staff was friendly and the food was great. I had the breakfast sandwich and my son had the waffle sandwich. Savory. The best part is they serve La Columbe coffee. Definitely worth the visit. Interior and atmosphere is cool.
9/14/2017,20170914,4,4.34,"The last reviews I read for this place seem oddly off especially the Alien Covenant person...that was just weird, BUT good hook to your review, it kept me reading. I actually really didn't want to come here. By looking on the outside, it just appeared too simple, but I was pleasantly surprised! The inside is real cool. The wooden tables, leather booths, the light fixtures, it's all pretty cool. The tables are set up so you can come as small group, large groups, or sit communally and make some new friends. The staff is real friendly and welcoming. They're excited to be here and you can tell they enjoy what they do. The menu in terms of quantity is perfect for a breakfast/brunch place. You're not overwhelmed by what to choose and the items are described in a way that make you want to come back to try something new. The espresso is amazing. Didn't catch what kind of bean is used but it's smooth and very enjoyable. I came with a roommate and we have tried the following:Chorizo Burrito: (g/f) The flavor is this was really nice. It wasn't super spicy and surprisingly it tasted a little sweet to me. The potatoes could have been crispier but it didn't take away from the overall enjoyability of the meal. The avocado was fresh and the tortilla was heated just right. The side mixed green was also fresh.The Power Bowl: (v) please get this at least once. It's amazing! I was really surprised by this. I wanted to ""be healthy"" and thought this was going to bore me and leave me hungry but it did not. The flavor of this is amazing and I think it's pretty simple. The dressing for the salad is a nice tangy flavor. The quinoa was cooked perfectly. The poached eggs were a little runny for my taste BUT they were poached eggs. The cranberries and sliced almonds, YUM x1000. This tasted like it should have been bad to eat, but it wasn't. The Wake Up Waffle: two waffles, eggs, bacon, and sausage. This is good to share. The waffles, the whipped butter, and the syrup was all delicious. The eggs were scrambled fine. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the bacon or sausage. The bacon was burnt, not crispy and the sausage I think was breaded and deep fried...too much. That's the only reason there are 4 stars."
9/18/2017,20170918,5,4.36,"So great to see this cute new casual breakfast/lunch place in the neighborhood. I had the waffle and lox, which is not a combination I would have thought of, but it was delicious. My partner got the Wake Up Happy with crispy waffles and a skillet of eggs, bacon and sausage. Delish! Unfortunately both dishes looked so good that we attacked the food before we thought to take any pics!"
9/21/2017,20170921,5,4.38,"My daughter and I were excited to see this restaurant emerge from the ashes of the vegan establishment that preceded it. Sure, they had their hipster poetry readings. But it never had that intangible quality of warmth, a place you want to stay for a while, that feels like home.That is what embraces you the moment you walk inside this new restaurant. Two young owners who are bravely taking on a new adventure and welcoming you to stay awhile. My daughter and her middle school friends see it as a rite of passage, too. They get to walk here on their own and order coffee drinks and fancy waffles and post it on their Snapchats. I went there with my babe when it first opened. Some neighbors had also walked in. We looked at each other knowingly and full of grace as it was the soft opening, and they were obviously figuring things out. The chef was reading from a recipe guide. I went back the other day with my baby girl and enjoyed a fluffy waffle artfully complimented with the right amount of Nutella, strawberries and bananas. My appetite is such that I can hardly finish anything I ever order, but I scarfed this down. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and airy on the inside, made by one of the owners. They are looking for all kinds of new employees according to the sign on the door. These reviews need to all take a deep breath.Because, I don't understand reviews that put down these waffles. What planet are you from? Or are you from a competing restaurant? Leave these kids alone."
10/2/2017,20171002,5,4.39,Very cute spot to go have a brunch date with my girlfriend their presentation for their waffles is hands-down beautiful down to the little flower they add . Customer service is spot on . They are attentive . Thank you so much !
10/9/2017,20171009,4,4.38,"The place itself is very cute. Not a full scale restaurant or anything, but a small, cute cafe. I thought because of the word, ""bar"" in the name and because of the hours, it would be a bit more...hmm...hipster? But it is like a blend between a cute Asian cafe and a hipster brunch spot. The food itself is simple, and decent. It all seems like something basic you can have anywhere. It isn't bad, but it also does not stand out. Perhaps if the design and plating of the food was different? I had the waffle and berries, and it does not look like the pictures posted on their IG page. However, it tasted delicious. I think that the food is made from scratch and is pretty good. The syrup used is ACTUAL maple syrup! YAY! The ambiance is warm and relaxing. The decor is more nature-ish and woodsy. The seating is plentiful and nice. It definitely feels like a place for stopping by for a nice, relaxing breakfast item."
10/14/2017,20171014,5,4.4,I ordered the strawberry ricotta toast. I think it's delicious! I sampled some of my tables plates and the waffles are tasty! The service was excellent. It's a hidden gem in our neighborhood
10/22/2017,20171022,1,4.32,"This is in response to the owner's message to my review.Your offer for me to come back in with a free meal on you was nice gesture, but it wasn't good enough. My husband and I would never step foot in your establishment again - that's how atrocious the food was. What you should've offered me was my money back.Bottom line, there's no excuse to have an unqualified busboy playing chef for customers because your chef showed up to work drunk. You have a back up chef or don't serve food at all. It's not mine or any other guests' problem that your chef was inebriated and you had to send him home. It's apparent you care more about profit on a busy weekend brunch by taking people's money and overcharging for food that is complete and utter crap. Shame on you."
10/22/2017,20171022,4,4.31,"We went to Met Her At A Bar on a Saturday morning for brunch. Seating was limited, so my friends and I had to scout for a bit until we finally got a table. I ordered the Wafflebello which was surprisingly good. The place is pretty small, but well-decorated and we appreciated the aesthetic. Overall, not a bad place for a weekend brunch!"
11/5/2017,20171105,3,4.28,Totally not worth the price. I ordered Wake up happy for $15. All I got is a normal waffle plus a little portion of egg and bacon. They ran out of sausage but never warned me... waffle not crispy at all.
11/13/2017,20171113,4,4.27,"I loved it a waffley a lot! (Translation: I loved it awfully a lot!) The customer service is great and the waffles are crisped to perfection! Their homemade maple butter is dangerously delightful! The ambiance is nice but it is too cold and loud. Walked out with a happy full tummy but a headache from the loud music. Service is really great, just not sure I'd be back but only because the music was too loud and the AC was too cold...my friend and I are both 30 and we felt the same about the noise and the temperature. Check out my pics to see the tasty food!"
11/17/2017,20171117,5,4.29,"Such a great spot for breakfast and lunch!Breakfast if very waffle and egg heavy, for those that do or don't like that. I made a split time decision for the strawberry ricotta toast, and couldn't be happier. The bread was a pillow of softness, the ricotta whipped like clouds, and the strawberry/jam topping was sweet, drizzled in lemon zest and basil. TLDR; going back asap.The coffee/espresso drinks were fabulous, the customer service great, and the food all came out very quickly. More of a place for brunch with a friend than bringing your laptop to get work done, and one that I can't wait to come back for!"
11/19/2017,20171119,4,4.28,I've been meaning to make my way to Met Her At A Bar for some times now. Today was the day and I must say it was nothing crazy. A cute simple Caffé that serves waffles and coffee. It was packed but not that long of the wait. The service at the counter was odd the guy was taking my order and making drinks not that attentive I was kinda confused. There isn't much seating but I snagged a place outside. I ordered the Mocha Latte and the Waffle Breakfast. A simple breakfast with four mini waffles with eggs and bacon. Pricing was a bit much for what I ordered $22 for a breakfast is much. I wasn't wowed but I'll definitely give them another try there was a few things on the menu I want to try out. Maybe the hype got to me and I expect much more.
11/25/2017,20171125,3,4.26,"Bizarre name for a waffle place, especially one that closes at 3pm. Waffle Bar perhaps?I had the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich, which is simply scrambled eggs, cheese, and bacon in between two waffles. You can eat as is or pull the waffles apart and eat as an egg breakfast. I definitely enjoyed my meal, but it was overpriced ($13) for the basics.Cute little kitchen and nice seating area. Also, pretty hard to find it on Yelp, unless you type in the exact name."

11/30/2017,20171130,5,4.29,"This is probably the cutest coffee shop I've ever been too, the staff was so friendly and the coffee was amazing. I'll definitely be back"
12/17/2017,20171217,5,4.3,"I love this little place. Great vibe and friendly employees. Delicious options- including everything from vegan options to sandwiches made of waffles. Delicious coffee, but like normal coffee. This is not the place to get your local honey lavender rose tips peppermint mocha java frapp with oat milk. Although that sounds delicious... Come early if you want to dodge the crowd a bit. At busy times there's not much seating. I personally heart the berry chia overnight oats with almond milk. My bf likes bacon and eggs exploding out of a waffle sandwich. We both manage to be happy here :)"
12/18/2017,20171218,5,4.31,1st time at this place which is right around the corner from me -- glad I finally tried it! My review basically comes down to the scrambled eggs with cheddar. I've been searching for a place that cooks them like my dear grandmother used to -- fluffy with cheese perfectly melted. Let me say I've never found a place that does them remotely close to how well she cooked them...until yesterday. They. Were. Amazing.The waffles with maple butter along with sausage and bacon were delicious as well! Everything was also reasonably priced. Definitely a great spot and worth trying.
12/19/2017,20171219,5,4.33,"I love this new little place. Clean, Cool vibe. I got quick service, it was at a reasonable price, and it was delicious. The staff was very nice and helpful. There is also free WiFi. I'll definitely be going back regularly."
12/23/2017,20171223,5,4.34,This is a cute neighborhood cafe with lots of character. The staff is amazing and accommodating
1/2/2018,20180102,3,4.31,"For a neighborhood that has some pretty excellent brunch spots, this place was just ok. It's a good spot to hit if you live close by, but it's not necessarily worth traveling for. We got the breakfast burrito (which was tasty but had a lot of liquid coming out of it which rendered it soggy) and the grain bowl (good, but nothing special). The coffee was good and the service was friendly though! Overall, it's a solid place to go if you're craving some coffee and waffles, but if you're looking for something a little more, you may be better served with another brunch spot in the area."
1/5/2018,20180105,5,4.33,"I've been here twice and both times were absolutely amazing. The first time, I had the All American Breakfast, Waffle & Berries, Power Chai Latte, & shared the Avocado Toast with a friend. The 2nd time, I had the Wafflebello Sandwich. I usually don't like savory waffle dishes, but this was phenomenal. Everything I've tried here has been phenomenal! What makes this neighborhood spot so great is the staff. They are so unbelievably friendly that you can't leave without being in a better mood afterwards. I really love this place, & I look forward to going back to try everything else on the menu."
1/13/2018,20180113,5,4.34,"This place is very welcoming! Small and quaint with a homie feel to it. The food is EXCELLENT! The owner Mindy and her husband are very friendly! The chef makes the best eggs I've ever tasted from any establishment, they were super light and fluffy! I am most definitely going back to try everything on the menu! I would have posted a pic of my food but I had demolished half of it before I could remember."
1/23/2018,20180123,4,4.33,"Who knew you could meet a girl at a bar and it turn into a happy ending. Well this 'Met Her At A Bar' cafe, is a perfect embodiment of a successful connection. This newly opened love affair offers an array of freshly baked items, a solid coffee menu, waffles, and yes, they have bacon. I thought it was a nice touch with having many items on the menu be named after common relationship expressions. This place with its cozy cottage motif and a touch of modern flair, gave me an enjoyable experience from beginning to end. A noticeably lively vibe was present, not only from the customers, but from the staff. Hmmm...the only thing missing here is alcohol. But hey I get it, take out the liquid courage, leave the pleasurable experience. Upon entering, you must first place your order at the counter, grab a number, then cop-a-squat. The staff were friendly, informative, and attentive...and of course always smiled. My order was 'you make me Wake Up Happy'...I have a comment for that, but let's keep this about the restaurant, shall we. This order consists of a couple pieces of bacon(I added an extra order, shush), scrambled eggs, two sausages, side waffle, and maple butter(Bombass Sathy). The scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages were served on a Hot mini cast iron pan...meaning, don't touch or you'll burn your... The eggs were done perfectly, light, fluffy and flavorful. I wouldn't change a thing. The sausages were really good. The waffles were really good as well, but should be more crispy...and if I may suggest, another kick of vanilla, as I didn't taste much.  Last but never the least, bacon. I did like the bacon, nice flavor, however the size and richness of the pig was lackluster. The plating approach was simple, and balanced. But lacked the WoW factor. Because the items are a bit pricey, the customer needs to see that translate to their order. More bang for the almighty buck, right. I say, if you're going to have high pricing, regardless of the neighborhood, smack dat thick slab of bacon down. Never sacrifice quality.  My coffee of choice was the Chai Tea Latte, which I dirtied up(double shot of espresso). I was very pleased with this. Because my overall experience was excellent, I will return and try that cold brew I've been hearing good things about.  The only thing left to do is find out which bar he met her at."
1/26/2018,20180126,5,4.34,"Pretty good place. Had the Avocado Toast Me, Waffletella and You Make Me Wake Up Happy. Their waffle is my favorite. The waffle is crunchy, but light and fluffy inside. Most get soggy and soft if you don't eat them right away, but not theirs. Definitely going back. Go and check it out."
1/27/2018,20180127,5,4.36,"Such an adorable neighborhood cafe that's good for breakfast and lunch! The staff was very welcoming and hardworking, excellent food and coffee. For breakfast I ordered the classic Eggs Benedict with a macchiato. The egg benedict came with a side of salad that was just enough to fill me up. For parking, there is street parking you just have to read the signs.Check into Yelp for a drip coffee or hot tea!"
2/4/2018,20180204,5,4.37,"Tried this spot today based on Yelp reviews. I absolutely Loved it and will be back! The ambiance was nice, a chill spot to enjoy Sunday breakfast with little fuss. You stand in line to order your food and grab seats inside or outside. The team is extremely attentive and the customer service is top notch. I enjoyed a cappuccino (well actually 2) and the crispy French toast which was Delicious! Who knew corn flakes on French toast would be so tasty? The portion sizes are good if you are coming with am appetite. The presentation of my food and other dishes I saw make them easily sharable. I will be back to try that Nutella waffle"
2/10/2018,20180210,5,4.38,"Service was fast, friendly, and food was delicious. I got the waffle Benedict and the waffles are the perfect balance of savory and saucy. The side salad with it had a delicious vinaigrette. The breakfast burrito had so much flavor it was unbelievable. I will definitely be going again."
2/10/2018,20180210,4,4.37,"So I've been twice and the food has held up and been consistent.However, on my most recent visit the was a health code violation. Now before you dog lovers go nuts, I like dogs...but dogs are not allowed inside food retail and grocery stores unless they are service dogs per 114259.5 of the California Retail Code. Let's keep our furry friends where they belong for EVERYONE'S comfort outside on the Patio!!"
2/11/2018,20180211,5,4.38,"Drove up La Brea on a Saturday afternoon and saw on the awning ""Coffee and Waffle Bar."" Drove back on a Sunday morning to check out this spot for the first time. It's a super-cute rustic breakfast and brunch spot with communal and bar seating. The layout is a bit snug but there is also outdoor seating if you want more air. I chose to sit inside because they were playing jazz.At 9:45 on a Saturday morning, it was getting to be a tad busy. Staff was friendly and happy, everyone is smiling which was one of the reasons why I chose to eat-in then take out.I ordered the Wake Up Happy plate with scrambled eggs cooked perfectly, crispy bacon, sausage and Belgian waffles. Their coffee is also brewed to perfection so no sugar or cream was needed.I had a pleasant experience for my first time here that i would definitely come back soon to try the rest of the menu. Parking is in the residential area but you have about an hour or two. Watch the signs as parking enforcement are on top of their game in this area."
2/16/2018,20180216,5,4.39,"Adorable little brunch spot that's now one of my favorites. The owners and staff are so sweet and welcoming. Definitely will be coming here more often since it's down the street. Waffles are great. I've only had the ""wake up happy"" and can't seem to pick something else since it's perfect and simple. I'll eventually get more adventurous. I've heard great things about their other menu items. Cold brew is well made."
2/17/2018,20180217,5,4.4,So yummy!! Really great place! There was a problem with our order but immediately the manager came over and attended to us! Even gave us a free waffle. The food is amazing and well made! Will definitely be back!
2/18/2018,20180218,2,4.36,"Located off la brea right before you get to wilshire, this lovely named place is just that. A great name. Our meal was NOT appealing in the slightest.We ordered:Plain waffle with whip $10 Beautifully presented but tasted like air. Literally. Should have gotten the dessert waffle that was in the case by the register. Vegan wrap $13 give or takeChalk full of lettuce with slim pickings of everything else. No flavor at all. Come with a vinagarette dressing that's sour. Bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich made on a waffle ( no idea how much this was)Same Thing, no flavor. Maybe we should have ordered avocado or ricotta toast or ANYTHING else on the menu. It just didn't hit the spot for us. The place had a line out of the door when we got there today, the seating is order at the register and seat yourself. Atmosphere is like your at a concert when eating inside and a midnight summers day outside. Probably wouldn't come back."
2/18/2018,20180218,4,4.36,"Very nice little breakfast/brunch spot. I was there on a early Sunday afternoon and they had a short line out the door. It's a small place with seating for 35 or so inside and a few tables outside on the sidewalk. I got the Waffle Benedict which comes with an arugula salad on the side. The eggs were a little too poached for my taste, but that's personal preference. The hollandaise sauce was delicious, as was the waffle. I hope to make it back on future trips to LA"
2/19/2018,20180219,4,4.35,"First time here...ordered strawberry ricotta toast and the breakfast waffle...everything's good!! Just took a while to get out order, but We'll still be back and try the avocado toast. Just a little pricey but at least the food is good!"
2/20/2018,20180220,5,4.36,"This is the greatest place for brunch before 3pm i mean i was in shocked at all the clean plate I saw. When we got our food we cleaned our plates and still wanted more the portions were more than enough but I promise you it's that good, the only thing they don't have is turkey bacon or chicken sausage which sucks if you don't eat pork but other than that I am in love!"
2/24/2018,20180224,5,4.37,"DELICIOUS!I had the Siracha turkey waffle Sandwhich with an added scrambled egg. It was perfect. My friend had the beet and kale salad and though it was delicious. Another had the waffle breakfast Sandwhich. All were delicious. We got there just before a ""rush"" and were able to sit quickly but it took some time to get our food. Howerver the servers were very gracious and apologetic about it and checked on us often. We had two toddlers with us and they and other diners were very welcoming even assisting us with stroller parking. We brunched at our leisure and had an all around great time!"
2/24/2018,20180224,4,4.37,"This place has probably the best french toast in town. The best one I've had for sure and I order them everywhere. So Beautifully served that you almost don't want to eat it. My fiancé had a burrito and he said it was delicious too. Would give them 5 starts but my Cappuccino tasted kind of weird, like matcha almost and I ordered a regular one."
2/27/2018,20180227,5,4.38,Wow. I have to say this is one of the best surprises in food I've had in a long time. Food was amazing. New and delightful. Great deal of care and pride put into the preparation and delivery of of the waffle meals. So good. Service excellent and chai tea latte was perfect too.
3/2/2018,20180302,5,4.38,I loved this place!! The ambiance and the vibes were so good!! My fiancé had their waffle and berries and i had the bello bello waffle sandwich. Our brunch was AMAZING!!!!! Definitely worth a shot
3/3/2018,20180303,5,4.39,"Waffles were great, homemade whip cream was legit! Homemade cold brew hit the spot I'll definitely be coming back!"
3/10/2018,20180310,4,4.39,"Found my brunch place if I'm craving waffles or a breakfast burrito! Met Her At A Bar is a small, cozy restaurant. So, if there is a line out the door, no worries because it won't take too long to get to the counter to order your food. Once your food is ordered and paid for, it's a seat yourself type of situation. Their service is top notch - everyone is super friendly and attentive! ""Can I see you again Waffles & Berries"" is served with homemade honey whipped cream and seasonal berries (mine had strawberries and blueberries). The honey whipped cream is not too sweet and adds a nice touch to the waffle. I only needed to add a small amount of syrup because it's already good without it. The price is a bit steep for only one waffle, but it is delicious!""Met Her Breakfast Burrito"" has Italian sausage, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sesame oil, sour cream and a side of chipotle salsa and mixed greens. All the components work really well together to their tasty flavor profile. This is easily my favorite breakfast burrito. One of my go-tos for brunch is a breakfast burrito. So, living only a few blocks away, I will definitely be back! I did minus one star because it is a bit pricey here."
3/10/2018,20180310,4,4.38,"I would give it closer to a 3.75 if I had the chance lol I went here on 3/10 which is a Saturday. Fairly packed but found a place to sit easily. You order at the counter and then sit down or take it to go. Lots of waffle options (indulgent) which I love since LA seems to do brunch very very lightly. I got the PBJ Bacon sandwich which I believe is new to the menu. It was overall good, a little overpowering with the amount of peanut butter but it filled me up and satisfied my craving. The cappuccino was good too! My boyfriend at the prosciutto sandwich and the prosciutto was pretty dang fatty even for prosciutto. Overall a good, tasty brunch with very nice staff. Everyone was very welcoming!!!"
3/11/2018,20180311,5,4.39,"When you hit up a spot 2 days in a row, you know it's legit! Came here around 11 on a Saturday. Place was a bit packed, but we were able to find seats by the window, no problem. The hubby and I both ordered the Wake Up Happy & we were not sad about it. The drip coffee & power chai were the cherry on top! Came around 2 on a Sunday. Place was packed, yet again. No surprise there. It's easy to see why. Found ""our"" seats by the window, though. Easy peasy. He ordered the Wake Up Happy again. I ordered the Avocado Toast with an egg on top. Best avocado toast I've ever had! So fresh & tasty. I may have to add some bacon next time. Mmmmm... And that freshly squeezed OJ? Perfection! An Adam Sandler sighting ain't too bad, either. You're 2 for 2, MHAAB!"
3/12/2018,20180312,5,4.4,"No joke the day before we went I was telling my boyfriend I was craving waffles. There have been places that were mediocre and I was praying this place would be outstanding. Let's just say it met my expectations and then some! Met Her At A Bar was small and quaint. There was a line out the door but the line moved at a decent pace.We were in a rush so I decided to order to-go. I was nervous that we would not get our food on time but that was not the case. Ordering was pretty simple. It was straight forward. You had the option of picking up right away or setting a specific time. Since we ordered to-go, we were only in line to grab our food and go. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. We were greeted and asked if we wanted a menu. I went on to tell the lady we had an order and she quickly went to go find it.This is the best part, the food was ready at the time they said it was. Talk about accuracy! We ordered the ""Can I see you again Waffles and Berries"" and the ""Oh no you didn't Siracha Turkey Waffle."" The Waffles and berries had whip cream, seasonal berries and syrup. The balance between berries to waffle was a great blend. You honestly don't even need the syrup there is so many flavors going on. The Siracha Turkey waffle had arugula, tomato, carrots, onions, cheddar cheese, siracha and mayo. This one was my favorite out of the two. It was the perfect combination of everything and the arugula was the perfect pairing. Words cannot express how much I liked this sandwich. The waffle was not too sweet but you can definitely tell you're eating a waffle. I am not a big fan of spicy food but this was not too spicy and I inhaled the sandwich rather quickly. I would recommend this place to go to for brunch or early lunch. Although we only tried two items, I already want to go back to try more!"
3/16/2018,20180316,5,4.41,"(+) Anything waffle(-) Crowded, not alot of space to sit and be comfortable""Met Her At A Bar"" is one of those brunch places in LA that is a must go. The variety is great, and the name of each dish is creative and takes after two people falling in love. It's cute. I found ""Met Her At A Bar"" on YELP by searching waffles in the downtown LA area. I had minimal expectations heading into the restaurant, but was pleasantly surprised. Here are some thoughts:Food: My girlfriend and I shared the ""Oh no you didn't Siracha Turkey Waffle,"" and the ""Can I see you again Waffle and Berries."" The sriracha turkey waffle is a sandwich comprised of arugula, tomato, carrots, onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha, and mayo in between two toasty and warm waffles. For those of who you might think it could be spicy, it really isn't. The amount of sriracha added to the sandwich is minimal, but they do have bottles in the restaurant for those of you who'd like more! The turkey was similar to deli meat, but the overall flavor was perfect and the waffle had some sweetness that added to the flavor. Many waffle sandwiches I've eaten in the past were disappointing, but this one didn't disappoint. The waffle and berries was everything I expected and more. The berries we had were raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries. The syrup is sweet and you honestly don't need too much of it because the waffle itself has a hint of sweetness. Ambiance: We ordered for pick up, but the restaurant is compact and there was a line out of the door. It was very loud inside, with a lot of moving parts in such a small area. If you're someone who doesn't like crowds and having a meal with people standing around/next to you, I would order take out to avoid the hassle and uncomfortable situations. Parking: there is street parking, but good luck! You might have to walk far, but it is doable. :) Service: There was a lady who met us outside as my girlfriend and I were waiting in line to pick up our phone order. She asked us if we've been here before and we told her we were picking up food, so she went in and got the food for us. She saved us time because we would have been waiting in the same line as the guests who were ordering. Great service is meeting your guests in line to take care of their needs/questions. I would recommend ""Met Her At A Bar"" for anyone who loves brunch, and/or waffles. I cannot wait to come back and try the many other items on the menu. Outside of the craziness and crowd, ""Met Her At A Bar"" met expectations, especially the food aspect."
3/18/2018,20180318,3,4.39,This place is PAAAAAACKKKKKED on weekends for brunch. I always drove by heading back to westside and felt it was a dope spot to visit but no idea how crowded it was going to be Saturday morning around 1130. Met my bestie here and realized it's a order then grab a seat type of place. I really need to read the air better bc we were outside for over 10 minutes waiting on a waiter to seat us before we realized it. They really should have a sign or something for aloof ppl haha. The food was great but priced kinda high since it doesn't have any sides. I didn't feel totally full after my waffle benedict.
3/24/2018,20180324,4,4.38,"SYNOPSIS:1) Located on the corner of 8th St. and La Brea Ave. Street parking mostly. Park in residentiall or along 8th St..2) Order first! Same procedure as Poppy + Rose. If you're uncomfortable with tipping first, you can just tip after your meal.3) Cost is a bit a high, because of location. I gets it!4) Inside and outdoor seatings available. Tables and chairs are a bit small if you sit outside. A bit cramped inside, so take deep breaths and just embrace the ambiance.5) Open kitchen! If you can, get a seat there! See the kitchen staff in action! If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen! :P6) Owner is great. He'll get down and dirty among the staffers to provide great service to all his patrons.7) If something is wrong or you don't like something, speak up! They'll replace whatever you like. As for me, my bacon was overly fried. I spoke up and was rewarded a bacon that met my standards.8) Get the Wake Up Happy! Scrambled eggs, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips, and 4 pieces of side waffle with powdered sugar and their homemade whip butter. Surprisingly, this item doesn't make you feel like you ran into a wall after eating it. Kudos, M.H.A.B! :)MHAB For Thought: Get your brunch on!!"
3/25/2018,20180325,4,4.38,"I'll start by saying it's my second time here and I'll definitely love to come back. There are many things I love about the place. The food is delicious, especially the sweet waffle with Nutella, bananas, and strawberries. It is a bit on the pricey side, probably because of the location.There's usually easy to find street parking which is very convenient. The place is a bit small but offers both outside and inside seating. Cute decor ideas and mini details such as pretty flowers on the tables , a piano in one corner and coffee mugs with different quotes. Adorable!It has an open kitchen and it can get pretty heated inside. So if you don't want to be close to the action get a table outside. Overall a great brunch spot. Be prepared to wait a little longer for your food, while you enjoy a delicious coffee (my latte was on point); I recommend that. We noticed the owner was also there helping with everything he could. He didn't mind getting dirty with everyone else and I admire that in a manager! The only reason I took a star off is some minor details I noticed in the kitchen. They were pretty busy and rushing to make everything on time. I think they had some issues with the waffle makers but the food still came out delicious. However, there was a lady making the waffles who dressed a little unprofessional to put it delicately. She was wearing a pink t-shirt and jeans with an apron over it. Nothing too out of the ordinary at first glance. But once she turned around you can see how her jeans slipped a little further down and T-shirt didn't help a lot so you could see parts of her lower back and beyond. No need to focus on that, it happens to everyone but please pay attention to this as it could be a deal breaker for someone else."
3/26/2018,20180326,4,4.37,"3.5 StarThis place first grabbed my attention because of the name. Then when I checked their photos, I was even more interested because I love waffles!Went on Monday for brunch and this place was packed! I got Wake Up Happy and yes I was def satisfied and happy after killing the whole thing. Their waffle was on the thin side and was crispy. The scramble egg was a little bit disappointing because it is on the dry side. Bacon was nice and crispy. The whole thing was served on the hot cast iron so food was nice and warm when served. Since it was crowded, it did take some time for us to get our food. I did enjoy the waffle but I do think there is space of improvement for waffle flavors. Flavors were great but not impressive, it kinds of remind me of eggos."
3/27/2018,20180327,3,4.36,"Came here for brunch and wasn't impressed.This restaurant is quite small and gets packed on weekend brunch days. I waited over half an hour for a table to open up after I'd ordered and it was very crowded inside. I ordered a chipotle chicken sandwich and a drip coffee. The chicken sandwich was around $10 and I thought there was really nothing special about it. It came with some lettuce, tomatoes, and corn and felt like a sandwich I could get in the deli section of a grocery store. Also, while the menu said there would be avocados in the wrap, I didn't get any avocado. When I asked a waiter, he told me it wasn't supposed to come with avocado but I had distinctly remembered ordering that item because there was avocado listed in its ingredients. That same waiter eventually came back with a plate of avocado and apologized, stating that the chef had forgotten. Even then, it was only a few slices of avocado.Overall, I thought Met Her at a Bar was just alright and I probably wouldn't come back because of the wait and average food."
3/30/2018,20180330,3,4.34,"Met Her At A Bar was a nice quick stop for breakfast before work. My friend was visiting from Ohio and Met Her At A Bar was a great location to start our day (mine for work and hers at LACMA). By checking in you get a free coffee or iced tea (which is a great way to make your customers extra happy before they even try the food!). I ordered the special bowl of the day, which came with two poached eggs, quinoa, kale, dried cranberries and sliced almonds. It was a very filling bowl and I enjoyed the different aspects/ingredients on an individual basis. However, overall, it was not the most flavorful or cohesive of dishes. Met Her At A Bar is known for their sweet and savory waffle sandwiches so one of those menu items would probably be more of a hit than my bowl was. Our server was very friendly and the whole experience was satisfying but nothing extraordinary. In comparison to some of the truly innovative and high quality brunch/breakfast spots around LA, I don't think I would be likely to return to Met Her At A Bar, but for those in the mood for their specialty waffle sandwiches it may be a good option."
4/1/2018,20180401,5,4.35,"I love it here, been visiting this place so many times because the ambience is cool and got friendly crews."
4/4/2018,20180404,5,4.36,"You guys, this place is delicious! The presentation is beautiful as well. we had the waffles, avocado toast, coffee, and tea. Everything here is made from scratch and using all organic ingredients. Even the service is on point. I love everything about this place and will be back 100%."
4/5/2018,20180405,4,4.35,"I was doing a tour of the Paramount Studios so I checked Yelp for a mid-city spot for breakfast and Met Her At a Bar popped up with good reviews. I bookmarked the spot and went the next morning. I arrived about 8:10 and there were 5 or 6 customers just placing their order. You place your order, pay, take a number on a metal stand, and then your food is brought to your table.When it was my turn, I went with the bello bello Waffle Bello sandwich and a cappuccino. I asked the person who took my order if I could sit at the bar and he answered, ""Certainly!""From my stool, I watched the people cooking eggs, making waffles, and all the other good stuff that goes on in a restaurant kitchen. Met Her At a Bar is a small, neighborhood kind of place and it got busy fast. During the week, parking would be an issue but being Saturday morning and early, I parked on LaBrea and walked across the street.The barista (it turned out to be the co-owner) brought my cappuccino and brunch formally started. While enjoying the view from my seat, I sipped the cappuccino and enjoyed the show.Then my waffle bello sandwich arrived. This is what it is: portobello mushrooms, over medium egg, avocado, tomato, organic greens, cilantro aioli. The only thing I changed was to have a sunny side egg. I took one bite of the waffle as a sandwich and then I went to my knife and fork. Better to enjoy myself without having avocado and egg yolk all over me. This savory waffle made a good breakfast sandwich.The staff was very friendly and engaging. When I asked about the name, the co-owner pointed to the woman and said, ""met her in a bar."" What a clever name for a place.I'd advise getting there early. As I said before, it got busy fast and most of the seats were taken.It was with a broad smile on my face that I crossed LaBrea to get back to the car. The food and the staff made my day start off wonderfully!Good luck to you all!"
4/5/2018,20180405,5,4.36,"All I can say is if you love waffles this is the place to be!! The owners were really nice and this restaurant feels warm and full of love. I've only gone on the weekdays because on the weekends it is most likely to be packed! P.S make sure to get some maple butter on the side, you won't regret it!"
4/7/2018,20180407,5,4.37,"I read Jeff V.'s review and I had to get here...This place is great! I enjoyed the decor, especially the piano, the live plants, and the portraits of famous people on the wall! The service was excellent! We ordered at the counter and our meals were brought to us! The friendly owners even stopped by to chat with us. They were thrilled that we were from San Leandro, Torrance, Long Beach, and Honolulu!The food was outstanding! My friends had the Chorizo Toast, Breakfast sandwich (no photo), and the colorful ""You Make Me Wake Up Happy"" waffle. I had the ""I miss you Lox + waffle"" which was basically waffle and lox! The lox was fresh and not too salty! The capers popped my meal subtly while the cream cheese added some mystery!I asked for a bunny on my latte, but got better... a heart! How cool is that? Now I need a key...haha!We found free street parking, appreciated the convenient restroom, and had a super fun time! I'm sure we'll return to this cozy neighborhood spot on the corner!"
4/7/2018,20180407,4,4.36,Really delicious food and great atmosphere. The Strawberry Arugula salad is my favorite and its filling! Great place for a date or a meeting. Laptop seating available during non peak hours.
4/17/2018,20180417,5,4.37,"This place is so fun! I went here for brunch with a friend on a Saturday morning and it was wonderful.I had the Eggs Benedict and they were hands down the best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten. They were light, the sauce was perfect, and it was a good amount of food! I also had an iced coffee which was delicious. The inside of the restaurant is super cute, and great for pictures. It packed a lot of people in a small space, but it never felt too crowded or too loud. Just fyi, this is not a restaurant with servers, you order at the counter and then take your food back to your table. It's a little hard to snag a table, and you have to be pretty aggressive about it. Also parking isn't great, and you have to kind of search for it, so I'd recommend an Uber! But besides that it's a fun little place and I'll definitely have to go back for lunch or dinner!"
4/18/2018,20180418,4,4.37,"Adorable little spot with great service! I found a free parking spot (unheard of in LA) on La Brea which was very convenient. The place wasn't too crowded on a Wednesday around noon. It's an order-at-the-counter type of place and it was my first time so I had to browse the menu. I was surprised at the big variety of options for lunch and brunch. I went with the Waffletella which was a waffle covered with nutella, strawberries, and bananas. The oozing nutella and plentiful fruit made the whole thing taste really good. When I isolated the waffle though I thought it could have been fluffier. I was very impressed by the coffee though. I was super excited to see the La Colombe bags of coffee on the shelves so I knew it had to be good. I tried the iced vanilla latte and it was absolute perfection. It wasn't too milky or sweet, and I could perfectly taste the coffee in it, which was amazing. Just the right amount of ice too (this makes a difference!). I loved the cozy feel of the interior and being able to look out onto the street through the big windows. Plenty of natural light also gave the place a pleasant vibe. The staff was super friendly and I loved the use of real flowers in the dishes (my favorite!). I will drive back here for the coffee alone. Aaamazing"
4/18/2018,20180418,4,4.36,"Adorable little place! Has a cozy feel between the interior decor, the amazing succulents outside, the cute mugs, and all of the fun names on the menu that revolve around the bar name. I think we saw both of the owners there at Sunday morning brunch. It was crowded, but we were able to snag a spot on the patio. I ordered the ""you make me wake up happy,"" which I was glad was an option- I knew I wanted savory (eggs, bacon sausage) but felt like I had to try a waffle there. Food was not quite enough for me to give it five stars- not bad, just nothing out of this world, standard-ish breakfast fare. I love the setting though and the staff was very friendly, so we will be back."
4/23/2018,20180423,4,4.36,"Finally came here for Sunday brunch after always driving past it and being curious.Arrived at approximately 10am and the line was OUT the door. Wow, I was not expecting that. We waited about 20 minutes in line to order at the counter before finding a seat. The place was absolutely packed and insanely loud. It was overall chaotic. However ordering with the man at the front and getting our own water was easy. Luckily we found seats at the communal table but otherwise we would have had to wait for people to leave.Our food came out pretty quickly and the staff was really on top of it, I'm sure because of the long lines and that they want a quick turnaround. The second a group got up to leave, someone was there to clean up and wipe. The second I finished my plate someone was behind me taking it from me. Wow.We were shocked at how good our waffles were. I had the waffle and berries (the whipped cream was delicious) and the wake up happy savory waffle. This waffle came with maple butter which was great! And the eggs had a meaty bacon fat-like flavor which was delicious. We cleared our plates and we were not expecting to.Glad to find this place and I recommend! But be ready to wait in line unless you come early. And get ready for your ears to hurt because it's insanely loud inside."
4/26/2018,20180426,4,4.35,"4.25 STARS I've been driving past this place for a while now...wondering what it was like. There was a parking spot available on the other side, felt hungry and took the opportunity.So glad I did. I'm forever annoyed that trendy places serve almond milk coffee instead of soya....because most places F it up. But it was GREAT coffee, I mean delicious-morish.I ordered the ""wake up happy"" waffle - bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage, side waffle. OMG!!Full but want to try something else on the menu...have to hold back. :)I've found my Coffee & Waffle Heaven. Definitely coming back..... with friends next time to share the experience. Very good, friendly service too. Gonna be hard not stopping here every time I drive past."
4/28/2018,20180428,5,4.36,Great food great vibes ! This little place is so close to my house and the food was super good the place is a little small but plenty of seats.
5/3/2018,20180503,4,4.36,"The breakfast burrito was a sweet welcome back to California. My partner ordered a huge avocado toast with iced tea and fresh squeezed orange juice. The food was hot and fresh when we received It and service was friendly and quick! Really delicious food, although we did spend almost $60 incl. tea and orange juice so we thought it was a bit pricey. Other than that, great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch."
5/4/2018,20180504,5,4.36,"Visited here while visiting LA last week, and I can't stop thinking of this place ! It is a cute little cafe in Mid-City/Culver City . I ordered the crunchy French toast and OMG it was soooo good , that I even shoved the flowers that were sprinkled on top in my mouth ! The crunch comes from the cornflakes and the home made whip and Nutella was a perfect amount of sweetness , without it being too sweet! I also ordered a side of eggs and bacon and toast with their tasty Power chai latte. Everything was delicious ! I visited on a Monday morning and it was about 3 people in line to order and about 3 more people entered behind me. You order at the counter and take a number and the food is brought out to you . If I'm ever in LA again, I will be stopping here again!"
5/5/2018,20180505,5,4.37,"Fresh Tasty Amazing food and staffLoved the waffles (Nutella) , the chicken panini is simply delicious.And yes the place has a very good vibe.I would recommend on table ordering, I think it will add to their revenue."
5/5/2018,20180505,5,4.38,My neighborhood go to spot. Love this place. Great options on the menu for sweet and savory waffles. My favorite is the Waffle with bananas and Nutella chocolate. They also do a great waffle lox and cream cheese sandwich. Prefect place to chill and have a great cup of coffee.
5/6/2018,20180506,5,4.38,"Best Breakfast my wife and I have had in a long time!Recommend Breakfast Burrito, Chia Seed Oats & Ricotta Strawberry Toast."
5/11/2018,20180511,5,4.39,"The food was delicious and the service was quick! I ordered the chorizo toast and a Super Chai Latte. My girlfriend ordered the waffle benidict and cold brew coffee. Our overall experience was flawless, thank you Met Her at a Bar!"
5/15/2018,20180515,5,4.39,"First of all I love the name of this small cafe. I have drove passed it couple of timed and did nor know it was a brunch cafe. It was pretty packed when I went for a Sunday brunch. It was small and cozy. I had the cold brew as always and had the avocado toast, breakfast burrito and the egg benedict.... mouth waters as I type this. Will be back to try the other menus. Two thumbs up!"
5/21/2018,20180521,5,4.4,"I've always wanted to have a place for breakfast and coffee that I can walk to, and Met Her At A Bar is now that place!They have delicious waffles, and their food is always presented so beautifully. They haven't even been open a year, and they've already grown so much and become better and better. The service is great, Vinny and his fiancé really make you feel valued and special, and the food is delicious, as well as the coffee. So glad to have this place in the neighborhood!"
5/23/2018,20180523,5,4.41,"You know when you stop by somewhere randomly and you're like where the hell were u all this time? MET HER AT A BAR is bomb. Their waffle sandwiches are amazing, coffee, plenty of seating, customer service and their prices are perfect for that area. $12-16 for a meal is amazing in this area for a clean, middle class joint like this :) I haven't been here for brunch yet but I will be going this weekend! Don't think to hard, just come here and see for yourself."
5/23/2018,20180523,5,4.41,"Me and my roommate live around the corner and decided to finally try this place and it's amazing!! We got chorizo toast, waffle Benedict, and a waffle with Nutella bananas and strawberries. The staff was so nice we met Clint and Vinny. They're seriously so amazing and everything was a great price and portion size. Will definitely be back everyday of my life."
5/24/2018,20180524,4,4.41,"A very cute neighborhood brunch spot that serves really good waffles, great for a boost of energy in gloomy LA weather. The chai latte however is not a ""wow"" as other reviews suggested. Overall like the ambience."
5/26/2018,20180526,5,4.41,This is such a cute breakfast place and so reasonably priced compared to other breakfast spots in LA. the cold brew is awesome!! I had chorizo toast and it was awesome. But what really impressed me was the salmon and waffle. I wouldn't expect a waffle to be good with salmon but I actually think it worked better than a traditional bagel! Service is super friendly and prompt. Would love to go back!
5/27/2018,20180527,5,4.42,"This place is pretty amazing despite the lack of parking...you will basically have to either call a car or look for street parking.Cute and casual spot where you order at the counter and pay, they give you a number to place on your table and they bring your order toyou.We arrived at 9am on a Sunday and made it just before the long line started to form. If you like a little of everything, I would recommend the Wake Up Happy which comes with scrambled eggs, sausage, crisp bacon, and a waffle. The eggs are scrambled perfectly, the sausage had a sweet taste, the bacon melts in your mouth, and the waffle is made to perfection where it's not too hard or soggy. You can also ask to have your eggs made differently.Waffles and Whip is a simple dish of a large waffle and freshly whipped cream which is not overly sweet.The Chia Berries with overnight Oats is also very filling and refreshing. Mine came with fresh blueberries and strawberries which were sweet. There was also a layer of granola on top which added an excellent texture. Although the food is pricey, the excellent service and quality of food makes it totally worth it!"
5/28/2018,20180528,2,4.4,"no I wouldn't recommend this place for brunch, nice decoration, food is edible, but the taste, No. especially compare to Blue jam with the same price. The ham here taste like the ham that people bought from Ralph's, the supermarket ham, and the scrambled potatoes here have no taste, it's just like boiling potatoes. SMH..."
6/4/2018,20180604,5,4.4,This place was such a great find. We came in right when they opened so we got a great parking spot and were in and out in under an hour. The food was DELICIOUS. You order at a counter and they bring the food to your table. This is a must try place for breakfast. Note: They do not have alcohol.
6/4/2018,20180604,5,4.41,The avocado toast is incredible! With the parmesan and beautiful little flowers on top. The music is amazing the coffee is superb and the woman at the register was so kind and helpful. I cannot express how much this place has enhanced my experience of Los Angeles. I will be back! Thank you so much!
6/8/2018,20180608,4,4.4,"With a name like this, it's gotta be cute. And so it was. Close to work and on Memorial Day, what better place to have a late brunch. Empty it was, so we got a nice seat inside. Craving Eggs Benedict, with a twist of waffle instead of english muffin, it was delicious, even though they made a mistake with my order and I ate my food after my husbands sandwich. Coffee was delicious, a chocolate croissant to go for the next day tasted yummy, I would come back if I had another afternoon after work to eat."
6/9/2018,20180609,5,4.41,"Visited this restaurant with my best friend. The waffles were perfect. We will be regulars, but just for the quality food, but the excellent service."
6/10/2018,20180610,5,4.41,"Get the French Toast. Get the Waffle Benny. Get anything. It's all so freaking delicious!!!!!! This place is seriously the real deal when it comes to brunch. This is your favorites, LA style, aesthetic af and even more delicious than it looks. Simple kind of person but want good quality, 100% eat here."
6/10/2018,20180610,3,4.4,"I met a friend for brunch here today- it was pretty good. The pluses - the food is good, and the baked goods are amazing. I also like the industrial ambiance, metal and wood, Edison bulbs, etc. (I didn't care for the fake ivy strewn around - it seemed out of place with the decor)The minuses- ordering, seating, coffee, and cost. Although ordering at the counter is not a big deal, there was a line, the ordering process was not fast and the seating situation was not great. The seating was my least favorite aspect of my experience- after you order you have to wait for a table or area to be available. Although it didn't happen to us, I'd expect that there are many people who order and don't find a seat before their food comes out. The only other aspect I did not like was no refills on coffee. It's Sunday, it's brunch - I need more than one cup of coffee, but since you order at the counter, there is no service, hence no coffee refills . Lastly, it's NOT a good value. Two breakfasts, one cup of coffee (no refills) and one piece of coffee cake - $37. That's approximately $10 more for Breakfast than I typically pay for two people, for full breakfasts- with two drinks, one of which is bottomless coffee."
6/12/2018,20180612,5,4.41,"I love the food and the vibe here. It's a relaxed, casual brunch spot. You wait in line to order at the counter and then find a table. Prices are pretty reasonable, considering the area. Parking in this area actually sucks but I don't like to hold that against a restaurant's review; it's not their fault. Food: The wafflebello sandwich (egg sandwich with portobello mushrooms, avocado, spring mix & tomato) was so delicious. The only suggestion I have is for them to put more of the cilantro aioli on it as it was just a bit dry. If it had more sauce of some type, it would be even more amazing. My friend ordered the wake up happy plate (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage & a waffle). He loved it.Go for their orange juice or a cafe latte. I definitely want to come here again. There are too many items on their menu that sound delish."
6/14/2018,20180614,5,4.41,"Let me just say, I like this place a waffle lot. The aesthetic of the dishes was honestly my favorite part. Ive had a lot of waffles with fruit, nutella, syrup and whipped cream before but it's never looked as beautiful as this! The avocado and black bean wrap was super good, make sure you ask for the chipotle aioli on the side! It really takes the wrap to the next level."
6/18/2018,20180618,5,4.42,"This delightful little corner spot has been on my list of places to visit. There a very short wait to order, seating was a little rough as there appeared to be two larger groups there. But no biggie we were able to find a table for two. We definitely came for the waffles that are absolutely mouth watering in videos and pictures but indescribable bite after bite. All you can say is yum and mmmmm! To avoid over indulgence we order avocado toast and a quinoa salad both of which were killer! My compliments to the chef(s) and the staff here. They really made it a spectacular experience on my tastebuds and over all visit."
6/21/2018,20180621,3,4.4,YO THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.IF YOUR RICH.MAN THE FOOD IS WAYYY TOO OVERPRICED.For what you get..Slight dissapointment..No refills on their homemade lemonade with 8oz lemonade(thats with shitton of ice so that makes like 4 oz lemonade for nearly 5 bucks)The food was beautifully presented and its a lovely spot.Ive been to far too many restaurants..But who am i to judge..But i just feel you could work a little on ur portions if ur gonna charge that much.I spent 100 dollars with 3 adults..all of us left still feelin a lil hungry. Or should i say.. unsatisfied
6/24/2018,20180624,5,4.41,All around phenomenal! This place has great food and a great atmosphere. The avocado toast was delicious and for the first time I felt it was well worth the price. The ricotta toast is also delicious and a perfect balance of sweet but not too sweet. The star item was the wafflebello! Super unique and interesting combination waffle sandwich with portobello. Definitely a must get. The customer service was outstanding. We were constantly checked upon by the friendly waitstaff and it was so cool to see the restaurants namesake couple working there as well and it really shows how passionate they are about the food and customers.
6/25/2018,20180625,5,4.41,"In an ode to my first meeting with the insatiable Veronica Corningstone, we visited this aptly named breakfast oasis. A charming abode run by two lovely human beings, the rich mahongony decor makes you feel right at home. Little ham and eggs comin' at ya.This restaurant is Ron Burgandy approved"
7/1/2018,20180701,5,4.42,"BEST french toast in LA. Not only is it cereal coated, but it also has a creme brûlée base and it is TO DIE FOR. I order it every time I go and i've been there once a week ever since I discovered the french toast. I'm addicted :')Go. Get the french toast. Thank me later!"
7/2/2018,20180702,4,4.42,"A lot smaller than what I imagined it to be. Seating is definitely limited on a Sunday. Luckily for us, we were able to snag a table outside. I got the Grains Bowl and it was soooo good! Everything about it was delicious. The dressing that came with it just tied the whole dish together. I did realize after I finished that it was supposed to have tomatoes in it. Nevertheless, it was very tasty.4/5 STARS- Will be back again !"
7/3/2018,20180703,5,4.42,"An adorable little breakfast bar! Perfect for a solo breakfast or intimate brunch. Staff was kind and very attentive, service A+ and the FOOD. Thanks so much guys!"
7/4/2018,20180704,5,4.43,"Friendly service, delicious food, fresh OJ and coffee - we will definitely be returning."
7/7/2018,20180707,3,4.41,"Everyone is a little bit superficial. Beauty is enticing. It's exciting. It's hard to resist. Whether a person, place or thing is endowed with the quality, it inherently enhances its value in the eye of some beholder. The very word is synonymous with much of what we aspire to be, see and do. Celebrities and luminaries are often described as beautiful people. Hawaii and Paris as beautiful locales. Ferraris and mansions as beautiful objects. Sure, our families and friends are beautiful, too, but in a subjective way. I'm talking about a strictly objective sort of appeal that makes something stand out from the pack. But it's a luster that runs into problems when it is only skin-deep. Then the allure wears off faster than a fake tattoo. While Met Her At A Bar is a feast for the eyes, I found its offerings to be one-dimensional.I always give high praise to any restaurant that happens to be located in one place but brilliantly recreates the vibe of another. In this case, Met Her At A Bar made me feel as though I had stepped into a cafe in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. Owing to my undying affection for New York City, I was instantly enthralled. There was a cozy intimacy that soaked its way into every inch of the eatery. The tables were comfort zones. The staff uncommonly warm. A wall was covered with stunning photos of the greatest rock stars of the modern era and stood opposite a pastry case filled with fresh baked goods. My friend and I got there early enough so that the wait in line and for a table were both brief. Half the menu is built around their homemade waffles and the numerous savory and sweet ways that Belgian treat can be adapted. The other half was comprised of standard favorites with whimsical names. We ordered the Met Her breakfast burrito (arguably one of the less fanciful appellations) and the You Make Me Wake Up Happy. Given a number and coffees, we took our seat and blended in with the trendy crowd. When our food arrived, I was impressed by the presentation. No question both were made with the freshest ingredients. The kind you can see and smell, but unfortunately in this case, not necessarily taste. Biting into my burrito, I was instantly surprised by the lack of flavor. I was aware of the eggs, sausage, peppers, onions and mushrooms, yet none of them popped. None of them worked together to create a next-generation flavor profile. They all just sort of did their own thing atop my tongue. It looked far prettier than it ate. And the potatoes were equally as unspectacular. Having no portion control whatsoever, I tend to treat any ilk of potatoes as the marines do soldiers and never leave one behind. In this case, a few were more than sufficient.The You Make Me Wake Up Happy furnished us with the basic components of any well-rounded brunch. Eggs. Bacon. Sausage. Waffle. The eggs were well cooked. The bacon crispy. The sausage tangy. The waffle flaky. Each tasted fine on its own or when paired with a plate-mate. Everything bordered on good and fell well short of great. Again, the appearance was deceiving.Their hospitable staff definitely enhanced the experience, however I'd only return to indulge in the ambiance, not the food."
7/9/2018,20180709,3,4.4,"I live across from this new neighborhood spot! I have been a handful of times. It's been a mixed bag of experiences. The first time I came I had the best latte of life and then the worst breakfast burrito I've ever had, the flavor was not good and it was mistakingly paired with butter and jelly rather than sour cream and a salsa. The second time I came I had very mediocre coffee but great avocado toast. Today i came for an all American breakfast and ice tea. My bill was $17 for 2 scrambled eggs, 2 small pieces of bacon, and 2 pieces of toast. The meal was enjoyable. The ice tea was served in a tiny stemless white wine glass, about 5 sips included with a price tag of $3. I enjoyed my entire meal UNTIL asking for an ice tea refill where I am told that they do not refill ice tea? $3 black ice tea and no refill?! Unacceptable. $3 is about the cost of a box of black tea bags. Really disappointing. While this place has the bones for being great, the prices don't warrant the experience. Everything is overpriced for a counter service style restaurant. I don't think i can get over the ice tea thing. That was the last straw for me."
7/9/2018,20180709,5,4.41,"I came here with my parents who almost rarely ever stray from dingy Korean restaurants with bad service and traditional food. A part of me was a bit worried to bring them to a trendy American place that sells waffles, cold brew, and avocado toast, but they surprisingly took it in very well. Their snide comments on ""weird"" Americans that would actually pay money for waffles that are essentially glorified pancakes quickly changed. They were shocked by the friendly service and the presentation. This was probably the first time that they sent an actual address to an eatery to the family group chat. Funny enough, my aunt already frequents this cafe! Met Her At a Bar has a fantastic casual atmosphere, and is really great for both sweet and savory dishes. I would really recommend the Waffle and Berries that convinced my parents that they need to buy a waffle maker. Thanks for the yummy food!"
7/10/2018,20180710,5,4.41,"Yum! I love the new menu full of waffles! I just had the ""Waffle and Lox"" and Yassssss Queeen!!!!I've been coming here since it opened and I've not written a review because there are so many nice things to say. The staff is attentive and lovely. The owners are present and very conversational. The food is always hits the spot. They actually use fresh, organic and cage free ingredients. And they have vegan options. My only wish is that there was another location on the Westside. I keep trying to bring my husband the power quinoa salad but it somehow it never makes it there. ;)"
7/11/2018,20180711,5,4.42,"Great breakfast restaurant. Their waffle are really good and I'm so happy they have gaufre de Liege. I am not usually a fan of mixing sugar/savory (I still don't understand bacon, maple syrup and pancake) but their waffle is not super sugary so it goes well with eggs, bacon, chorizo, ham, Avocado... you name it.They have an incredible menu and it was hard to choose. Note that the portion are normal (meaning not huge) so I was still hungry for desert!I thought there was going to be a waiting list but when we arrived at 1:30pm on a Saturday the place was pretty empty (maybe the heatwave)."
7/15/2018,20180715,5,4.42,"I found this place a while ago and only recently got around to eating here. Definitely fun and worth a try. I really enjoyed my food, my little daughter did too. Service was great, chatty and welcoming. It was pretty empty when we went for lunch which I was happy about. Parking was easy to find on the side street. I'll definitely be back with my boyfriend, I'd love to show him this place."
7/15/2018,20180715,4,4.42,"The food was delicious! However it is a very small spot. You order your food and then find seating. This can be difficult due to the size. There is shared dinning, so you could be sharing a table with others. The one thing I didn't care for was the street parking. Drive around for 15-20 minutes trying to find a parking spot. Would definitely eat here again. because the staff was amazing and the food was good. I would probably Uber/Lyft or just walk."
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.42,"The cute backstory of how this cafe came to be can be summarized by the name of this cafe. I enjoyed my morning work sesh here starting with my interaction with the delightful staff that allowed me to open a tab (it's order at the counter - at least during the week) since I wasn't quite hungry yet and only wanted a beverage to start. The cold brew served in a stemless wine glass was a refreshing change from a mason jar...and the accoutrement area had all the coffee fixins one needs to doctor it up as one sees fit. I sat down and worked on my laptop without issue (there are only a couple outlets) until I decided I wanted a bite. I ordered the chorizo toast for an exciting twist on the played out avocado version (not to worry, they have that, too!). It was served on a baguette and had a little dollop of avocado mousse to accompany it. At first I thought I was going to need a hacksaw to sever each piece (the butter knife didn't really cut it - pun intended), but after letting the two egg yolks really soak up the baguette, it got much easier (also, I could have just asked for a more sharp object if I wasn't so lazy).On the way out I grabbed one of their delicious looking cookies and it did not disappoint. It was an impressive size, with the gooey wrinkles, and the chocolate chips were of the larger variety which I very much enjoy.A great option on La Brea for a breakfast/brunch/lunch bite/beverage."
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.43,"I was super excited to explore this place for brunch & decided to drag my friend along with me. Needless to say I loved it. To start I had a mocha cappuccino & it was pure heaven. Food was delicious. My friend got the salmon & locks and I got what is in the picture below, your regular scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and waffles. Believe me when I say the food was anything but ordinary. I'll most definitely be going back! Just keep in mind the place is a bit tiny compared to other places and can get packed but the staff is pretty awesome and tries to stay on top of everything to make sure you are well taken care of."
7/21/2018,20180721,5,4.43,"Very cool place, I liked the atmosphere, interior and the food was delicious. The staff is very friendly! They run out of yogurt for granola, so they replaced this item with something else and brought us waffles for free. So nice of them. Loved the pesto sandwich, asked for extra sauce though. Yum! Will definitely come back!"
7/22/2018,20180722,5,4.43,"I'm glad places like this exist. I've lived in this part of town most of my life and we need more businesses like this. Run by a couple that is putting in the effort to make eating here an excellent experience.  Having said that, the waffles here are great, more of a tradition style. Keep in mind that they are competing with Roscoe's so they have to deliver.  They have been consistent with quality since they opened. I hope they keep it up!!!Other items on the menu are more experimental. Like the turkey sandwich which uses waffles as the bread. The sandwich seems to be a fusion of European, American, and Vietnamese. It gives you what you expect, but also delivers a welcomed surprise in flavors.Finally, a breakfast joint needs to have solid coffee. They 've got you covered there."
7/22/2018,20180722,5,4.44,"Yum yum yum and more yum. This is my new favorite breakfast spot in L.A. The owners and their ""love"" story is too cute.(read it, it's on the menu) All the staff is VERY friendly ready to greet you with a welcoming smile. I got the chicken and waffle. OMG, the chicken, breast might I add, was season to perfection and moist. The waffle melted in my mouth.  If you want a good breakfast with superb service, try this one"
7/23/2018,20180723,4,4.44,"Came here Friday July 20, 2018 about 10:15. ORDERED:- Avocado Toast    * Add 1 egg    * Add Bacon- Iced Almond Milk Coffee- WaterPROS:- food was delicious- egg was made perfectly- lemon drizzle around it added perfect flavor- presentation was lovely- staff was super nice- adorable ambiance- perfect bar/window seats that are great being solo or with 2 people- bacon was forgotten but they gave me some on the side at no charge. Awesome customer serviceCONS:- I ordered bacon but girl at counter didn't type it in. She heard me and repeated it back to me but I dunno what happened. No worries because the my made it right- pretty pricey. Breakfast for myself with a coffee was over $20."
7/23/2018,20180723,4,4.43,"My bf and I had brunch here last Saturday around noon. Loved the decor and ambiance of this place! It's a medium sized cafe, quite cozy feel. The way it goes is you order at the register first and then you will be given a number to place on your table-- you must find a seat and a waiter will deliver your food. You must pick up your utensils and napkins on the way (or after you get seated). There is a table off to the side where they provide a jug of water for your taking & all the needed extras for your table (napkins, utensils, sugar packets, etc). Table/ seating wise, you will be fairly near other customers.... so coming with a huge party (more than 4) may not be as advisable. Food:We ordered 3 things. First, the crunchy French Toast (shared this plate). Second, breakfast sandwich (not the breakfast sandwich waffle-- this one had the chipotle aioli sauce). Third, the boyfriend got the Missing You Salmon Lox waffle one. All three were delicious! Serving size was appropriate, all definitely shareable dishes. Taste:The French Toast had a lovely sweet flavor at the center of the toast, but not to the point where you'd get a toothache. I'd say there was a great balance and ratio between texture and flakiness of the French Toast to chewiness and softness (it wasn't soggy at all yay!). The salmon was fresh. Tasted light-- not too salty, paired well with their cream cheese and waffle. I enjoyed my breakfast burger! Chipotle aioli tasted wonderful-- smooth, nice kick of spice from the chipotle but not overpowering. Bun was perfect! I got carried away that I had more bites of bacon that the bacon to bun and everything else ratio was string smaller lol so I made sure each bite had bacon. Parking: mostly residential so it should be fairly doable (not as stressful as trying to find parking in the heart of Downtown LA). Price:Each plate/meal is an average of $9-$13. So come with someone else or at least a group of no more than 3-4 so you guys can try each other's plates. That's my best advice. Also! When you check in on Yelp, you can receive a free coffee drip or iced tea. Would definitely come back again to try other items on their menu."
7/23/2018,20180723,5,4.44,"I work at Culver City Honda, and my date last night stood me up. This morning I needed a solid breakfast. Yelp reviews recommended this place. Great name, Met Her at a Bar. Walked in at 10 am this morning. It was quiet, the crowd starts coming in about 10:30 am. Had the waffle omelette bacon and sausage the one in the photo. It was so nice to alternate between sweet and savory. Was thinking of European style eating manners, savory before sweet. Hang that. Alternating was more enjoyable. Though this place seats about 20+, it is very clean and friendly. Imagine real silverware! And the coffee is good, too. Parking was easy this morning. I will come back here again but this time with a date. Strongly recommend for dating couples."
7/27/2018,20180727,5,4.44,Great brunch spot- they are known for their waffles which look devine but I got the breakfast sandwich. It was perfection!The chef is a serious pro with eggs. My husband got the eggs benedict and he said he never had eggs that good. Dont know where they found the chef but kudos to them Also the coffee and iced tea was amazing!Great atmosphere - communal tables but not good for studying. They ask on weekends not to bring laptops in the mornings.I will be back!!!
7/29/2018,20180729,4,4.44,"We stumbled upon this place driving to République, and once we saw the line there, we flipped a U and came here. Really cool ambiance, good food, and good service. Ambiance: photos of musicians, a stand up piano in the corner, unfinished ceiling. It feels like you're hanging out at your buddy's loft getting served grade A breakfast. Food: Delicious with a good portion size, but a little light in the sauces. - Waffle Benedict: nice play on the Benedict. The poached eggs were good but inconsistent. One was considerably runnier than the other, but both still in the range between too dry and too raw. Ham was salty deliciousness, but the dish overall was a bit light on the Hollandaise. Potatoes were cooked well, felt light, and seasoned well (note: I like low sodium)- The breakfast sandwich: Very Good, but not great... a little more sauce would have set this one off. The brioche is pillowy amazingness, the bacon brings the thickness with a nice crunch giving the sando texture, eggs cooked perfectly and cheese oozing all over. On the edge of greatness, but just needed a little nudge to get over. Service: super friendly and surprisingly attentive for a order at the counter and sit down kinda place. You have grab your own silverware, but they give refills on the ice tea. Solid 4 stars."
7/30/2018,20180730,5,4.44,"What an incredible breakfast place this is!The staff is incredibly nice - and the manager is such a fantastic dude.He held our table for us when we called, literally sitting down and holding the table for us (they don't take reservations) until we arrived 10 min later.The ""wake up happy"" breakfast is great - some of the best sausage, bacon, and eggs I've had in LA. And of course, the waffles are spectacular.My wife had the Thai Chicken and Waffles, and f you do too, you won't be disappointed. Give this place a shot! Nice decor as well. I will be going back several times."
7/31/2018,20180731,5,4.45,"I honestly wanted to try this place because of the cute story of how the owners met at a bar and because of how pretty the french toast looks!I finally visited Met Her at a Bar this past weekend and tried not to have too many expectations because I didn't want to be disappointed if it was all just hype. I'm happy to say I loved it! The food was delicious, but it was the service that really sold me! This cute little corner shop has a slight hip but homey feeling and the most adorable couple as owners. They check up on the customers and seem so genuinely sweet and friendly. When you walk in, you'll see a counter by the door where you place your order, and then find a seat yourself. My friend and I decided to share the crunchy French toast and the fried chicken waffle sandwich. We also ordered a cup of drip coffee (free with check-in). The worker taking our order was also very friendly (and patient while we were trying to figure out what we wanted).We received our French toast pretty quickly, but the fried chicken waffle sandwich took a lot longer than anticipated. At one point, one of the workers tried to take our table number away because they thought we had received everything when we were still waiting on that chicken. However, the staff came by to check on and update us several times and brought us some ice tea while we waited. When the sandwich arrived, we dug into our food. The sandwich was so delicious! The fried chicken was so juicy and crispy, and I liked the pairing with the cole slaw. The French toast was tasty and pretty, but it wasn't very crunchy. I suspect that had to do with waiting for the second plate though. Portions aren't super big, so you may need to order more if you have friends who have big appetites. We got to try the liege waffle, which was delicious as well! Thanks to the chef!Overall, we enjoyed it and definitely loved the service. Everyone was so sweet there, and I'm already wanting to return to try some of their other items!"
7/31/2018,20180731,5,4.45,"I'm so glad I finally found a neighborhood spot to go to! Awesome food- especially the waffletella!! And they have a cute patio seating with 4 tables outside. Honestly, I can't say good enough things about this place - just go check it out."
7/31/2018,20180731,5,4.45,"If you like waffles and coffee, this is the place for you. I came here on a Friday late-morning and the place was hopping. It's obviously a popular place, between people getting their weekday brunch on or having a work meeting. You order at the counter and the staff is really nice and friendly. They've got a variety of food here, but are known for their waffles. I went with a sweet waffle, the berries waffle, and a flat white. My aunt went the savory waffle route with eggs, mushroom, etc. The waffles are really good, light, airy, but with enough substance to them. The berries were great, and the honey whip cream was delicious. I tried some of the savory waffle and that was delicious as well. It was basically like a waffle sandwich; looks intimidating, but it works. The flat white was delicious of course, I almost wanted to order more. All in all, a great place for brunch, a little pricey, but it's downtown LA so that goes with the territory."
8/2/2018,20180802,4,4.45,I loved the chia seed pudding!! It was so filling and I loved the atmosphere :) you can tell that there's so much love as well and everyone was so kind. I would definitely hope for more vegan and gluten free options on the menu! :)
8/4/2018,20180804,4,4.45,"Finally got to check this place out. Always am excited when there is a breakfast place that offers gluten-free Waffles! It was a busy morning, but it didn't take long for our food to come up. My boyfriend got the carmalized peaches waffles, with a side of bacon AND nacho waffle fries (living large for his bday weekend). I got a gluten-free Waffletella . Everything was great, so was the food presentation. So many more things we want to try!The staff were all very sweet as well.Only downside is the coffee. The serve Colombe coffee which is just not good for people who like coffee. If they change their coffee beans I'd give them 5 stars!"
8/5/2018,20180805,5,4.45,"Yay I'm so glad I came here for a Girls' brunch date! It's a very small cafe on the corner of 8th and La Brea but I didn't wait long at all. Parking is street parking and luckily there's a lot in that area. You wait in line to order your food & pay before you sit down. My friends & I ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, Breakfast Sandwich & the Crispy French Toast. The CCC was AMAZING like I would for sure go back to order that again. Breakfast Sandwich was a little underwhelming & the French Toast was yummy but very sweet! The workers are friendly & its very lively inside! It's the perfect atmosphere for lunch/brunch and they will also give you a free drip coffee or iced tea if you check in which is SO worth it. I'll be backkkkk! :)"
8/5/2018,20180805,5,4.45,"I absolutely 1000% love this spot. Great vibe, amazing food! OMMFG the food is killer! Service is second to none. Too many amazing people to name off. This is totally my Sunday Funday spot! Thank all y'all for such a phenomenal meal!"
8/7/2018,20180807,5,4.46,"This is one of my favorite breakfast places. The food is delicious. Although they have a long list of waffles, their French toast was really great. We had a iced and hot latte and both were really good too. The space is very communal, friendly and nice. I'm definitely going to recommend this to all of my friends!"
8/8/2018,20180808,4,4.45,Have to thank my friends for introducing this spot. Food is great. Chorizo Toast....BAM! :) Will definitely find my way back for more. The FEEL/VIBE is cool. Everybody wants a feel comfy and SNOB FREE environment when trying to enjoy a meal. Right? =)
8/11/2018,20180811,2,4.44,"Tried this place today and I was not impressed by it.The place is nice looking and the ambiance was good.I like the fact they serve organic eggs and everything looks fresh however, some of their portions are on the smaller side for their price point so my teenage boys were hungry after they had their waffles (berry) and French toast. I had the plain waffle that comes with eggs, bacon, and sausages eggs tasted fresh, bacon was ok, sausage was good, and the plain waffle tasted like something you would have at IHOP or out of a box. I would not come here again and if you have a big appetite go somewhere else."
8/14/2018,20180814,5,4.44,"I come to LA to visit my daughter and her husband who conveniently live across the street from ""Met her at a Bar"" They brought me there and told me it was there favorite neighborhood place and that the food was amazing. It is now a family favorite! The food is beyond delicious. The waffles Benedict, waffles and lox, are just a couple of our favorites but we have tried everything and never been disappointed. The owners are warm and welcoming and it is always a pleasure to go there. I never come to LA without a visit to ""Met her at a Bar""!!"
8/17/2018,20180817,5,4.45,"Where do I begin? Do I start with the warmed, whipped butter? The homemade whipped cream? The fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, not too dense, not too light, perfectly cooked waffles? Or the fact that this New Englander can enjoy all of this with dark, rich, REAL maple syrup (something that rare in Los Angeles).To Met Her At A Bar... I say, ""bravo!"""
8/18/2018,20180818,5,4.45,First time my husband and I had breakfast here. Loved the vibe! And the food was delish! (I had the avocado toast...yummmm!!!). The service was outstanding. Every employee was super nice and happy. The bathrooms were really clean which was crazy because the place was packed. Super great cozy experience. We will for sure be back!!
8/19/2018,20180819,4,4.45,"Cute and quaint restaurant. Their specialty are waffle sandwiches. I ordered the ""make you happy"" waffles. The eggs were a little more runny than I like for scrambled eggs. Sausage and bacon are standard. As for the waffle, it was great. Light, fluffy and crisp on the sides. The facility is clean. Food came out quickly. And there was a nice waitress that came out to refill the water quickly. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."
8/20/2018,20180820,4,4.44,"Met Her At A Bar is like a small cafe where you order up at the register and take a number then find a table. It's a bit cramped, but as long as you're down to find a table Hunger Games style, you'll be just fine.I came with a group of 3 on a Saturday at 11:30am, and although the place was packed, we didn't have trouble finding a table.My group ordered the You Make Me Wake Up Happy (breakfast platter) $15, Now This Is Love Waffletella (sweet waffle) $13, and the Met Her Breakfast Burrito (a burrito) $12. See photo below!Each item was tasty and filling. I'd say the portions are just right - you definitely won't be stuffed but you'll be full after! I also checked in on Yelp and got a free iced coffee, so that was pretty dope. I'd recommend this place to satisfy all your cute girly brunch must Instagram needs for reasonable prices and no painful wait!"
8/20/2018,20180820,5,4.45,"Great ambiance, friendly staff and perfect portions for those who don't typically finish their food. My boyfriend got the chorizo toast and just inhaled it in a matter of minutes. As for myself I ordered the waffle lox and matcha latte with oat milk. Everything was rich with flavor. Although I paid for the food my bf couldn't help but comment that the waffle lox was over priced. In my opinion to those who complain about pricing, everything in LA is on the pricey side however this cafe is exceptional."
8/20/2018,20180820,5,4.45,"This cute neighborhood cafe is the best!! The cashier/ server Katerina (Kate for short) was extremely hospitable, knowledgeable of the entire menu, and super sweet. It was my first time here and she helped me with my order - which was SO good. She recommended the iced chai latte and the scrambled toast and they were both amazing. I'll definitely be coming back for more!"
8/23/2018,20180823,5,4.45,"My friend and I came here after a hike up the Hollywood sign. We were both starving, and to our luck we came across this place on yelp. Inside I would describe decor as rustic, shabby chic. You order as you walk in and then they give you a number and you can choose where to sit. We went on a Monday morning, and to our luck, it was not too packed, but it was definitely pretty full. They have a wide variety of breakfast/lunch options that all have the cutest names. We both ended up ordering the ""You Make Me Wake Up Happy"" which comes with eggs, sausage, bacon, and a waffle. It's $15 which is kind of a steep price, but it's a pretty good amount of food, and best of all it's super yummy!! Food was out within 10-13 minutes, and the service was very polite and pleasant. All in all it was a lovely dining experience and would love to swing by again to try something else off of the menu."
8/25/2018,20180825,5,4.46,"They have amazingggg customer service. It was a bit crowded, and one of the owners helped clear and set us up at a table. They were very friendly. All of the food we got was really good - Power Bowl - 4 stars- Sriracha Turkey Waffle Sandwich - 5 stars. Tastes so fresh and so good although the ingredients sound ordinary. I think it's the waffle that really makes it so good! - Salted Caramel Waffle with toasted coconut - gluten free, too! 4 stars- Matcha Waffle - omggggg Soo goooood. The matcha flavoring is strong. Baked goods don't usually have such a good matcha flavor. Even the insides of the waffle are bright green. 5 stars"
8/27/2018,20180827,5,4.46,"I found this cute cafe on Yelp and I am very happy I did! I ordered chicken and waffles($15), and my girlfriend ordered the wake up happy meal ($15), both tasted delicious. My only concern was my chicken was so small lol it literally was smaller than half the waffle. One of the staff walked back and we joked about how they going to give such a small piece of fried chicken to a big black guy and she laughed and offered me another piece. Even though I took it to go, it definitely showed how far they would go to please their customers. The cafe was very cute. Hippy vibes. We sat outside, they had 4 small tables. It was facing away from the sun and felt amazing. We did street parking. It might be a little tight if they're busy but all positive vibes. We both checked in for our coffee and ice tea. Both great. Over all, the staff was all SUPER SUPER friendly. They were all so attentive. The prices are decent, will return soon to see how the actual piece of chicken portion looks like."
8/29/2018,20180829,5,4.46,"Love this place! It's my first time here and it's so cute. Amazing, friendly, and attentive service. The place feels like a local dinner but with a modern twist. They also have vegan/gluten free waffles which is the best thing for someone who has difficult dietary restrictions like me. Highly recommend for any meal."
8/30/2018,20180830,4,4.46,"I adore this cute cafe!You walk in and you place your order at the cashier! And you take a number and you take a number and they bring you your food! Tip! You can check in for a cup of coffee or ice tea! HIGHLY recommended.I ordered the ""Wake up happy"" and my boyfriend just ordered chicken and waffles. I much rather go with my meal over his any day. Both cost the same but the chicken and waffles portion was terrible. I wish it comes with two peices of chicken instead of one. But the staff did make it up to us when we joked about it being so small. But the wait was about another 25 minutes so we took it togo. Every single staff member was so friendly and welcoming. My meal was very good. The eggs taste so authentic. The cafe itself is so cute! A few small tables outside. Pet friendly. It does get packed fast, from what I saw. Cant wait to come back to try more items on the menu!"
8/30/2018,20180830,4,4.46,"Midweek lunch date with my bestie. We found street parking just down the street and didn't have to wait for a table. Ordered at the counter and took our seats. Foods and drinks soon followed. Very casual setting yet attentive and warm service. Bello waffle sandwich with House brew coffee (refillable with oat, almond, and soy milk options with no extra charge). Was worried I would not have enough to eat when ordering...man was I wrong. The sandwich was stacked to its fullest potential: double fried eggs, thick cut Portobello, and quartered avocado all stuffed between a waffle ""bun"". With a drizzle of maple syrups over - delish! I still managed to demolish the entire sandwich as usual - but def much bigger portion than most other waffle options. Was it a $15 worthy sandwich though? Probably not. The waffle could had been a tad crunchier and the waffle batter could had used some interesting herbs or cheese? A good, satisfying sandwich but not one that I would remember or crave... especially at that price point. Still worth a visit if you are in the area. Maybe I would go with the sweet options next!"
9/1/2018,20180901,3,4.45,"What a disappointment!! I've ordered delivery 3 times from them and every single time they've gotten our order wrong. I never wrote a review about it before because regardless of the completely different food we received, it had been good. This time we made sure to call before placing the order to let them know we've gotten wrong orders before and they stated they will make sure it doesn't happen again. We get the food and it's wrong again.Called the restaurant and the lady who picked up said she was sorry, that she was new and didn't know it was the wrong order.I then called grub hub to let them know the situation. They called the restaurant and they blatantly lied! They stated they called us to let us know that our order will not be exactly how we requested (we asked for a boiled egg instead of poached egg for our 1 year old since he can't eat raw eggs, and we ordered a chorizo burrito which we didn't receive at all and instead received their standard burrito). They did not call to let us know about any of them.Again, this is the THIRD time they've messed up our order. When grub hub asked them to provide a refund, they refused, so grub hub gave us a promo code instead.We will never order from them again and I highly recommend against anyone else doing so as well.Disgusting liars.EDIT: I got a call from Mindy the owner who refunded the meal. This doesn't change the fact that the employees lied, but I appreciate her call and apology. When the menu gets updated, we'll be willing to order from them again. Edited from a 1 star to a 3 star because their food is good and once the menu is updated, it should be ok. As long as the employees communicate any issues in the order."
9/2/2018,20180902,4,4.45,"Everything was delicious. Well prepared and simply but nicely presented. Excellent quality ingredients. I had the Wake Up Happy and it was delicious as reviewed by everyone. My son-in-law had the chicken and waffle. Pro: chicken tasted great. Crispy and juicy. I was skeptical about a Thai flavor for breakfast (the sauce and garnish on the chicken is Thai-peppers, basil, etc) but it was interesting and not too intense. Con: Only complaint about that dish was the Thai stuff creeped over onto the waffle and that wasn't great. Portions good, cappuccino good. Seating a little close but people are friendly so NP"
9/2/2018,20180902,5,4.45,This place is amazing. Really small and crowded but the staff does an amazing job at taking care of their customers. The food comes out extremely quick and the staff helps you find a table if it's really busy. The food is INCREDIBLE.
9/4/2018,20180904,5,4.45,"My new local weekend morning pop in. Had the Egg sandwhich a couple of times, and both times......soft bread, egg coooked perfectly (sounds easy right? Not), tasty bacon. Coffee's good, and of course they seem to be well known in this hood for their waffles."
9/15/2018,20180915,4,4.45,"This place was as cute as I thought it would be! I think they found a good balance between being no-frills and careful execution, while the interior also feels like a balance of cozy and modern. I was surprised at how small it was. I was there at 10:30am and it was pretty packed, but no lines. I'm generally not a fan of the order and then find your own seat style of cafe, but my circumstances weren't bad. I'd probably be more unhappy if I had to try to find a table when it was full. I also generally don't order the ""American breakfast set"" at brunch place, but I felt like trying the Wake Up Happy. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. Although simple, I thoroughly enjoyed each element of the dish. The sausages were delicious, juicy, and unique (not just like a typical breakfast sausage). The bacon was a tiny bit candied, crunchy, perfect. Scrambled eggs were the perfect texture and a bit underseasoned which worked well with the salty proteins. The waffle was good, kinda felt more on the savory side than sweet, so it was good with the rest of the meal and syrup. My one complaint is that the waffle ended up being like 2 layers/split where the bottom was soggy and the top was crispy. Otherwise - all was good. I got the coffee for free with yelp checkin :) (heart)"
9/17/2018,20180917,4,4.45,"Met Her At A Bar is a charming cafe with great lattes and a menu including various waffles and other brunch essentials. I've been here a few times, and the service has been consistently 4-5 stars even when they are busy. My usual order is an Iced Mocha (4 stars) and Waffle and Berries (4 stars). The waffle has the perfect crisp and soft textures that you expect from a delicious waffle. It's topped with whipped cream and fresh raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries in every waffle indentation. It includes picture ready plating with flower garnishes. I've tried the Matcha Latte (4 stars) with pretty latte art. With various dining options on La Brea, this is a nice small cafe if you want to dine in for brunch or just get some good coffee to go."
9/19/2018,20180919,5,4.45,"The best part of this yummy restaurant aside from the atmosphere and food is the story behind the name. Vinny, the owner met the co-owner Mindy while working at a bar, it was love at first sight. Mindy is a professional food scientist that cares about making quality, whole food with healthy ingredients and you can tell by her menu. We ordered the chicken and waffles, matcha waffle, strawberry arugula salad, quinoa bowl, crispy french toast and of course, the waffletella. My favorite things on the menu were the chicken and waffles (it had a great Tom Yum seasoning), the waffletella which was the perfect soft waffle mixed with berries and Nutella and the crispy french toast. What I love is that they have so many healthy items like the salads too so when I'm not eating carbs I can also go back! Will be back soon."
9/19/2018,20180919,5,4.45,New brunch spot in mid city. Love the neighborhood vibes. What to order? I would recommend the matcha waffles and the tom yum fried chicken and waffles. See y'all there
9/23/2018,20180923,5,4.46,"We were looking for yummy waffles and that's exactly what we got! They were beautiful as well. Also, the story behind the name is the cutest thing! The owner met her (wife) at a bar and that is why they named it that"
9/24/2018,20180924,4,4.46,"Love this place for brunch! Good for a date or a brunch with a small group of friends. Small, cute restaurant with delicious brunch food. You order at the front, get a number, and choose your own seats. Can get crowded during weekend brunch time. Be mindful they close at 4 pm! Cold brew coffee Waffle + Lox Avocado toast that I modified to be put on a waffle instead of sourdough and added a poached egg on top"
9/29/2018,20180929,2,4.44,They don't follow instructions on to-go orders!I've called TWICE to let them know that putting a side of whipped cream in a container with HOT FOOD doesn't work. They don't get it. They don't understand that whipped cream melts apparently and i've gotten whipped cream that basically looks like milk when it arrives. It's disgusting and I'm not sure why they can't figure it out -- especially when i've brought it to their attention. NO ONE WANTS MELTED WHIPPED CREAM. Just saying.
9/29/2018,20180929,5,4.44,"First of all this place is sooo delicious! ! It is quite small, however the food is BIG on taste! Armando (our waiter) was absolutely amazing and attentive. He made our 1st time here even more memorable. Everything was scrumptious; from the cold brew to the fried chicken and waffles! We will be back."
9/30/2018,20180930,5,4.45,This is the best environment and food! A must!! It was very popular on a Sunday morning but we were seated immediately and food was out within 10 minutes of ordering despite a full house. The servers are the friendliest! And again the food was everything wonderful in this world! A must!
10/4/2018,20181004,4,4.45,"I have a wheat allergy and am thus gluten-free. So I was super excited to see that they offered gluten-free waffles during brunch time. I purchased gluten-free Waffle Benedict and my boyfriend got the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich. Both were delicious! Overall, the biggest pro to this place is high-quality, great tasting food with gluten-free options.The cons, my gluten-free waffles came considerably later than my bf's meal. About 20 minutes after his. I understand my meal may have taken longer to prep, but should be standard for all meals to come out at once, right? For that, the line out the door, and somewhat priciness they lose a star."
10/6/2018,20181006,4,4.44,"Really cute brunch spot!! My boyfriend and I came here for a quick bite to eat and really enjoyed the food. We sat in the patio, but it was very noisy due to the street traffic. Aside from that, great spot."
10/7/2018,20181007,4,4.44,"I always enjoy my time here, it's such a cute place for brunch. Obviously, because it was Sunday it was super packed but it also wasn't extremely difficult to find a table.My experience was overall good, but this time (my second time) the food was lack luster. My boyfriend's eggs Benedict was over cooked, so it tasted more like a hard boiled egg than anything else. The potatoes were also strangely seasoned and cooked to the point where they were super crunchy. However, the bread was delicious as was the hollandaise sauce.I had the chorizo toast, which was good but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the eggs benedict I had on my last visit. The bread was perfectly toasted, but it was too hard to cut to eat in pieces and too long to just pick it up. The chorizo was seasoned perfectly and the eggs were just the right amount of runny. The peppers were also very good, and though it wasn't much food it was super filling.And as always, their ice coffee was delicious.Overall, I enjoyed my experience and will definitely come back!"
10/7/2018,20181007,5,4.44,"Love this place! Casual neighborhood coffee bar with great food. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The vibe is great, I love their music. I will definitely bring my friends here. Definitely try the chorizo toast!!"
10/9/2018,20181009,5,4.45,"A great little local waffle bar/brunch spot! Came here with my boyfriend in the late morning on a Sunday. The line was pretty short but regardless, service was really fast! It's a cute little spot, but not much room esp for big parties-you order at the counter and find a place to sit. We had the eggs Benedict waffle and the huevos rancheros (daily special), with mugs of their drip coffee. Both were delicious!! The waffle was excellent-crispy just the way I like it and light! The breakfast potatoes were also super tasty- a pleasant surprise! Both dishes were full of flavor, but not heavy enough to put you in a post brunch food coma. It's pretty loud in here since the place itself is so small, so wouldn't recommend for intimate conversation over brunch. But friendly owners and staff + delicious food + crispy waffles. You can't go wrong!"
10/10/2018,20181010,3,4.44,"Food is good for curing hangovers. However, the ordering situation is a bit hectic and clumsy though. They should invest in a wait staff and hostess vs having people order and then find a place to sit."
10/13/2018,20181013,5,4.44,"AMAZING, nothing less.Came here for the first time with my bf and I can honestly say, WE ARE COMING BACK!!!!!!food is amazing, can get busy but can always get a table when eating in. Not overly price, service is top notch... if you are looking for a place to catch up, have brunch, business meeting, or on a date. THIS IS THE PLACE. Can't wait to come and try their whole menu, my new fall goal. :)"
10/14/2018,20181014,4,4.44,"Great place to eat some brunch. I love Strawberry Ricotta Toast. Lots of street parking outside, so no worry about parking here."
10/14/2018,20181014,3,4.43,"Visited here today from San Diego because my cousin is here from Hawaii for a work conference. She wanted to do some things in the area and we had the time so I decided to drive her up early to LA. We wanted to go to a brunch spot (and this place was recommended from a friend) so we got here straight from the 2.5 hour drive so we were super excited about this place (and we were hungry).I got the eggs Benedict w/ the waffle and the first bite was bomb - as I was cutting into another bite I saw something black that at first I thought It was just me acting crazy and paranoid because I am a germophohe but no, it actually was a strand of hair. For a moment, I got really upset and got grossed out and we showed them the hair and had them take it back. I decided to tell them that I didn't want a new order - I completely lost my appetite already, I even tried eating some of my cousin's meal but I couldn't. She really enjoyed her meal though! I wasn't so so angry because it happens, I think I was more upset that I just drove 2.5 hours and was hungry and didn't even get a chance to enjoy a good meal, which I know it would have been because I had at least one bite hah. Anyway, I wish I could give more stars. But my main purpose for this review is that although a nasty piece of hair was in my food, I think the staff and manager handled it well and they even refunded me my meal when I decided to not have them recook it which I appreciated because I was already planning to ask for a refund but they offered it before I even asked. They even offered a comp coffee that I appreciated, and I did choose an iced matcha which was ok (it was too watered down for me ) Anyway, the whole experience sucked but I appreciated what they did about it. I may come back to try it again"
10/15/2018,20181015,5,4.43,"Was looking for some brunch places to try out for me and mah lady. And came across this little corner gemstone. The ambiance was very relaxing, the people working there were polite and attentive. Freshly squeezed orange juice was delicious and chill to drink. A+ from both of us. My girl got the power omlete with potatoes (she really loves potatoes) and I got the eggs Benedict with potatoes as well. WOW! we were both amazed by how much flavor each of our plates had. We both enjoyed each other's plates, as well as the potatoes. At the end, it didn't leave us on a full stomach like most places would, but it just leaves you feeling satisfied with a smile. As we left, we decided to add this to our list of brunches until we've had everything on the menu. We will definitely be coming back again soon. See you guys again! =)"
10/16/2018,20181016,5,4.44,"Every time I walk past this place I keep meaning to drop by, well... I finally did and I loved it!Fantastic spot for Breakfast, Brunch or Lunch conveniently located on La Brea just south of Wilshire Blvd. Order at the counter then pick your table but be warned it does get very busy! I had the Avocado toast on Gluten Free bread and an almond milk iced latte. Super fresh, super delicious and the coffee is some of the best in the area.You've found a new repeat customer in me for sure!"
10/20/2018,20181020,4,4.44,"Errrthing waffle! Whatever want, they'll have it with a waffle. Errthing!I Miss You Waffle and Lox, which is basically a Salmon and Lox on a Waffle w/ cream cheese shmear. 2/2 people recommended. It's a twist on the normal salmon and lox with a twist on the waffle. It's different and ended up being pretty bomb! Wake Me Up Happy was just ok. It's the most basic thing you can get, and I'm basic so I had to get it. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and a whole waffle. This basic girl would rate it 3/5. Nothing super special.This place gets poppin. You order and then find a seat next to some hip ass person. I think I'd just come back to feel hip. You have guys in flannels on a hot summer day w/ a beanie looking like they came right out of urban outfitters and girls wearing just a shirt but looking like models. Love it"
10/24/2018,20181024,5,4.44,"My girlfriend and I were traveling on a road trip that ended in LA. It was a short getaway from San Francisco. The first thing I noticed was that there was no line for a brunch place on a Sunday; maybe a party ahead of us tops. If we were in San Francisco, it would easily be a two-hour wait. This opinion was backed up after we finished the meal. We went on a whim, based on one of Los Angeles' top Yelpers, Ed L. Thank you, Ed L! He was an excellent guide and brought us to a side of LA we had never been before. I ordered the lox+waffle, my girlfriend ordered the benedict and Ed ordered the chicken and waffles.It was so interesting to see the common ingredient in each dish being waffles. And my God, they were the fluffiest waffles. My lox + waffles dish was brined very well. The eggs benedict were cooked right, where when you cut into the eggs, they just oozed yolk. They put a twist on the chicken and waffles dish where it was Thai-influenced, with a lime chili Tom Yum flavor.It's great to sit outside in the beautiful LA sunshine.I'd love to come back here again."
10/24/2018,20181024,5,4.44,My boyfriend and I were looking for a breakfast place and decided to come here. It's next to a bus stop so you don't have to walk far. The inside looks cute and there weren't too many people so you could choose your fav spot :) The card has a lot of delicious dishes and it was so hard to decide what to eat but when we got our food we didn't regret a bit of it. Looked and tasted so good. Perfect breakfast place
10/26/2018,20181026,4,4.44,"I give it four out of 5 for 1 reason. When I went to order and pay for my soaked oaks and chia seed dish and asked for hot tea, I wanted to make sure that they have refills on hot tea. The gal said we give free refills on tea and went on my merry way. However, when I finished with my tea and wanted more, they didn't give me a new tea bag but just additional hot water. Whenever I drink hot tea, I always get a fresh tea bag with my hot water. That didn't make me thrilled. But overall, this place is cute and parking in this area is horrible. If you're in the mood for a waffle, definitely a place to go."
10/28/2018,20181028,5,4.44,"We rolled in around 11am on a Sunday. It's counter service, and there was a line of about 15 adults waiting to place their order. I kept an eye out for a table to open and snagged one cus seating is kinda limited. It was loud, crowded and probably not the best place to nurse a hangover or bring a large group to. The service was friendly all around, and they hustled. The food came out pretty quick; it wasn't more than 7-10 minutes. The food was good and hearty and well portioned! We ordered the waffle breakfast sandwich. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and the bacon nice and crisp. We also had the avocado black bean wrap which was fresh and given a kick with some salsa. The chicken and waffles was tasty. The chicken was nicely fried and had Thai seasoning! The place was clean, as well as the bathrooms. I think we'd definitely suggest this place to our friends that are visiting from out of town."
10/29/2018,20181029,5,4.44,"Parking is typical LA challenging. The tables inside are intimately close together and crowded. Laptops are discouraged. And the line is consistently outside the door. But once you step inside this magical, hip little neighborhood cafe, you'll understand why.Hubby & I ordered the famous avocado toast and eggs benedict with waffles. For the latter, paid extra for salmon and the GF vegan version. O.M.G. So worth it. The food is exceptional. Even the side order of scrambled eggs and curated drip coffee (free with Yelp check-in) are noteworthy. Ended the meal with a soft, gooey chocolate chip cookie. With delicious homemade recipes, fun ambiance and top-notch customer service -- exemplified by owners Mindy (the ""Her"" of said bar) & Vinnie who served with smiles -- it's no wonder this cafe earned votes for neighborhood favorite. We'll be back."
10/31/2018,20181031,5,4.45,Wow! Went for the grain bowl. Amazing!! Decided on a healthy lunch but I'm looking forward to trying any of the waffle options soon.  The grain bowl has got to be the best bowl I've ever met. The dressing is not heavy and you really feel the freshness in every bite.  Very impressed with my first impressions.  Service was great as well.

10/31/2018,20181031,5,4.45,"I got the waffle, fried eggs, and sausage plate (forgot the name). The waffle is surprisingly good - moisture on the inside and bit crispy on the outside. But the sausage is even better. It has maple syrup flavor in it that makes it sooo good."
11/1/2018,20181101,4,4.45,"This place is suuuper cute! The interior is casual and laid back but v cool with its indoor plants, wooden accents, and artsy decor. I had the Wake Me Up Happy ($15) which came with 2 pieces of bacon, 2 sausages, scrambled eggs, and a big Belgium waffle. I asked for whipped cream to go with my waffle because I don't like maple syrup on my waffles, and their whipped cream is GOOD!!! It's super dense and tastes homemade rather than from a can. It was perfect with my crispy and soft waffle. It's a large order I could barely finish. I also had the chai latte iced with oat milk and it was delicious as well. I also sampled the lemonade which was really refreshing and light.Their entire menu features cool items that I would really want to come back and try. The staff was also really nice.Oh - and street parking!"
11/6/2018,20181106,5,4.45,Amazing waffle dishes at a great price! Got the strawberry ricotta toast and the chicken and waffle. The sweet and savory combination was delicious. Prices were so good and the restaurant was so cute. I would recommend anybody who wants a fun brunch experience to come here.
11/8/2018,20181108,5,4.46,"What a great gem! My wife and I were looking for a new spot and gave this place a try. We were not disappointed. The staff immediately greeted us with warmth. The owner and his wife were also taking care of orders. If you don't know their story, read their menu! Food was exceptional! Try the chicken and waffles. It has a spicy Thai twist which works on so many levels. We will be coming back regularly : )"
11/11/2018,20181111,5,4.46,"We went here this afternoon and it was packed! Still seated very fast, friendly service. Our family got a variety from salads and a turkey sandwich to sweet waffles. Chai tea latte came out quickly and was delicious. Peaches and cream came with an amazing sauce that I was tempted to drink out of the container. The chicken on the salad was moist and delicious. Avocado toast is a tasty work of art. The nutella waffle was so delicious it disappeared before it could be shared! Turkey sandwich was very good also. The service was amazing and even though a line formed after we sat down we did not feel rushed. The owners were running the front and kitchen and completely charming. We were very impressed with customer service by everyone. Would definitely come back to try more of the yummy looking menu options!"
11/12/2018,20181112,4,4.46,"I'll be honest found this in an Instagram chain, similar to how when you're up til 4am on YouTube watching weird elephant videos when you started off on brand reviews. Anyways, pretty good but really don't understand what all the hype is about. I guess I've been to too many brunch places? My girlfriend liked her skillet and waffle with the sweet butter. My breakfast burrito was good too and came with sour cream. The ketchup wasn't normal ketchup had some spice flavor to it and I appreciate that. Got a free latte with a check in!Tip: mix the sour cream and sweet butter and you get cream cheese. It isn't weird, just try it even with your burrito. So fire."
11/13/2018,20181113,3,4.45,"Hmm. I'm a little confused by all of the high ratings here. My friend and I must've ordered wrong. The line was surprising as we were there off-prime-time. Seating was hard to come by, we were escorted (quite pleasantly, in fairness) by a waiter to the VERY narrow counter by the front while awaiting a table that never opened up. Our food took a long time to come, and came out five minutes separate from one another, and while my breakfast burrito was perfectly fine, it was no better than any other I've had. My friend had the chicken and waffle, and both were, again, just okay. We said the same thing; if we were in the neighborhood and starving and there wasn't a line, we'd return. Nothing was bad. But the rave reviews that others are writing, I'm just not sure. It was fine. That's the word. Fine. Not fantastic. Not amazing. Just fine.I may have to return, try again, maybe we just really ordered wrong."
11/13/2018,20181113,5,4.45,Have good vegetarian options. Good omelette and a variety of bowls. The coffee was really good as well. Good place for Sunday Brunch.
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.45,"Swa-dee-kah! If you like waffles with a Thai fusion, then try the fried chicken and waffles here at ""Met Her At A Bar"" and your taste buds will be glad you met this place! Located off of La Brea in LA, this corner breakfast/brunch joint is a flavorful way to start your day. With your yelp check-in, enjoy either a free cup of drip coffee or iced tea with one complimentary refill. Parking is on the street, mostly metered for up to 2 hours. I met the owners who are a cute couple who not only love each other, but love serving good food as well. Well worth the try to stop by, just order your food first then find a seat and get ready to eat, then you too will be happy to have ""Met her at a bar."" Don't forget to ask for more syrup for your waffle, soooo good!"
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.46,"I visited once around the ground opening time with my friend. We were both dissatisfied with the food and services. It took over 45 mins to get simple waffle, eggs and bacon. By the time everything arrived, eggs are already cold. Luckily we gave it a second try after a while. Food tastes so good and service now is always attentive. Wake up happy is the one I always order now. It comes with a whole waffle, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages. A big portion of food. The chicken and waffles dish is my favorite. A big thick piece crispy fried chicken on top of a whole waffle and serve with spicy/sweet sauce, butter and maple syrup on the side. Best chicken ever. They also give you a free cup of coffee or ice tea if you check in on yelp. Love it."
11/18/2018,20181118,4,4.45,"This place is great! Decor gives off a comfortable homey vibe and the food is great! I mean... who doesn't love waffles??? We got the berries waffle and the grain bowl, both are fantastic but wish that there were more."
11/18/2018,20181118,2,4.44,Highly overrated! Super noisy and crowded! I ordered the breakfast burrito and couldn't even finish it because of how bad it was
11/19/2018,20181119,5,4.45,"Favorite neighborhood spot! It gets busy so get there early if you don't want to wait in line. However I've never waited longer than 10 minutes for a table despite how small it is inside. The kitchen moves fast! The wait is worth it, every dish I've tried is DELICIOUS and the service is always friendly and inviting. I recommend Wake Up Happy or the Breakfast Sandwich."
11/20/2018,20181120,3,4.44,"I had been seeing this place for a while and wanted to go. Today, I went with a coworker for an early lunch. They have a pretty decent menu with breakfast and lunch items. I ordered the waffle with whip, a size of potatoes and a coffee. The potatoes were quite tasty, but a pretty small portion for $4.50. The coffee was lukewarm as was the waffle. Additionally, my waffle didn't even arrive until my coworker had eaten half of his meal, so I think my waffle was sitting on the counter somewhere for a bit. It was pretty though, just not hot. My coworker ordered a turkey sandwich and he said it was dry, and all of the meat was in the middle of the sandwich and not spread out across the bread. Can't say that we will be back. I won't."
11/21/2018,20181121,4,4.44,This is a great neighborhood spot good food nothing to complain about although it's small and I have seen lines out the door I have not experience that yet luckily!
11/25/2018,20181125,5,4.44,Absolutely adorable and cozy are the first two words that come to mind. I grew up in a relatively small town on the east coast and this place brings to mind the nostalgia of a mom and pop restaurant where people all go for something comforting and familiarity.Situated on the corner of 8th St. and La Brea this place screams quintessential cuteness. My recommendation is the breakfast sandwich with a brioche bun and bacon! This place also gets extra props for having a cute couple who run the joint and make sure to put in an extra smile for their restaurant patrons.
11/25/2018,20181125,5,4.44,"Quirky name and a solid spot for breakfast in LA. This place is waffle palooza, so if you love waffles, there is ""everything waffles"" here. The juices are mega-fresh. It's a great go-to spot."
11/25/2018,20181125,5,4.44,"This spot is awesome. Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning with a date. I ordered the waffle breakfast sandwich, while she ordered the benedict waffle (?). Both were really delicious. Plenty of tables to sit inside, but there's also great seating outside. It was a little chilly that morning, so we opted to sit inside by the window. Great vibe and friendly staff. Service was top notch. Props to this great breakfast/brunch spot in the heart of LA."
11/26/2018,20181126,3,4.44,"Always hopping, cute corner cafe serving full breakfasts and brunches. All indoor seating so leave your dogs at home."
11/28/2018,20181128,5,4.44,"Great little breakfast nook right next to 2 other good places to hang. So I've got mornings and evenings covered!They are just opening up but the new owners have put a lot of work into the place and I love it! Their waffles are fresh crispy and TASTY served with REAL maple syrup! My friend had bagel & lox and that is my next item I will try. Coffee is great and can easily be a daily pleasure! Really happy to see this new place in the neighborhood :)The menus selections they are talking about sound interesting and will work my through them. Little businesses like this need our support to compete with the artificial flavored overpriced mega corps offerings and I will be a regular here ! Two Thumbs Up! I came by, they are expanding their lunch menu. Just tried the chicken soup. WOW!! Added a pic too. It's DELICIOUS & homemade. Kudos!!"
11/29/2018,20181129,5,4.44,"Food did not take awhile to come out. As soon as we got there it was crowded however the servers will help you find a seat, and will serve you drinks while you wait in line. Food was very delicious. I will for sure come back. The waffle was good, the eggs were seasoned well, I esp expected it to not be, the bacon was delicious!! I will come back and I'll bring more friends next time! Orange Juice is PURE amazing too!!"
11/30/2018,20181130,4,4.44,"What a nice little find this was, small but tasty food. I had the portobello waffle sandwich, which was really good. The lemonade i got was free refills but the coffees were only allowed 1 free refill. We actually ran into the owners and they told us the story of Met Her at a Bar which is how they met and they are engaged. My wife of course bought a shirt."
12/1/2018,20181201,5,4.44,Highly recommend! The breakfast is super fresh and the service is always friendly! The butter is to die for!
12/3/2018,20181203,5,4.45,Food and coffee were fresh and delicious. The staff was very helpful and friendly as well. I highly recommend!
12/4/2018,20181204,5,4.45,The chicken and waffles is absolutely delicious. Cozy family and friends atmosphere. Parked in the residential street parking.
12/7/2018,20181207,5,4.45,"My 1st visit... Everything was bomb, down to the water!!!! Huevos rancheros, hot chai tea, warmed up brownie, loved it!!!!"
12/9/2018,20181209,5,4.45,Definitely one of my new favorite brunch spots in LA! Everything was fresh and delicious and definitely Foods I haven't tried before. Definitely recommend the strawberry ricotta toast to finish your meal off :)
12/11/2018,20181211,5,4.46,"Met her at a bar is a place that just feels right whenever I go! I've been there enough to know that they uphold their standards for quality. Their coffee is still great. The service is fantastic !! The waffles are light and tasty . Try the gluten free waffles which is what I had and loved. So today I was back there with hubby. He had a chicken pesto panini with a matcha latte and I had the avocado toast. I love the staff. They are helpful and good at what they do! Today my toast was delicious and they actually cut it so that it made it easier to eat! It's little things like that, that make this place special! My husband loved his sandwich. After eating here for months I still have good reviews and if anything I think the food has gotten better. I look for a couple of things when I go out to eat. One, is how the staff treats customers. Two, is the consistency in the quality of food and three is atmosphere. Is it clean? Does the bathroom smell and look clean? Lastly do they pay attentIon to details . The answer is still Yes! So a big thumbs up for this neighborhood gem . I met her at a bar still rocks"
12/16/2018,20181216,5,4.46,"If you come here; you will meet more than just her, but amazing breakfast cuisine. Take a trip to Thailand and have the fried chicken and waffles Thai style! Best chicken and waffles I've ever had and I didn't have to pay for the airfare to go to Thailand! If you want to play it safe get the classic ""wake up happy"". This hearty dish screams the classic red, white, and blue. Maple wood sausage and hickory bacon accompanied by a great plain waffle. You can't go wrong with anything here. The coffee is amazing. The hibiscus tea is out if this world. The one question that I ask you is: ""will you meet her here?"" - only one way to find out..."
12/17/2018,20181217,4,4.46,"A very solid spot for plopping down with some work and a cup of coffee! I don't always find myself in this part of town, but I'm glad to have this place in my back pocket for when I do. Met Her At A Bar is super central, fairly roomy, and unpretentious. They make a very good americano (my caffeine vehicle of choice) and have fast, free wifi. I also tried their power bowl with kale, dried cranberries, almonds, and a yummy dressing. I found the kale hard toeat, but I'll admit that the two little slices of bread were so delicious and memorable. This is an order at the front kind of joint and the service was fast and friendly. Parking is a little tricky in this part of town, but I snagged a two hour meter about a block away. Would definitely come back for another Americano and to dive a little further into their menu!"
12/20/2018,20181220,5,4.46,"This breakfast was so good I wish I had gotten a picture before I ate it! I ordered the eggs Benedict on a waffle with potatoes and it was probably the best eggs Benedict I have ever had. We were the first ones there when it opened and the service was great, our food took a little bit to come out but it was so fresh and had excellent flavor! The potato's didn't feel like a cheap side dish but were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I finished my plate faster than I'd like to admit. If I lived closer I'd be there every week!"
12/21/2018,20181221,5,4.46,"Really liked the fried chicken and waffles because of the Thai flavors. Crispy and juicy, with just a bit of heat."
12/23/2018,20181223,5,4.46,Pretty cool place for the First date experience or if you just want to spend some time with your​ friends for a breakfast. Everyone's pretty much talking too so it's not quiet if you are looking for quiet. Other than that everything was delicious and awesome.
12/23/2018,20181223,5,4.47,Waffles are iconic. So fluffy and good. The food is also so picture worthy. Definitely do waffles with berries it makes them so much better.
12/24/2018,20181224,3,4.46,"kinda average crowded and small American breakfast place, with eggs and waffles being slightly better than a Denny'snot a nice atmosphere to relax and enjoy your brunch due to volume of people standing in the middle of walkways (through no fault of their own) to try and get their order in at the counter and then stand around more to try and find a seat"
12/28/2018,20181228,3,4.45,"Food: 3/5 Ambience: 3/5 Price: 2/5 Bang for Buck: 2.5/5 This restaurant needs to step up on the efficacy of its service. It took 20 minutes to serve a waffle when the restaurant was less than a quarter full. They had six kitchen staff and nobody could make a basic waffle? They even had a waffle iron in the back. In the purgatory of waffle cafe, we found amusement in the decor. Most of the plants are fake; however, we received a half-dead one as garnish with our waffle. Tip: If your waffling over your breakfast choices, this will suffice in a crunch."
12/28/2018,20181228,5,4.46,"This place is DELISH!! Got there early with no expectations, place was empty. But omg, everything we ordered was AMAZING and naturally the place was packed by the time we left. What a neighborhood gem. HIGHLY recommend!"
12/29/2018,20181229,4,4.45,"When we came there was Not a lot of seats so this place , can get crowded. We found free street parking pretty easily right in front. This place is cute but small. My favorite thing here was the ginormous fresh baked brownie, but I am a chocolate person!I also generally enjoy healthy foods so I ordered the Chicken salad. It was basically just lettuce, a few tomatoes. chicken, Parmesan cheese and light dressing. The dressing was super light and refreshing and I enjoyed the lettuce and tomatoes but the chicken was pretty dry and bland. I wouldn't order this again. My daughter had the Grain bowl- but by that I mean she picked it apart. She enjoyed her avocado and her tomato's but didn't touch most of the rest of the food. I had a few bites and it was pretty good. Service was great, the location is convenient."
12/29/2018,20181229,5,4.46,"My favorite new brunch place!! I tried it w/ a friend for the first time and we both loved it and plan to be back soon. Such a cute looking cafe, and the food was sooo satisfying and fulfilling."
12/30/2018,20181230,5,4.46,Actually the name of this place is what attracted me. Such a lovely story behind the name. Cute space. Order at the counter and they'll bring it to the table. Chorizo on toast. What?? Such a simple idea but I have never had it before. It was so good! The poached eggs on it went beautifully with the toast. My son had the Benedict waffles. That was good too but I liked the chorizo toast better. Little pricey but worth it. Finished it with some cappuccinos. Good coffee too.
12/30/2018,20181230,5,4.46,"This place deserves a reward with how good they're food is!!Food: food here is DELICIOUS!! I ordered the breakfast burrito & loaded waffle fries (think that was the name) & a freshly squeezed orange juice. The portion sizes here are huge & the flavors are exceptional. The burrito I would order again & highly recommend. The nacho waffle fries were crazy good & lowkey addicting, don't leave here without ordering these! The orange juice was fresh & sweet so can't go wrong with ordering this yummy beverage. They even brought me out a cute little waffle with a birthday candle in it for my birthday, VERY sweet! Overall, food is amazing.Atmosphere/service: atmosphere here is cool has a fun hipster vibe to it. There is indoor & outdoor seating although limited in space. There is street parking all around just make sure to pay the meter. Service is nice & food comes out quick!Overall, I will be back! This place has a good thing goin."
12/30/2018,20181230,4,4.46,"Docking off one star because of the following: parking can be challenging, pricey (however what do I expect from the area), and the honey for sweetener was rock solid. But I fell in love with the vibe! Staff was super friendly (I wish I got their names!), she went out of her way to help me get the honey moving into my matcha latte. Speaking of matcha latte, I highly recommend getting it sweeter! As far as food the flavor was all there! I got their chicken and waffles, amazing flavor and super juicy chicken (def. not your average chicken and waffle combo). My husband got their version of an egg sandwich and he really enjoyed it but I think he was jelly that he didn't get the chicken and waffles. Lastly, they had real fresh squeezed orange juice and that just tied everything together. I live about 5 minutes away and I will definitely come back and tell my friends about this place!"
1/2/2019,20190102,4,4.46,"I've been here 2 times now and this is a really solid spot for brunch! I really like the interior, it is a bit tight in there, but not too horrible. They also have outdoor seating. In terms of parking, there's a good amount of free parking in the surrounding area. I haven't had troubles the 2 times that I've went. In terms of food, I've had their omelette with potatoes and the Wake Up Happy. Both pretty solid choices. Honestly their food isn't anything mine blowing, but it's good! I've also had their matcha latte and it's good too. Overall, I would still recommend this spot, but don't expect anything crazy!"
1/2/2019,20190102,4,4.45,"Came to this little gem on New Year's day. This was my first time. The place is small, but very hip and inviting. It was very crowded, and my friend and I got there just in time. The name of the place is interesting, and it is explained on the menu. Very heartwarming and touching. Made me enjoy the place even more. Owners were both working hard, and I could tell immediately that they took great pride in their business. The breakfast was different and great. I would definitely come back again!"
1/3/2019,20190103,5,4.46,Waffle Benedict was great!!Scrambled toast was yummerz too! Great way to start off the new year!!Love their story too!!
1/4/2019,20190104,5,4.46,We love this place! The food is outstanding and staff very friendly and helpful. Try the siracha turkey waffle sandwich for an amazing spicy and slightly sweet treat. They're going to be open for dinner soon and can't wait for that.
1/5/2019,20190105,4,4.46,This place is like Republique but smaller space. The tables are so small and chairs are not that sturdy. Food was good! I love breakfast food. The line gets long as it goes throughout the day. Street parking.
1/6/2019,20190106,5,4.46,"This place was amazing! I ordered their chicken pesto panini with a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. The wait staff was super friendly and helpful. A lady pointed me towards the pictures and helped me order. I was seated almost immediately upon ordering. Their fresh squeezed orange juice was simply delish. (Duh fresh squeezed)Their chicken pesto panini was awesome. The bread was perfect, toasty on the outside and soft on the inside. Their pesto was great, it wasn't to oily or dripping down the side. The chicken was cooked nicely and the tomato and fresh greens tied it all together!"
1/6/2019,20190106,5,4.46,"Best brunch in town.The story behind this place is great - you can read up on it on the menu when you enter. Parking in mid city can be tough but I was able to quickly locate street parking without any issues. Try to review the menu beforehand, it's a order and then seat yourself type of restaurant. Everything runs extremely efficiently and there are lots of tables inside.Everything I had was seriously delicious. The chicken panini was crusty on the outside and the flavors were consistent with what you'd expect. The avocado toast (R.I.P homeownership) was light with lots of parm cheese and a hint of citrus from limes. Finally the waffles and berries were made perfectly. The fruits in the winter are a bit sweeter so this was a great dish to get this time of year.Oh - and the coffee was amazing too. I drank mine black.I'll be back!"
1/8/2019,20190108,5,4.46,Our experience went from a 3/5 to a 5/5 thanks to the owner and staff here.Ordered:Crunchy French Toast (1/5)Chicken & Waffles (5/5 )The French Toast bread tasted old and stale. We each tried a piece to ensure it wasn't just one piece that was off. We sent it back and asked for avocado toast instead. The staff & owner apologized and even gave us a complimentary glass of orange juice while we wait for our new dish.The avocado toast was so delicious. It had a great balance of citrus & cheese and the sourdough was perfect! Definitely coming back for this dish. The fried chicken was out of this world. Very surprised how juicy the chicken was considering the size of the large breast. The crispy basil was also a nice touch and just brought everything out together. The waffle was plain on its own but provided a nice sweet / spicy balance with the fried chicken.Until next time!
1/9/2019,20190109,5,4.47,"I absolutely loved this place! It caught my eye because of the name. You can read the owners' love story on the menu. It is so cute! And they were there being so attentive to all the customers bringing out food and making sure everyone was enjoying the food. I like that you just order and pay at the counter and can sit wherever you want. The waffles were perfect! Soft, buttery and sweet. The huevos rancheros I got had crunchy tortillas and were so flavorful with the black beans cheese, salsa and two sunny side up eggs. It also come with a side of habanero salsa which was ."
1/12/2019,20190112,5,4.47,"Lovely cafe! This location has gone through several owners and names and this is by far the best one. This place is beautiful and bright and a warm vibe. (They have air conditioning for the hot days.)I really enjoyed my Unforgettable Chorizo Toast and latte, and my friend liked her turkey sandwich. I look forward to coming back to the try the waffles.Very friendly staff and easy street parking."
1/13/2019,20190113,5,4.47,"Came by for some brunch with my friend yesterday and had the best experience. I forgot the name of the lovely man that helped us out with the menu but he was so kind and helpful, not only just him but the whole staff was so friendly and welcoming, thank you guys! It took us longer trying to figure out what to order than actually get seated so that was a definite PLUS! I left wanting to try more :( everything sounded soooo good!"
1/13/2019,20190113,5,4.47,"heard about this brunch from a friend and had to try! Lot of great options at this quaint urban LA neighborhood restaurant (they do have a small toast options dw my basic LA brunch gals)..+ come for the waffles because they have it all (basic waffle w/ berries, chicken n waffles, waffle Benedict, fruity pebbles waffles).. split the waffle w/ berries w a friend for that side of sweet - not wowed by it but still quality waffles!!+ got seated and got food fairly quickly despite the line+ great service! Everyone in line got menus and the guy at the register gave me honest recommendations for what to get!+ tbh I came to support this couple because their story is sooo cute they started the place together and yes he did meet her at a bar (read their story on the back of the menu)!PRO TIP: GO ON SUNDAY - free residential parking right behind the restaurant!!"
1/13/2019,20190113,5,4.47,"A solid brunch choice in the La Brea neighborhood! My friend came up from Orange County and wanted to enjoy a nice brunch so I actually suggested here and Republique based on the reviews. Republique's line was CRAZY long for a Sunday morning so we opted for this spot! Parked in a public paid lot ($1/hr parking) about two blocks away. I ordered for the ""wake up happy"" - eggs, sausage, bacon, and a waffle ($15) and my friend got the eggs Florentine. You order at the front, grab a number, and seat yourself. It was so poppin' but we were able to grab two seats at the bar within 2-3 min after ordering. Our food came out quickly after and we were both very satisfied with our meals. Overall, I really have no complaints for this place. It's a quality spot with lots of options - savory and sweet for an average price. Will definitely stop in again if I'm in the neighborhood!"
1/13/2019,20190113,4,4.47,"Service was slow and we had to ask for our drinks like 3 times but the 40 minute wait to sit (corner property but smallish space still) was definitely worth it. Everyone in my table ordered a different breakfast item and it was all delicious. My waffle melted in my mouth, the food is made with love and the vibe inside the restaurant is really chill, I will definitely go back."
1/13/2019,20190113,4,4.47,The matcha waffle is sweet and mocha was sweet too. They taste good in the mouth but heavy in the stomach. Maybe too much creme. Great brunch experience but maybe not the healthy side
1/14/2019,20190114,2,4.46,"WARNING: there is no alcohol here of any kind! That said, mediocre and flavorless food. The waffles are ok most likely because of the syrup. My friend's vegetarian burrito and my omelette on the other hand. Oi, we had to douse it with hot sauce and salt.This place is good for kids i guess but definitely not for adult groups. It's also only good for breakfast! Boozy brunch elsewhere. There's a few restaurants within walking distance with full bars."
1/14/2019,20190114,5,4.46,Small local breakfast spot in my neighborhood that has solid food. I can't stop getting the Wake Up Happy because I always crave a mix of salty and sweet. The eggs are so fluffy and the waffles are always perfect. The drip coffee is good too. I'm sure everything else on the menu is just as delicious. Will need to break my habit and try other stuff!
1/16/2019,20190116,4,4.46,"Yelped a breakfast place and this showed up, I had it bookmarked, and I saw the Chorizo toast, and I had to come!This is located at the corner of La Brea and 8th, across from the old Firestone.I was able to talk to Jake to ask about menu items, he was friendly and helpful! I ended up getting the Wake Up Happy which consisted of waffles, and a small skillet of eggs, bacon and link sausage. And, I got the Chorizo toast.I wanted to try the waffle, and wasn't disappointed. It came with ""butter crumbles""-looks similar to blue cheese and helped in the melting over the waffle. I appreciate a place where the butter doesn't come in a solid hard mass that smashes the waffle or never melts. The taste was basic and good. The syrup came in a small container on the side, and tasted rich and caramel-ly.I'm not a sausage or bacon fan, so I won't comment on it. The bacon came out crispy. Not sure if that's always what you get, but my mom would have loved it.I really liked the chorizo toast. The chorizo was smooth and oh-so-flavorful. It looked as if there wasn't enough on the bread, but looks we're deceiving-it was just right! It came with two poached eggs, two tomatoes, and was delicious.I had the hibiscus cooler iced tea, which was also good, a light fruit flavored tea.There's construction in the area, so not much meters or parking in front. You can park in the residential area, but read the signs. Watch for street cleaning on Monday and Tuesday!"
1/17/2019,20190117,5,4.46,"Had my first meal of 2019 here and I had no regrets! Come for brunch and get the Fried Chicken and Waffle! The tom-yum seasoning they put on the chicken is tom-YUMZ. Their lattes are amazing, service is super friendly, and the café is just adorable!"
1/19/2019,20190119,5,4.47,"Had really good food. Has your order ready HELLLLA QUICK. I'm glad I came here. However, the place is small and can get packed but only because it is worth going to. Parking is hard to find not going to lie..."
1/21/2019,20190121,4,4.46,"Heard about this place and finally got a chance to visit for bfast today. Super cute, small spot on the corner of the street. I got here when they opened at 8am but it quickly filled up , and it's barely a Monday. They have many waffle selections & I ordered the wake me up happy waffle meal. It's a plain Belgium waffle, scrambled eggs, bacon & maple sausage. The waffle was a little too crispy for my liking but overall still a very yummy breakfast. I also ordered a cute little cappuccino. Aside from their waffle selection they have different toasts, eggs benny & a lunch menu. This is a new place so the vibe and atmosphere is very trendy & aesthetically pleasing little spot"
1/21/2019,20190121,5,4.47,"Came here early on a Saturday morning so we could avoid the brunch time when the line starts forming. Small and cozy breakfast and brunch on La Brea. They don't have pancakes if I recall cause I think my husband was a bit disappointed about that. Their food are really good, although I'm not sure if I like the taste of the syrup itself - or could just be that it tasted weird with my waffle sandwich. Latte was fine with pretty, simple latte art. Should get their fresh squeezed orange juice for sure! Iwould definitely come back and order the other things on the menu. It is a bit on the pricier side but it's La Brea so it's not toooooo bad haha"
1/25/2019,20190125,5,4.47,"If you love waffles, ""met her at the bar"" is the place to be. So many choices, from sweet to savory. I wanted to order everything. I got the **You Make Me Wake Up Happy Waffles [cute names] which is scrambled eggs, bacon, maple sausage, maple butter. All you need in a breakfast is this. The waffles was cooked perfect. Perfect moment of crispiness and not too doughy.My cousin got the **Waffletella Strawberries, Nutella and homemade whipped cream. She loved it. Everything else looked good too. Even the people next to us, they friend chicken sandwich, looks amazing. The lattes was good. The service was super friendly and its a small cute brunch spot. I can't wait to come back."
1/25/2019,20190125,4,4.47,"Came here around 1pm on a Sunday for brunch. Cute spot. A little tight. I ordered the met her breakfast burrito. They didn't have a vegan sub option, so I asked to get avocado instead of the chorizo. The food came out in a timely fashion. The avocado came on the side of the burrito instead of inside. I thought that was a little weird. Other than that, it was pretty cool. Staff was SUPER FRIENDLY! The waffles look really good."
1/26/2019,20190126,4,4.46,"""Bacon, Eggs .. Bacon, Eggs .. Bacon, Eggs .. I'm so, I'm so grateful for my eggs"" Is that the right lyrics?! Food: You Wake Me Up Happy (Waffles, Scrambled Eggs, Maple Sausage, Homemade Maple Butter, Bacon)Price: $15Ratings: 4/5; I lovedddd the maple sausages, so juicy on the inside and so crisp around the edges. I loved their scrambled eggs as well! They really cooked it well, as there was a hint of butter and cream. Their waffles were pretty good too! It was crisp on the outside, but it wasn't too hard enough to just cut effortlessly for a bite. This meal was perfect for 1-2 people to share, depending on hunger level. The price is a little pricier for what it was. Nonetheless, beautiful set-up and beautiful couple who runs the restaurant! Note, you order at the counter and the. Take a seat! There is minimal parking, but there are some street parking!"
1/27/2019,20190127,4,4.46,The chicken and waffles are to die for! I am for sure driving there from the South Bay again just to eat that again! Their coffee is also delicious and the owner and servers are super nice. The only downside I thought was that it was a bit loud inside with the echo plus the music. Maybe I'm just getting old!
1/27/2019,20190127,4,4.46,"Came up from Long Beach to roam around and my daughter picked this spot. Great food, fast and friendly service. Had the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich, yum!"
1/28/2019,20190128,5,4.46,"If you want delicious photo friendly breakfast that's actually worth the hype and long lines, then Met Her At A Bar is the perfect spot. Beautifully decorated, gorgeous food presentation, and a unique menu makes this worth the 5 star rating.You order food in the counter first, then you find a table. Seats are very hard to come by and the tables are extremely petite. You'll be very close to everyone. This isn't a place for big groups or people hard of hearing since it is very loud.Now there are a few cons, like the long lines and small interior, but we're in LA so this is forgivable if the food is worth it, which it is.Food:Avocado Toast- beautifully presented with edible flowers and Parmesan curls served on sourdough. Very light and delicious. I suggest ordering a side of protein to stay full. I added poached salmon and it was perfect.French Toast- Toast battered with corn flakes and topped with berries and strawberries. So delicious. The light whip cream, and syrup brought this Toast to another level. I suggest ordering one for the table to share. My friends ordered the Thai style chicken and waffles. The chicken had spicy Asian flavors topped with bell peppers. The dish came with butter, syrup, and Asian sweet and sour sauce. Another friend ordered a waffle sandwich that was stacked with chicken and avocado. Price:Price wise everything is pretty close to $15. I think it's priced fair compared to other breakfast joints.Interior:Small but beautiful. Very mom and pop mixed with elegant greenery. There are beautiful plants throughout and lots of light coming through the windows. Staff: The staff here are so efficient, fast, and nice. They are super on point with picking up plates and clearing out tables to accommodate other people. Everyone is also very good looking lolI was actually helped by the owners and like everyone else, I'm so in love with their love story. I'm completely invested in this couple now. Such couple goalsOverall my experience was great. Waited a while to order but me and my friends were extremely satisfied with our meals. And the food is picture friendly which is a win for food bloggers!"
1/28/2019,20190128,5,4.46,Their Eggs Benedict were delicious! The place is super cute and a little busy but we were able to find seats. The food was very cute and cute place for pictures. The story that's connected to the bar is also cute and you can read on the menu. I would def. recommend this place for a cute brunch date.
2/2/2019,20190202,5,4.47,"This place is great. I found street parking less than a block away on a Saturday morning/afternoon. I came right before the rush came at around 10:45 AM. We came w a party of 6 and the owners were super accommodating, nice, and helpful in finding us a table. Their back story of their restaurant is so sweet. He literally met her at a bar and they opened up a restaurant together. There ended up being a lot of people crowding to get in on a rainy day which was really surprising but that just means this place is worth the hype. I ordered a Wake Me Up happy and so did four other girls in my party which was hilarious but great. It had everything I was craving which was scrambled eggs, waffles, sausage, and bacon. The sausage was delicious and not too greasy. The bacon was thick with flavor. The eggs were soft but could use a little more flavor so I added salt and pepper. The waffles and maple syrup were really delicious. I finished the whole waffle because it tasted so good. The food had so much flavor it was so good. The staff is also so friendly and nice. I really enjoyed my experience here and get why there were so many people lined up outside trying to get in on a really rainy day in LA."
2/6/2019,20190206,5,4.47,This place is absolutely exceptional. The platting is just as beautiful as the flavors themselves. Go here. Eat it all. And be happy
2/8/2019,20190208,5,4.47,"I drive by this place all the time and for the longest time I thought it was a bar and not a brunch place. The restaurant style is to order at the bar and park it wherever there is space. I had the HUEVOS RANCHERO but I found out from one of the owner's that they're known for their waffles which now that I know I absolutely need to go back and try. Parking is kind of a pain, it's just street/ meters. ENJOY!"
2/8/2019,20190208,5,4.47,"This place is great. I've lived in the neighborhood for over 10 years and have seen this space come and go as coffee shops and whatnot. This place has what all those others lacked, an inviting neighborhood vibe with awesome food and cool people running the operation. The co-owner Vinny is one of the nicest guys ever. I met him next door at Little Bar. Haven't met his wife and co-owner but she's usually behind the line slaving away while he is uploading pic of the food and guests to Instagram. Haha. Gotta work that social media grind. Only downside to this place is the line on weekends. But what can you do? ‍ That's a sign of how good they are."
2/9/2019,20190209,5,4.47,"Amazing food. Ordered a burrito, the girlfriend ordered the chicken & waffles and they were both full of flavor, fresh, and perfect size. Will be coming back!"
2/9/2019,20190209,5,4.48,I rarely post reviews unless I really love a placeThe food is amazing the service is great the place is CUTE!Loved itWould come here more often now
2/9/2019,20190209,5,4.48,Our food was delicious and the staff went out of their way to make sure we were seated at a table that could accommodate at high chair even with it being a weekend and prime brunch time. Highly recommend!
2/10/2019,20190210,3,4.47,"After pursuing a lot of yelp reviews, I decided to check this place on my own today- Sunday morning. And my my, was this place busy! Checked in with the reception to find myself 30-35mins waiting in the queue. After tons of people leaving, they put me up at the bar where I met Jake who helped me take my order. Outside the restroom. In front of their open kitchen. It was kinda cool minus the continuous chaos of orders ad people wanting to use the restroom. Ordered straight up, black bean avocado wrap and strawberry ricotta toast. Black bean avocado wrap- the wrap itself was freezing cold. Like you could sense the temperature just by touching it. I understand wraps to be not -hot hot- but I expected it to be atleast warm. The inside was fine- corn, crunchy greens, avocado, black beans although no scratch of hummus that it mentioned. The vinaigrette that it comes with, is totally useless. I got myself some sriracha. They should add some nice accompaniment I think that goes with the wrap. So overall it was alright. Nothing extraordinary for $10. Strawberry ricotta toast- GET THIS ONE! This was sooooo good. Since I sat at the bar, I got to see how they make it. Sourdough toast, with ricotta cheese topped with homemade strawberry sauce- this was tasty- scrapes of lemon zest, and chopped basil leaves, with fresh strawberry and maple syrup drizzle. Although I thought that they could have added bit more on it. It was of big size for $9. Took half of it home. Open kitchen - the beauty of the open kitchen is that you get to see how and what happens inside. The cons of open kitchen is you get to see how and what happens! The owners made time to time check with people with videos and social media. They have their story put up everywhere, personalized the space. The staff is extremely friendly who would ask time and again. The checking out was quick and easy.Overall, I think they need to expand. Space wise. It's really cramped up inside. Not a perfect place place for a date, coz you're sitting right next to somebody. But I guess that's LA for you!"
2/10/2019,20190210,5,4.47,"A friend invited me to this place with a trendy name. I thought at first, ""I hope it's Not like the one near my house(Hilltop Coffee and Kitchen)"".....I was Very happily surprised!Moderately priced, Met Her At A Bar specializes in waffles, but they also serve many other delicious items. While looking over the menu, I found it difficult to make up my mind. Plates of great looking food were being served around me, the aroma filling my nose with my stomach growling. I wanted EVERYTHING!They also serve freshly squeezed juices, fantastic full-bodied coffees and teas, prepared in different forms. The ambiance is warm and inviting. The only detractor is their scanty parking. But I'm not going to fault them for that. The place is popular.If only the new place near my house was THIS good......."
2/11/2019,20190211,5,4.48,Every time I come there I always eat here nice that its right next store / small Mexican spot with big flavor / food is good as well as the prices / I recommend!
2/11/2019,20190211,5,4.48,"Been a while since I was very impressed by a places food, atmosphere AND service. The food here was so good! I have lived in this area for many years. I am upset I didn't find this place sooner! This is the new spot for me:)"
2/12/2019,20190212,5,4.48,"I haven't written a review in some time but today I must say I was blown away! My friend recommended this spot (she's been twice and obviously loves it.) The place is cute, food and service equally amazing! I had the Thai style Omelette over rice (I forgot the name but you'll recognize it on the menu). IT WAS ACTUALLY PERFECT! My friend had a Power Bowl, beautiful but too healthy for me We both shared the Matcha Waffle which was a split second decision and I'm so glad I made it. It lacks nothing! No wonder they don't bring out syrup--it would ruin it! I didn't use salt or pepper on anything ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SHOW UP AND EAT! I felt like I was being waited on by myself and I'm a pretty good server. You get a genuine connection but non intrusive. It was the owner (the lady) and she just rocks along with every one else. I will return and recommend!!!!!!"

2/14/2019,20190214,5,4.48,Wow! Went for the grain bowl. Amazing!! Decided on a healthy lunch but I'm looking forward to trying any of the waffle options soon.  The grain bowl has got to be the best bowl I've ever met. The dressing is not heavy and you really feel the freshness in every bite.  Very impressed with my first impressions.  Service was great as well.
2/14/2019,20190214,5,4.48,Amazing! Waffles and French toast taste great! Can't really go wrong with anything here!

2/15/2019,20190215,5,4.49,"ALSO NO PHOTO I COULD SIT ANYHERE I WANT ?!?!?!WHAT IS THIS MACDONALDS???? NO ITS I MET HER A BAR, this small nice restaurant has a unique look that can only find I'm every CW show like riverdale , Riverdale is honelsty trash idk who writes it but it must be some 70 years old guys trying to figure out what is hip in today's youngins, like who says ""Hold your coconuts""?, like who talks like that, you know who else is the worst???Also, they have ONE!! BATHROOM! What do they expect me to do share the same bathroom as a woman that's disgusting, why do they want me to use a genderless bathroom, in tired of tired of libtards, but I guess they want me to prove my point with straight facts, Nvm they had two bathrooms, I want to apologize to my liberal fans i.do to wish there was more than 2 genders.Not this restuarant for sure, even tho I didnt like their cw aesthetics, they could work out some minor details. Not that the case of this review, the chicken tasted soo good that it made wonder if she had friends, if.she lived right, if she made more than 15 dollars an hour, I wonder if it ate only organic locally produced no GMOs grass. I hope she went in a peace way and they snap her neck quick. Thank you for this meal. The food was good I give it 8 out of 10 chicken neck snaps."

We expected the line to be huge but once we put our name down we didn't have to wait long because 4 groups in front of us rejected the outside table that was available. My bf and I decided to just take it. It is a small place so it would be kinda packed. The service was great. My boyfriend and I got teas, he got just waffles and whip and I got Wake Up Happy. It was so yummy! The waffles were delicious. The butter is maple butter which was a pleasant balance between salty and sweet. I really want to come back and try their pesto panini. Give this place a try!!"

The restaurant is a cute, quaint spot with a lot of shared tables and a small outdoor space. The name is based off of the owners' actual love story, which is quite sweet :) There are a lot of typical brunch options as well as a whole section of the menu dedicated to their waffles. I got the Met Her Breakfast Burrito, my friend got the Thai omelet, and my other friend got the Thai fried chicken & waffle. We shared an order of the French toast. It was all delicious! The staff were also attentive, friendly, and quick. We didn't have to wait very long either to get seated or to get our food. I liked this place, but I would also consider it very standard for LA brunch with a similar vibe and menu offering to many other places like Blu Jam, Poppy + Rose, etc."

2/19/2019,20190219,5,4.49,"This place is so darn cute and cozy. It gets pretty busy for breakfast but the wait times aren't too bad if you have a party of 2-4. We arrived around 10:30am and waited only 10 minutes. The place was jam packed! I love the decor all around (see pics) It was very earthy, artistic, and hipster.We ordered their drip coffee and some waters. The coffee was fantastic. The aroma kept me wanting for more and before I knew it, I was on my second cup! Onto the food! We ordered their Benedict Waffles and French Toast. I had never tried eggs that way and to be honest, I am glad I tried them, but I won't get those again. Not because they weren't good, trust, the waffle and egg were delish together, but because I just don't like my eggs cooked that way. I'm more of an over-medium type gal. They do have a variety of waffle dishes to try though. The french toast was superb! With all the fruit piled on top and syrup as well as whip cream to go along with is, I could've had two servings of that plate.Everyone is very attentive and helpful here. I loved how we were in and out in a breeze and were able to enjoy such a decadent meal!"
2/19/2019,20190219,5,4.5,"I wish I came here more often. I live a couple blocks away. Defiantly my day off spot. This place is great and their service is spectacular, and food is even better. I started coming here when it opened up and recommend it to a lot of people. All of their food has so much love cooked into it I feel happy leaving every time and their coffee will have you so awake you may never fall asleep again I had the quinoa omelette and I was skeptical at first but once I took a bite I was in heaven! I had a little waffle with berries and every berry I had tasted freshly picked. You can never go wrong with this place!"
2/19/2019,20190219,5,4.5,"Such a cute restaurant. They've used every inch of this restaurant to showcase their delicious food! I had their huevos rancheros...beautifully served and just as delicious. My husband had the French toast which he thoroughly enjoyed. We were a party of 4 and each person licked their plate clean! The owners have their story on the menus which is a sweet touch. Based on the photo, I recognized the owner and he was quite friendly and introduced us to his wife also! Looking forward to a return visit soon!"

2/20/2019,20190220,5,4.5,I ate here on my lunch break and it was amazing. The staff was helpful and friendly. The vibe was positive and lively. And the food was delicious. The presentation was beautiful. I had the You Make Me Wake Up Happy and I couldn't stop eating the waffle and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu.
2/21/2019,20190221,5,4.5,"So good. Been here a couple times I've tried the Big Breakfast and the Grain Bowl. Both flavorful and filling without making me feel full. The volume fluctuates depending on busyness, but at its peak don't bother trying to do work here, even with good headphones. Outlets exist, but if you have a large Mac charger it's not going to fit bc a bench is right in front so juice up the electronics before you get here. Plenty of 2hr/meter parking all around. Def could see this being a cute day date spot. Was witness to a terrible one and one that had marriage potential while working lol."
2/22/2019,20190222,5,4.5,"This place was super cute and the staff was very friendly. We went around brunch time on a Saturday so it was also crowded but my bf and I managed to snag a table. You pay up front and the food came out pretty fast.I got the waffles with berries which was displayed beautifully and tasted delicious. My bf got the recommended Thai chicken and waffles. He said they were good and I think they were filling enough for him, too. I believe it was the owner who recommended the chicken and waffles to us as we walked in. I looked on their Instagram to confirm. I love the story behind the name of this place and also the vibe. It's a cute place to stop by for a quick bite if you're in the area."
2/23/2019,20190223,5,4.5,Me and my girlfriend's first time there. It was a cute little spot and the staff was very friendly. The food was delicious and I would definitely recommend this place. The story behind this place is a cute one as well.
2/23/2019,20190223,1,4.49,"I've ordered postmates delivery from this place twice and both times, I have been sorely dissapointed. The first time I ordered the waffle & lox & the classic eggs benedict. I love bagels and lox, so I thought this would be a innovative twist. What I got was a very soggy waffle, stuffed with cream cheese and some not so fresh lox. The eggs on the eggs benedict were extremely undercooked, white squiggly slime on top of a sad piece of ham, barely any hollandaise sauce. I told myself that I wouldn't order from this place ever again.Fast forward a few months later, I'm hungry and craving breakfast, something different and sweet. This place comes up on Yelp, has high reviews and food looks interesting. I go on postmates to place my order and see that I've actually had delivery from this place before (memory is coming back, how could I forget) and I make the bad decision to give them another chance! I order the classic eggs benedict and in the notes I describe my past experience and ask if they could please make sure that the egg is not raw. I even order extra ham and hollandaise sauce to supplement for their small portions. I was hopeful that things would turn out okay this time. I receive my postmates order and nothing but the same. Uncooked eggs and even worse, raw potatoes, overall bland. A inedible breakfast that I paid over $18 for. I usually don't write super long reviews but I requested to have a refund for this portion of my meal and either postmates or the restaurant refused. Being that this is the second time that I've had a negative experience with this place, I feel that a refund should've been issued. I forgot that I ordered from this place the first time but I will never forget again."

2/23/2019,20190223,1,4.48,"These people are charlatans. They spilled hot coffee all over me today. After that the owners proceeded to use intimidation and further embarrass me in front of everyone. They then called the paramedics and talked to other customers to further humiliate me. The male owner is a chauvinist. He spoke down to me like I had no right for being upset. You burned me with hot coffee and ruined my clothes. And they said they'd compensate me then went back on their word. The manner in which they handled this situation was appalling. I don't need to be ""mansplained"" by the owner that ""these things happen."" Lastly, if you don't know how to properly handle these situations you shouldn't own a business. Most importantly the restaurant is unsafe. The beverages counter on top of sitting customers and easy for anyone to get hurt by hot liquids. I'm going to report them for safety violations and go after them to get compensation."

Parking is surprisingly ample in the area - residential/metered. I got the pesto chicken panini and my friends got the wafflebello sandwich and the eggs Florentine, and all three were consistent and delicious. The wafflebello is really hard/messy to eat but it was by far the best dish out of the three. The only downside was my drink! I got the hibiscus iced tea bc it looked all cute but it just tasted like watered down black tea. I added some simple syrup to it and then it just tasted like simple syrup LOL. I'll just stick to the orange juice next time :-)"

The inside is pretty small, but super aesthetic looking. I love how the menu gives a little background history of the owners and the meaning behind the name. Anyways, I ordered the wake up happy for $15 I believe. It comes with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and bacon."

My mom was visiting for the day and my boyfriend and I decided to try this cute little spot not too far from where we live.The environment is very warm & welcoming -- we were greeted right away by the lovely hostess who handed us menus and directed us toward the counter when we were ready to order. We had plenty of questions as it was our first visit but both her and the owner (mindy?) were so patient and accommodating.And then!! Everything was delicious! We ordered the waffle fries, wafflebello, turkey waffle sandwich, wake up happy, oatmeal raisin (gf) & chocolate chip cookies.We enjoyed iced vanilla almond milk lattes & a refreshing Arnold Palmer. We opted to sit on the patio and they were very attentive, making sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our experience.We were even treated to a dessert from Mindy! Again, the food was just a plus. We'll be back for the outstanding service."

They didn't have that homemade taste to me for some reason -- perhaps the hollandaise sauce...Anyway, this was a place I had been meaning to try, so I am happy to cross it off my list.

I ordered the waffle Benedict even though I had eaten waffles the previous day. How often is it that you go to a restaurant where u can sub out the muffin for a waffle?! Never. I'm a big eggs benny fan, but something about this hollandaise rubbed me the wrong way. The spice-to-egg ratio was not well suited for this dish. It might be someone's cup of tea, but I did not care for it. I wanted so badly to enjoy my food because this place was very cute and the entire staff was extremely nice. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back and trying something new just because I enjoyed my experience so much. I'm sure they have some really enjoyable things that I never got to try. Kudos to this place :)"
3/10/2019,20190310,5,4.5,"Really cute place to eat! The service was fast even though it looked busy! The servers were super nice and very attentive. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and a latte, everything tasted great! Definitely will come back!"

3/12/2019,20190312,4,4.5,"Met Her At A Bar's signage always caught my eye when driving by and it's nice that the couple has a cute back story to meeting and opening the restaurant! The restaurant has a quaint neighborhood feel, nested in the Miracle Mile neighborhood. We came at 10 am on a Sunday and got seated in under 10 mins and the food came out in record time. I got the crispy french toast, it had corn flakes, this is the first time I've had it with big pieces of corn flakes rather than it ground up. The french toast was good but way too sweet to finish, it had nutella, whipped cream, fresh berries, and edible flowers on top with maple syrup. I would've gotten it without the nutella next time. Street parking on the residential streets was very easy and a short walk to the restaurant."
3/13/2019,20190313,5,4.5,"Delicious, innovative breakfast items and yummy espresso drinks, fun ambiance, friendly and caring service staff that move quick, and cute love-story origins-- couldn't ask for much else in a brunch spot."
3/16/2019,20190316,5,4.5,"Fast, friendly, delicious, and super efficient! My kind of brunch place.My husband and I scootered here on a beautiful hot sunny day in March... speaking of which... when did it get so hot?!!!! Went from winter to summer and bypassed spring altogether. Oh SoCal. There was a small line outside around 11:45 am on a Saturday but it literally only took 5 minutes to get seated. Can't speak for parking as we scootered here. Definitely no lot. This place is cozyyyyyyyy. Ladies leave your big bags at home and fellas no backpacks whatsoever. The space is teeny tiny but they know how to jam pack the space so you're not waiting too long.We ordered the avocado toast and the crispy french toast as well as some fresh squeezed orange juice! The food came out within 5 minutes. They aren't messing around here. The avocado toast was deliciousssss and cheesy but my only qualm was that the crust was a bit hard so hard to cut through it with my arthritic hands and chew it with my teeth. The toppings though were perfect. The crispy french toast was amazing. Nutella, syrup, berries, whipped cream, crispy flakes of deliciousness. It didn't even need the syrup! So so good. Highly recommend. Juice was freshly squeezed and the small size was perfect. They servers were really friendly as well which always makes things 10x better.Go here now! :) Cant wait to come back."
3/16/2019,20190316,5,4.5,The food was absolutely amazing. The service was fast. Couldn't have asked for a better brunch! Highly recommend the White Truffle Toast!!
3/18/2019,20190318,5,4.51,"Came here for Sunday brunch with my girlfriends and we thought this place was SO CUTE. We were so afraid there would be a long wait, but luckily for us we only waited about 10 minutes. We ordered the avocado toast, strawberry ricotta toast, french toast, American breakfast and the eggs benedict. My favorite was the french toast. It was crispy and fluffy at the same time, so good. The strawberry ricotta toast was mild in flavor and the strawberry jam to top it off was not too sweet, just the way I like it. The avocado toast was heavily packed with avocado and cheese, thank you for that!! Everything came out super fast and the service was excellent. We had about 5 servers check on our table continuously throughout our meal. It was a great experience and I definitely would come back if I'm in the area."
3/18/2019,20190318,4,4.5,"Loved this little brunch spot and definitely want to come back to try other items on the menu!I came by at around 11 on a Sunday morning, and while there were a number of people waiting outside, my party of two was seated pretty quickly! They seem to be really efficient about getting people seated and getting food on the table.Service was SO friendly, and the food was great. Their brunch menu consists of classic brunch items, thai-inspired dishes, waffle creations, and coffees/teas. I ordered the Khai Jiao, a thai omelette with onions and maple sausage over rice + sriracha. The maple sausage was sweeter/more syrupy flavored than I expected, but I still enjoyed my meal overall. Last, but not least, this place is just really cute! Love the story of how this place came to be.I'll be back!!"
3/18/2019,20190318,4,4.5,"Cute place!It was very busy and I'm not a fan of the tables being so close together. It is very hard to have a conversation because it's so loud. We brunched on a Friday morning and it was pretty busy but got seating about 5 minutes later. I found metered street parking right out front. It's in kind of in a strange area. I ordered the French Toast and my friend got the chicken panini. The french toast was delicious and instagram worthy but the flowers and herbs were kind of annoying. Additionally, the waiting staff is incredibly kind and we even had a conversation with our server. Would come back but definitely during a less busy time!"
3/21/2019,20190321,5,4.5,"Amazing!!!!!! Must get avocado toast and coffee. Experience is great. The owner comes and talks to just about everyone, to see how they enjoy their food. Went with friends visiting LA - highly recommend. Will come again! And any friends visiting again - will take them here!"
3/23/2019,20190323,5,4.51,"This place was coming up a lot in my brunch searches so I decided to check it out. Came in for brunch on a Sunday and found 2 hour free parking about 2 blocks away. We went around 1pm and waited less than 30 mins for a table for 3 (not bad for LA brunch). We were seated at the bar, which was cool because we could see into the kitchen - lots of creative items! I would say this is definitely a place for smaller groups, anything more than 3 might be pushing it on the seating. We were on the corner so it was easy to converse but it might not have been good with 4. There are some tables and a little outside seating as well.I ordered the waffle Benedict because it was unique and recommended. It was cooked perfectly and delicious! Nice twist to have waffles instead of an English muffin. Came with a side of potatoes which were very well seasoned. I also had the cold brew coffee which was a great energizer and well-brewed. Service was also fast and very attentive. Overall, I had a great experience here - good food and adorable interior. I'd definitely recommend it."
3/23/2019,20190323,3,4.5,"Great coffee, cozy atmosphere, but a bit too overpriced for the crowded space and food. Close to becoming too instagram-pretty and hype."
3/24/2019,20190324,5,4.5,"Oh mah gawd!!!!!!! Soooo first of all, everything here DELISH! We lucked up and only had a 13 minute wait on a Sunday morning for 2. Josette (sp?) was our server. It was our first time and she welcomed us whole heartedly! She was patient with us as we decided what to order, and offered suggestions that we might try. We both went with the chicken and waffles, and I added the farmer's market berries (which were superb, btw). Okay, so it was freakish how fast our food came out that even our server was shocked! Apparently the chicken and waffles is the #1 selling item so it's always primed and ready to go. The place is small, busy, but worth every single thing!!! Whenever I'm in town then I'll be sure to pop in for deliciousness. Nom nom nom!!!!"
3/25/2019,20190325,5,4.5,"A cafe based on the concept behind of the owners' love story and how they met! Very hipster and trendy looking on the inside... what you'd expect to see in LA :) When we arrived around 11:00am on Saturday, we felt intimidated of the 6 parties ahead of us on the self service waitlist but we were pleasantly surprised with a quick wait and got in about 10 minutes.I got the breakfast sandwich and it was so good, the bun was a little oily but I can imagine how it could hit the spot for someone hung over. The customer service was excellent, everyone was super friendly! Bonus.. they have cold brew. Only thing to note is it is really small in there and we were so closely seated to the couple next to us... I could hear their entire conversation!Would definitely recommend this place for breakfast for anyone staying in Hollywood."
3/25/2019,20190325,5,4.51,"Really good food .. great service , and pretty inexpensive .. first time here , will be back .. great neighborhood local place .."
3/28/2019,20190328,4,4.5,It's a small little place but the food here is amazing. I do believe this place is crazy busy during weekends so try to go during weekdays. Extremely friendly staff. For parking it is only street parking so be ready to spend some money on parking and time
3/31/2019,20190331,5,4.51,"Super fast, cool atmosphere, pretty and very yum! Nice service Def coming back again"

3/31/2019,20190331,5,4.51,"This restaurant was lovely to say the least. My friend and I came in for a late lunch, and the staff was so kind to us. The owner in addition to three other people asked if we had been helped while sitting on the patio with my dog. Suggestions were made and it was clear that the staff believed in the food by the way they detailed it. I had the fried chicken and waffles which was quite truly the most delicious piece of friend chicken I had ever had. My friend had a wonderful avocado toast. The table next to us had truffle fries whose smell wafted over. They also had a Nutella waffle that looked delicious. I do wish the hibiscus coolers came with refills, and the waffles were yummy but cold. That is my only issue and barely a detail. This is my first review as I am sometimes compelled to write bad reviews-- but never have. I have NEVER loved a restaurant so much that I wanted to write a positive review props to the owners. Maybe it's their beautiful story and kind gesture that makes the place so great!"
3/31/2019,20190331,4,4.51,"Overall good experience! I took one star off because of two reasons. First reason being they don't take reservations and don't seat you unless your whole party is here. Second reason was the price for their Waffletella. I love waffles with strawberries so I got that. However, $13 in my opinion is too expensive for one piece of waffle and some thin slices of bananas and berries l. The home made lemonade was great, love they make it free refill!"
4/1/2019,20190401,4,4.51,I got to know about met her at a bar through a coworker because he brought their toasts for our Friday breakfast and it was sooooo good. I wanted to bring my friend here since she was visiting from norcal. We came here on a Saturday around 10am and there were a lot of people waiting in line. I dropped off my friend so she can get seated first and went on a quest to find parking (it's so hard!!) my advice for parking is go into the residential neighborhood there was a good amount of parking a block or 2 away. (if you're coming from Wilshire take a left from the street met her at a bar is in) My friend got the waffle sandwich (vegetarian) and I got their met her burrito. The burrito was underwhelming. Wasn't super great but it wasn't bad either. My friend said her sandwich was very flavorful. It was a little confusing because there was waffles (as the breads) and syrup to compliment it but the insides of the sandwich were savory. Honestly I think I would only come here for the toasts tho! The toasts were way better than our meals. They have 4 choices and 2 of them are vegetarian. We got the avocado toast and strawberry ricotta toasts (amazing) they cost $13 & $9 but honestly I think every bite was worth it. I left some of my burrito but I couldn't get enough of the toast!! Would come back just to eat the other 2 toasts I couldn't eat this time

4/3/2019,20190403,4,4.5,I got the truffle toast which was yummy! I want to try the ricotta toast next! We were seated right away on a Saturday afternoon and they had room on the outside patio despite it seeming busy. All the food options looked great. Wish they were opened late so you could come by and work on a laptop there. Service was super nice too! Street parking on 8th.

4/4/2019,20190404,4,4.5,The only thing stopping me from five stars is the fact that they don't do modifications and they didn't have pure cane sugar for their matcha latte or hibiscus tea which were a bit bitter. Other than that this place is absolute magic and their food is amazing.
4/7/2019,20190407,5,4.5,GREAT FOOD!!! Got the typical Avocado toast and French toast. Delicious!! Highly recommended!
4/7/2019,20190407,5,4.5,"This place is amazing! The employees here are so nice, attentive, and they are always smiling. The food looks good and tastes good! I only have good things to say about this place. Everyone needs to come and try this place, trust me you will love it!"

4/8/2019,20190408,4,4.5,This gem is located on the corner of some random street! Definitely not the nicest view outside. The interior however is very cute and has that earthy vibe of most cafes. The workers are nice but in terms of cleanness it's okay. My friends and I came in a Tuesday afternoon and it was pretty packed with no seating so we waited for a table. After we were seated I watched a server/worker pass by several times with a towel but he did not wipe the table from the previous group (sorta messy as well). I didn't want to bother him so I wiped the table myself with some water from the self serving station. Not the best first impression but the food was so aesthetic and pretty I sorta forgot about that instance!! I got the Waffletella. It was really good but price wise a little overpriced but worth it for the display LOL. I paid $15.24 for one waffle (with $1 tip+tax).
4/8/2019,20190408,5,4.5,"Super friendly & knowledgeable staff, very clean, great ambiance!! Ordered by recommendation, Wake Up Happy (add berries + $3) w/ eggs bacon & sausage. Big fan of the bacon & everything in all is AMAZINGGG!! Also ordered: avocado toast, chicken & waffles & side of potatoes. & they all were soooo tasty!"
4/8/2019,20190408,5,4.51,"This place is amazing! Delicious food, great community vibe and friendly staff. Too many good things to pick my favorite menu item but I love the strawberry ricotta toast!"

4/9/2019,20190409,5,4.51,Excellent if not tight digs. Friendly staff and owners. Impressed they do so much and have such great food. Would come here over and over.
4/12/2019,20190412,5,4.51,There's one hour parking right outside. When you walk in you order at the front and they give you a number and you grab a table. When they food is done they search for your number where you're seating and bring it to you. The avocado toast was a good portion size and it comes with coconut shreds which makes is sweeter and fun to eat. The chicken and waffles were also a perfect combo for bunch. The waffle was soft and not super crispy and the chicken was so good especially after a late night out.
4/12/2019,20190412,4,4.51,"Waited about 20 minutes, which was what we were told. My only complaint was that I felt rushed when I was inside to order, eat, pay and leave for the next customers. Overall the food was rather good and the price was fair. I do have to say the avocado toast was very pretty if that counts for anything, but I wish that came with poached eggs with the price. Would come back."
4/12/2019,20190412,5,4.51,"I've always passed by this cute little nook and was intrigued by the name. After deciding to give it a try, I am so ecstatic I did. I had the waffle with berries which was superb! Gisette our waitress was very nice, attentive like the others, and even conversed a little. The minimalistic chic cafe is great if your looking for a great food spot that feels like your eating in a family home! Plus the story of how the owners met hence the name is a perfect touch!"
4/13/2019,20190413,5,4.51,"My cousin and I went to the LACMA and got hungry so we looked up places to eat and found this place, we were very happy with everything we ordered. The cold brew was good..the avocado toast .. amazing and the waffles were soooo good. The fried chicken was perfection."
4/14/2019,20190414,4,4.51,"I randomly came across this listing on yelp actually. I liked the story on how they met andI wanted to check it out because we were in the area visiting some museums. We arrived about 11 AM on a Sunday and there was a small group of people outside waiting. The wait was about 15 minutes for our party of four and we were offered seating at the bar which was fine with us. The inside of the restaurant is on the small side, and there is a small patio outside as well. We opted to order the strawberry ricotta toast, mamas omelette, the breakfast waffle sandwich and a fried chicken sandwich. As we sat at the bar, we watched the kitchen work feverishly to prepare the items as fresh and fast as possible which was really interesting. Although we didn't order it, the Fred Flintstone waffle looked rather interesting with the ice cream and fruity pebbles as did the chicken and waffles. The waffle that was served with each of our meals was delicious. It had just enough outer crisp and a chewy center with a hint of sweetness. The fried chicken sandwich was excellent. It was a generous portion of chicken on a soft bun with a delicious slaw. We also ordered the waffle fries, which were also delicious. Although I did not try the ricotta toast it looked amazing. We had a server, male, with reddish brown hair and a slight beard who was super nice. I like that they use an iPad style ordering system as well as a payment system. It really speeds up the process overall. We found street parking. The menu seems to have something for everyone, healthy, somewhat healthy and not so healthy."
4/14/2019,20190414,5,4.51,"This is a super cute hipster brunch place. I'm all about love stories and I love how the owners of this restaurant literally met at a bar. They have their cute love story on the menu as well. We waited about 20 minutes and then got seated. The seatings are kind of tight if you sit next to the window but I love people watching so I didn't mind the tight seating. Hahaha :) We ordered the wake up happy, crispy French toast with a side of berries, and fried chicken and waffles. They were all really good!!! But what stood out to me the most was the way they fried the chicken. The flavor was very seasoned and battered to the right perfection. It was perfect to eat along with the waffles. The bacon in the wake me up was BOMBBBBB!!! It was sooo crunchy!! I'm salivating again just thinking about the fried chicken and bacon!!! The waiters and waitresses there were very sweet. They were constantly checking up on us to make sure we didn't need anything else and refilling our coffee when it was low. Thank for the awesome service. I'll definitely be coming back :)"
4/14/2019,20190414,4,4.51,"THIS PLACE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! The service, food, the vibeszzzzzzz, the story behind the cafe. Loved it!"
4/15/2019,20190415,5,4.51,"This is a great breakfast spot! The owner is so nice, he came over and chatted with us and talked about the menu. He was refilling drinks and helping the staff while his wife was cooking in the kitchen.We came to LA for a long weekend trip and I tried to find the best restaurants and this one did not disappoint. In fact, we loved it so much we came back 2 days later before we headed out of town. I had the Thai Omelet and the Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was so crispy and cooked perfectly and the waffles are huge and fluffy! So delicious. Definitely check this place out!!"
4/16/2019,20190416,5,4.51,"I live near La Brea, so I'd seen Met Her At A Bar a number of times before realizing it was a brunch joint and not...actually I have no idea what else the name might suggest; it's kind of a terrible name for a business. The story behind it is cute, I guess--the owners met at a bar, fell in love, and opened this place together (but like, why is their love story the name of their business and not just a page on their wedding website; and why is it told from the man's point of view--the man the implied subject, the woman the object--when the woman is also right there?). Both husband and wife work at the restaurant--I'm pretty sure the wife waited on us, and she was a wonderful host.We went for brunch on Presidents' Day and the place was busy--Matt B. wasn't the only person who wanted a waffle on his day off work. We put our name down and ended up waiting about fifteen to twenty minutes. There was nowhere to wait, really, but it was nice outside and the people watching was fun. It would've been better if we could've had a drink, but alas, no liquor license. (I will stop shitting on the name after this, but if you insist on calling your restaurant Met Her At A Bar, some of your customers might expect a Bloody Mary on the menu.)We were seated at a high counter at the front of the interior, looking out onto La Brea. It was a little tight, but not uncomfortable, and I liked the bustling, cozy feel of the restaurant. It was attractively decorated too, with some greenery and photography and a number of statement light fixtures. Service was fast and friendly.The food was excellent. I got the khai jiao, or Thai omelet, and it was absolutely delicious. (I even uploaded my first Yelp photo in a zillion years because I couldn't find any pictures of it before I ordered it.) This was a three-egg omelet with onion and maple sausage over jasmine rice, served with sliced tomato and sriracha on the side. It sounds simple, and it was, but the egg was perfectly cooked, soft and fluffy but brown and lightly crispy all around. The onion and maple sausage made it beautifully savory with a little bit of sweetness, and it went great with the rice and sriracha, kind of like a Thai omurice. Do not miss this dish. Matt had a waffle with strawberries and that was great, too. This place seems to sell more waffles than Thai omelets, but I'd recommend that khai jiao, especially if you prefer a savory brunch.I was pretty impressed with this place, and look forward to going back to eat the same exact thing again. I guess I'm glad after all that he met her at that bar."
4/18/2019,20190418,3,4.51,"If you enjoy sitting within centimeters of other people and being able to hear every word of every conversation around you, then this place is perfect for you. My friend and I came here on a busy Saturday morning for brunch and were initially brought to the packed bar area, presumably to sit on the laps of the people on bar stools. When I told the hostess we would just wait for a table and didn't want to squeeze in at the bar, a spot for us happened to open up at a long table near the entrance. Someone cleaned us a spot and threw down a stack of napkins, forks, and knives. We sat, and I immediately felt extremely uncomfortable due to the loudest woman I've ever heard in a restaurant, sitting elbow-to-elbow with us. I couldn't concentrate on anything and wanted to leave, but I had examined the menu ahead of time online and really wanted to try one of their delicious-sounding dishes. I will say that I have been to plenty of busy brunch locations on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but I've never before felt so squished or uneasy. We ended up staying and did thoroughly enjoy our meals, but I would never again return on a weekend. This spot is just too small to accommodate as many people as they bring in. Maybe on a random Tuesday morning would be the best time to return. Also note that they don't bring you a receipt of what you ordered, and they'll instead read off the items and then ask how you would like to pay for it. Parking is a little tough to find, but I did manage to snag a 2 hour spot a few blocks away."
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.51,I stumbled upon Met Her At A Bar when we were going to Republique and it was almost it's closing time.They have the photos of their popular food so it would be easier for you to choose.I had their avocado toast which was the best I had for ages. Definitely the best in town and not only delicious but also pretty. Check the photo.Coffee was good too.Park on the street which is difficult.This is definitely my favorite spot now !
4/19/2019,20190419,2,4.5,"I really really thought that after reading all the reviews that I would be leaving a 5 star review for this place but it was disappointment after disappointment. They are a 1.5 star restaurant rounded up to 2 stars cuz I'm wondering if I caught them in a bad morning/afternoon. It was around 11am on a Friday morning. I walked over and started to wait in line around 10:50amish... Then around 10:55amish...I got sat at the bar near the kitchen. Thankfully I grabbed a menu by the door and was able to read the menu while I was waiting for anyone to come by and take my order. Let's start with the chair was dirty and I had to wipe it off with my hands... Then I put my phone down only to find that there was a residue of a dark liquid on the counter that was then on my phone...I looked around but there was no one to give me a napkin so I just wiped it on my pants. Not a good start. But a guy finally came by to clean the counter top soon after. Then about 15 minutes later, I was finally greeted with an apology and a thank you for waiting...(that was good... But if you knew that I was waiting at least come and drop off water...utensils... Or something)... So far not impressed. So I started to read the Yelp reviews as I waited and on one of the reviews it said to order at the counter. So I walk to the counter and ask is this where I place my order? The guy replied and asked if I was sitting...I told him yes at the counter and he said that someone would be by to take my order. I proceeded to walk back to the bar when I realize that there were giving my seat to another person...I had to step in a say... ""Hey I'm sorry but I'm sitting there""...I wasn't going to chance getting another dirty seat and dirty counter top. I'm guessing they don't have the software to say who sat where. So far... Very disorganized. At this one I could've spoken up... But I wanted to give the food a chance to make up for how disorganized this place seems to be. Cuz sometimes the food is so good... I'll put up with mediocre service just to eat some good grub! :)The server gave me water and said that she would be right with me... But I'm guessing that they don't know who got sat first because the lady that got sat about 10 minutes after I did got her order taken first. :/ Then finally it was my time. I placed my order for Chorizo Toast and proceeded to wait... The food came out quick. But I was disappointed in the size of the dish. I don't know what I was expecting but when it came out...I was disappointed. It was one side of a not quite half a baguette toasted with a thin thin layer of chorizo schmeared on top of the baguette with 2 poached eggs with a garnish of wilted micro greens and flower petals. The plate also came with a quenelle of avocado on top of sliced peppers and 2 blistered grape tomatoes. I guess I was expecting a little more for $13... Maybe I'm wrong?? And I got my utensils after I got my food... So far not so good. I was really hoping that my food would make up for all the mishaps that I experienced that morning.The chorizo was salty salty salty. Maybe that's why the thin schmear?? I couldn't really taste the chorizo... All I could really taste was the salt. The bread was actually really good but it's bread. The eggs were poached very nicely and the yolks ran beautifully! Yummy! One of the tomatoes was blistered beautifully and was so juicy and sweet. The other tomato was bad. It had already started to sour I think and after biting into it, I had to spit it out. And normally I love a good amount of acid in with my avocados... But this had so much lemon juice in it... That it was too tangy and overpowered the flavor of the avocado. So overall, I was really disappointed in this dish...2/5...1 star for the eggs and 1 star for the bread. They did come and ask after I was done if everything was ok... And yes I could've spoken up at this time once again but by this time all I really wanted to do was get out. The place is very cute but man it is a little claustrophobic. They crowded in too many tables and too many chairs into a small spot. Lot's of potential but just too crowded for my taste. The place was getting slammed and there were 3 people on break...I know that everyone deserves a break but when a place is this busy I'm kind of wondering why they didn't break them a little later or earlier as it started to empty out by the time I paid and left. It was just bad timing. And it seemed like one of the people on break was a server/manager?? Just overall very weird!Overall, I'm not in a hurry to come back here... But I might come back and try another dish at maybe another time just to see if I caught them on a bad day."
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.5,"This place is as dope as its name! I love the food here. Top brunch spots I've ever been to. The food is exceptional. I usually order ""You make me wake up happy"". It's super delicious. 10/10. Only downside is the place is small so it's hard to get a table but the restaurant has a nice chit chat vibe."
4/20/2019,20190420,5,4.5,This place has some of the best waffles I've had. Really good breakfast place that's no ordinary breakfast.
4/21/2019,20190421,2,4.5,"I loved this place so we came here again trynna get casual late lunch. This time we left after seated（waited for about 20min about 40min before closing). TOO NOISY, every sentence I say I'm yelling. Extremely NARROW Fit Seating (about one finger distance between our table?) I touch elbow with person who sit next to me all the time. This ambience just FILLED me instantly. No easy breezy chill vibe. You can be crowded I get it, good for you, but please please make sure the spacing is generous, noise level containable, and service always on point. For restaurants, food is the priority, but Environment matters!"
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.5,"Awesome breakfast in a great environment with attentive service. What we ordered: Frech Toast, benedict florentine, and the Thai omelet. All there were outstanding and I would order any of these again. My favorite was the Thai omelet just because I LOVE rice and this was a very unique dish."
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.5,Amazing brunch! I've never gotten so many positive Instagram comments as what I got from a pic of my meal here. The service was quick and the food was creative and fantastic. Went here for a quick brunch right before taking my brother to the airport and we both agreed it was one of the best brunches we've had. Great prices too
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.5,This spot is really great. Not the biggest spot but the ambience and aesthetic is just right for the name it feel like a spot you'd see a couple eat at a chill spot in movie scene of something lol but the food is amazing and orange juice is super fresh! The only thing that sucks is I went around 1am and they were out of french toast which was really disappointing but the waffle I got made up for it. Overall loved it and would definitely come back again and again.
4/24/2019,20190424,5,4.5,"This place is so good! Been there twice now, first got the Florentine Benedict, then the waffle and lox (the I miss you I think?) and my boyfriend got the crispy French toast then the avocado toast. All of it was sooo yummy, the Benedict was my favorite- the house made sauce was delicious and even the spinach was seasoned so well, which most places don't typically take the time to do. The atmosphere is also so cute. Glad that we found this little gem near us :)"
4/25/2019,20190425,5,4.5,"Yum. Parking was easy for me, there is street parking down the corner. It didn't require a meter. There is construction down the street for the new plaza being built. It's good that they have brunch hours because I imagine the night-drive hectic. It looks like you can grab a table and a server will come to you and both, you can order your food/coffee in advance and grab an empty table. They have a slightly covered patio outside that looks nice too. It looked like there was a good amount of seating for when I want but I cannot imagine it completely busy! The coffee was GREAT. They have it pre-made already. I like it. Delicious.Chocolate chip cookie was fat and thick and a great treat to drive with. I had the Benedict waffle with country potatoes. Their ketchup was good. I don't know why I have to mention their ketchup! Some places have ruined ketchup for me. Point- you have good ketchup and don't you ever mess with it! The eggs were perfect. I loved the waffles. I wish there were more waffles. Maybe one more square. It was like half a waffle. Wish G made it out for brunch! I think she would have liked it."
4/25/2019,20190425,4,4.5,"My roommate and I came on a weekday, so the place wasn't too crowded. We were able to order quickly and there was plenty of seating. Our food was brought to us pretty quickly and the staff was attentive and checking in on us frequently. I ordered the chicken pesto panini and it was great. They were generous with the pesto which made the panini very tasty and bread was just the right amount of crunchy! However, I wish it did have a little more chicken. I had a couple of bites where I was only tasting veggies and bread. Overall, the atmosphere is chill, the staff is welcoming, and the food is tasty. I'd definitely recommend checking it out! P.S. The place is cute and IG worthy (if that's what you're into)"
4/27/2019,20190427,5,4.5,I will definitely come back Food is delicious I'm in love with huevos rancheros yummyyyyTheir coffee is very good quality taste very good They put a lot of love and decorate their dishes very pretty
4/30/2019,20190430,5,4.5,"My friend and i came across this cute place and had to stop in! We got the Flintstone Waffle and the Chicken pesto panini! Ugh all was so good! Oh and our waiter was adorable, he helped us decide on our choices, as there are sooo many great ones to choose from. Also, their Arnold Palmer and hibiscus tea was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and anyone looking for a quaint lovely ambiance with delicious food. Their story is so adorable!!"
5/3/2019,20190503,5,4.51,"I cannot remember the last time I had an amazing experience at a restaurant in terms of customer service, but if that's what you're looking for a brunch, definitely come to Met Her At a Bar. This place is the spot for perfect brunch. Short wait, great menu, delicious food at a decent price and the customer service is amazing! I cannot stress this enough, but that is what made my experience very memorable here. Long story short, the owners of the restaurant met at a bar, fell in love and got married and they later opened this restaurant and still run the restaurant to this day. Our waiter was the wife and she was the sweetest person. She's really nice and wears a big smile on her face. She was very patient when I had a million questions about the menu and checked up on us multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal. The food is bomb! It was maybe about a ten minute wait for our food to come out. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and it's a good sweet. But definitely get a large. I got an avocado toast, and my other friends got a french toast and a breakfast burrito. We all tried each other's foods but I was obsessed with the french toast the most. They add cereal flakes to it and it's so so good! I think it's a customer favorite here. The avocado toast comes with a mountain of cheese flakes and the breakfast burrito also comes with perfectly roasted potatoes on the side. This is probably my new favorite brunch sport and I cannot wait to come back more often and bring my friends out here. More people need to check this place out!"
5/3/2019,20190503,5,4.51,"Hands down one of the best breakfasts we've ever had. It's a small spot full of locals (probably annoyed when tourists stroll in). The story behind it makes me love it even more - it was literally started by a guy who met his love at a bar close by. The only thing missing was some bubbly to turn that amazing OJ into a mimosa.We went with the kids and they absolutely loved it too! And try the bacon - we didn't snag a picture but it was crispy perfection! Everyone that works there is amazing, sweet, and personable. Glad we went in person instead of using Postmates."
5/3/2019,20190503,4,4.51,I really do love this place. Went for brunch/lunch on a Friday around 11 AM. A few guests were waiting out front. We were able to sit along the counter which was fine. Although they are busy they are super efficient in taking your order electronically. People are constantly coming around asking how you are and if you need anything which is appreciated. This time we tried the chicken and waffle and the wake up breakfast. Both were outstanding. Really love the dusting of Thai spices on the chicken with the waffle and the chili sauce on the side. The wake up breakfast is huge and my guest ate everything. There's something about your scrambled eggs that are just so delicious. They are super creamy and well seasoned. There's something for everyone on the menu. Street parking can be a little tough but there's always something around the corner.
5/4/2019,20190504,5,4.51,"My only regret is not dinning here sooner. The food is not only delicious, but it pleasing to the eyes. My eldest daughter ordered their avocado toast and she loved it! My little one had their Flintstone waffles and she dug right in! I went with the waffle+lox and let me tell ya, I'll never have lox on a bagel AGAIN. This place for sure is going to become our weekend breakfast spot! Oh, and let me add... service here is top notch. Even in the heap of a busy morning, they checked in regularly to ensure that all was well. All in all, great dinning experience. This will now become our Saturday ritual."
5/4/2019,20190504,5,4.51,"Who doesn't love good food and a great love story?! This is hands down one of my favorite breakfasts spots in L.A. ,and it's worth the wait. Look at that waffle action!"
5/5/2019,20190505,5,4.51,"This brunch spot is so cute and has great food. Their menu is a mix of sweet waffle creations and traditional breakfasts such as eggs, sausage and french toast. I had the eggs florentine with potatoes. The eggs were poached perfectly, but the dish had a bit too much spinach for my liking. The potatoes were crispy and seasoned well. I also had a try of the french toast and it is cinnamon-y and very yummy, although it may be overly sweet for some people. The servers are suuuuper nice and if you're having a hard time deciding what to get (as I did, because their menu has so many great options) they are very willing to give you suggestions and their own opinions on dishes. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in LA!"
5/6/2019,20190506,5,4.51,"As much as I wanted to stay in LA just another day, the responsibilities of adulthood were calling me. But first... brunch.Found this cute little place, thankfully parking wasn't too painful this time around. Walked in and immediately loved the vibe. I ordered the power bowl + smoked salmon (cured) & my friend ordered the Vegan Waffled (wow that was fire af)The food was a delight and of a generous portion. As we drove back home, a few days later we wished we'd stashed some more food from this place. Will definitely be back the next time we visit LA."
5/7/2019,20190507,5,4.51,"What an amazing experience i've had here at Met Her At A Bar! The place has an amazingly chill neighborhood feeling and that's the sense you get from the moment you walk in. The owner Vinnie was warm and kind and made each patron feel welcome. With over 95 years of family history running food services businesses it's obvious the apple doesn't fall far from the tree; the food is amazing! I had the Wake Up Happy Waffles with Berries and a Mimosa, i loved it.I will absolutely come to this place again! You won't regret checking out this gem!"
5/11/2019,20190511,4,4.51,"Overall a 3.5 stars experience.For a visit around 2pm. They close at 4pm and there were still people waiting to get seated. Very popular dining spot.I got seated immediately for dining solo, they got me a spot at the bar.Vibe: VERY friendly, hip.Noise level: loud (but acceptable).My server was pretty good. Very kind, polite.(Overall, water service was a little shotty, I had to ask a few diff people to refill, but a carafe at the get go would have helped, since I did order a LARGE cup of ice water, knowing that I drink alot during a meal). The carafe of water was brought over, when I was about to leave / pay. Oh well.The food was good, decent. Looks prettier in the pics though.The woman who seated me recommended chicken n waffles as their best dish, but seemed to heavy to eat. But perhaps I ordered wrong....Ham sandwich was on a good French baguette, lettuce, Dijon mustard and a little tomato. I had them add onions and pickles (for which they did an upcharge of $1.75, a but NOT much for the amt / value provided).- Sandwich comes w a basic side salad, fresh greens and chopped tomatoes (balsamic and oil dressing)- Bread toasted would have made it greater- Some cheese would have been nice- The ham seemed very high quality- You do have the option of chips (which might be a bigger portion)I wanted to taste their waffles that everyone was raving about.- Got a half sized berries waffle, pricing is NOT half, but 2/3rds- Waffle was soggy, soft- I was expecting something more crisp, with more wow- If you want to add bananas, another up charge (I went banana free)- Tons of whip cream makes the item look alot bigger than it is- Some strawberries, a few blueberries- I thought there would be more berries, more valueI got an off menu sangria EASY ice; $9.- It tasted good, had a chunk of pineapple, 1 grape and 1 melon- Some citrus / orange garnish would have been nice (MIA)- They didn't go to easy on the ice, and shorted me on the glass, poured less than could be. - Usually sangrias are poured generously to the rim. - Oh well.So for 3 items, $32.For tip $37+.Not a great value for a meal.Weird how my experience fell short of all the plethora of 5 star raving reviews."
5/13/2019,20190513,5,4.51,"Amazing food, small portions pack with delicious flavors. I had the chorizo toast with poached eggs, my mom had the huevos rancheros and my dad had the waffles. Shout out to Melody, the hospital was amazing!!!!"
5/13/2019,20190513,4,4.51,"Very good food. I really loved the place and ambiance. The servers were really nice and prompt. I had the crispy French toast and they were amazing. Everything tastes great. Although it was a very busy day there they serviced us fast. The only reason why they didn't get 5 stars is because of the tiny space. The servers were bumping into the customers and let's not even say you want to use the restroom, it's a tight walk over. But above all I would go again."
5/14/2019,20190514,5,4.51,"Came here half and hour before it closes, the waitress was so friendly and had us sat down in no time. Really wanted to try the avocado toast since it looked for pretty in pictures. The fried chicken waffles was so good. The avocado was kind of soggy while the french toast was just as good as any other french toasts. The owner saw my friends and I talking pictures and talked with us. After that he came back with two waffles, saying that it was free! The service was good and the food were pretty okay too. Overall, it was a good experience though and I would love to come back and try other dishes!"
5/14/2019,20190514,3,4.51,"My husband and I had breakfast at 10:30am on a weekday. It was crowded, but not overly so. You order at the counter and find a table. Because there was a line, a server armed with an iPad took our order to move the line along. We ordered the Wafflebellow Sandwich (husband), a Waffle Benedict (me), and 2 ""Daily Drip"" coffees. We found a table and waited for our order. NO coffee came (while tables that had ordered cappucinos seemed to be getting theirs quickly). We mentioned to an individual who was delivering meals that we had 2 coffees coming. NO coffee came. We mentioned it to another server. ONE coffee came. Finally, AFTER our meals were delivered our second coffee came. MORE on the coffee: Our table had no sugar or sugar substitute on it. We had to use the basket on the table next to us. When I asked for cream, I was directed to a small area with pre-packaged liquid cream in individual containers (why these couldn't be ON tables is puzzling). So I had to get up, leave the table and my meal in order to get some cream. In addition, NO refill was offered until we asked for it. We hadn't ordered cappucino, Americano or other specialty coffee...simply drip coffee. How hard is 1) getting it on time, 2) getting a refill?Finally, the food was good - of good quality and plentiful enough. Good variety to choose from with sweet and savory waffle dishes available. Prices are comparable to most upscale breakfast places. Service - meh, and the atmosphere too crowded with tables crammed together so that we were privy to the conversation of the woman and her lawyer sitting next to us.Service at other nearby places such as Joan's On Third is far more professional."
5/16/2019,20190516,5,4.51,Had a lunch date with my hubby. I had been searching for a good chicken pesto panini and this one was just that. It was delicious and filling. I couldn't even finish the entire sandwich. Great experience for our first tome there!
5/16/2019,20190516,2,4.5,Food is overpriced and the quality is not great. The portions are small. I was still hungry after spending $30 here. So many other great places to eat nearby
5/17/2019,20190517,5,4.5,"What a cute name! Went here for brunch with a few friends on a Sat. There was a bit of a wait because the place is fairly small. The place had such a nice homey feel and it helped that all the servers/hostesses were very kind and smiley! Parking here wasnt tooo bad because if you go behind the place, theres a neighborhood that you can park in. Everything on the menu loooked so yummy! Many choices of savory or sweet options. i ended up ordering the bello bello wafflebello sandwich and we also ordered the OMG oreo waffle fudge to share. Everything was VERY Delicious! i've never had a waffle sandwich, but this wasnt bad! i shouldve asked for more cilantro aioli (because i loooove cilantro). also, very glad we shared the oreo waffle because it was largee!great cute place to go to for brunch/lunch!"
5/17/2019,20190517,5,4.5,Yummy place to eat! The place is very nice and cozy. Great breakfast/brunch spot for sure! Cappuccino was freshly made and the waffles are amazing!!!
5/18/2019,20190518,5,4.51,"Three words... Chicken. Pesto. Panini. It's a problem. I crave it all the time. I have had other items and it's all been great. The strawberry ricotta toast, breakfast sandwich, coffee cake, cookies... I will get through the menu. The service is solid. They now have alcohol. Weekend brunch is crowded so be prepared to wait... it will be worth it."
5/19/2019,20190519,5,4.51,The waffle breakfast sandwich was amazing. My wife had the waffles and chicken and it was also bomb!!!!
5/20/2019,20190520,5,4.51,Super yummy and great service! Atmosphere is pretty and chic! A very cute place on the corner. :) I came here and doodles for a bit while waiting to my meal. Music was nice and it was just an overall happy place to be at!
5/21/2019,20190521,4,4.51,I can see that matter at a bar is a very very delicious restaurant especially as let's say a coffee cafe or a breakfast place you will definitely enjoy yourself The parking is not the best it's mainly all street parking and they can definitely be really busy on weekends so I would say expect to come in expecting a wait time but other than that you will enjoy
5/22/2019,20190522,5,4.51,Food 10/10. Customer service 10/10. So good and I'm already planning on my next trip with my friends. Loved it
5/23/2019,20190523,5,4.51,"Breakfast was delicious and the service was great. There was a bit of a crowd waiting outside for a table, but didn't have to wait long at all. My daughter and I ordered the Nutella waffle and ricotta strawberry toast...so good."
5/24/2019,20190524,5,4.51,Waffles galore. I had the Mama's omelette which was delicious! My girlfriend got the Wake Up Happy waffles with eggs and sausage. The sausage was a bit sweet and really good. OJ was truly fresh squeezed.
5/25/2019,20190525,5,4.51,Great place for morning breakfast - excellent quality fresh food and coffee.The people are friendly and care for your comfort and meal experience.Will recommend to friends and family.
5/26/2019,20190526,5,4.51,I never had chx and waffles and decided to give it a whirl. The name of the restaurant is also catchy and (cute). The service is top notch and servers are super friendly and chill. Food was hot (this makes me so happy) and it was fast! The meal was so delish!! The ambiance is amazing. I'll have to bring the homies here now.
5/26/2019,20190526,5,4.51,"Love. Love. Love the waffles. Waffles are my favorite and they do it right. Be prepared to wait for a seat but it's worth it, and they are so nice."
5/27/2019,20190527,4,4.51,"Came here for brunch and got a waffle bello. Parking is nearby is a nearby parking structure, so it was nice to not have to hunt for street parking.Food was good! Enjoyed by waffle sandwich and friends enjoyed theirs as well! The space is a little small so this might get crowded during busy times, but we didn't have to wait."
5/27/2019,20190527,4,4.51,"YUM!! With SO many breakfast options in the area, the pics of the food is what brought me here but I was pleasantly surprised by the kind wait staff, the perfect portions & beautiful plating.Classic eggs benedict - loved how the English muffin wasn't too thick or greasy, the ham was nice and thin and egg was perfect. Potatoes were crispy. Only wish I had more hollandaise sauce. Huevos rancheros - crisp, wonderfully cheesy and my husband loved the spicy homemade habanero.Waffletella - perfect to split with our family of 5, very sweet and could have used more whipped cream proportionately. I ordered more and noticed I was charged a hefty $3 for a little plateful.Power chai - perfectly done, a little sweet and a bit spicy but just right. Matcha latte - great taste but could definitely use agave/honey?Definitely will come back - worth the wait (the staff handles the list and seating really well)! Only left one less star because I wanted a bit more hollandaise & whipped cream but that's my own preference!"
5/27/2019,20190527,4,4.51,"Came here for the first time with my boyfriend and had a good experience overall. The food items we chose were the waffle and berries, chicken and waffles, and waffle Benedict! I would HIGHLY recommend the first two options !! The Benedict was okay. We parked on the street 5 minutes walking distance from the restaurant. Parking wasn't too difficult to find. The only downfall was waiting an hour to be seated but it's not a big place so it's understandable. Also, our food dishes all came at different times which was okay since me and my bf were going to share the plates but if we weren't then we would have ate at different times.  Despite these things we will definitely be returning :)"
5/27/2019,20190527,2,4.5,"I was super excited to try this spot. After waiting 20 mins to be seated, my bf got served his food first. I waited patiently for about 25 mins, my food did not arrive. My neighbors next to me were still eating, they finished a new couple sat down. I lost it when they got their food and I still hadn't gotten mine. To make matters worse my food was cold, wrong, and the waiter Chris bumped into my back hard while I was trying to eat. Then, I bite into a crunchy eggshell! The only reason why I'm giving an extra star is because they tried to make it right after the fact though at first Chris said there was nothing they could do for us. Then the manager came up and took my meal off the bill however that only partially made up fo the terrible service. Never going back here!"
5/27/2019,20190527,5,4.51,"The food and service was amazing! Loved the history behind the establishment, which was perfect for a breakfast date. The patrons and staff were so friendly, we felt like old friends having breakfast together. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It is all delicious. Can't wait to go back. Yes"
5/28/2019,20190528,5,4.51,"Oh, man! This place is delicious. We came here on a weekend and were able to get seated right away, despite it being a small space and fairly busy. Make sure you write your name down on their clipboard - I noticed a couple that didn't realize and I guess they were waiting around, but we put our name down and were seated quickly. We ordered the Oreo Waffle, Nutella Waffle and a side of eggs. The food came out pretty quickly and was so freakin' good! Parking can be tough because it's right off of La Brea Ave, and it's a crowded area; however, we were able to find metered street parking fairly close to the restaurant."
5/28/2019,20190528,5,4.51,"Went to this restaurant on a Saturday morning around 9am. It was full but not busy. It's a order and then find your own seat place. Service was good and friendly, food was delicious.Towards 11a, it started getting busy. It's a smaller space so on the weekends there seems to be a wait outside. Everything we ordered was delicious. I would definitely recommend and return.- You Look So Familiar Breakfast Sandwich- Met her breakfast burrito- Crispy French Toast- Hello There, Beautiful Power BowlWe parked on the street (metered). At 9am, there were plenty of spaces."
5/28/2019,20190528,5,4.51,"Guys, three words... LOVE. THIS. PLACE. Met with some friends here for a girls brunch and the reviews don't lie! The service was amazing and attentive. The food was absolutely delicious and despite the long wait (because it's that amazing) our food came out so quickly we barely had time to catch up with each other! If you're looking for a cute brunch place I highly suggest you pay them a visit. You will not be disappointed."
5/29/2019,20190529,5,4.51,"Came here on Memorial Day around 11:30am and there is a line of 45mins. However you can put down you name and walk around until your estimated time. The inside was a little bit cramped but has a nice vibe to it. The two of us were seated at the bar table near the window (the host didn't ask our preference) which is not ideal for conversation but perfect for selfie! One small detail that impressed me is how efficient the service is: your server comes over quickly with an iPad and almost immediately after your drink request, an other server will bring the drinks while the one taking your order is still helping with the ordering. Also the food comes quick enough even though it is a full house. I ordered the Benedict and my bestie ordered the wake up(I believe) with waffle. My eggs Benedict was cook perfectly and the English muffins were very very crispy toasty! I 100% appreciate making simple but delicious and well executed dishes like these. I tried my friend's waffle and they are incredibly crispy on the outside and still soft inside. The honey whipped butter was a nice touch. The eggs in her skillet was cooked perfectly.Guys this is THE textbook accurate example of you do not have to impress customers with something crazy. Do the most simple staple dishes justice and I absolutely appreciate how much attention to details they paid (from efficient service to make the simplest brunch food exceptional). Oh and you are only paying $15 for a great brunch in the heart of LA!"
5/30/2019,20190530,5,4.51,"Great breakfast spot!!!The waffles are always perfect. I've been here a few times now. The owners are really cool people, truly hard workers in the kitchen and out. It really shows that they put their hearts (literally lol) into this restaurant. The fried chicken and waffles is the best. TIP: I normally add a sunny side egg on top! They have indoor and small outdoor seating which is great if you have a dog. If you sit inside - try the counter tops by the kitchen. It's amazing to see the food made right in front of you in the little kitchen. Parking is street parking only. But shouldn't be too hard, since it's on La Brea."
5/31/2019,20190531,5,4.51,This place is beyond awesome. The waffle was flaky and Crispy the eggs were fluffy and man the bacon was actually crispy and yummy. I love going to new places especially for food. Something unique and tasty . I will definitely be coming back to this house pace . Definitely like that this place is pet friendly.
6/2/2019,20190602,5,4.51,"My boyfriend and I came here on our way to six flags and it is so delicious. We definitely were satisfied with the food , coffee and customer service!! Whenever we are in the area we will be back!"
6/3/2019,20190603,5,4.52,"This is one of my new fave brunch places. It's small and cozy. Menu is amazing, prices are descent. Coffee is perfect and our server was really nice. I will definitely come back!"
6/4/2019,20190604,4,4.51,"Great place to grab a quick snack on the go or just for a quick bite to eat. Located in the mall parking lot at the end of the mall. Not too far from the Starbucks. The menu changes seasonally, but the waffles and pancakes are always a keeper. I am a regular here so I've had a lot of new guests. There is a mini bar area to sip on some cold brews. The wait staff is super friendly and helpful, sometimes getting into a heated argument with customers over who should take what. The service is great. They have a few cashiers to greet you for payment and even give you a smile when you get to your seat. The staff is quick to respond and the staff is super nice too. I really enjoyed the food here and hope to come back often!"
6/6/2019,20190606,5,4.52,Good little spot on the Westside. Easier to get seating than Roscoes. Employees friendly and the food is good. Great charm and cozy for a local breakfast spot.
6/6/2019,20190606,5,4.52,Stopped in for a quick brunch. I love breakfast and always want breakfast much later in the day than most restaurants choose to serve it. But this place serves great eggs and greens all day. Their waffles and coffee were also great and it had a good vibe. The owners were extremely kind.

6/7/2019,20190607,2,4.51,"Why is this place so crowded, am I missing something ? The waiter recommended the turkey sandwich. Let me explain something to you, this turkey sandwich was terrible . You know who makes a better turkey sandwich...? Anyone. I noticed they used Kraft American singles for the cheese. The kind that comes in plastic wrap. Wtf. Need I say more? I was happy to leave. Iced tea was excellent."
6/8/2019,20190608,5,4.51,"This was a hit. Good brunch food an led it was super busy in a good way. The waffles and egg dishes were good. Ordered drinks that did not arrive and had to ask a few times, but they were pretty busy and got it done. Five stars for the food and awesome setting."
6/9/2019,20190609,3,4.51,"We had super high expectations based on the reviews and the photos. It's a super cute place, and the food is spectacularly presented, but it wasn't as awesomely tasty as I had hoped. We tried two of the most popular brunch dishes, and yeah... not bad, but wouldn't need to go back. If you want to try it, I would suggest going pretty early to avoid a long wait."
6/9/2019,20190609,5,4.51,"Simply amazing! Every dish was cooked to perfection! My wife and I ordered the Oreo waffle, eggs Benedict and an avocado toast to share. The Oreo cookie waffle was like a tasty dessert for breakfast. The eggs Benedict was delicious with a nice runny egg where the yolk flowed perfectly out after it was cut. Lastly, the avocado toast was rich in flavor. Additionally, the staff was super friendly and the food came out fast. I highly recommend everyone try the food there."

6/10/2019,20190610,5,4.51,How did I not know about this spot after driving by it daily?  It's great. Chicken and waffles w/ Thai spice and sweet chili was excellent. Friendly service for our very large group.  A new favorite.

6/11/2019,20190611,4,4.51,"~Food~Waffle Benedict: pretty standard eggs benedict, good poached eggs and the waffle grooves worked really well to catch the sauce and egg dripsMatcha Waffle: most of the matcha flavor was in the matcha syrup sauce but it combined with the whipped for a little too sweet for me~Price/Quality/Quantity~The chicken and waffle was a good amount of food while the matcha waffle at $13 for 2 small pieces with nothing else is a little steep. I guess it's a hit or miss here.~Atmosphere/Service~I came here on a Sat at noon and only waited 15min (woo!). It was busy but they were attentive. The only irk was the Chicken and Waffle came out so late that everything else was cold, and 2 different servers gave us contradicting answers as to why it was taking so long. The inside was very unique, it's almost like a Euorpean cafe smashed with a Thai street vendor.~Bottom Line~Quirky brunch place with decent food."

And I'm a total breakfast snob living in the North Park area of SD for so long. Waffles were tasty... eggs MELTED in your mouth (I wanna know their secret!!) sausage and bacon were delicious and cooked perfect. And OH EM GEEE the butter Now for the chicken and waffles... AMAZING. Chicken was fried to crispy juicy perfection! It had a little kick of spice and was absolutely to die for. They served it with a Thai sauce or maple syrup (sweet and savory.. love it!) and both were great.Highly recommend, will totally be back if ever in the area!"

6/13/2019,20190613,5,4.51,"Hands down, best chicken and waffles that I've ever had. The proportions were perfect, the chicken was perfectly spiced and extra crunchy, the waffles with the butter and syrup were delicious! I also got a chance to meet the manager and tell her about the great experience with the service and food I had. I definitely recommend this place and will be back with friends."
6/14/2019,20190614,5,4.51,"I cant give this place enough stars!! The place is small but super well kept after, always someone cleaning off tables / cleaning up. Every single staff member was super kind and helpful! After we ordered it took less than 10mins for our food to come out, and it came out hot but absolutely delicious! I got the wake up happy and it was amazing. The waffle is cooked perfectly(and im a pancake girl normally!) and the eggs and bacon/sausage had so much flavor. Plus the cold brew was DELICIOUS. My new fave breakfast place i've ever been to by far"
6/15/2019,20190615,5,4.51,"I brought my friends here who were visiting from out of town and we all absolutely loved it! The food was delicious and everything came out not too long after we ordered it. Super trendy spot so it's obviously very busy especially around brunch time, but so worth the wait!"
6/16/2019,20190616,5,4.52,"This place was great! Awesome food, good service. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and the flavor combination of the spicy chicken and the syrup was amazing. My husband had the waffles and lox, which he also really enjoyed. Parking on a Saturday morning was easy enough... Street parking about a block away on a side street. Restaurant was small but we sat outside on the""patio."" Cozy seating, which was fine!"
6/16/2019,20190616,5,4.52,"Cute little breakfast/lunch place. I had the omelet with potatoes and split the very berry waffle and it was great! The home potatoes were seasoned well and crispy! The waffle was by far my favorite, fluffy and soft."

6/16/2019,20190616,5,4.52,"Fun decor, really great service, and delicious food. Waffles are absolutely worth every five star review they've received. Truffle toast is also a standout (though if you don't like ham, it should be noted that there's a mountain of it atop the toast, and that's where the truffle is drizzled). Ask for the bacon extra crispy: they do it to perfection.Eggs were fine. Sausages were the only meh moment. Parking on the street was relatively easy for LA. Tables are close together, so the restaurant is a crowded, friendly, buzzy place when it's full."
6/16/2019,20190616,4,4.52,"This place was awesome! Will def be back. Only caveat was the very cramped window seat-- servers bumped into me every time they walked by (not exaggerating, every single time). Other than that, the food was fresh & amazing, staff was friendly and accommodating, and the menu offered way more than I thought!"
6/18/2019,20190618,5,4.52,"By far the cutest breakfast + brunch spot I've been to so far! The hostess Jess, was super sweet and made some really good recommendations from the menu. I ended up getting the Flintstone waffle because it was my birthday and TREAT YOURSELF RIGHT? It was delicious. My server Clint was so friendly and was always checking on us and making us laugh. I had a really good time here and I will definitely be coming back."
6/19/2019,20190619,5,4.52,"Love the Thai chicken and waffles! So yummy! And instagrammable! The coffee is delicious! And even though it's usually crowded, we manage to find a table. And parking is ok too, on the adjacent residential street. :-)"
6/21/2019,20190621,5,4.52,We absolutely loved this place! The food was amazing and the staff were sweet and helpful with questions about ingredients for food allergies. Food came out quickly and perfect! If I had any complaint I wish they had a bigger place so we could get seated a bit quicker. Other than that this place was AMAZING and if you are wanting to have a new place or just wanting something different this place is a must to try!
6/22/2019,20190622,5,4.52,"Food: 5Service: 5Ambience: 4Went here recently to have lunch with friends and so glad I chose this place. I ordered the black bean avocado wrap with extra avocado and cheese. I had them remove the hummus. It was a simple wrap, but so delicious. It comes with a balsamic vinegar sauce/dip that paired so well with the wrap. I also ordered their truffle fries for the table and it was very good. It's definitely a small establishment and NOT stroller friendly, so leave those in the car. They do have high-chairs available. Parking is a pain also, but this place is worth it. Definitely will be going back to have their breakfast/brunch items."
6/22/2019,20190622,5,4.52,"Food is simply amazing! I ordered the Chicken and Waffle (Thai Style) and it was a delicious twist on a classic. I'm Thai and love Thai flavors so this combo was perfect for me. The waffle was simple but done well and the chicken was the crispiest chicken I've ever had in a chicken and waffles dish. I will say this was most likely achieved because the chicken was 60% breading and 40% actual chicken. My mom ordered the Waffle and Berries which was again simple but done very well! I would definitely recommend ordering some of the more creative dishes on the menu. The staff was nice but our server seemed very eager to leave, understandably so since we got there half an hour before closing."
6/22/2019,20190622,5,4.52,As an updated review I will definitely say that my experience at met her at a bar is still top not quality I love the matcha green tea waffles they have great quality bacon The eggs are good as well and their drinks are on point The place can get extremely busy especially on a weekend so expect that but the people that work there handle it quite well under the pressure this place is good enough for me to go out of my way to check out every once in awhile they are probably one of my favorite breakfast places
6/22/2019,20190622,5,4.53,"Great little breakfast place. I took my boyfriend here for brunch on a Monday morning. We easily found street parking, and were sat immediately. Our server (Jake I think?) was very friendly and made recommendations. The food was DELICIOUS. I had the breakfast burrito and my bf got the fried chicken and waffles, both wonderful. What I'm assuming to be the manager on duty stopped by to chat with us to make sure we had a good visit, too. We will definitely be back!-The actual restaurant is quite small, and it does get loud and cramped so if that isn't your vibe, maybe visit during off hours. I personally didn't have a problem with it!- The ambiance is adorable. Very earthy and welcoming. - Instead of printing checks they show you your bill on an iPad (saves paper, very cool)"
6/22/2019,20190622,5,4.53,"Found this place when they first started and got to talking with Michael on the story of their bar and his wife is very sweet. The waffles are amazing. I also have had their waffle sandwich with portobello mushrooms and arugula, it was bomb!!!"
6/22/2019,20190622,5,4.53,"This place is the bees knees and the cats pajamas. Vinny and the crew made our brunch morning special with awesome hospitality, incredible food, and an amazing atmosphere! The wait beforehand is extremely worth it. And don't forget to read the story on the back of the menu!"
6/23/2019,20190623,5,4.53,"Crispy french toast! You must get this here. I've had ""Met Het At A Bar"" bookmarked for the longest time and wanted to go here more after hearing the story of how the owners met at a bar and opened up a restaurant together. This place did not disappoint and I would highly recommend checking this place out for breakfast/brunch! I was greeted by a big smile and welcome from the female owner when I walked in. The interior and decor is very homey and cute. I got the crispy french toast and my friend got the avo toast. Oh man the cripsy french toast was bomb and I will definitely be going back for it! Servers were very friendly and attentive. Street parking was very easy to find!"
6/23/2019,20190623,5,4.53,I'm so excited I finally got to try this place out. Their menu is amazing and the food is even better. I came with a friend after working a night shift and the service was excellent. I def recommend if you're in the area.
6/26/2019,20190626,5,4.53,"I can't wait to come back. Such a cute spot. Great food. Waited 25 min, worth the wait. I order the French toast. Probably one of the best French toast I've had in a long time. I order the waffle truffle fries so flavorful. My sister order the waffles I forgot which ones but she said it was super delicious. Our server was very friendly. There's only street parking. I will definitely come back :)"
6/26/2019,20190626,5,4.53,Amazing food. I loved the couples story of how they met and how that is by the bar is called what it's called. I like how attentive they were with me and my boyfriend and we didn't wait long for the food. It was delicious and beautiful. Will return 10/10
6/27/2019,20190627,5,4.53,"I was out in LA for 4 days and of all 4 breakfast spots I had, this is by far the best one! Chicken and waffles was 5/5 stars! Chicken was well seasoned, juicy, crispy and the waffle fries were crunchy and fluffy. Really delicious. I regret going to other breakfast spots and trying the chick n waffles bc none compares to this one. I also got the wake me up breakfast that comes with eggs, 2 maple sausages. Waffles, bacon and fruits for an addition $3. Very very very delicious. Eggs were buttery and bacon was perfectly cooked. I will definitely be back when I'm down here in LA again!"
6/28/2019,20190628,5,4.53,"Good food, great service. So to start from the top. Me and my boyfriend arrived at the restaurant around 2-2:30. We hot seated withing 5 minutes of standing at the door. There is no host, but you do need to wait for someone to seat you. After that we were greeted by our server and got out drinks right away. After that we waited 10 more minutes to order because we were sorting through the menu. Everything looked good. We then ordered and our food arrived about 10 minutes later. Literally the food came out super fats. Everything was good! Recomend. Also all the food we got was plated so beautiful."
6/30/2019,20190630,5,4.53,"Amazing! We had ordered the Hibiscus Cooler and the Cold Brew for drinks. The cold brew was very smooth and we only added a little bit of creamer and it was perfect.The French toast was on point and so unique with the bits of cornflakes. The extra crunch really added to the dish. I had the fried chicken and waffles. Definitely a must try!! The fried chicken was so crispy but fluffy/light. It wasn't heavy in the batter or crust but had enough to give it a great crunch. The meat was so tender and moist especially considering it was white meat, probably one of the best fried chicken I have had. And, I have an expansive palette of fried chickens from southern fried chicken in Memphis to KFC (Korean fried chickens.) In addition, the dish was sprinkled with some crisp basil on top which really brought out the flavors of the Tom yum . Lastly, the waffle was also delicious with its fluffy and airiness. We found out from the restaurant manager that the chief/co-owner is a food scientist which explains the unique flavors and combination.The place is super hospitable and personable as well. The restaurant manager was very welcoming and friendly, going to each table serving and asking about their meals."
6/30/2019,20190630,3,4.53,"We went for a late brunch. This place always has a line, so we waited a short time. The food was ok: I had the waffle with berries. We sat at a high top shared table. It was so noisy we couldn't hear across the table, But you could hear the person sitting next to you. I'm disappointed that they charge a percent of your check for ""healthcare love"". Seems that's a benefit the business should pay for out of their profit."
6/30/2019,20190630,3,4.53,"After finding my apartment but before moving to LA, I started to research restaurants. I was the most excited to try ""Met Her At A Bar."" It's a small place and there was a wait, which is okay. The food was good and the staff attentive. But, there are shared tables and it's so loud that I could barely hear my friend; however, I could clearly hear the neighbors that I was sharing a table with. Some people might love this as it's a chance to meet new people, but I've never loved this experience. Despite all the great aspects, I was disappointed; but, that might be because I was so excited to try this restaurant and had such high expectations."
6/30/2019,20190630,5,4.53,One of the best places in the neighborhood. The owners are lovely and the service makes you feel appreciated. Of course try the French toast & chicken and waffles but my favorite is the avocado toast!
7/1/2019,20190701,5,4.53,The cutest and quaintest spot. Its located right near my office and I love walking over here for a mid-day pick me up. They have delicious avocado toast and a wild spicy fried chicken sandwich. Their coffee is seriously yummy. Not to mention the story of the owners and how they came to open this spot is just about as precious as it gets. Hint: the story is on the menu :)
7/2/2019,20190702,4,4.53,"One of the most perfect fried chicken sandwiches I've had. No exaggeration there. My only ""complaint"" is that I couldn't really taste the green curry aoli. But the chicken itself was juicy, tender, and fried to golden perfection!I also ordered the truffle waffle fries, which were.. different. They weren't awful, but they were seasoned waffle fries, as opposed to traditional (unseasoned) waffle fries. I wasn't expecting that and I think the seasoning on the fries battles the flavor of the truffle oil and parmesan. However, the perfect chicken sandwich and delicious flat white latte really made up for the fries. The service was great as well - I was greeted as soon as I walked in and was offered water right away. The vibe/ambience here is great, too. I sat by the window and had a great view for people watching :)"
7/5/2019,20190705,5,4.53,"Pro tip: It's not a bar!Even though most of my friends are pancake people, I made them all come eat waffles for my birthday and they all loved it! You can't make reservations, but I came with a party of 8 at 10am on a Sunday, and didn't really have to wait to be seated. It is a pretty small place, but they combined a few tables in the back. All the staff was super nice and the service was pretty quick. The food is so good! I got the Wake Up Happy Waffle (comes with eggs, meat, and a waffle) and added berries because it was my birthday and why not? Other friends got the Nutella waffle, Oreo waffle, Fruity Pebbles Waffle, and breakfast burrito and everyone enjoyed their meal. It seemed like a cozy place locals like to come for brunch, and there was a line outside when we left toward 11:30am. I'm excited to come back and try other things on the menu!"
7/6/2019,20190706,5,4.53,"Honestly, the service, the environment, the people, the food is all GREAT! The owners here are the nicest people that have the best quality service to have customers return back from another state. Absolutely recommend this place 10/10"
7/7/2019,20190707,4,4.53,Shout out to the owner. Who completely saved the day. My friend was having a meltdown over his order being wrong. The waiter brought it out and couldn't understand what was wrong. Took the plate to the owner and nicely the owner mentioned hollandaise sauce can't be warmed up. Our friend ordered the egg Benedict waffle regular and I ordered mine with the egg Benedict plate and hollandaise sauce on the side. When the plates came out his got no sauce and mine did. My friend was pissed. The waiter brought sauce on the side but with any eggs Benedict when the sauce is served on top the hot eggs warm the sauce up. He knew this and knew if he poured his sauce on the eggs it wouldn't be the same. Sadly our waiter got confused making my friend more upset. Once the owner came out genuinely sorry about the mishap by then my friend was beyond fed up and refused to let themremake his dish. I honestly thought he was just hangry. But beside the point the owner later came by and said the dish was taken off the bill because he wanted all his customers to be happy. So nice of him. We didn't ask or push to get a free meal but for an owner to go out of his way to handle the situation we will definitely be back solely because of his kindness. Thank you for what you did. You made my friend very happy and he was much more forgiving once his belly was full. We'll see you next time.
7/8/2019,20190708,5,4.53,"This was my first meal in LA and what a great way to start it off. Got here early morning and maybe waited about 10-15 minutes to be seated. I ordered a coffee and the You Make Me Wake Up Happy which came with a waffle, sausage, bacon, and eggs. It was delicious!! The eggs were soft and creamy, waffle was warm and fresh, and the both the sausage and bacon tasted great!I also tried other items such as the chicken and waffles and the chorizo toast which was also good. Overall, the food was great and I definitely recommend trying it."
7/8/2019,20190708,5,4.53,By far the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. Very juicy and tender. And the breading is Phenomenal! The place has a very unique and homey vibe to it. Plus the name is its own. 20/20! The chicken panini is delicious also. I ate both entrees in one sitting. With zero regrets!
7/9/2019,20190709,5,4.53,"I was looking for a good brunch spot. I live on the west side and there are several great places. I was meeting a dear friend and when I told her about them we realized she was pretty far from where I was. I looked up a spot in the middle and this came up. The food looked great so we decided to try it. When I arrived I had to find neighborhood parking since there is no parking lot, but it didn't take long to find a space. When I arrived the wait was about 20 minutes there were chairs out front to sit and wait. I asked for a menu and skimmed through it before we were seated. As I sat there I saw lots of different dishes being brought to customers. Every single one of them looked delicious! One we sat down we were seated at a shared high table towards the front. We were greeted right away and we all ordered the same thing. It was a waffle with eggs sausage and bacon. It was delicious we enjoyed ever bit. Ambiance, customer service, and the food makes this place a gem."
7/10/2019,20190710,4,4.53,"Came here for brunch after spin! We were a small party of 3 but the wait looked pretty long and they said about half hour for a Saturday morning so we took a walk. After exactly about half an hour we came back and were seated. Got the mushroom waffle as did my friend, husband got the chorizo toast. Service was awesome; quick, attentive and especially quick. After 10 minutes after ordering our food was up which really surprised me. The chorizo toast was very small, kind of pricey for what it is when you consider how much you've paid, my husband was definitely hungry afterwards. The waffles were very good, because food was served up so quickly it was still crispy and warm. However the filling inside contained very little mushroom, it seemed like maybe a quarter of one Portobello mushroom. Flavor was decent. It's a lively brunch place but too busy to hang around leisurely, more like the eat and get out type. There's no dedicated parking, but we parked down the street for free and there was quite a bit of it."
7/11/2019,20190711,5,4.53,"My friend has been wanting to come here for months and we were finally off while they're open, we were greeted by very friendly staff, we sat outside and enjoyed our meal, the staff checked on us consistently which is great I feel like that doesn't happen anywhere any more. At the end they brought us a complimentary waffle which was delicious. We will definitely be back."
7/11/2019,20190711,5,4.53,"Well what can I say I just love this place so much. I do admit it can be a bit pricey, but the food is always delicious. I frequent their avocado toast and waffle eggs Benedict. Their coffee drinks are also good. Met her at a bar is owned by a husband and wife duo who truly care about their business. I always see them around and the customer service has always been superb. Can't wait to come back!"
7/11/2019,20190711,5,4.53,Today was my first time here and it was delicious! I had the chicken and waffles and I will def be back for more. I kept looking at everybody's food because it all looked amazing. Parking can be a bit of a hassle but its worth it. Very cute layout as well. Staff was very attentive and nice.
7/12/2019,20190712,5,4.54,"Went here because my friends and I wanted to find a new place to have brunch. We're creatures of habit so when we like a place we have a tendency to come back for a really long time! This place is a gem! The ambience is absolutely adorable, and the staff is very friendly and helpfulI am gluten intolerant and they had very delicious substitute gluten free bread that I could use for my sandwich. The check came in a little mug which we absolutely loved, because they came in the kind of mug we've always wanted to have in our homes ourselves.I can say with no doubt that we will be back to this little place.Side note - also very cute that the couples story is in their menu, makes it feel very familiar"
7/13/2019,20190713,5,4.54,"I come to LA to visit my daughter and her husband who conveniently live across the street from ""Met her at a Bar"" They brought me there and told me it was there favorite neighborhood place and that the food was amazing. It is now a family favorite! The food is beyond delicious. The waffles Benedict, waffles and lox, are just a couple of our favorites but we have tried everything and never been disappointed. The owners are warm and welcoming and it is always a pleasure to go there. I never come to LA without a visit to ""Met her at a Bar""Back in LA and of course at ""Met Her at Bar"" for brunch. This place just keeps getting better. Now that the word is out there is a line out front, but don't be put off because it moves so fast! They are now full service so sit down and relax and they will come to you. Service is fast and with a smile. :) The food is still delicious. Today we had the waffle breakfast sandwich. Amazing!!"
7/14/2019,20190714,2,4.53,"Our experience was somewhat aggrivating. There were 2 hosts both female, the female asian host was rude and passive agrressive. Ive worked in a restaurant and I get how busy and hectic it can get. But one thing despite the crazy and hectic enviornment the rule of thumb is to always be polite to the customer even if they are constantly asking about the wait time and if they are next. The other hostess was polite and she had glasses and so whoever she is, the other lady should take notes from her. Our server was nice. For the food the panini kinda tasted bland but the truffle fries and the waffels were exceptional. I feel like this experience would have been better if started on the right foot."
7/14/2019,20190714,5,4.53,The taste was amazing and great customer service. I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito and side of potatoes. One of the best bkfast burritos ive had in a while. The potatoes were so soft on the inside yet crispy on the outside.
7/16/2019,20190716,5,4.53,"Went here for a ""welcome home"" brunch with my girlfriend, after picking her up from LAX. The name caught our attention because our first date, where we also first met, was at a bar. And then there's our shared love of waffles, so we had to check it out. Met Her At A Bar did not disappoint at all! Our server was delightful, as was the food. We often like to share a savory and a sweet dish when it comes to brunch, so we opted for the Eggs Benedict Florentine and The Flintstone Waffle... Yabba dabba delicious!!!!"
7/16/2019,20190716,5,4.53,Waffles! Real good ones you guys! If you like breakfast foods then you need to get HERE. These waffles will have you coming back for thirds and maybe even fourths. I'm a cook in my day job and can definitely say the food tastes ever so fresh and gave me more than a cough reason to recommend this spot to anyone who has an appreciation for the morning food spectrum.
7/16/2019,20190716,5,4.53,"The food was really good, I've gotten waffletella which looked awesome and tasted so good. I've got sausage on the side was good but it was a little bit to small. The wait wasn't to long but depending on the day it may change. In general really good and worth going to."
7/18/2019,20190718,5,4.54,"My family and I had a terrific Father' Day breakfast here. Amazing food, friendly service and I can't wait to come back!"
7/19/2019,20190719,5,4.54,"Belle ambiance, good food, friendly servers, I enjoyed this place.I had a yummy salad , my daughter a sweet waffle.I will definitely go back to try some waffles.I recommend this place."
7/19/2019,20190719,3,4.53,"Service was pretty fast. I enjoyed my sandwich but in terms of portion sizes and food, it was just okay."
7/20/2019,20190720,5,4.53,"Omg where do I begin!? Customer service is top notch! My boyfriend loves breakfast and I love Thai food. This place popped up on Yelp and we knew it was meant to be. Not to mention the fact that my boyfriend and I met at a bar too!! Mindy, the owner, and the rest of the staff are so friendly and welcoming. My boyfriend and I tried the sangria, His Waffles, and the Thai Jerky. All exceeded my expectations. After having a super busy day, it was nice to find this gem and unwind with good food and drink! I couldn't recommend this place enough. We are from the OC area and we will definitely make this a go to place whenever we are in town! I'm already planning to bring my girlfriends here! Thank you guys!"
7/20/2019,20190720,5,4.54,"I was very indecisive on what to pick for dinner tonight with my girlfriend, after a busy day in LA. After browsing thru yelp, I came across this Gem of a Restaurant and picked it, for the sole reason of my girlfriend and I ""meeting at bar"" lol. The food was so delicious, it was ""Love at first bite"" for my gf and I again. I tried the Chicken and Waffles Italian style and Thai Pork Chops with a glass of sangria, they were all amazing. The owner Mindy and the Restaurant staff showed great hospitality. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu. I know I'm going to be a regular here"
7/21/2019,20190721,5,4.54,Awesome brunch and nice little dog-friendly patio out front. The food is excellent and the servers are very nice. I got a portabello sandwich and my husband got a nutella waffle with berries. We both got lattes and they were delicious.
7/21/2019,20190721,5,4.54,"Awesome brunch! I went here with a friend and although there was a wait to be seated, we were served quickly. I got overnight oats and my friend got the French toast-- both were very tasty!"
7/22/2019,20190722,5,4.54,"We love this place. Go early as it gets crowded, but the food is great and the vibe is really awesome."
7/25/2019,20190725,5,4.54,5 stars because I can appreciate them offering vegan options that doesn't just include tofu like literally every other cafe in LA. The Waffle was sooo yummy! Paired great with my iced chai The place is really dainty and cute too. Thank you for a great breakfast!
7/26/2019,20190726,5,4.54,"Quite good! Super casual and fast coffee-shop vibe, but with food that's way better.Not a good place to sit with your laptop and work (they even have signs telling folks NOT to do that Fri-Sun, 9am-2pm), but good food, fast, and lots of coffee drinks to choose from.The gimmick here (and I don't mean that in a derogatory way) is that they can serve just about anything on a Belgian waffle. Want a sandwich? Throw it on a waffle! An eggs Benedict? Poached and served atop an English Waffle!It's funny, but it works. Worth a go."
7/26/2019,20190726,5,4.54,"Met Her At A Bar is one of the cutest and most delicious places to eat at. The staff here are very welcoming and not to mention the owners are very nice! I came in with a party of 6 and we ordered several dishes from the menu. From the menu some of the dishes we ordered included the Flintstones Waffle, Matcha Waffle, and Met Her Breakfast Burrito. I would definitely come back and plan on coming back soon. Looking at this place on Instagram I was curious if it was just another ""picture spot"" , this is definitely not it. The food is insta worthy and EXTREMELY tasty! 10/10!"
7/27/2019,20190727,4,4.54,"I loved my first time here! Went on a Sunday for brunch (around 10 AM) with 2 friends and we had a 25-minute wait. The space is extremely tight so I don't recommend coming here if you're claustrophobic at all. Parking is street parking only or any nearby lots.The prices for the brunch menu are very reasonable. We got the waffle breakfast sandwich (with a side of potatoes), Met Her breakfast burrito, waffle benedict, and the waffletella. Everything tasted delicious, with the exception of the potatoes. For $5, it was plain and was not appealing at all. Our group's favorite was the waffletella. So yummy.The service was quick! We got served our food quickly and I can definitely see how they turn their tables fast. Because of this, I also would not recommend this to be a brunch place to sit down for a long period of time to talk. I'd definitely come back!"
7/27/2019,20190727,5,4.54,Jake was our server and was dope as hell. Love the food here and it came fast. Can't wait to come back
7/27/2019,20190727,5,4.54,"Never felt the need to write a yelp review but this place was absolutely amazing. I've been led astray by 5 star reviews before but Met Her at A Bar deserves it. My fiancé and I ordered entrees and ... had to order seconds. Seriously. American breakfast, mama's omelette, white truffle toast, and the waffles & berries. I am a self-proclaimed waffle connoisseur and this was the best waffle I have ever tried. The eggs are perfectly scrambled and the truffle toast was beyond decadent. Our server was also so friendly and personable. If anywhere ever needed to franchise it's this place."
7/27/2019,20190727,5,4.54,Amazing! Just amazing food. Chicken and Waffle - His style was my fav. Chorizo bread was great. There is a line always so come prepared to wait. Highly recommend this place for brunch / brekkie.
7/27/2019,20190727,5,4.54,"The Crispy French Toast is the best, and the intimidating line out the door is at most a 15m wait. As a new LA resident, this is my new favorite brunch spot."
7/28/2019,20190728,5,4.54,Wow! What a great experience we had. Delish food. Great team. The avocado toast is the best we've had. Be back soon!
7/28/2019,20190728,5,4.55,"Great place! Expect a bit of a wait, but well worth the wait. Coffee was delicious, mimosas were great, and phenomenal service. I enjoyed the waffles with Nutella and bananas, it was amazing. Probably the best breakfast I've had in LA and I come every year!"
7/28/2019,20190728,5,4.55,Wow! What a great experience we had. Delish food. Great team. The avocado toast is the best we've had. Be back soon!
7/28/2019,20190728,5,4.55,"Great food and coffee! Hope to visit again. I ordered the chicken and waffle! Great choice.They are always busy and we a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad! Hope to go back to try other menu items!"
7/29/2019,20190729,4,4.55,"OH my goodness, how is the line ALWAYS out the door for this place?! Definitely well worth the wait though!Met Her At A Bar is one of the cutest and most eclectic brunch spot ever! The menu is short, sweet and to the point. I've enjoyed all of my visits here and the service is undeniably on point. Food always comes out quickly and is really really tasty! The presentation of the food is amazing. Really makes you want to try everything because it looks great! Taking 1 star off just because I feel like it's slightly a bit pricey for the quantity."
7/29/2019,20190729,4,4.55,"Super cute spot, but also super small. Definitely not the place to go with a group or when you want a leisurely brunch, as I definitely got the feeling they were anxious for us to get up as soon as we finished eating. Makes sense they don't take reservations and there's a consistent line out the door, yet the wait is never too crazy.I had at the Bello because I felt compelled to get waffles here, but I felt the combination of mushrooms, eggs and waffles was not the best. I probably should have stuck with something like chicken and waffles, but I was trying to be a ""bit"" healthier. It was beautiful and very instagrammable and certainly not bad, I would just probably opt for something different next time. Still a fan of this spot, the story (the owners are a young couple that ""met at a bar""), the ambiance and vibe."
7/29/2019,20190729,3,4.54,"Everything about this place is just ok except for the usually long wait to be seated. Cute origin story, nice people, decent enough food but there are plenty of great breakfast joints in the area which have about the same wait times and weighty prices. TL;DR It's worth a try and its cute"

Some constructive criticism, the avocado toast go easy on the parmesan so when its presented one can see some of the avocado. Your waffles are amazing and hope your business expands with such great food -eddyedlavoz"

The presentation, the taste, the visual, and the smell were on point! Customer service was very attentive. The boss lady actually brought the Waffles to our table. We told all our friends about this joint. Will definitely revisit. Highly recommended!"

7/31/2019,20190731,4,4.54,Came here with my sis for brunch. Found parking easily on a weekday Ofcourse. Small resto but very cute inside. Loved the food here. Very tasty and well presented. Good service. Clean bathrooms. Busy for a weekday morning. Ordered the chorizo toast and waffle. Sister ordered waffle with eggs sausage and bacon with berries. Great portions and great flavors. Will be back soo. Trust!!
7/31/2019,20190731,5,4.54,"I'm having a super refreshing glass of Sauvignon Blanc at Met Her At A Bar on the patio. This place is super awesome. This great establishment is welcoming. It has a artsy yet rustic feel. It makes Los Angeles feel miles away, yet you're in the heart of it all. The food is amazing too!"
8/1/2019,20190801,5,4.54,"I had been hearing buzz about Met Her at a Bar for months upon months on foods lists and word of mouth. I even had suggested it to friends prior to my actual visit looking for brunch places to nosh at! My friend Jasminda offered to take me out for a belated birthday brunch and how could I not suggest MHAAB?! I knew we'd have to come early on a weekend, so we did around 9:30 and got seated almost immediately (parking was more difficult in the residential area - beware)! Other times I drive by close to lunchtime, the lines are out the door! There are so many kinds of waffles, breakfast and salad delights, it was hard to choose! We got our hot lattes from the very sweet and charming Zack as she ordered the breakfast sandwich. I opted to go a bit healthy and got a power quinoa bowl with an egg on top that was super tasty! The side of potatoes weren't bad, either. It's a small, dense eatery. Everyone is crammed in which is fine by me, but if anyone reading this is claustrophobic, skip it. I LOVE the decor and the lighting and kept oohing and ahhhing with aesthetic delight the whole time. If anything, come for that! All in all we enjoyed our visit and customer service from Zack. I mention Met Her at a Bar to anyone who wants to have brunch with me! Bravo!"
8/1/2019,20190801,5,4.55,"Loved this recommendation by my cousin! Wow! Waffles with fried chicken, & everything we ordered was excellent including the best coffee I have had in awhile! Service was wonderful as well. Great outdoor seating for my daughters birthday celebration!"
8/2/2019,20190802,5,4.55,"It's a pretty small restaurant so parking is a bit hard.But beside that the chicken waffles are to die for!!! It's a boneless deep fried chicken thigh I'm assuming. It's not chicken breast for sure because it didn't taste dry. It was moist. The waffles was so fluffy!! I love how they give you butter, maple syrup, and some sweet hot sauce. I devoured everything! Will definitely come back if I'm in la again!! And also the story how they came up with the shop is just so freaken cute!!"
8/2/2019,20190802,5,4.55,Second time here! An absolutely lovely little place. Dinner is as good as brunch. We ordered four different waffles. Each single one is soooo good! Service is also perfect. Driving 1 hour to having dinner/brunch is totally worth it.Parking could be difficult during weekday's dinner time.
8/3/2019,20190803,4,4.55,"So glad I tried this place out as it does not disappoint! Service: We were seated promptly during brunch hours. Come before noon to avoid waiting.Food:- Crunchy French Toast: Sweet and delicious! Love the plating of the dish and the berries/cereal toppings added an extra crunch/sweetness to pair with the toast.- Eggs Florentine: A great vegan option! Pair this with the breakfast potatoes and everything will be great. The breakfast potatoes are super crispy and soft, and they are bite-sized!- Waffle Benedict: Waffle instead of English Muffin! This was very delicious with the breakfast potatoes.Drinks: - Iced Mocha: A bit pricey for the size of the drink. Nothing special here, but it's worth the try if you're craving something chocolate-y!The eggs benedict dishes are good to share with a friend since they have two on each dish. Parking: Street parking. You can find parking a block down in the residential areas as well."
8/3/2019,20190803,5,4.55,The food was absolutely delightful! Just enough flavor and everting super fresh!! And the servers were absolutely wonderful and friendly!! Great service and amazing food! *inserts heart emoji* :)
8/4/2019,20190804,5,4.55,Joseph thank you very much for serving our table! 5 stars for the awesome service Joseph gave us. 5 stars for the quick food and 5 stars for the great food! The husband and I will be coming back another day. The wait was long but it's expected for a Sunday. Overall great place.
8/4/2019,20190804,5,4.55,This cute little brunch spot is a must! The food was fantastic and service was great. It was a little bit of a wait to get a seat but totally worth it!
8/5/2019,20190805,4,4.55,"Food: Ordered chicken and waffles (Thai style) and it was very good! The chicken was crispy and it had a kick! The butter was sweet and almost tasted like honey, and the butter and syrup combination balanced the spice from the chicken very well. Highly recommend this dish! My friend ordered the eggs Benedict with potatoes. Nothing special, just your typical Benedict. Our only complaint was there were barely enough hollandaise sauce to top the egg and the bread, so it tasted kind of dry.Didn't try any drinks, but they do offer mimosas, champagne, and your typical brunch cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages. Service: Food came pretty fast and the servers are quick to attend to your needs. We were seated the moment we arrived as well, which is always a plus in my book. Parking: came on a Monday afternoon and lots of parking were available around the neighborhood."
8/5/2019,20190805,2,4.54,2 Stars for service4 Stars for food YUM! Melody and a younger female server plopped food down in front of us. They left the table without skipping a beat to make sure there wasn't anything else we needed. Then hard to get their attention afterwards.
8/5/2019,20190805,4,4.54,"The lines are no joke at this place, so I was expecting to be wowed. Our wait time for a table of 2 was 30 minutes. The waits are so long because of how tiny the restaurant is, not necessarily because of anything else. My friend got the Waffletella and I got the Waffle Sandwich + Avocado. The food was good, nothing mind-blowing. I won't make an effort to come back, but if I'm in the neighborhood, I'd eat here again. I will say, the food came pretty quick despite the wait time!"
8/6/2019,20190806,4,4.54,"First time here and def not the last time Came here with fiancé and friends We all got very mixed things and they wereAll hitters. I got the ""waffle Benedict"" it did not disappoint at allAlong w bacon and country potatoes (GET THE TRUFFLE OIL) Holy crap it goes really good.My girl got the matcha waffle which was absolutely fireAnd friends got burrito and Nutella waffle both were really good.My only con about the place is unfortunately The out side patio smelled holy shit Disgusting. I'm sure it's not their fault But some bum/ bums who decide to pee on the street.So SIT INSIDE"
8/6/2019,20190806,5,4.54,"Absolutely stunning, exquisite on all levels, the food I was raving about long after we left. The chicken and waffles were delicious, the service was amazing, the energy was stunning. We left with smiles and will definitely be back. Clean, tasty, original, vibrant, will be back time and time again! Bravo!"
8/7/2019,20190807,4,4.54,I really like this place and come here often . The food is great ! And staff really nice and helpful . The only thing I will say that can make this environment better is to do something about the fly's getting into the business . A simple fan / blower above the door will go a long way . I recommend any dish here .
8/7/2019,20190807,5,4.54,"Cutest place ever! The service is amazing, everybody is so nice. The couple that owns it has a very sweet story about how they met and they are very involved and interactive with their customers. Loved it"
8/8/2019,20190808,4,4.54,"I came here with friends after seeing it on Instagram. Their location setup and decor is so pretty. I liked they had creative dishes on their menu. I tried their Matcha waffle side of bacon and house potatoes with truffle oil. Loved it but quite honestly the waffle serving was small. Also, my friends and I wanted to sit outside on their patio because it was nice sunny day but smelled like urine perhaps because of near bus stop. Not the business' direct fault but definitely a downfall. We decided to move back inside due to strong smell."
8/8/2019,20190808,5,4.54,"Was looking for an all day breakfast, but not the greasy normal diner stuff. This hit the perfect spot; clean food, super food, a little naughty, and great lattes! We had the kale and quinoa omelette and the waffle sandwich and shared a berry waffle, along with amazing breakfast potatoes! The staff was professional and helpful. Ended up buying 2 cute with logo yoga tanks! Glad I ""met her at a bar"" too! - just 2 LA locals"
8/9/2019,20190809,5,4.54,"11/10 restaurant right here!!! First off, the love story behind the whole idea of this restaurant is so cute. I came in with a party of 6 and even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated quickly and we kept getting asked if we wanted water while we waited which was sweet. When we got inside we encountered the nicest servers and staff members ever that always kept a smile on their faces. I got hot matcha tea to drink and it was delicious (duh because it's matcha) and it got to a drinkable temperature quickly and stayed there which is really appreciated. I conquered the Flintsone Waffle and I've been wanting another since I left! The waffle was so fluffy and the ice cream didn't even make it soggy which was awesome. Everybody in my party was very pleased with everything and posting these pictures is making my mouth water all over again. This restaurant is doing everything right from the service to the food and even to the decor. I LOVE this place and I highly recommend it to any and everybody!"
8/11/2019,20190811,5,4.54,"Went on a Sunday morning around 9:15am and we got there before the traffic! The food was great, enjoyed the matcha tea, and the service was on point. Our server was on top of things and the entire team checked up on us throughout our breakfast and we were even able to meet the owner after reading their love story."
8/11/2019,20190811,5,4.54,"Food was delicious and the atmosphere was super cute. My husband had the chicken and waffle and I had the French toast- both were amazing. The chicken was not your typical chicken and waffle- it was spicy which made it 10 times better. Would definitely come back when in the area. Also, I think we waited about half an hour on a Saturday morning for 2 which is completely understandable as it's a smaller restaurant."
8/11/2019,20190811,5,4.54,"I had my birthday brunch here. If you love brunch, you must go. Two of my friends have gone here after I posted the pics on my other social media accounts. I have to say that I will be back again. The owner was kind enough to take our photo and come to our table. Everything was amazing all around. I had the salmon lox over the waffles. We loved everything. We were stuffed! I want to come back for the eggs Benedict which I was able to get a bite of. Now I want one all to myself. Thank you for making my birthday morning amazing!!!"
8/11/2019,20190811,5,4.55,Met Her At The Bar is the perfect breakfast spot. The Avocado toast with a side of scrambled eggs and Halo tea is my favorite go to. Honestly everything looks delicious on the menu. The place is ALWAYS busy and the service is always great. Warm friendly smiles and very clean. You never wait long to be seated or to be waited on. One of my favorite places in LA.
8/13/2019,20190813,5,4.55,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND! This is the best accidental find ever. We stumbled upon this place for dinner and had some AMAZING chicken and waffles. The waiter told us they're actually known for their breakfast, so we came back the next morning. Once again, we were all absolutely thrilled with literally everything we ordered."
8/14/2019,20190814,4,4.55,Very Good electric...very hip vibe type atmosphere. Has a combo of art plus music. Employees are very friendly. Food is excellent. Highly recommended.
8/14/2019,20190814,5,4.55,"SUPER cute spot! Delicious food and drinks, slightly small but great atmosphere, plus street parking is easy to find about a block or so away. Would absolutely recommend this spot for a hangout, date, or business coffee. I had the Wafflebello Breakfast sandwich and 10/10 would recommend it again, SO delicious!"
8/15/2019,20190815,5,4.55,"Presentation is impeccable. We happened to be in the neighborhood for their first dinner night. I went for waffles from their breakfast menu. The waffles were capitol D decadent, looked bigger than my head, but fell off the fork with tenderness. I surprised myself by finishing the whole plate!My husband ordered the chicken skewers and really enjoyed them as well. It was a surprisingly good night out. Their strawberry lemonade is a shining star in the constellation of their new dinner menu."
8/15/2019,20190815,4,4.55,Kinda pricey but food is phenom !! Brunch was busy AF and the mimosas were literally fresh squeezed orange juice
8/15/2019,20190815,5,4.55,So for the first time of me coming here it was actually good I got the chorizo toast and their chicken pesto panini and they were both awesome the place is really nice and well decorated
8/15/2019,20190815,5,4.55,Honestly my favorite breakfast place to Postmates from on the weekends when I'm splurging. I tend to vary between ordering the Now This Is Love Waffletella or the Grain Bowl ! Both are fantastic. Highly recommend this place !!
8/15/2019,20190815,5,4.55,"I've only ever heard amazing things about this place. I mean, look at the name haha! So good, I bring my friends that are visiting to this place all the time. If you want amazing breakfast food, this is your place"
8/16/2019,20190816,5,4.55,Such a kind staff! I ordered the grain bowl with a fried egg and the chorizo toast with a side of potatoes.They accidentally gave someone else my meal and gave me a free liege for the wait! Food is super yummy and the backstory is so cute. Can't wait to come back for good food and good service!
8/16/2019,20190816,5,4.55,"The vibes, customer service and food was amazing! I ended up getting the fried chicken and waffles Thai style. I enjoyed the taste of it all. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. Literally no complaints! Definitely will be recommending friends and family to go there ! & I'll be back as well. Really enjoyed my experience and exposure to the food there."
8/17/2019,20190817,5,4.55,"I love coffee and I love breakfast; they have a good selection of both and more. The service was good, it's just a little tight inside, but that was ok, because the people next to us were friendly. Have been back, will return."
8/17/2019,20190817,5,4.55,"I just love this place. The people were very nice to me. And our waiter, Joe, was the best. He took care of our needs and offered to help me into the car. Now the food was some of the best I have had in a long time. I will be going back. Thanks for the great care and food we experienced today. Edward Brown."
8/18/2019,20190818,4,4.55,"Went to this little breakfast spot with about a party of 8 without any high expectations. I thought this was your typical mom and pop breakfast diner but i was surprised when I looked at their menu. A lot of unique food combinations that you wouldn't see at your typical breakfast diner, which got me intrigued. We got there at about 11 am and understandably we were told to wait about 20 minutes because we had such a large party and the restaurant was pretty small. Once we got seated, it was pretty crowded and I was sitting about 3 feet away from another table next to us. The employees are very friendly, they will explain what their most popular menu item is and check up on you. I ordered their avocado toast which is about 13 dollars along with a iced matcha latte. When my avocado toast came, I was a little disappointed with the portion size because I ate it in like 6 bites. It was still very delicious and the avocado tasted very fresh. I was expecting a little bit more since I spent 13 dollars on toast. My iced matcha latte didn't have that much of a strong flavor of matcha but that could be my fault because it is usually ordered as a hot drink but I asked it to be iced since the weather was so hot. My friends ordered some waffle dishes such as the matcha waffle and the waffletella which were delicious as well. After our meal, we asked if the waiter if we could pay separately between 8 people and they had no problem doing that. The waiters are very experienced and move efficiently. Pros: Very lively atmosphereFriendly staffDelicious food with excellent presentationCons: Small spaceCrowdedSmall portions compared to price paid"
8/18/2019,20190818,5,4.55,"Cute place for brunch in LA! Their food is delicious and they have mimosas. Parking is a hassle, but that's expected for LA."
8/18/2019,20190818,5,4.55,For sure the best French toast and waffles we've EVER had. Anna was so nice and wished my friend a happy birthday!! She had a great smile and was super friendly. Great service and food!!!!!!Meg and Olivia from Ohio
8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.55,"What a great place! Very quaint. It actually has a lot of deating considering how small the place is. It's very very packed, though. It's a little uncomfortable. But the food is FANTASTIC. My husband has the Thai Style Chicken and Waffles and I had french toast with berries. The Thai Style Chicken and Waffles were the best chicken and waffles we have ever tasted. We would get that against The coffee was just okay but even with that, we'll be back!"
8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.55,First timer and it was great love the place set up. Excellent customer service everyone is really friendly and attentive. Food was really good well portion at a very good price. Will definitely be going back totally recommend
8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.55,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in LA. I always recommend friends to come here. They're very busy so know that you'll be surrounded by people but it's a very loving and welcoming environment. The staff is wonderful and more often than not, you'll run into the owner. I came on a day they were out of a selection I really wanted and our waiter was super apologetic and the owner himself came out to apologize and suggest other menu items. They were just selling out of food because they're THAT good. I changed my order and had an incredible meal that I didn't regret at all. If you're on the Miracle Mile, visit this spot. Hands down a great restaurant, you'll love everything about it."
8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.56,Great spot. Food was so good. The fruit waffle was so light and the bacon wonderful. We all loved it and will be back. Parking was a bit of a deal but not impossible.
8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.56,"This is the cutest little spot near LACMA. There's always a wait bc the restaurant is small but it's worth it if you want an aesthetically pleasing vibe, great coffee/tea, and a smaller bite to eat. The waffles are yummy and coffee is creamy and flavorful."
8/22/2019,20190822,2,4.55,"Nice environment served by nice people but honestly, kind of crappy food.I had an eggs benedict and the eggs were way undercooked. I mean close to raw. See photos. BS presentation with little pieces of plain, dry ham.I ordered a side of sausage and it seemed like the little links from Trader Joe's.Really unhappy that I made the trek to this vaunted breakfast star and wasted my time getting blah food. I suggest skipping.Place is one of these that thinks it's entitled to charge a 3% surcharge for health insurance benefits that the company should pay for directly, too."
8/22/2019,20190822,5,4.55,"I came here for a brunch meet up with my friend and we were amazed at how delicious the food was. The line could get pretty long so plan accordingly if you come on the weekend. I ordered the waffle fried chicken with thai spices that were unique and delicious. We also ordered matcha waffle that was super bomb and you could taste the matcha flavor bursting in your mouth every single bite. Although the place could get pretty hectic and the table is rather small,but it's a cute place overall. There's no parking lot for this restaurant so you would have to park on the street. If you're lucky, you could find parking at the residential area in the back of the restaurant."
8/22/2019,20190822,5,4.55,I ordered the fruity pebble waffle and the Benedict waffle. Both were so delicious! I have a gluten intolerance (ordered gluten free) and ate both without any issues. The staff was so friendly and it had a really nice cozy environment. Definitely worth the trip!
8/23/2019,20190823,5,4.55,The service was excellent!!!! The food was tasty. Especially the strawberry puree!!!! The prices are competitive. This joint had a lot of traffic...all types of people coming and going. The restaurant stayed full. The staff was great. The only issue was the absence of HEAVY CREAM FOR MY COFFEE!!!! It would be a game changer for their coffee if they had it JUST SAYING....LOL im going back
8/23/2019,20190823,5,4.56,Great surprise. Brunch and Service A+. Brian was fantastic. Very enjoyable eating experience. Food was great. A must if visiting LA. Cheers!
8/25/2019,20190825,5,4.56,"Great brunch spot. The foods amazing, the service is great and I haven't had anything that I wouldn't order again. Only downside is that it's pretty small and very popular. Prepare to wait a while if you're showing up during popular times."
8/25/2019,20190825,4,4.55,"The food here is delicious! Everything is tasty and well thought out and there is a broad selection of food. They offer breakfast all day and the portion sizes are reasonable. The fried chicken options are amazing and mixed with one of their creative waffles you can't go wrong. The coffee was also very good here. This place is full and hoping at all times it seems. They usually have a wait between 11-2 or 3pm so expect to hang out before you get seated. People are crammed in here and it can be noisy so if you're looking for a quiet and relaxing cafe, this probably isn't the place for you. This is basically a bee hive of activity which can be attractive for some and distracting for others. Due to the high volume of people it can feel a little dirty and grungy as the cleaning staff are zipping along after patrons leave to get the next people in. Staff are friendly and very attentive at all times so you never have to wait long including receiving your food. This is mostly indoor dining with a small outdoor area which fits just a few tables. This is absolutely worth a visit."
8/28/2019,20190828,5,4.56,"The place is small and crowded even on a weekday. But, the food was delicious! Love the chicken waffle and their Mama's omelette was good too. Actually everything we ordered was yum."
8/28/2019,20190828,5,4.56,This is probably one of my favorite restaurant for breakfast! We tried the chicken & waffles & the french toast w some sides which blew us away. the food really had my girlfriend & i speechless. also we had their Chai ice latte BEST THING EVER. Honestly really enjoy the food plus the service was really great. 10/10
8/29/2019,20190829,5,4.56,"Our Fifth visit here & each time we have been pleased! Always greeted with a smile & a warm welcome!  We have come for Breakfast, lunch & now ( newly added) dinner.We have been very fortunate with the street metered parking.  The history behind the name is Cute! The restaurant is Charming! Our menu favs is the Thai chicken n waffle, thai Omelet, Breakfast burrito, cauliflower, & GOOD COFFEE!LOVE THIS GEM!!"
8/29/2019,20190829,2,4.55,"I went to this restaurant due to high average and good reviews. In the beginning, everything went well. Coffee was good. Food got a little bit of delay. I could wait so it was okay since it was Saturday morning. Flies came in and out the restaurant and eventually on top of food. It was okay and bearable up to a certain point. After many people came in for the brunch (Of course it was Saturday morning). After that I had bad experienced being indirectly forced to rush out of the restaurant. Although my party was trying to find out the next destination, the pressure and gesture of the server was not kind. Good food, but later the service ruined this review.PS I hope this review stayed on. My previous was removed. It's not quite right to keep only good reviews."
8/29/2019,20190829,5,4.55,"The Thai chicken and waffles is one of the best brunch dishes I've ever had. Spicy, salty, sweet, hot, kinda sour with the chili sauce. Run there."
8/30/2019,20190830,5,4.55,"Was sat immediately upon arrival. I was solo. They have communal seating (sitting at a table with random strangers lol) as well as tables for parties of two. I was initally asked if i wanted to sit at one of the communal tables but after I sat down, I wasn't feelin' it. Lol So, without hesitation, I was able to be placed at a table that would normally accommodate two. All of the waiters and bussers are attentive. I ordered within a minute of sitting down.I got a half order of the Waffletella so that I could get a side of eggs for the same cost as the full order of just the waffle. It was filling and just enough. Their eggs are bomb, btw. Very tasty. I wanted to ask how they make them, but didnt. They were a bit pricey for one waffle, but, the service and the food is good."
9/1/2019,20190901,4,4.55,Came here on a Saturday afternoon took a while to get a table but worth the wait! Avocado toast was good and we also had a waffle not sure the name the one that comes with eggs. Would return!
9/2/2019,20190902,4,4.55,"Great Brunch Spot - Food was beautifully presented and tasty. And although seating was a bit tight, they make great use of the space and is quite cozy but efficiently thought out. First time here and we got the Avocado Toast which was the prettiest and tastiest I've ever seen. And got the Wake Up Happy I believe which included all that you need - eggs, bacon, sausage and a waffle we made berry style. Price was average for LA prices.Looking forward to coming back to try the Thai Chicken and waffles. And love that a Thai couple owns this restaurant and has added their own cultural twist to the standard brunch items. Fusion food is the best, and they did a great job with this concept."
9/2/2019,20190902,4,4.55,Really good food and coffee! Very small place and warm. I got the strawberry ricotta toast with a iced vanilla almond milk late. Very delicious!
9/2/2019,20190902,3,4.55,"I was fortunate to be seated within 5 mins of putting my name on the list. We were seated at the empty bar. About 5 minutes later two other couples were seated, putting us in the middle of the two new groups. The other two couples managed to have their orders taken and drinks served before we ordered. And we all had the same waiter. The couple to our left managed to get their meal before we got our drink order. When we received our drinks (iced coffee and water), the couple to our left was eating their meal. When we inquired about our food, the food came out within5 mins. It seemed like that forgot about us. The food was great, when they got the order right. We ordered the Thai chicken and-waffles and chicken pesto panini! Even though the panini was missing the pesto sauce. I would go back just to see if the service improved, because the food was good."
9/2/2019,20190902,5,4.55,"Great food, wonderful service. Very quaint but super cute place. Definitely coming back & ordering the chorizo toast again. It was sooooo delicious as a takeout item that I can only imagine what it would be like to have it fresh."
9/5/2019,20190905,5,4.55,"Food was lovely, such a cute presentation in the French toast. My mom was very please with her waffle and we really enjoyed the lattes they are soo yummy. We will be coming back to try more items in the menu. Service was also great and love the convenient method of paying with card it makes it easier and safer especially since it's done at your watch. Speedy close up of checks is a plus."
9/5/2019,20190905,4,4.55,"The food here was really really good. I got the fried chicken and waffles which had a spicy Asian twist to them and I always appreciate a unique take on a classic dish. The place was pretty crowded and the wait times were long, however it was brunch on the weekend and this is a common occurrence at any brunch spot. I found the food and coffee to be very appetizing but not quite wow that's 5 stars. It was pretty darn close so by no means is this a negative review. The outside seating is what we went with due to it being a hot day and long wait times. Don't bring a bring group if you're sitting outside. There's not much seating and it can feel a little crowded if there are a few groups trying to order. Overall a fun and good eating experience. I will probably come back if I'm in the area looking for a savory brunch and a latte."
9/5/2019,20190905,5,4.55,"I was looking for an amazing place to take my boyfriend for breakfast on his birthday. Yesterday we came across Met Her at a bar, and I loved the name of it. When I told him the name he really asked me if that was the name. We were both amazed and excited of the vibe and surroundings as we entered. We were immediately greeted by all the workers with a smile , let me get started on the customer service. Our Server Brian was an amazing happy soul and made our experience the best !, he asked if it was our first here and I was and was very enthusiastic about it all and so were we ! So now for the food part, I got the crispy French toast plate ( aesthetic as hell people) and a side of eggs and bacon and sausage with a matcha green tea latte ! ( 1000% recommended) and my boyfriend got the met her at a bar burrito de Chorizo with an americano. The Food and service was so good and it was the best moment for his special day ."
9/5/2019,20190905,5,4.55,"Just left this restaurant for breakfast and we had such an amazing experience! Second time here, but I have to start off by saying our server Clint was nothing short of wonderful - He was very attentive, kind, knowledgeable, and helpful. If I could give him more than five stars, I would. The food also exceeds five stars. I got the breakfast burrito and was surprised at how delicious it was for us not being at a Mexican restaurant. We also had the waffle with berries and Nutella... YUM! This place is consistent and if you're ever in the neighborhood, please give it a try and I promise you won't be disappointed! The ambiance is also my jam... Makes me want to come here and just drink their delicious coffee and work on my laptop all day! Much thanks to the wonderful staff and we will be back next week!"
9/5/2019,20190905,1,4.54,My chicken sandwich was all the way uncooked and raw and I got sick after eating this. They rushed my food out and did not cook the meat. Only the outside was crispy this tasted so disgusting I couldn't believe I was served uncooked chicken. They gave me a free box of waffle fries but that just wasn't enough this place is grosss.
9/6/2019,20190906,5,4.55,"I love everything about this place! The owners Mindy and Vinny are so sweet. the rest of the staff are truly incredible. 'A Team' for sure! I've dined in, ordered to-gos and had them cater my party. It's too bad that I don't live close enough, otherwise I'd be at Met Her At A Bar every single day!Vegans: they have vegan salted caramel waffles with homemade sauce and the grain bowl (hold the salmon).Thank you Mindy n Vinny!!!"
9/6/2019,20190906,3,4.54,"Service needs to be improved, it's a fast paced high turn over type brunch spot which is a little cramped. Also, not the best location, but i will say it's the best chicken waffles I've ever had in my life. The Thai chicken waffles so the best and they have great coffees. I've been twice and service felt rushed the first time and didn't check on you through meal, not the best. Second time, the waitress did not put in both of our orders and only one of us got our order and never even thought it was odd one of us had food and not the others. It was like eating alone since our food came out separately and we both waited feeling dumb to eat alone. Coffee was good, but staff needs to be match the quality of food, it lowers the experience over all."
9/6/2019,20190906,5,4.54,"The food Is beyond delicious. We had Avocado toast, the Flintstones waffle and an omelette. Everything was so tasty. Zach was our waiter and he was really nice and attentive."
9/7/2019,20190907,5,4.54,"""Yes"" a hundred times to Met Her At A Bar! We arrived around 1:45PM on a Saturday afternoon, and as predicted, was met with a packed house. Luckily, a party of 2 was bar-seatable during that time, so we had no issues regarding wait. Hi, Connie. The two items ordered were The Bello Bello Wafflebello Sandwich and the Fried Chicken and Waffle (Thai Style). The Wafflebello, which was portobello mushrooms, fried egg, avocado, tomato, mixed greens and cilantro aioli sandwiched between two fluffy waffles, was very good! There are many options for vegetarians and this was definitely a great choice! It was a pretty large order, but I had no trouble finishing it! The Chicken and Waffle (Thai Style) was also extremely delicious, according to the biggest fried chicken fiend I know. It's their twist on chicken and waffles with tom yum seasoning and crispy basil. According to him, he'd come back MANY times for that dish!The service there was spectacular and something I really took notice of. Everyone who worked there joked and laughed with each other, and at the same time stayed extremely professional! One server asked a chef to add more jam to a dish before she brought it out because there didn't seem to be enough on the order. She also kept on complimented the dishes that came out as well. I love that they care so much about what they bring out to the table, and at the same time, keep encouraging their colleagues.Great food, great service and great experience overall. It's definitely a little on the pricey side, but I would definitely come back!"
9/7/2019,20190907,5,4.55,"So many of my friends have come here and kept coming here, so I finally gave it a shot, and let me just say it lives up to the hype. Particularly the waffles? I don't really know what to say other than I'm a picky eater, especially with sweets, and I had nothing to complain about. Not too hard, not mushy either, and not overly sweet or bland either. I'm not in the area often but will definitely try to come back when I am!!"
9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.55,"Service was outstanding. The chicken in any variation of numerous options is a big hit. Parking difficult given location, but available on adjacent streets."
9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.55,"Amazing food! I had the met her at the bar burrito and I made it vegetarian by subbing the meats with kale. The iced matcha green tea with oat milk was also amazing. My friend got the white waffle dish and she gave it 10/10 and also had the matcha.Parking is street/meter. Look for signs but we had no trouble with that one a Sunday morning.Dog friendly: They have an outdoor small space for seating so you can bring your dog and also a dog bowl for your pooch. Service: excellent and I thought I couldn't sub or modify as its indicated on menu but fortunately I was able to. The server was very nice about itZ Maybe remove that from menu since it can steer off some clients (mainly vegetarians/vegans). I needed more napkins as they provide one on the table and a server was quick to notice I needed something so they are all well trained to keep an eye on guests. They do a great job trying to flip tables for new guests so if you want to stay and hang out after your meal this is not the place to go to. I also noticed they would provide waffle samples for guests waiting outside which was a nice gesture. Suggestions: get in a waitlist app of some sort. They don't take RSVPs and only take RSVPs the old fashion way of putting your name down on a written out list. We were quoted 30 mins or less and advised to stay nearby as she said it's more likely it will be shorter since we were a party of 2. The wait was nearly an hour (55 mins) so double the time which was horrible since there was no shade and you wait outside. If there was a waitlist app showcasing time frame we could of gone to lasses or a place nearby to kill time. I'd recommend getting on the waitlist app and they notify customers their place in line and also gives a 5 minute window to come back to the restaurant to get seated or you will lose table so it's a win win for restaurant and guests. Remove the modifications/ subs politely declined from the menu since it's not something they enforce (thankfully). Have a water station outside when it's hot and or add an awning on the side for shade. Highly recommend! I would go back and try the other dishes! Although, i would go earlier in the day because waiting anywhere for almost an hour isn't worth it. Try them out! Always great to see a local small business thriving!"
9/9/2019,20190909,5,4.55,"The cutest and coziest restaurant. For it being a smaller place, it felt spacious and not overly loud- can easily hear and have a conversation with the person you're with. The service is wonderful and the food is amazing. We had the classic eggs Benedict, power chai latte, chicken and waffles and cold brew. Amazingly priced for the quality you're getting. Definitely will be back."
9/10/2019,20190910,5,4.55,"This is the 4th time I've been to this spot. I usually don't like to give a review based on first time visit. Today I happened to come for breakfast here again and while I've always tried a different dish, and all have been really good. Today I was in the mood for waffles, after finally deciding on the ""fried chicken + waffle Thai style, I was glad I did. Definitely a favorite for me. Btw, every time I've been here it has been great! Staff are very organized and friendly. Special thanks to our sever today Sarah (I believe that's her name) for all the help. I definitely recommend this place, weekends are super busy, you can't blame them!! It's amazing! However if you come during the week, it's easier to get seated right away! Thank you guys for making my visits so enjoyable."
9/10/2019,20190910,4,4.55,"Good brunch spot! We got the strawberry ricotta toast and the fried chicken and waffles. The waffles were amazing with the chili sauce that comes on the side! Would definitely order that again. Plenty of seating on the inside and we were seated the second we entered the cafe. Good service! Parking can be tricky given the location, but we went on a Monday afternoon (~2pm) and got a sweet parking spot close to the cafe."
9/10/2019,20190910,5,4.55,"Love this place! The wait was worth it & yes it's a tight space. But the food was gorgeous and DELISH, the story is so cute (the owners have their story printed on the menu) and the environment was chill considering how tight the space is. We got the french toast. I got the truffle parmesan waffle fries and OH WHEW BABY, I'll come back just for those."
9/10/2019,20190910,5,4.55,"Lovin' this unpretentious, neighborhood gem! We literally stumbled into here on a morning walk and could not resist the idea of waffles. Better yet, they did not disappoint. We ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles and a Yogurt Parfait. The fried chicken and waffles had such depth of flavors, great textures and even a fun little kick of spice! The yogurt parfait was made of this fluffy, unbelievable yogurt, was tasty and delightful as well. Be ready for the cozy vibes -- the tables are very close to each other but you will find yourself talking to your friendly neighbors and enjoying the food for an all-around amazing time!"
9/12/2019,20190912,4,4.55,I love the food here but is hectically scattered with their seating arrangement and decor! And a lovely sign screaming at you about not allowing your lap top?!! Uhmmm ok. Don't bring your laptop but defiantly get a kick aZs waffle!!
9/13/2019,20190913,5,4.55,"Quality of food was just amazing. Have great menu for brunch , waffles is must try there. Lemonade was fresh . Lovely ambiance and vibes."
9/13/2019,20190913,5,4.55,"Oh my gosh! I freaking love this place. Had the ""his waffles"" for the first time. It blew my tastebuds away. Not only was the chicken crispy on the outside. But it was so juicy and tender on the inside. Cooked to perfection this meal stole my heart. Each bite melted in my mouth and I never wanted it to end. The Alfredo sauce was MAGIC! How you can still get the slightest bit of parmesan cheese is beyond me! As for the waffles, superb! I can honestly say this is easily my top 2 favorite restaurants in LA. Definitely a MUST!"
9/13/2019,20190913,5,4.55,Very friendly staff and amazing atmosphere. The service is quick and the matcha with oat milk was incredible. I didn't have time to eat here but the menu was outstanding and those around me had food that looked incredible. I look forward to coming back here and trying more things on the menu.
9/13/2019,20190913,5,4.55,"Best chicken & waffles I have ever had! Not only was the chicken nice and crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside, but the seasoning of it was phenomenal! The rest of my party was also satisfied with all of their selections (my husband had the chorizo toast, and while definitely not the cleanest thing to eat, it was delicious!)"
9/13/2019,20190913,5,4.55,This place was delicious! The waffles are legit! The staff is very friendly. We were greeted multiple times and never went without anything. This is a perfect spot for brunch with your peeps!
9/14/2019,20190914,4,4.55,"My brother kept singing about this place for so long that on his next visit I decided to join him and not disappointed at all! I liked how the menu had creative names for their dishes (love a good word pun) and how they also added their little love story of how they met - at a bar!We had the berry french toast (I dont remember the name of the plates but I'm sure if you show them a picture or describe they'll know), oreo waffles, fruity pebbles and ice cream waffles, and strawberry ricotta toast (only one I though it was a little meh compared to other plates but still pretty good) and left there completely full and satisfied!Gotta say because it's a small restaurant they are always packed but even then the wait is not that long (20-30 minutes on a saturday), and they have some meters around for street parking as well.They are dog friendly but their patio is very small with only three tables so you might have to wait a bit longer if you want to brunch with your dog (for which I do!)Also on that matter they make sure your dog is on the floor even though he's tiny, almost hairless, and stays quietly on your lap without bothering anyone :(("
9/14/2019,20190914,3,4.55,"Very nice place, good atmosphere. Food could have been better, I ordered the eggs Benedict was very dissapointed. All reviews where talking about the great food I was expecting better."
9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.55,"Worth the wait! They have lots of vegetarian and gluten free options, and healthy options for all. Their gluten free waffletella was phenomenal. I was able to watch them make it because of my seat at the bar. They cleaned the waffle iron before putting the gluten free batter in there. A+++"
9/15/2019,20190915,5,4.55,"We're visiting from several states over so I did my research looking for the best possible local establishments to eat. Met Her At A Bar more than lives up to it's reputation in Yelp. It was beautiful, service prompt and friendly, and the FOOD WAS AMAZING. We went with our 21-month old and was very happy they had highchairs. No kids menu, but my son was more than happy with a side of scrambled eggs."
9/16/2019,20190916,5,4.55,Randomly found this little spot. Chicken and waffles was bomb!! Best fried chicken I've ever had! Cant wait to go back again
9/17/2019,20190917,3,4.55,"You know the place is going to be crowded when they don't take any reservations. They also don't have much parking, so you kinda have to park in residential areas. We're a family of four and we decided to give this place a shot. We went Sunday at about 11:30 and there was a wait of about an hour. You wonder on the streets until someone comes out and tells you you're being seated. We got some great high top seats. It has a beautiful inside and cute flower centerpieces everywhere. We got a round of mimosas, 2 coffees, 3 Asian style chicken-and-waffles and one chicken panini with no onions. The mimosas are amazing. It's made of freshly squeezed orange juice. You can tell cuz you may get chunks of fresh oranges in your mouth time to time. I got the cold brew which was really good. And my sister got a flat white which was delicious as even had a great design on top. Now onto food. The Asian style chicken and waffles are a must. The waffle is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The butter is churned, so you have no trouble spreading it on the waffle. It also comes with a side of maple syrup and some sort of Asian style spicy sauce. The sweet and spicy is just perfect together. My sister's no onion chicken panini comes and it has onions in it. I know the waiter took the order correctly because when we got our check it said without onions on it. But no big deal right? Just pick them out and eat the sandwich. That's exactly what she did. Other than that she said the panini was very good. Then we got another round of mimosas and we still had our coffees to drink. About a couple minutes into that, our waiter literally came up to us and said there's another party of 4 waiting to be seated and if we can hurry it up. Also suggesting we take our coffees to go. I get it, it's a fast paced place and I know how antsy people get when they're hungry. But, there was a couple sitting next to us (side by side not in front of each other) talking to one of the employees the whole time we were there. They didn't order anything, they were just sipping water and occupying 4 seats. So I don't mind hurrying up and chugging my drinks but it's just not nice when the people next to us could have easily taken their conversation outside. But I guess it's who you know. Now I'm not saying I wouldn't go back cuz the food was really good."
9/17/2019,20190917,4,4.55,Such a great place for brunch and to bring your dog! I'm entirely obsessed with places that accommodate our fur babies while enjoying great food.
9/18/2019,20190918,5,4.55,Staff was really accommodating to a couple changes we had to the food. Everything came out quickly and delicious. Will definitely go back... and I don't live close so I will drive to get there. Been dreaming about their toast.
9/18/2019,20190918,5,4.55,"Had the eggs Benedict waffle, everything was just perfect from the perfect amount of egg yolk and hollandaise. The waffle was crispy but had the perfect savoury flavour with a hint of sweetness. We were seated quickly and the service was great. Would come back and recommend."
9/18/2019,20190918,5,4.55,"Dude, the vibe in this place is awesome, also the food is solid, oh! And also, the servers are super awesome and friendly, Brian was our server. 'His Waffles' are effing awesome. Alfredo sauce, fried chicken and waffle, with syrup? Doesn't sound like they go together, but they definitely do. Get 'em. Byeee."
9/20/2019,20190920,5,4.55,My favorite breakfast spot in LA. Waffle chicken and sandwich are so so good. Highly recommend! But it's a little difficult to park outside.
9/20/2019,20190920,5,4.55,Best brunch spot in LA! The couple that owns it work so hard to make it a great place to come with friends!! Will continue to return
9/21/2019,20190921,5,4.55,"Always happy. Jake was our server. Everything.. the food. The portion, the prices, the vibe, the service... excellent. Won't visit LA without coming here."
9/21/2019,20190921,5,4.55,"This is probably my favorite breakfast location in Los Angeles, me and a couple friends returned to this spot after enjoying it the first time. Me personally, i fell in love with the Fried Chicken & Waffles, to be specific the Fried Chicken. I even had to get a second order of it just because how good it was. Down to the taste of the breading to the juiciness of the chicken in every bite. It had a mild kick to it so take that in consideration when ordering, but it is well worth the order. Besides the chicken, the waffle was really tasteful as well, the whole meal was superb down to the service of the waiters. Definitely recommend this Location if you're wondering, will be coming again."
9/22/2019,20190922,3,4.55,Ambience: good. Could be better minus the buzzing flies. Menu: great. Lots of crowd pleasers including waffles and fried chicken. Waffles with Nutella. Waffles and berries. Did I mention waffles? Execution: this is where instagram worthy foods are just not quite calories worthy. Waffles are not freshly made and not quite brown and crispy. Over cooked poached eggs. Salads that are meh (probably sourced from Costco judging from the way they look). This is hardly a farm to table endeavor. Service is so nice I'm tempted to give an extra star. It's just so disappointingly overrated.
9/22/2019,20190922,5,4.55,"Sighhhhhhhhhhhh..I write this review with a heavy heart as we prepare to leave here. The food was surreal,amazing,fantastic, and F%}£ing DELICIOUS.....First off the waiter was on point gave us the run down and gave really good choices by what we liked.We had the chicken and waffles and Roscoes ""You're Fired"" lol the Asian recipe was on another level and made so perfectly balanced with its spicy sauceThe waffle-on another level and didn't get soft or soggy which I just wanted more.Waffle fries-Yum Yum and YUM!!!Waffle sandwich had the best eggs we ever had Sigh....I want to come back already and looking to make an excuse to come back to LA to eat here lol"
9/22/2019,20190922,5,4.55,"Waited way too long to try this place! Worth the wait and not something I say lightly. Breakfast was amazing, with well-prepared, fresh tasting ingredients. The service was fabulous - helpful and attentive without being over-zealous. Polite and accommodating at every step. Great people watching, too! A perfect LA experience."
9/22/2019,20190922,5,4.55,"Waffle-bello was perfect. Savory with cilantro aioli. I asked for extra but really it was great without the extra aioli. It even had a side of maple syrup. My brunch request to the heavens was thus granted: both sweet and savory all in one. I'm vegetarian so chicken and waffles is not an option. I always want the waffle and something savory. This hit the spot. It also confused me because I had been set on just ordering two entrees to meet this yearning. I was satisfied but I pushed to then also ingest a berry and cream waffle. Delicious. The server forgot to include the side of maple syrup - which I would normally have been like 'please give me' but I assumed that was the order, and because I realized the wafflebello was perfect without any changes so I ate the sweet waffle as received. It was good! My partner got the Italian chicken and waffles which was superb, and also the sliders which he said were also amazing. The wizard behind this menu is a food scientist! The server was also gushing about the food and we were all just very very pleased talking about how great the food was. Also, most waffles are served all day on the weekends but other brunch items are til 4pm, FYI."
9/23/2019,20190923,4,4.55,"My husband and I had breakfast here twice while in LA, yes it was that good. Service was excellent, we waited less that 14 minutes to be seated. Seating is in close proximity , so keep in mind you will be bumping elbows with the person next to you. Breakfast was tasty not bland, orange juice tasted like it was freshly squeezed my husband enjoyed the chick n and waffles, waffles where crunchy but at the same time soft enjoyed... Overall atmosphere was light, relaxed and easy going. Would definitely visit again"
9/23/2019,20190923,5,4.55,Ahhhhhhmazing. Worth the wait. Me and my bestie had tried a few of their french toast and eggs dishes and none of them disappointed. I will be back
9/23/2019,20190923,1,4.55,"LMAOO THIS PLACE IS OVERHYPED. I live a block away so I thought I'd finally try it out & support a local business. My bf wanted to order a breakfast item but couldn't get potatoes instead of sausages. (Y'all know potatoes cost way less than meat right) & I ordered the bean wrap which was so bland and basic ( lettuce blend, hummus, beans) literally my homemade wraps cost 5$ to make and it got way more flavor. Anyways, this place got a cool theme and setting to it but the food is a no no. So to the ones coming here for an insta post... enjoyyyy ;-)"
9/24/2019,20190924,5,4.55,Server was super friendly and attentive. Huevos rancheros & mama's omelette were both super delicious. Waffle was light & fluffy & yummy. Food came out pretty quickly. Will be back again to try other food options.
9/25/2019,20190925,5,4.55,This a smaller place but the staff and food is just amazing. I recommend the chicken and waffles.
9/25/2019,20190925,5,4.55,Amazing. The Khai Joao (Thai) omelette is absolutely inspirational. Service was awesome as well. Love Brian from Chicago. A must if you are anywhere nearby.
9/25/2019,20190925,4,4.55,"Long wait, but delicious food! Highly recommend their French toast. Super cute restaurant with an even sweeter background. Came in for brunch on a Sunday and waited for about an hour, but pretty typical for LA. My friend got a latte and said it was delicious and their waffle truffle fries are bomb too!"
9/26/2019,20190926,5,4.55,"They say third time is a charm but I guess I'm lucky! My first visit didn't go so well. It was a Saturday and extremely packed so I decided to leave (I was hangry). Today was my 2nd time visiting this restaurant and I loved it! I had their waffle breakfast sandwich it was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! The waffle was soft and buttery. It complimented my cheesy scrambled eggs and bacon perfectly. Every dish that came out was ""instagram worthy."" I will definitely be back and try something new!"
9/26/2019,20190926,5,4.55,"This place is literally perfect. I come here all the time as I live very near and love the energy from everyone who works there, including the owners. Delicious food and drinks and great atmosphere. Cannot recommend this enough!"
9/27/2019,20190927,5,4.55,Yum. Worth the wait. Do it and you won't regret it. Oh and don't forget you can always sit at the bar (faster service) and you get to see everything being made which is so cool!
9/28/2019,20190928,3,4.55,"I truly went into this place with high expectations and maybe yelp is to blame! My dad and I decided to check this place out on a Friday morning and it was pretty crowded but we were fortunate enough to sit right down. Unfortunately, this place is not kid friendly..I have a 6 month old in a car seat (there's no way I could've brought her stroller in) and the host suggested I put her on a barstool...That might not be the safest idea but to our luck the people eating right next to us was about to finish up and offered their seat to us. Thank you strangers!Based on the pictures on yelp everything looked AMAZING so we decided to order the breakfast burrito and the crunchy French toast. Hands down beautiful display..flavor on the other hand was okay. I enjoyed the French toast but my dad wasn't too thrilled about it. Since it's called ""crunchy"" French toast he expected it to be crunchy rather than soggy. The crunchy part refers to the few corn flakes they sprinkle on it not that it's actually a crunchy slice of French toast. The burrito was something that tasted homemade but pretty bland unless you added their homemade salsa. Chai latte was pretty tasty and I would definitely come back for that and possibly to try their drinks! Maybe I didn't order the best plates but I definitely did expect more. Our server was the sweetest but I feel that the host should've been very well informed about sitting a family with kids."
9/28/2019,20190928,5,4.55,"This is my absolute favorite place ever. Not only is the food beyond delicious, it's made with love! Mindy and Vincent are amazing ppl and make my boyfriend and I feel like family. I have never been disappointed once. The waffles are amazing and the waffle sandwich Omg! This is like our second home. Can wait for their new Italian spot to open. This is the type of place you will eat at forever! I'm going there now haha. You must try it!"
9/29/2019,20190929,5,4.55,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in LA. It has a cute, cozy yet modern ambiance and the food is great! I came here with a friend on a Saturday (late) morning and we only waited 5 minutes for a table. Water is served in cute little mason jars and the food is bomb - just as amazing as it looks. I 100% recommend the French toast if you like a sweet breakfast on occasion. (It's the best French toast I've ever had.) Service was great as well. Prices are as expected for a trendy brunch in LA, but so worth it."
9/29/2019,20190929,5,4.55,"Tried the Thai style chicken and waffles and was very apprehensive til I took the first bite. HEAVEN. Omg so surprisingly good and it helped that I was hungry haha. The chicken was not overwhelmingly Thai flavored, it had a kind of flavored powder on the chicken that wasn't too strong. It came with a chili sauce that tasted really good combined with the syrup. Sweet and spicy The seating might look cramped cuz the tables are right next to each other but it was actually fine. I had the mint tea after my meal and it was thebfreshest mint tea I've had in a restaurant. The tea bag just had whole mint leaves in it. So I definitely finished my already delicious meal with my favorite tea and left happy."
9/29/2019,20190929,4,4.55,"Excellent food! I recommend trying the eggs benedict on a waffle. It's original and taste very light and delicious! Only suggestion i would of loved to see is a deal on mimosas. Would of absolutely loved a bottomless mimosa on the menu.. instead they are $10 to start and $8 each one after that. Kinda pricey to me but then again it's LA. Overall, would recommend this place."
9/30/2019,20190930,4,4.55,"I ordered the breakfast burrito and I was only able to finish half. I wish they had different hot sauces/more than what came with the burrito. Maybe I didn't order the right things but it was just a good brunch place, but I probably wouldn't come back again/would try other places."
9/30/2019,20190930,5,4.55,Food was great and the customer service was a-1 which made my experience that much better! Came on a Sunday after church and there was a long group of people waiting outside. The space is pretty small inside. But because I was a party of one I got seated right away! There's like 12 more things in the menu that I would like to try so I'll for sure be back!!!!
9/30/2019,20190930,5,4.55,Loved the food. Went early in the morning and the vibe was really chill. Waffle sandwiches are a must!
10/1/2019,20191001,5,4.55,This place has been on my breakfast list for a long time and I'm disappointed I slept on it so long. Breakfast was one of my favorites in a long time.Visited on a Sunday and the place was packed. I had the Flintstone waffle and my girlfriend had something much healthier but not memorable to me. Sat next to the owner who was very friendly and clearly well liked by his staff.
10/1/2019,20191001,5,4.55,This was the best brunch so far. The batter on the chicken i ordered with my waffle was amazing. Also the French toast was amazing. Definitely give this restaurant 10 stars.
10/1/2019,20191001,5,4.55,Had the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend had the burrito BOTH WERE AMAZING. We both agreed that if we lived closer this would be our breakfast spot but in the meantime it's definitely worth the drive and the ambience is also really nice. My chicken and waffles was crispy and they were the most perfect combo together. Highly recommend!!
10/1/2019,20191001,5,4.55,"This is my new go-to brunch place. The place is bit small, packed with tables, wait on the weekend can be long but the service & the food, esp waffles are just too good! Now I don't need to drive all the way to downtown LA for my chicken & waffles!"
10/1/2019,20191001,5,4.55,"My friend and I came around 5ish on saturday, the place was so cute and cosy, after the rush for their brunch, right in time for the happy hour.The atmosphere was very peaceful with nice music and AC for the hot days.We had a great thai tea, truffle waffle fries / avocado toast. We loved our time there!Also, our waitress, Anna, was extremely nice and helpful.Cant wait to try more things on their menu."
10/2/2019,20191002,3,4.55,"I took my parents here the day after my graduation ceremony. It was a Sunday morning. In hindsight, not the best idea. The wait tends to be super long on the weekends--especially brunches in LA.The wait was around 30 minutes. We were seated and service was pretty fast for how busy they were. Albeit, it's a little difficult to grab their attention amidst the craziness. I got the Wake Up Happy and it was pretty good. I'd say a bit better than a standard diner breakfast, but not enough to blow me out of the waters. My parents got french toast. They seemed to quite enjoy the breakfast and they're not super huge on American breakfast. Overall, super busy and crowded brunch spot. Pretty good, but it's not to die for."
10/2/2019,20191002,5,4.55,Had the chicken and waffles at this quaint restaurant during a brief stop in LA. it had been on our list of places to visit and it's worth it. The chicken and waffles were HUGE portions and were delicious. This restaurant is uniquely creative with their flavors and the ambience of the is cozy and welcoming. Will definitely go back!
10/4/2019,20191004,2,4.55,"The service is excellent! But the food is mediocre at best, i got the ground chicken with basil and rice and it only had salt, no sauce what so ever. They shouldn't have items on the menu that will lose potential future customers. I also tried the waffle and Nutella with strawberries, it was whatever's could probably make it better at home. In all, not going back for the food but the service is 5 plus stars"
10/5/2019,20191005,4,4.55,"Cute little spot and the food is amazing! I was so pleasantly surprised! Waffle themed menu and so tasty. I ordered the portobello mushroom waffle which comes with a fried egg, avocado, tomato and some greens but what maximizes the flavor is the jalapeño aioli. Wow! They did it right. I also ordered their hibiscus tea which was also refreshing. The only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 stars is because as I sat down, the cup of water that was brought over was filthy with red wine stains all over. Plus I don't think they should be sweeping while people are eating as the dust gets all over your food. Otherwise, I'd definitely go back. The food was excellent."

10/5/2019,20191005,4,4.54,"Updated review! This is a great neighborhood spot that we go to often. Love the salads and waffles. Service can be a bit off during the brunch rush on weekends so we tend to avoid going then. Aside from that, it's a solid spot with consistently good food."
10/5/2019,20191005,1,4.54,Bad service ever. I was waiting for my iced coffee 20min but we didn't get any drinks after main menu came out. Servers and Manager are very rude. Very poor ability to deal with customer complain.
10/5/2019,20191005,5,4.54,Such a cute little spot. Cool different breakfast options! Super yummy!! Close to all the museums !

10/6/2019,20191006,5,4.54,"So good!!!! The food was great, great host. It was a wait, but it went by fast after taking a little walk. I loved it totally coming back!!!"
10/6/2019,20191006,5,4.54,"Cute little gem, bought my boo here. Waffle eggs Benedict are superb avocado toast do stand out from the rest I've had. Service was quick and friendly. It's atmosphere is fantastic, just the name is a conversation starter. Idk, I love this place."
10/6/2019,20191006,5,4.54,"Staff were very welcoming. Food was out within 10 minutes. Servers were attentive. Coffee was delicious. Pricier than most breakfast places, but definitely worth the price. Will definitely come back in the future."

10/7/2019,20191007,5,4.54,I love this place! The small corner spot gives it a wonderful family-feel that makes you forget you're in Los Angeles and not in some quaint small town hotspot. I ordered the (Thai-style) Chicken and Waffles and it did not disappoint.I look forward to coming back to try the Now This is Love Waffleetella and the Khai Jiao (Thai Omelet) and a few others. Going to work my way through the whole menu.Love that I stumbled across this place finally. Brunch spot of my dreams. I only wish I had taken the time to take a few photos.

10/8/2019,20191008,5,4.54,Literally never knew scrambled eggs could taste so good. The waffles were so soft and sweet. The orange juice tasted like fresh squeezed. The outside area has a fly problem which was my only complaint.

10/8/2019,20191008,4,4.54,"Love the atmosphere here and the toasts were really tasty, but the cold brew was so small! It was like a stemless wine glass full of ice with barely any actual coffee in it; not great value for money. Seating is pretty tight but very charming and fun place."
10/9/2019,20191009,5,4.54,"this was probably one of the best brunch spots I've ever tried in LA. I loved everything about this place. The vibes, the people, the food, the area... everything was so perfect! The waiter was so nice and the food was so delicious- my sisters and I actually finished all our food! I would definitely come here again & I would totally recommend it to anyone who's visiting. The story behind the name of this restaurant was even so cute! (Yes, he met her at a bar)"
10/9/2019,20191009,5,4.54,"Excellent gluten free waffles, Certainly the best that I've ever had!Excellent customer service!!!"
10/9/2019,20191009,5,4.54,The waffle we had was so extra and so amazing. Would recommend this place for a fun and chill breakfast
10/9/2019,20191009,4,4.54,Great coffee and ambiance. There are all kinds of breakfast items with waffles on the menu and breakfast is served till late afternoon. Really enjoyed the waffle Benedict.
10/9/2019,20191009,5,4.54,"They took peanutbutter off their menu, so I probably won't be back but daaaaaaang when your table could get one pb/syrup waffle and one fried chicken waffle, (it's thai fried chicken somehow and it's unreal,) we were here all the time."
10/10/2019,20191010,5,4.54,"The name of this place in itself is intriguing enough to make you want to come in! I love the cute little story about how the owners met and decided to open up their own restaurant!Located on the busy street of La Brea, this cute café has only street parking available. You order at the counter and then take a seat any table you'd like.For drinks, we had the Hibiscus Iced Tea and a Blooming Tea. The Hibiscus Iced Tea was a beautiful, vibrant red color topped with fresh fruit--really refreshing! The Blooming Tea was so fun to watch! The hot water opens the tea right up, so it's like it's blooming right in front of you!They have a nice variety of entrees on their menu. It's a good mix between classic American and Thai-inspired dishes, which I love! The Khai Jian (Thai Omelet) was definitely my favorite! It consists of 3 eggs, onion, and maple sausage on jasmine rice with a side of sliced tomato and sriracha sauce. So tasty! I literally gobbled this right up! We also had the Fried Chicken and Waffles...I love their Thai-style spin on this dish! It was flavored with tom yum seasoning and topped with crispy basil and chilis. The chilis gave it a nice kick, and the chicken and waffles were nice and crispy! I like their take on the Avocado Toast because not only are they generous with the amount of avocado, but they also add tomato, and LOTS of parmesan! Yum. They're known for their waffles, so make sure to get one of these! I had the Organic Matcha Waffle, and it was not only pretty to look at but tasty too! Perfect for breakfast or dessert hehe."
10/10/2019,20191010,5,4.54,"Love coming here! Really delicious food, quick service, and friendly staff. There's metered street parking on La Brea, but there is also some free residential parking on the streets behind the restaurant. They don't take reservations so expect a short wait on the weekdays and an hour or so wait over the weekends. Worth it though!"
10/11/2019,20191011,5,4.54,"I waited ... and waited, but she never came. So, I had a Wafflebello Sandwich and side of sausage and smoked salmon. Thought it might be the day I finally meet her as it seemed Lady Luck was on my side. I immediately found parking. Free. Only a block away. No permit needed - just a two-hour time limit. Get to the entrance, and two large parties are exiting. I only had to wait for the tables to be cleared ... (if you don't know the area, depending on when you go, parking can be challenging. And with the size of the restaurant, not tiny but not large - you may have to endure a wait for a table)The service was great. All the qualities you hope to find when you're out to enjoy some good eats. I wish I remembered the server's name to give him a shout out but I'll just catch it next time when I go back looking for her. As for the food - I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It allowed me to forget why I was there. At first, I wondered about the waffle as it wasn't as crispy as I usually have them - however, after the first bite - nothing else mattered. The mix of ingredients worked for me and I took my time, enjoying every bite until it was gone. Two things many don't know about me. I'm not a breakfast person, nor am I fan of waiting in lines. I'd come back here for breakfast and I would wait if need be. After all, I can't risk, not ""meeting her"" ..."
10/13/2019,20191013,5,4.54,"Second time here and I must say this place is a 5-star in my books. I had the fried chicken Thai waffle, Oreo waffle and the portobello waffle sandwich and each were quite delicious. The portobello waffle sandwich was light and stuffed with portobello shrooms. Next we had the Oreo waffle which was dusted in Oreo bits and served with a dollop of ice cream and whip cream. It was decadent but what's a better way to start Sunday Funday off right? Lastly the Thai Fried Chicken Waffle was delicious. Savory and a hint of sweetness. It was just so flavorful. You won't regret this order! The line here is a bit long which is one of the reasons why I don't come here as often as I would like, but they are opening a restaurant next door called amber Agee at the Bar- Pasta. I'm very curious to try that when it opens up hopefully by early next month."
10/13/2019,20191013,5,4.55,"I had the BIGGEST waffle craving, and decided to come here from all the strong reviews. What a cool neighborhood spot with a wide variety of waffle options. I got the waffle combo (came with a skillet of eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles + berries). It was filling, delicious and appropriately priced. We sat on bar stools at a slightly cramped table against the window, but the service was really on top of it and we had a great time. I'll be back!"
10/13/2019,20191013,5,4.55,"The restaurant was great. The staff was super amazing, super nice. We celebrated my friends bday. They brought out the cake I purchased with candles and everything. Super nice. The food was delicious as well."
10/13/2019,20191013,5,4.55,"I go to a different brunch spot every weekend in LA and this is the best place I've been to! Their Thai fried chicken and waffle is extremelyyy flavorful and one of the best brunch dishes I've had. Prices are fair, typical brunch in LA if not a little cheaper. It's a really small place but they serve quickly and the wait is never too long, even on a Saturday morning. I see that this place is getting more and more reviews though (I visited for the first time probably when it was at around 600 reviews), so not sure if the wait time will start increasing with its popularity. Parking isn't bad either, you can always find some good street parking in the surrounding neighborhood."
10/15/2019,20191015,5,4.55,"Went yesterday for brunch with my fam. Service was amazing super fast. Its a really small but cute spot. Food was really good and reasonable. They had everything we all wanted, from fresh OJ to avocado toast to yummy waffles. We will definitely be coming back to try something else on the menu. Definitely recommend for a intimate breakfast or lunch. No parking street only however many available. Go check it out!"
10/17/2019,20191017,5,4.55,"I was almost speechless after the first bite of the chicken. I ordered the Thai style chicken and waffles. The best word I can use to describe this chicken is mouthwatering. Quite frankly, it was the best chicken I've had at a brunch place. The chicken was well cooked and extremely flavorful. The waffles delightful and could be eaten with or without syrup. I would highly recommend this brunch location. I will definitely return on my next trip to LA."
10/17/2019,20191017,5,4.55,"Good vibes/music, great atmosphere, people, foods were delicious! & best services from Sara!! Wednesday night meter parking was only for 2 hours but there's a parking structure across the street on La Brea."
10/18/2019,20191018,5,4.55,Is there a ten star option?!?! Seriously this place was amazing I've never been so happy eating brunch. The customer service is outstanding thank you to our waiter for being so friendly and on point as well as the whole staff! There is not a single person in their who doesn't look like they love their job. Ok now the food.... HOLLY DELICIOUSNESS !! Chicken and waffles Thai style is heavenly their orange juice is It's a small location and you may sit next to strangers but I loved it such a great environment
10/18/2019,20191018,5,4.55,"5/5 foodI love this place, I love their waffles, I love the owners story about this place it's so sweet. I tried their Thai basil chicken waffle and it was BOMB, The chicken was crispy on the outside and the spice was just right. It's not too spicy. And the waffle was just as soft, sooooooo gooood . Also try the Nutella waffle for dessert, you definitely wanna share that with someone. 3/5 placeThe place gets crowded pretty fast, so look forward to waiting a bit especially since the restaurant is small. They have a modern Thai fusion decor that I really love. It's friendly and welcoming once you enter. There's outside and inside seating! No parking lot so you'll have to find street parking."
10/19/2019,20191019,5,4.55,"This is my 3rd time coming here and it still never fail to disappoint me for their various type of food and drinks, but this time me and my friend ordered the matcha waffles and Benedict Florentine with iced mocha and halo tea. It was the best meal for both of us and we were able to finish everything off from our plates.The Benedict Florentine have a lot of good flavors in it along with the crispy potatoes. They did a good job on the poached egg since we cut it down and there was yolk pouring everywhere. I even enjoyed the matcha waffles and it actually came to my surprise because I was afraid that it might be too sweet but it wasn't. I would say the level of sweetness on the matcha waffles is about 50-60%. I even tasted the matcha flavor inside too! I'm a hardcore lover for matcha everywhere I go and when I come back to this place again, I would definitely order the matcha waffles again! My friend immediately fell in love with the halo tea because of the taste quality of it and it wasn't too sweet either. She would recommend adding honey in it because it would make 1000x better! I still like the vibe of this place and it's always my favorite thing to do on a weekend...come to this place and hang out with a couple of friends in the early morning and just dig in our food. I even love the story behind this place and it's so sweet. The estimated waiting time wasn't that bad at all for us. We came here like 3 times and It always would take us about 15 to 20 mins in order to get our table and order our food right away."
10/19/2019,20191019,4,4.55,"I came here Saturday morning around 9am it was already pretty full but got a nice seat by the window. I ordered the Halo tea which is pretty tasty if you request honey to go with it. I also order the Benedict Florentine eggs which were cooked to perfection, I think the sauce could use a bit more flavor but overall they were pretty good. This place is definitely a pretty good food hang out. Just be aware that the street parking can be a bit tough."
10/19/2019,20191019,4,4.55,"This little trendy place delivers on its flavors! The cold brew was delicious. The eggs benedict was ehh but that chicken and waffles. Wow. The chicken was juicy, crunchy and a little spicy. The waffle was soft and sweet. The maple syrup and sweet chili sauce really brings that dish to the next level! Don't skip out on the avocado toast either-- that cheese makes such a simple dish, incredible. Note: Be prepared to wait if you're going on weekend in the morning/afternoon. But it's worth it!"
10/19/2019,20191019,5,4.55,"We loved this place. Great service and the oat milk honey latte was amazing! I had the vegan salted caramel waffle, I love being able to get brunch that fits my diet needs and this place fit both criteria! Delicious vegan brunch! Lots of options as well for non vegans, easily fits the tastes of a group. Will be returning!"
10/19/2019,20191019,5,4.55,"Been here three times and each time it's been special . From the Oreo waffle , to the chicken & waffle , last to the breakfast sandwich. All the above was Fire !!! It's a must you experiment this"
10/19/2019,20191019,5,4.55,I just experienced the best chicken and waffle ever. Crisp fried chicken with a spicy Thai twist on top of a delicious Belgium waffle. On the side was maple syrup and a sweet & spicy chili sauce. The best. We arrived a little after 8am and were quickly seated. The cappuccino was perfectly balanced and the ambiance of the restaurant was cozy. Lots of local neighbors dine here and support a wonderful neighborhood business. Please stop by a be prepared to enjoy a delicious meal with great service!
10/19/2019,20191019,5,4.55,This is officially my favorite place to get fresh homemade waffles!!! They have the best Nutella waffle and the fried chicken and waffles is very delicious and flavorful!!!

10/19/2019,20191019,2,4.55,"My two stars are based on my interactions with the hostess. I had the eggs Benedict, let me say it was yummy, my sister had the chicken and waffles, and again it was balanced and well seasoned, the wine list though a tad limited, was perfect for what the crowd is and time of day. What really rubbed me the wrong way was how the no reservation wait went, not only was I told that my wait time was 45 minutes to and hour, that's fine it's a weekend, what annoyed me is watching people be sat even though it is said your complete party has to be there, ok even if it's a friend or a friend of a friend, if I see this happening and then ask you how much longer and you tell me there's a 45 minute wait still, and I'm already past the hour wait, that's just not ok at all. What really annoyed me is when I brought it to her attention and she found us a seat in haste, she said that wasn't that bad was it all I know is the only reason I didn't read her the riot act is, it was Sunday and I really wanted to have my food without seething at the fact that I found her comment so dismissive. Again the food was ok, I'm sure it would have been better if the first person you interact with, the hostess was a tad bit more sincere."
10/20/2019,20191020,4,4.55,"I came here during a weekday with my coworkers and the place was pretty packed for lunch time. The only spot they had for us was at a bar table squeezed between two parties. It wasn't the best for a pregnant woman to have to climb up to eat but we didn't want to wait so we took it. The service was so so and it took a few tries before we could flag anyone down to order. The workers were walking all around us but never really looked up to see if anyone needed them.Despite this, I enjoyed my waffle sandwich - it was the portabello mushroom one but forgot the name. I tend to like plain things without too much sauce so if that's not for you, you might want to try their thai chicken and waffles which is their specialty. Overall, not sure I'd come back on a weekend because the place is super tiny and it's not the best place for conversation. For a quick lunch during work hours / the week, I'd be down to come back."
10/20/2019,20191020,3,4.55,"We loved it, delicious....little pricey for what it is BUT customer service was amazing....Only negative is the fried chicken...too much fat! Not enough meat. I'll come back but I will never buy their fried chicken again...I thought maybe it's just mine but I tasted my friends' chickens and it's the same. They noticed it too..No bueno."
10/20/2019,20191020,4,4.55,It's kind of hard to find parking on a weekend since there's no parking lot. We signed up on the waitlist when we got there and waited 20-30 mins on a Sunday which isn't so bad. The matcha waffle and that was pretty different from your usual strawberries or Nutella waffles. The orange juice is freshly squeezed which is always my fave!!!

10/20/2019,20191020,2,4.54,"Came here for the first time as I needed a midway meeting point for a catch-up with a friend. Chose this spot entirely based on the reviews and honestly did not have a good experience at all. Expecting it to have some charm (even hipster charm) it was noisy (even though there were barely any people there at 3:30/4pm on a Saturday), bad acoustics, we were told to sign in and wait even though there were plenty of free tables and the staff generally didn't seem to know what they were doing e.g. we were moved to another table for a party that never came. On the food side I ordered a chia fruit bowl that I couldn't finish as it was so stodgy and my friend ordered a version of huevos rancheros that was just okay. We also got a coffee my friend couldn't drink and a lemonade. All overpriced for what it was. I feel like this place is closer to a 3 star joint but my experience was more like a 1 star. I am amazed people rate it so highly as there are a tonne better spots in town."

I'm very picky about hollandaise sauces, but our server let us know they make their own. I also got the vanilla with oat milk and my friend got the mocha with oat milk which she loved! The oat mills gives a nutty flavor. Our server was very nice too!"

10/24/2019,20191024,5,4.54,"Great food and service. Was a bit crowded even at 10:30am on a Friday morning, but that's LA for you. Got the thai fried chicken and waffle and truffle potatoes. Both were fantastic. I will definitely be back."
10/25/2019,20191025,4,4.54,"This place is so freaking cute! I decided to stop in before my hair appointment and I'm so glad I did. I was able to be seated quickly and the staff members were sweet with genuine smiles. I had the Wafflebello Sandwich, which surpassed my expectations. The aioli meshed the whole thing together for me, it was sublime. I'll be sure to make sure to make some time before my future trips to the salon to try more here."
10/25/2019,20191025,5,4.54,"Does not disappoint! The staff is so friendly and the food is amazing. Very well plated, accenting the simplicity of the food with lots of color. Loved the Fried Chicken and Waffles (Thai Style). Definitely worth coming back for!Very cute story how the cafe name came to be and love the fusion that's incorporated into the food and cafe. A must try!"
10/25/2019,20191025,4,4.54,Food was so good. Wait was long but that is considered on a Saturday mid brunch time. Waffles and lox was my fave! And the matcha latte was good. I like this place!
10/26/2019,20191026,2,4.53,"This place was stingy! We ordered an omelette with extra cheese, a ""his fried chicken and waffle"", and some sides. The omelette didn't have extra cheese, and the fried chicken was so small that it couldn't cover half of a small waffle. Also, they charged for my hot water. I don't mind restaurants charging for hot water but when everything else was ""short"" it becomes a thumb down. They don't have regular butter here, only sweet butter. And everything else was kind of sweet, even the sausages were honey glazed. The only good thing was the flavor of my fried chicken."
10/26/2019,20191026,5,4.53,"Went on a whim with my 8 year old, and loved it. She got the Flintstone waffles, and they came out beautifully. The side of extra crispy bacon was so good, the kiddo wanted a second order.I got the white truffle toast, and it was delicious. A+ would eat again.Cons: place is tiny, loud, and crowded. But worth it."
10/26/2019,20191026,5,4.53,"Great place. Tasty food, top shelf service. Triple treat here lol. Had the chicken and waffle it's bomb with a Thai twist"
10/27/2019,20191027,4,4.53,"A brunch spot that simply gets the food right. Now. Lemme say this. I am usually not a Belgian waffle type of gal. Gasp. I know. But this place. Dare I say. I'd go back just for the waffle! It was so YUM. I got the waffle and berries and save for offering my friend a taste. I ate the whole thang! I also ordered khai jaio as well with avocado instead of sausage and it too was delicious. A bed of rice hiding beneath a fluffy cloud of eggs filled with pieces of onion and avocado. My friend got the portobello mushroom waffle Sammy and said it was yum as well, her sole complaint, she wanted more sauce. I have only a couple of concerns or gripes and they aren't major. The space is tight and the wait is long. Also, 6 bucks is a ridiculous price to charge for a glass of orange juice (especially for me, mine wasn't even served in the mason jar everyone else seemed to have) with no refills at that! That being said, it's worth it. I'd totally do it all over again"
10/27/2019,20191027,5,4.53,"Place is Absolutely amazing from the service to the very last bite! Be prepared to wait a while, place tends to get packed and depending on how quick customers eat and get out is determined to how quickly you'll get a table. The staff is super helpful w/ suggestions on food and work very hard and quickly to accommodate every customer! Favorite new spot in LA!"
10/27/2019,20191027,5,4.53,Excellent service excellent Tasting food small portion sizes but hey can't have it all. It was packed and I was able to go In and get a spot with zero wait literally. I just asked how do I sign in and the stuff made it happen! I will be back next week. Mimosa was good 10 bucks 8 for a refill. Too small but delicious. Waffle was a true delicacy:)
10/27/2019,20191027,5,4.53,lovely joint in the heart of miracle mile. highly recommend trying their chicken & waffles (thai style)
10/27/2019,20191027,5,4.53,Lovely friendly staff great food. Decent prices. And they didn't boot us out when we needed to linger a bit. Good vegan options!
10/28/2019,20191028,5,4.54,"Service was great! Food was better! Was a beautiful day so we ate outside. Very little place but don't be discouraged the food is totally worth it. Very reasonable in price. I had the peach waffles and wow.... fresh peaches, ice cream and a beautiful presentation!! We will be back!"
10/29/2019,20191029,5,4.54,"Oooh I loved here for brunch! My man and I came here on a Sunday morning ~11am before we were going to drive back up to NorCal. We found free parking on a residential street! The wait time was about ~45 minutes so we walked to get Coffee Bean&Tea Leaf nearby. We were seated at the bar area where we could watch the workers make fresh waffles and whip cream. The restaurant was lively and bustling, and I think we even met the owner! My man and him talked about their fantasy football teams, cool dude.I ordered the Chicken&Waffle Thai style. IT WAS SO GOOD I hardly wanted to give my man parts of it but of course I did (wifey material). We devoured it up! My man got The Bello Bello Wafflebello Sandwich (portobello mushroom sandwich) which was also very flavorful but my carnivorous side preferred my dish.Overall, I recommend for a pleasant brunch spot in LA!"
10/29/2019,20191029,5,4.54,"We always have a nice time here! Classic breakfast place, they have all the usuals. We go for the waffles. Great place to treat a friend to brunch, it's small but cute and very local."
10/31/2019,20191031,4,4.54,"Cute little neighborhood cafe, highlighting Belgian waffles. Was trying to find a place closer to Koreatown so I could meet up with a friend visiting in town and stumbled across this place on Yelp. Driving there from the Westside wasn't as challenging as I thought it would be, and though they don't have ample parking, I was able to find a place on the street.  Main thing is that you have to be aware of street cleaning on Mondays and Tuesdays. The pricing is pretty standard for breakfast/brunch places. My friend ordered breakfast tacos and I ordered the combo of eggs/sausage/bacon and a Belgian waffle. The tacos seemed to be a bit on the smaller side, so we split the breakfast proteins. They put berries on my waffle, which was nice but I didn't order that (and it costs $3 extra), so I made a note and they didn't charge me for it. Servers are rather attentive, and coffee was refilled, but I didn't particularly enjoy how they kept asking us if we were done (when we clearly weren't)... it'd be understandable if they had a long line but there was open seating everywhere. And not to mention the fact that they placed the bill in front of us while we were still eating... you know how they do, but it just seemed inordinately early. Not a bad place for breakfast foods if you're in the area. Would like to try their waffle sandwiches next time!"
11/1/2019,20191101,3,4.53,"The place seems to be more of a hype than anything. I personally didn't think the food was amazing or anything. Very small portions for the price and very simple. The atmosphere was loud and crowded. I guess it's very LA. For my dollar, it wasn't worth it to me. The service is great though, very friendly!"
11/2/2019,20191102,4,4.53,"Came here on a Saturday right at 9am and wow, there was already a long line out the door. I was wondering why they are so packed in the morning but once I tasted their food, I understood. I tried their eggs Benedict with waffles and fried chicken and waffles. Both were really rich in flavor. The fried chicken really balanced out the waffles. Additionally, the soft boiled eggs were perfect. The restaurant itself is pretty small as it only seats around 7-8 tables with bar seats as well. Their interior design is very hip and modern so it draws a lot of young crowds. If you're looking to taking any visitors or family/friends out to a nice brunch, this is the spot. Customer service was very attentive and friendly. They would come out occasionally to refill water and ask if you need anything else. I would definitely come back!"
11/2/2019,20191102,1,4.53,This is what you get when you order chicken sandwich. Thinly sliced sandwich which covers half the bread for $14
11/2/2019,20191102,5,4.53,"Had really good food, order does not take too long, I'm glad I came here. However, the place is small and can get packed but only because it is worth going to. Parking is hard to find, I parked in a parking lot nearby on a weekend where it was free of charge. Everything was great besides the struggle to find a seat to sit."
11/3/2019,20191103,4,4.53,"There is a lot to love about this quirky place, including the staff.The menu has a good variety with unique twists on popular favorites.We had fresh squeezed lemonade and a hibiscus tea, which both were crazy good and refreshing for the warm day.Use caution if you're diabetic. While I'm not certain of the actual sugar content or if any sugar was substituted, everything we tasted was on the sweet side. My hope is that there is more of a counterbalance to the sweetness in the entrees in the future. The food was good. But... it's not enough to keep me coming back. Let me explain why. I got the crispy french toast. It's a unique take on an old classic. What I loved about it was the fresh fruit, the cornflakes, and the mint sprigs on top. I wish it had more mint on it or in it. Never would have thought to do that. And it had other stuff on it, and truly tasted so good. Just as good as it is quirky.The downside to this dish, you gotta eat it quick or it's a soggy mess. It was a little too sweet for me, and I'm a sugar freak. I'm surprised that I'm also undecided on the syrup. By itself it was good. With the French toast and on a waffle, it was too sweet for me.In the future, I think maybe, I'd order the French toast without the Nutella, and add crispy bacon, and see how that is. I'd also order a couple scrambled eggs with cheese, for balancing out that sweetness. But without any changes it's a bit pricey, and to add anything, is probably out of my budget to be honest.My daughter had a waffle, scrambled eggs and bacon. (Can't remember the quirky name given..)The scrambled eggs were on point. So incredibly good, fluffy and flavorful. The waffles were delicious, but very sweet. The fresh fruit helped balance it, but after adding the syrup on, it needed even more balance.Maybe it's just us, but the syrups sweetness was too much, and the flavors of both, in my opinion, competed instead of complimented. Unlike my dish, the crispy bacon and the eggs really helped balance out the dish overall. The customer service was the major influence in this rating. After we received the check in text from being on the waitlist, we were aware that our place in the waitlist would be forfeited if we did not check back in within 5 min. of the notification text. However, it was very busy, and we didn't know who to check in with. So our table was given away. They accommodated us at the bar. And for the confusion gave a small order of waffles. It was a nice touch. Every server seemed to check in on us. And they were a friendly crew with an infectious positive vibe. We would have liked to see information about the establishment. The backstory behind the name. And information about the charitable work they do. Maybe on the menu or something. We would come back with friends or family from out of town. Or on occasion. Overall, I'm glad we came. And we had a good time and it gave us a good story to tell."
11/3/2019,20191103,5,4.53,"I was floored by how amazing this place was. My bf and I were playing yelp roulette for brunch and this was the first place that came up! Upon arrival the place seemed so cute. It was busy and you could tell it was a regular spot for some. The inside is small but I liked it. We ended up sitting at the bar which gave us an insight on how everything was made. Let me tell you this did not make the decision on what to get any easier. My boyfriend got the Thai style chicken and waffles HONEY that chicken and that sauce was IMMACULATE. I've never had a piece of chicken so juicy and properly seasoned. The waffle was pretty good as well not my style of waffle but still yummy. I got the French toast and oh my gosh the flavor was delectable. I only wish that it was fried a little harder the middle was a little soggy which I just do not like. All in all this place is so good we went twice lol. I 1,000% recommend this place."
11/3/2019,20191103,5,4.53,My dish was very delicious I had the chicken and waffles and my friend had the mushroom one. She loved here's. We are both not fans of combining sweet and salty and we didn't we are them separate and it was perfect for us! The chicken was so flavorful and the waffles was nice and soft with a tiny bit of crunch. Iced coffee was good. Unfortunately it's a small place and gets really loud so if you want to talk to the person your with plane on yelling or not speaking. We got there at 9:30am and waiting for 20 minutes or less. Will be coming back the food is worth it!!!
11/3/2019,20191103,4,4.53,"I went here with a friend today and I enjoyed the food. The wait was usual, like 15-20 minutes. The only things I can say were cons: we had to ask for menus and our water never got refilled, and maybe, the hours. Other than that, I liked it here. We ordered the strawberry ricotta toast to share and it was DELICIOUS! I ordered the chipotle chicken wrap which I enjoyed as well. My friend got the chicken and waffle, which she complained about not being cooked enough and also her cappuccino - I don't know why! Nonetheless, I want to apologize to the wonderful server, whose name I didn't get, but she was fantastic and trooper at dealing with my friend (who was rude AF and acting high maintenance!). To the server - you are awesome and so kind, and I apologize for my ill mannered friend! I do recommend this place and I will totally be back (at an earlier time) for the strawberry ricotta toast and to try their waffles!"
11/4/2019,20191104,5,4.53,"Came here for brunch this past weekend and the food is delicious! The service was prompt and friendly so I truly appreciate their customer service here. I ordered the Florentine Benedict on waffles which is something I've never tried before. Loved it! The waffles were fluffy, the eggs were cooked perfectly and the veggies had good flavor. I wouldn't say it's the best Benedict plate I've ever had but it's definitely up there on my list. My boyfriend said his chicken and waffles plate was the best he's ever tried and he hopes to go back for it."
11/4/2019,20191104,5,4.53,Incredible selection of soul food classics with a culinary twist and charm that will leave you wanting to come back time and time again for more! Get there early to avoid the fabulous and eager crowds. A new neighborhood favorite!
11/4/2019,20191104,2,4.53,"Food was good until... I ordered truffle fries and they gave us regular fries. I asked a worker if this was truffle fries, he said yes. I had a few bites and was pretty sure they were just regular waffle fries. I guess the worker didn't know enough to know the difference. Guy who looked like the manager asked everything was okay and I asked him if these were truffle fries and he said they weren't and he would fix that. He took the leftover fries and had them sprinkle some parmesan over it. Our server was nowhere to be found, I guess her shift was over. Rule of advice, you're not suppose to meet her at the bar."
11/5/2019,20191105,5,4.53,"Still my favorite brunch spot that I can remember in recent memory. My friends and I were in LA for a reunion and we decided to go here based on reviews. We were definitely not disappointed and our expectations were definitely exceeded.Food was really good, we ended up ordering seconds even though we were pretty full because we felt we wouldn't get a similar experience the rest of our trip.Really nice, cozy atmosphere and fun interactive staff. We parked a couple blocks away on a residential street, had no problems there.(Went in Feb 2019, very slowly catching up on my Yelp reviews for the year)"
11/6/2019,20191106,4,4.53,"A group of us ladies went here for brunch on a Sunday around 11am. We ended up waiting over an hour to get seated since we were a large group, which meant standing on a street corner in the hot sun. We ended up getting seated outside and the slope of the sidewalk made it rather uncomfortable. Other than the discomfort of waiting/sitting at an awkward outside table, the food was excellent! We all shared our meals, but the Thai-style fried chicken and waffles were absolutely the highlight. The sangria was tasty and the scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly. I would definitely go back-- but with a smaller group!"
11/6/2019,20191106,5,4.53,Love this place i wish it was closer to my house i would probably be a regular. Eggs Benedict are awsome! Huevos rancheros are very good too.
11/7/2019,20191107,4,4.53,"I finally got a chance to come here and was super happy. We went on a Friday around brunch time - wait was only about 10 minutes at the time. The seating appeared pretty tight inside and there aren't that many tables. We were fortunate to be able to sit at one of the 2 outside tables. They had put up an awning to give us shade and it was perfect. That being said, try to join the Yelp waitlist if you're going at prime weekend hours and you can cut down on your wait. The three of us all opted for the ""You make me Wake Up Happy"" because it's the perfect combination of having sweet and savory options without having to order two items. One side is a waffle with maple butter, the other side is scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage. It's kind of the most basic, straightforward breakfast items but it works so well. The only thing was that the waffle was still a bit soft for me and not that fluffy. I'm always looking for that perfect crunchy hot outside with a soft and fluffy inside!"
11/7/2019,20191107,5,4.53,"GO HERE. Best brunch we have possibly ever had. You can tell just so much goes into each dish. It's a cute little place with friendly people. I got Avocado Toast - Avocado, tomato, parmesan, organic sourdough & cold brew My husband got Crispy French Toast - Cinnamon swirl brioche, creme brulee base, corn flakes, Nutella, seasonal fruitWe will absolutely be coming back, thank you for making some amazing food!"
11/7/2019,20191107,5,4.53,Fell in love with this place in an instant! Their food's amazing and their server's very attentive. Definitely adding this to my favorite brunch list.
11/7/2019,20191107,3,4.53,"Overall, pretty good. My truffle egg toast was missing something. It would have been better if the eggs were more creamy or there was a sauce. I found the entire dish to be dry. Thai iced tea was on the sweet side. Service was attentive. They also charge a ""healthcare love"" fee of 3% on all checks. When we asked about this the server told us that it was to pay for the employee's health insurance and that she would take it off if we wanted. Maybe it's because I'm from out of town but I have never heard of a restaurant asking customers to pay for this before. Strange."
11/8/2019,20191108,5,4.53,"Came here half and hour before it closes, the waitress was so friendly and had us sat down in no time. Really wanted to try the avocado toast since it looked pretty in pictures. The fried chicken waffles was so good. The avocado was kind of soggy while the french toast was just as good as any other french toasts. The owner saw my friends and I talking pictures and talked with us. After that he came back with two waffles, saying that it was free! The service was good and the food were pretty okay overall, it was a good experience though and I would love to come back and try other dishes!"
11/11/2019,20191111,5,4.53,"A boy and a girl Met each other at a bar and soon after decides to open up a restaurant called Met her at a bar. What a cute story and how this restaurant began not too long ago. I am not surprised that this restaurant does super well and is really appreciate the kind service I've received from both the manager and owner during my last visit! Their waffles with chicken is seriously the best I've had and the intense Thai flavors that burst in every bite was phenomenal! This is a must order dish! I've nevee been a huge fan of quinoa but that all changed when I had their healthy quinoa bowl! Whatever dressing they used kicked up a whole new level of deliciousness that I forgot that I'm eating healthy! It balanced well with all the carbs I was eating from the waffles dish. And let's not forget the most incredible Iced Latte with Oat milk! Holy oats! What kind of espresso beans are they using! I'm a huge fan of iced latte/coffee and drink this stuff every day! But the one I've had here is incredibly delicious! I loved it so much that I even ordered a second one! Wow! If you're like me and love coffee, try it! And tag me on IG: Missfoodaddict if you read this review and tried any of their dishes! The eggs Benedict is good but not my must order dish. I would try their avocado toast or anything from the waffle menu. They have a small patio area where you can even dine with your dog! I can't wait for their second location right across the street! It will be specialize in pasta and will named Met HIM at a bar! Oh my! The owner will be bringing his family recipe over from their main location in NYC that has been around for almost 100 years! It'll be epic and I can't wait to try their pasta made in the cheese bowl! Yummmm!! Thanks Vinny and I look forward to visiting again real soon at the new location!!"
11/11/2019,20191111,5,4.53,"Wow, so fucking good. Probably best random LA breakfast I've ever had. I got the simple ""Wake Up Happy."" It comes with scrambled eggs, bacon, and a waffle. Let me tell you, eggs = smacked. Bacon = smacked. Waffle = smackety smack smack. My friend got the breakfast burrito, and guess what, IT SMACKED. Gotta try this cute little hipster place if you haven't already."
11/11/2019,20191111,5,4.53,"Great breakfast at Met Her At A Bar... tiny dining area but definitely doable. The staff was super nice and accommodating. We ordered the waffle and lox, waffle with berries, one waffle without berries, waffletella with berries, and huevos rancheros.... absolutely delicious!!! Double shot latte, matcha tea and chamomile tea.... YUM!! We'll definitely be back to try more of the items on the menu."
11/13/2019,20191113,5,4.53,"This is a great brunch spot and pretty popular too. For a party of 6, we waited over an hour to be seated on Saturday afternoon since we had to wait for two tables to clear to be able to sit together. The hostess was apologetic, friendly, and communicative the whole time about any updates. White Truffle Toast - So much umami flavor! You taste the truffle oil with every bite. The scrambled eggs were soft and overall it flavorful and not too heavy. Fried Chicken + Waffle - This is one of my favorite chicken and waffle dish ever. Enjoyed the Thai twist on the juicy, fried chicken. Strawberry Ricotta Toast - Creamy and good if you are looking for something sweet. Liege waffles - Simple and tasty with good texture. Overall, we enjoyed our meal here. I want to come back and try the other waffle dishes. I don't recommend it for big groups though and next time I'll come earlier. Parking can be hard with no parking lot, but we managed to find free street parking on the next street over."
11/13/2019,20191113,3,4.53,"I was a little underwhelmed. The place is cute but felt really crammed. Really great people working there, good service. The decor was cute. It was packed but we only had to wait 5 minutes. I got the avocado toast. The cheese tasted weird with the avocado. And the avocado really didn't taste that fresh. Felt like it was out for a while and the portion was pretty small. Also not too many options for vegetarians. Would be nice if they offered some kind of meat substitution. Don't know if id go back but nice to try once. Waffles looked delicious."
11/13/2019,20191113,5,4.53,The food and service make the wait totally worth it! Cool brunch and lunch menu. Great coffee. Perfect waffles! Mouth watering fried chicken! From the minute you walk into this small crowded place you feel welcome and when you leave you're already planning to come back. It was a great place to treat our friends. Casual but special!
11/14/2019,20191114,4,4.53,"Wait was about an hour, during busy Sunday afternoon. Food was very delicious and came out fast."
11/14/2019,20191114,4,4.53,"This place exceeded my expectations 2 out 3 times. The first time - the food was fantastic! I found myself enjoying a dish I'd normally not order. I had the chicken and waffles and normally IF I eat chicken I'd insist on it being white meat (breast and wing) but the chicken and waffles here is dark meat. I'm glad to say I thoroughly enjoyed the Korean styles fried chicken and waffles. My sister had the one of the Benedicts I think smoked salmon and she really enjoyed.There is a wait especially on the weekends but my only complaint was ONE of the staff. The hostess. Her sass wasn't appreciated after a 45 minute wait but our server was fantastic.The second time - I ordered through postdates. Will never do again. Food was tossed all around, the waffles were soft, the slight changes in the order weren't fulfilled...I have no idea if this is the fault of the restaurant or the Postmater but it was bad enough to discourage me from ever doing delivery again.The third time - I went with a friend of mine on weekday, late morning. No wait and the food was great!"
11/15/2019,20191115,5,4.53,"This place was small, but it had a great vibe. Our food was not only nice to look at, but it tasted wonderful!"
11/16/2019,20191116,5,4.53,"Came here on a Saturday for brunch and even though there was a line (they don't take reservations), for a party of 2 we only waited for maybe 10mins and we were seated. The spot is small but pretty cute and cozy. Parking is on street (2 hrs free). We were greeted by our friendly server Nicole and she was very helpful in recommending their popular entrees. We decided on the crispy French toast, Wafflebello sandwich, matcha latte, and a regular latte. The crispy French toast was covered with a layer of bloobs and strawberries, corn flakes and Nutella. The toasts were cinnamon brioche with créme brûlée base. It was on the sweet side but the bread was soft and the berry mixture was refreshing. The wafflebello was also tasty. The waffles were airy and the portobello slices went well with the fried egg and avocado. Although it was dressed with creamy cilantro aioli it didn't give a thick and heavy feeling at all. The lattes were standard and were some good pairing to the entrees. Overall the foods were great and the friendly servers made us feel welcome. Definitely coming back again, especially after they open the pasta spot next door. It'll be called ""Met Him at a Bar""."
11/16/2019,20191116,4,4.53,"Nice chic cafe in the area! Breakfast are delicious, coffee was brewed just right! Love it all"
11/17/2019,20191117,5,4.53,OMG!!!! Delicious Delicious Delicious Eggs were amazing!!! Had Breakfast and Tempura Cauliflower!!!!
11/17/2019,20191117,5,4.53,"Bomb breakfast spot! My coworkers and I came here and we loved it. I order the waffle and lox , which is like bagels and lox but on a fresh waffle, and he ordered the wake up happy which came with a waffle eggs and sausage. All the food was delicious. The background of the owners story is too cute, thus hint the name, ""met her a bar"". Great spot!"
11/17/2019,20191117,5,4.53,I would highly recommend this place.The ambience is really good. I also liked how fast the food came out. We ordered chicken and waffles we also ordered the breakfast tacos and it was absolutely positively amazing. Very highly recommended and we will be back often
11/17/2019,20191117,5,4.53,Worth the wait food taste amazing ...didn't like the rush but still food takes all the stars
11/19/2019,20191119,3,4.53,"The restaurant is a victim of its success. There is a pile of bacon above the grill, hours old. Two slices for $4. The Huevos Rancheros are crunchy but not terribly substantial; you'll need to order more. The waffles are lukewarm having taken time for putting flowers on them and then sitting on the counter. The place clearly has lost the edge it used to have. It's still good though, just not excellent."
11/20/2019,20191120,4,4.53,"Came here for brunch while visiting LA and my mom and I had the Flinstone Waffle and the crispy French toast! Both of which were really good! The Flinstone waffle was what caught my eye from yelp and I couldn't resist! It was so tasty! A Belgian waffle topped with vanilla ice cream, fruity pebbles, strawberries, and creme brûlée sauce...like how could I not get that! I literally ate every bite! It was not overly sweet but still pleased my sweet tooth. I had a side of the chicken that would normally come with the waffle but the chicken was just ok to me. It was a little overcooked and under seasoned. My mom ordered the crispy French toast even though she was skeptical about the corn flakes but she was actually pleased with how good it was. Good brunch option."
11/20/2019,20191120,5,4.53,"Love love. The place is super cute Brian greeted and sat us, he is super friendly :) The food was delicious! Will definitely come back."
11/21/2019,20191121,4,4.53,I loved this place. Such a cute and quaint place to grab breakfast or lunch. If you're into waffles this place has a great variety of choices. It was so hard to choose. And the breakfast potatoes were so yummy. So glad it met my expectations while traveling.
11/22/2019,20191122,4,4.53,"A super solid brunch place with AMAZING waffles. For the two of us, we ordered the chicken and waffles, the waffle benedict, and the french toast. The chicken and waffles was by far my favorite dish. The chicken itself was so deliciously crunchy. It was also juicy and packed with flavor. The waffle was so and fluffy, the perfect compliment. The waffle benedict delivered as well, and was very satisfying.The french toast on the other hand was plated beautifully, but was really underwhelming. I liked the cornflake crunch. The middle of the brioche was soggy, but the crust of the brioche was super tough. Other notes:At 10am, the wait was very minimal. Street parking was not difficult at all. Service was great. Small restaurant with some outdoor seating with water bowls for the pups! Cute and trendy interior."
11/23/2019,20191123,2,4.52,"Long ass wait but the food and atmosphere is fun. Giving 2 stars because they served me burnt bacon (the kind you can't actually eat). Waiter was nice and replaced it with ...yep , more burnt bacon. I just couldn't ask a second time so I asked for some bread instead since I felt it was easier for them but I think we all know bread can't beat bacon. For the price, I'll spend a few bucks extra and luxuriate at Pump instead. They are too busy and too crowded to deliver enough value for the price. Last time they forgot my latte too. I do feel bad giving this rating but I only review to affect change."
11/24/2019,20191124,5,4.52,"Honestly, when I got there, I thought I was going to starve because there were so many people waiting. The wait was a little much especially for a larger party. But it moved pretty quickly and was SOOO WORTH IT!!!! I absolutely loved the food, people, and service. I had brought my baby and huge stroller, which can be a bit of a mission ( I don't know what I was thinking) , and the staff didn't make me feel bad at all. They helped accommodate me and my child. The owner was most helpful and sweet. Oooohhhh but the food! I had the flinstone waffles and an omelette . Holy cow! I couldn't have asked for a better breakfast! I will be back very soon.I can't wait to try their new spot "" I met HIM at a bar"" across the street, when it opens! ! ! Things to look forward to !"
11/24/2019,20191124,5,4.52,"OMG- so I don't eat meat LIKE SOOOOO MANY PEOPLE,so I tried the portobello waffle sandwich. GET IT‼‼‼‼‼‼ it was so good that I felt guilty leaving and going to work because I just KNEWWWW nobody at work was as filled and satisfied as I was walking in there . Loved the service and would definitely go back."
11/25/2019,20191125,5,4.52,"Guh the friend chicken and waffles.... So delish! We were a group of five and waited about 45 mins for a table on a Sunday afternoon. The staff were super friendly and very attentive, our waters were always full. I have the chicken and waffles with Alfredo and it was yummy! The chicken was crispy outside and moist inside. The waffles light and fluffy, and the Alfredo sauce added an additional savory-ness to the dish. When an ordered dish was forgotten, server was quick to get the replacement delivered. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food and enjoyed the ambiance there. I will defo be back to try more things on the menu!"
11/25/2019,20191125,5,4.52,"Stopped here for brunch after deciding my husband and I decided to do something spontaneous and watch the sunrise in Santa Monica (for point of reference we live in Fullerton) We were on the way to look at homes in the Los Angeles area at the time with our real estate agent and we had some time to kill. At 8:30 AM on a Sunday morning there was no wait. We were promptly seated, waters came quickly and they were pleasantly attentive. We ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles along with a Truffle Egg Scramble Toast. Wishing we had room to try other things but we had just picked up some donuts nearby which we had snacked on.The fried chicken and waffles was great! Warm on the inside while have a great crunchy texture on the exterior. The waffles were similarly well done as they put all the syrup on the side it doesn't leave any room for the course to be soaked through upon the time it's poured on to the time it reaches your table. (Which I've seen done at other restaurants). The truffle toast although seemingly simple in nature was our favorite! The egg scramble was delicious as they were fluffy although not so transparent in texture that substance was lost. The truffle taste wasn't overwhelming and was a nice additive to the dish. The overall ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and homey, not overly trendy and inviting.Would come back as the service was superior and the food was delectable."
11/25/2019,20191125,5,4.53,"We're here visiting from Phoenix for the weekend and all I wanted was a good chicken and waffle meal. And at this place, we hit the jackpot! I've eaten chicken and waffles from coast to coast and this is by far my favorite yet! The garlic parmesan gravy was just the icing on the cake. The chicken was so crispy and yet so juicy! My only disappointment is that I got full and couldn't finish all of it. I know that for the waffle to was very crisp and done to perfection. The vibe in here is very quaint and comfortable. I will definitely come back here again next time I visit."
11/25/2019,20191125,5,4.53,I've watched as this neighborhood restaurant has evolved into the spot attracting people looking for great food at a fair price. The offering on the menu include unique spins on some traditional dishes that are beyond satisfying. There is a very eclectic group of folks always present in a very warm hip setting. The only downside there is that as its popularity continues to soar so will the line waiting to get in.
11/26/2019,20191126,5,4.53,So I love this place. I come here a couple times a month just for the Thai omelet which is so good. Like SO GOOD. I love it with the sriracha and jasmine rice and just it is really good okay? Okay.Anyways service is always really prompt and fast and friendly. They're very busy on weekend (understandably) this is a great fast-service brunch spot. The place is small so you aren't meant to linger and that's okay! The environment can be loud so it's best to eat the yummy yummy food and then enjoy what LA has to offer outside. During the week during Normal breakfast/lunch hours it is easier to stay a little longer. It's a bit quieter. I wouldn't suggest people bring laptops or work meetings here - this is a place to enjoy yummy YUMMY waffles and toasts and omelets. Just enjoy the great food and kind service. Recently tried the strawberry ricotta toast and have to say it is also a must try. Perfect
11/26/2019,20191126,5,4.53,"This place is cute and filled with so many delicious looking dishes! My server was also super nice! While I was waiting I caught myself eyeballing everyone else's food thinking maybe I ll get that next time.As for my food... I ordered the crispy French toast with Nutella and berries (no whip), side of bacon, and a mimosa. It was ready much faster than I expected and it was SO good! All the while I enjoyed my book, just sat and relaxed. Eventually when I was done eating I wanted more, no not because I was hungry but because my first dish was amazing. Yes, I had just come from the gym. Ha! Anyways, ordered a side of potatoes, more bacon, and another mimosa. Yum! I will be back for more. Oh yes!"
11/26/2019,20191126,5,4.53,The best breakfast and brunch places I've ever been to. It's located on the corner of la Brea an eighth Street. I highly recommend this spot. It's hard to find a good spot around these days.
11/27/2019,20191127,4,4.53,"Heard so much about this place and was and still am excited for the brother shop opening up next year . Half way through my delicious meal I, i was appreciating the attention to detail on my latte coffee mug when I noticed lip stick left by the previous patron . Turned my stomach a little. They replaced it when I brought it to the attention of what looked him tHe owner or nearest host. The setting was beautiful and it was a fast paced environment but the wait wasn't long to get inside during lunch hour . I'll wait for the brother"
11/28/2019,20191128,5,4.53,Amazing food options. The staff are SO SWEET. Even on thanksgiving everyone is smiling and friendly. I can hear them thanking each other which is amazing. Really warm friendly environment. Gluten free waffles is definitely a plus. We sat at the bar and could watch all the food coming out. Everything looked delicious.Wait is worth it guys. Really I'm so happy with everything. Can't say enough how warm and friendly everyone was. We will be back!
11/29/2019,20191129,4,4.53,"Great brunch spot that specializes in waffles, but be prepared for hour-long waits on the weekends.Surprisingly for me, I was in the mood for a savory meal when I came here for brunch, and the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito was calling my name, so I opted for that. It was absolutely delicious, and I was surprised by how much chorizo and bacon they stuffed in there--it was mostly meat and eggs, which I appreciated. It came with a small fruit salad that was mostly melon, which was fine. The burrito was pretty substantial; if you have a large appetite you could probably finish the whole thing in one go, but I found it to last about 1.5 meals for me. The waffles looked tasty, and I'll have to try one next time.They close the Yelp waitlist remote check in during brunch so you have to go to the restaurant to put your name down. We ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table and walked around a bit to pass the time, but there isn't anything particularly interesting in the area. Overall, it's a great place for brunch as it offers a unique menu that highlights a variety of waffle dishes. The interior is cute and quaint, and service was friendly throughout our meal. I'm looking to go back!"
11/29/2019,20191129,5,4.53,"I wish I could give Met Her At A Bar 6 stars! This place is more than just a restaurant, it's a community. I am so lucky to live so close that I can come to this gem often! The owners Vinny and Mindy have created a dining experience that can't be topped. From the impeccable service, amazing food, and loving environment, Met Her At A Bar is hands down my favorite place to eat and a must if I have out of town company! This is the first place I take everybody. The customer service here is unbelievable. Even on the busiest days the workers are so pleasant and personable, attentive and just so dang nice! It's so refreshing than most experiences in LA! My go to breakfast item is the Wake Up Happy and it never fails to be perfectly prepared each time. The way the owners are so involved shows how much love goes into this place. I don't think I have ever been here and not witness the owners there making sure everyone is happy! Their story and success is so inspiring and something we can all learn from! Thank you, Vinny and Mindy for putting your heart and hardwork into this place, it does not go unnoticed and I'll be a forever customer!"
11/29/2019,20191129,5,4.53,"The staff were friendly and accommodating. Service was fast, food was good and reasonably priced. The vibe was chill and would definitely return with my family when visiting LA."
11/30/2019,20191130,4,4.53,Cute spot but bad parking. We shall return though! Great location and location is key. Friendly bartenders. We appreciate you guys!
11/30/2019,20191130,5,4.53,Delicious!!! The waffles with Nutella is a must. We stopped here for breakfast and ordered the breakfast sandwich with avocado... wow.... incredible. The mimosa was the best we've ever had. Freshly squeezed orange juice with champagne- what else can you ask for. You need to come over here.
11/30/2019,20191130,5,4.53,"Wow wow wow. Came here for brunch on a saturday in LA and left so impressed. First of all, we only waited for about 20 minutes which was great for peak brunch time on a weekend.Once we were seated, we got to see that the atmosphere is very trendy while still feeling cozy. The service was amazing and so fast! I'm not kidding when I say our entire table of 4 received our food within 10 minutes of ordering it, we were so impressed. Now let's get to the food, YUM! I personally had the truffle toast, it was so good I could have it every day for breakfast. I also got to try the fruity waffle, fried chicken waffle, and portabello waffle sandwich. Everything I tried was fantastic and I wish I lived closer because I would be here every weekend. Also had an oat milk latte and the coffee was delicious. Lastly, the story of the restaurant is very sweet, love supporting a wholesome small business. Next time i'm in LA you know where I'll be brunching :)"
11/30/2019,20191130,1,4.52,A good restaurant would not do the following 1) stick their customers with a hidden health care fee that's added to the bill without consent 2) stick automatic 20% gratuity onto bill3) return for signature asking customers if they'd like to add a tip AFTER already including 20% tip into the bill. 4) rushing customers out by dropping the bill on the table while still eatingThis is bad service delivery even though we considered the server 'nice'For an idea of the full cost of your meal add 50% to the posted prices.
11/30/2019,20191130,2,4.52,Overrated brunch spot. The fried chicken is great. The waffles (the most significant dish in the restaurant) is not good. The waffles are soft and not warm--it must have been sitting there for a while before it got served. Do not recommend
11/30/2019,20191130,5,4.52,"Breakfast at any time, YES PLEASE! The wait was extremely decent, the staff super friendly, and the ambience garden escape beautiful. The food came fast and it was a burst of breakfast heaven and berries in your mouth. The waffles are so good seems like any combination ordered was perfect. I dont know who met who at what bar but this place is a must have!"
12/1/2019,20191201,4,4.52,"Hipster, instagram worthy restaurant. Met Her At A Bar is located on the corner of La Brea Ave and Eighth Street. There is no dedicated parking lot but there's plenty of parking meters which are $2 for 2 hours. There's usually long lines so plan on coming in early. The interior is unique and nice casual restaurant. My friends and I came for brunch. They serve amazing breakfast. The biggest complaint is their portion size. I ordered Waffles and Berries and it was $13. It was a single waffle with sliced strawberry and blueberry on top. Presentation is 10 out of 10 but really pricey for what we get. Food was pretty good and I would recommend coming here for having an elegant breakfast. Wouldn't come here if you're really hungry. For a party of 6 or more people, they add gratuity tip automatically."
12/2/2019,20191202,4,4.52,Everything here looks amazing. I had the fried pesto pannini. It was great! Coffee is also very good and strong. Parking is a little difficult. But great place! They still had brunch at 2pm on a Monday
12/3/2019,20191203,5,4.52,Reviews say it all. Amazing food and service; I ate soo much that's how delicious food was! And they have a cute simple setting.
12/3/2019,20191203,5,4.52,"One of the best breakfast spots ever! Wish the space was bigger, but we love it there. Keep up the best breakfast and service, so fun to go."
12/3/2019,20191203,4,4.52,Great hole in the wall brunch spot! Good variety of options and everything tasted fantastic! Gave it 4 stars only due to long wait times with very limited seating and waiting space. Will definitely be back to give it another try!
12/4/2019,20191204,4,4.52,"Ordered the waffle Benedict and crunchy French toast. I'd say that the French toast was not as crunchy as I was expecting it to be, but still tasted alright. The waffle Benedict should be eaten right away because it can get pretty soggy. I would like to try out some other items in their menu the next time I come in here. These two dishes were good but not something I will have a craving for. The orange juice is freshly squeezed which is always refreshing. Cute and modern decor. The servers were great, checking in on us pretty often making sure everything is okay.Street parking wasn't too difficult to find during the weekday, I'm sure the weekends are a different story."
12/4/2019,20191204,5,4.52,"Really great service! Nice and genuine employees.Food was ok, nothing to go crazy about, but I would still go back."
12/6/2019,20191206,5,4.52,Great service and amazing food! Came here when it opened on a Wednesday morning with some friends. Our waiter (wish I could remember his name!) was very welcoming and helped us decide what to eat. We ended up sharing the crispy French toast (yummm) and I got the Thai chicken & waffle. Highly recommend the Thai chicken & waffle - so many different flavors in one dish! Everyone else enjoyed their food as well. Extra bonus points for the artwork they displayed on the wall. Definitely will come again!
12/6/2019,20191206,5,4.52,"Literally, just left this amazing gem in the wall. I ordered a Matcha Latte with Oat Milk, & The Waffle Eggs Benedict. I was very satisfied the way everything was. The waffles weren't over cooked, and the service was fast. If I could give them 6 stars I would, and this was only my first time here. Definitely coming back soon."
12/7/2019,20191207,5,4.52,"Came here during a busy hour, the service was quick and the service was great! My food came out really fast. Loved the Flintstones waffle! It's perfect for people with a sweet tooth. The matcha latte was also good, just wished that there was a little stronger matcha taste to it."
12/8/2019,20191208,5,4.52,"The food was amazing! Everything we ordered was delicious! Normally there's a really long wait but the wait wasn't bad at all. My friend and I split the waffle fries, strawberry Ricotta toast, and chicken and waffle. Would def wait in line and go again for brunch."
12/8/2019,20191208,4,4.52,"This place is pretty good. Waffles are great with crispy edges, creamy scrambled eggs and perfectly cooked bacon. Space is small and there is a wait but the line moves fast. Conversation is minimal because it's very loud inside but no need to talk with your mouth full of deliciousness."
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.52,"A few of TSG's own The Food Dudes came through before our KYCC volunteer event and man it did NOT disappoint!We got there around 9 and it was already packed! Thankfully, the colder weather kept everyone seated inside, so we were able to get a table outside for the 3 of us. We got our order taken and the food came out in literally 10-15 minutes. Talk about speedy service!I ordered the Chicken and waffle Thai style with a side of Truffle waffle fries, and the boys ordered the waffle benedict and crispy french toast. We also got a bottle of the rose cuz we're basic like that. Everything we ordered was amazing, but my chicken and waffle was the star. Juicy chicken with chopped peppers and the sambal sauce with syrup made for such great flavors. I'll definitely be back to try more things!!"
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.52,"I've been meaning to try this place for ages and I'm glad I finally did. It's a cozy little spot on the corner of La Brea and 8th Street. I came here on a Saturday morning before noon and there was a small wait. We grabbed a menu as we waited so we were ready to order upon being seated. All the items on the menu have really cute ""lovey-dovey"" names which revolves around the story of how the restaurant came about. For food, I ordered the Eggs Benedict. You get an option of breakfast potatoes or a salad. I chose the breakfast potatoes The eggs benedict was made so perfectly I practically inhaled it. I definitely can't wait to come back here again. There were so many options on the menu and I wished I could've tried them all at once."
12/9/2019,20191209,1,4.52,"This place had great reviews, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. I looked at the menu and was all prepared to dig in to a delicious meal, until I saw the over abundance of four legged patrons mingling among the people. When I saw a dog sitting on the seats that are designated for people, AND leaning over the table, I had enough. Bringing your dog along doesn't mean that they should be on the table and/or chairs designated for human patrons. Obviously some people are ok with this, but for people who prefer to dine with other humans only, just say no. We ended up going directly across the street to the Commerson and had a fabulous meal."
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.52,"Amazing food. Intimate atmosphere. Packed on thanksgiving morning. Blooming tea is an awesome experience. Great mimosa. Chicken sandwich I would recommend Pesto sandwhich is great, strong on the pesto Staff was very friendly even if it was super hectic"
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.52,"Their vanilla latte with oat is one of the best I have had! Especially when getting it along with Wake Up Happy. The waffle was so soft and the berries were super fresh, it was perfect!"
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.52,"Second time here for breakfast Amazing service. The food is always delicious and the waiters are always polite and ready to help. It's a great place to have breakfast and have conversations, cozy place. Make reservations especially on saturdays as it gets busy. Sunday's are better in my opinion."
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.52,"Great place, awesome food! The story behind it all is cool too. I had the chorizo toast, finally something different."
12/10/2019,20191210,5,4.52,"Bougie little brunch spot with great service, and has wine/beer and mimosas. Parking is street-side only, but Sundays the meters are free.I really liked their Eggs Benedict Waffle, which replaces the normally stale bread for a delicious waffle that soaks up the amazing yolk. They also have a great Strawberry toast which was surprisingly filling for its size. Also tried their sweet potato fries which were solid.Overall a great spot to try in LA for a nice brunch. The waitress we had was super attentive, despite us being on the patio which I feel notoriously gets ignored at most places."
12/10/2019,20191210,5,4.52,"This is such a great brunch spot. I love breakfast and my Bf is more of a lunch type guy so this restaurant was perfect! The service was excellent, the restaurant was clean, the staff were all very friendly. We will deff return."
12/10/2019,20191210,2,4.52,"Meh.... really long lines usually mean amazing food. There was an hour wait for brunch. The wait did move along quickly. However, I didn't receive what I ordered and they didn't serve regular French toast without Nutella. When I finally convinced them to make it,the French toast Was extremely dry. The place is a cute little vibe though."
12/11/2019,20191211,5,4.52,Yummmmmmm!!Omg everything we ordered for my daughters birthday was delicious! Their chorizo burrito sooooo delicious! The breakfast tacos and fresh waffles!! Wow! Love the staff and super cute space to eat!
12/11/2019,20191211,5,4.52,"Great for brunch, although the wait can be a minute. GREAT food, though! Wish there was more room inside!"
12/11/2019,20191211,5,4.52,Amazing food!! Went a couple days ago with my boyfriend and it was amazing. I personally loved the chia berries overnight oats and so did my boyfriend. The service was fantastic and everyone was on top of their game. First time and won't be my last :)
12/12/2019,20191212,5,4.52,"All of them were good. This picture was only half of our order! The truffle fries were my favorite! Check out this place's story too, very cute."
12/12/2019,20191212,5,4.52,Get the thai chicken and waffles. Don't ask why. Just get it. It's the best chicken and waffles you will eat in your life. I had this on a date and it blew my mind as well as my girlfriend's.
12/14/2019,20191214,5,4.52,"This buzzing cafe is right around the corner from our new place and we're thrilled about it. I went two mornings in a row and was not disappointed. The staff is so welcoming and kind, such warm vibes in this place. The decor is great and makes it really inviting inside. There's both indoor and outdoor seating and we didn't wait long for a table either time we came here. The food is very vegan friendly, with wraps, avo toast, waffles, and salads being just a few of the incredibly tasty items you'll find on the menu. One thing to note is that they don't allow laptops between 11am-2pm but I enjoyed the tech free environment. I've had a black bean hummus wrap and avocado toast - both were good. The prices are fair and similar to other cafes in the area. I'm excited to try more things on the menu here! The story behind the cafe is so sweet and I love that it represents something bigger than a cafe. Safe to say this is my new coffee spot."
12/14/2019,20191214,3,4.52,"I've driven past this place a couple of times, and always saw a crowd waiting! Finally got a chance to try, but I don't think it was worth the hype. I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich, it was okay, could definitely use more flavor. My latte and the service were great though! Friendly staff and okayish food."
12/14/2019,20191214,5,4.52,"Wow! Where do I start. First time here, and let me say, the food was DELICIOUS!!!!! I had the breakfast egg and chorizo burrito and it was yummy!!!!! My wife had the chicken club sandwich (substituted with crispy chicken), and it was very juicy and amazing! We will definitely stop by here again, the wait is worth it."
12/14/2019,20191214,5,4.52,Cool place with a cool story. Really good coffee and breakfast! I highly recommend! Oh...and the wait time was crazy ;) popular spot for sure!
12/15/2019,20191215,5,4.52,"Wait is long. Small and crowded. No parking, However, it's definitely worth it. There aren't many places as unique as this one.Waffles, coffee and a taste of asian flavor! Especially Thai! And who doesn't like Thai food? Food is great. Prices averages about $10-12 more or less. Portions are generous to the customer. Server provided good customer service. Great attitude during a very busy and hectic time. My girlfriends and I went for the first time and our bellies were very very happy!"
12/15/2019,20191215,5,4.52,"The wait sucks, but the food is phenomenal. I hope they are able to get a bigger location soon."
12/16/2019,20191216,5,4.52,"Went there on the morning of Thanksgiving and the place was bustling with people! Got my party of 2 on the waitlist and we were seated an hour later at the kitchen bar. We ordered the Crispy French Toast and the Avocado Toast and boy were they delicious! - The French Toast was thinner than the traditional ones, topped with Nutella and berries - SO DELICIOUS - Avocado toast was on sourdough and parmesan on top. I would have loved it if the quantity was bigger because it wasn't filling enough. Both the dishes were beautifully plated. We also ordered the cappuccino and latte. By the time, I got my latte, it was cold. I didn't want to send it back because we had a flight to catch. The hype is real! The service is great and so is the food. Just make sure you add yourself to the waitlist on the Yelp App to avoid waiting outside for a long time."
12/16/2019,20191216,5,4.52,We really enjoy this spot. The service is superb and the food is pretty amazing too. Seating is a little tight but you can't have everything right. Today our server was Joseph and from the time he greeted us until we left he was warm a accommodating. Great spot is you haven't checked it out you should do yourself the favor. We can for the first time about a month ago and my wife couldn't wait to come back.
12/17/2019,20191217,5,4.53,"Incredibly lovely brunch on a weekday. Had the Waffle Benedict, love the hollandaise sauce and do recommend. My friend had the chicken & waffles, it's Thai style chicken and worth it. I plan to order this myself next time I come. Thanks for the great service and great meal."
12/18/2019,20191218,5,4.53,"Absolutely amazing, the Thai style chicken is beyond tasty! Have already been back couple times."
12/20/2019,20191220,4,4.53,"My Girlfriend and I are regular Brunch-ers. Today we stumbled across ""Met Her At A Bar"" because we drive by all the time. We both agree this place is wonderful. It wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. The atmosphere is a little small but we sat inside and it felt like we were outside, given it was a lovely day. The drinks were spot on. The OJ tasted SO fresh and tangy yet had no pulp which was a pleasant surprise. The food was great, we ordered the chorizo toast and a waffle florentine. Like an eggs florentine but on a waffle which isnt on the menu but they were happy to make it. The chorizo had the bread a little too soft but aside from that we loved it. Definitely will be back again because the options all looked too good."
12/20/2019,20191220,5,4.53,Saw the reviews on yelp and thought had to come! Amazing place and great service! A must if your in this area.
12/20/2019,20191220,5,4.53,"Good service, food was amazing. Honestly first time here and I'm for sure returning again."
12/21/2019,20191221,4,4.53,"Nice place for brunch with many different options. A little pricey but it is on La Brea so that's a given. At least parking isn't a big issue since you can park on the residential streets. Can be a long wait after noon but we came in around 10ish and just waited for 10 min for an inside table. I had the waffle Benedict which was something out of my comfort zone but it looked and tasted great. You can substitute the ham for turkey bacon or avocado which are some good options so I opted for the turkey bacon. It was kinda too salty imo so next time I'll just get the avocado and there will be a next time, I assure you. Minus one star for the dirty glasses and a bit too crowded and loud for me so early in the morning."

12/22/2019,20191222,4,4.52,"My friend and I came for lunch, arrived around 10:45 and seated around 11:30, though I was expecting that length of wait time. Once we sat, our waiter arrived within a few minutes with water and ask for our drink orders. The mocha latte I had was not as sweet as I expected, which was a nice surprise. The mimosas were very refreshing! I ordered the Waffle Benedict - it was the first thing on the menu that caught my eye - and not only did our food come surprisingly quick, but it did not disappoint. The waffle was so super fluffy and fresh. The only issue I had with my meal was my hunger: I wolfed my food down without really enjoying the taste because I was so hungry! If I come again I'll be sure to eat a snack beforehand. The breakfast potatoes were, unfortunately, kind of bland. Overall there was nothing outstanding about my meal here - perhaps the most average brunch I've had, but I've heard nothing but raving reviews about this restaurant, so I suppose I was a bit biased."
12/22/2019,20191222,5,4.53,"The food is delicious. The service is good.There is a waiting list but that's because this place is really good. Parking is a hit or miss so, make sure you plan that out prior to arriving. Enjoy!"
12/22/2019,20191222,5,4.53,Amazing! Got the mushroom waffle sandwich (don't remember the name) and it was honestly the best breakfast item I think I've ever had. Highly recommend it! Also tried the strawberry ricotta toast and Thai iced tea which was delicious. In love with this spot
12/22/2019,20191222,3,4.52,"This was my second time here. The first time was pretty good, the second time not so good: Definitely expect a long wait. I came with one other person and we waited 37 minutes to be seated at a table with food crumbs on it. The people next to us also had a dirty table. It's like they're so busy they don't take the time to clean up. For my meal, I got the waffle Benedict- sub smoked salmon Instead of ham. My friend got the waffle breakfast sandwich. My food came out about 20 minutes after we sat. They forgot my friends meal so I notified my server and she had to wait an additional 15 minutes for her food. By the time she finally got her food i was practically done my meal. Her sandwich was bland and room temperature (I tasted it myself). We spent $45 on a sub par experience. Save your money and time and go somewhere else"
12/22/2019,20191222,5,4.52,Great breakfast menu! Went here 2 days in a row and it gets packed so plan ahead to make your reservation!
12/23/2019,20191223,4,4.52,"We came here on a Saturday morning for brunch so needless to say, it was very crowded. For a group of 4, we waited approximately 45-60min. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles knowing that this is what this brunch place is known for, but I also wanted to try the matcha waffle. They were able to switch out the waffle with an additional charge. And my fiancé got the breakfast burrito.The fried chicken one of the best fried chicken I have had. I don't like super crunchy crispy fried chicken and this was at the perfect point of crispy while being very tender and moist on the inside. The Thai-inspired flavor was also very unique take on the traditional fried chicken and waffle and was delicious. The matcha waffle was also good but it didn't amaze me. The flavor was good and wasn't too sweet but the outside of the waffle seemed a little too soggy from the cream added on top. We also had drinks as well but just FYI, they only serve beer and wine. Overall, I would come back again for the chicken and waffles but probably would not at such a busy time."
12/23/2019,20191223,5,4.52,Visiting LA and had breakfast at Meet Her At The Bar. Added my name to the waitlist on yelp and was seated quickly when we arrived. The restaurant was small but intimate. We are ordered the crunchy French toast which was amazing it had good flavor crunchiness fresh strawberries and blueberries and an added special touch with the greens and flower petals. We also ordered the Nutella French toast which was really delicious with fresh strawberries and bananas. We also had a breakfast platter with eggs and all the fixings. I enjoyed this place so much that we had to come back for a second visit before we left LA. This time I ordered the Webbles rancheros which were really really delicious. It was a simple entrée but presentation made it better. And of course we had to get a second round of the crispy French toast. I highly recommend this place if you are in the LA area.
12/23/2019,20191223,4,4.52,"3.5 stars.I went here for a first date a while back which was super appropriate given this cute little cafe's name. There's a whole story detailing it on the menu, which is an adorable touch. :) Do note though that this place is TINY -- there's an assemblage of small tables outside & seating inside, but the crowd had definitely overwhelmed the space. We ended up waiting for around 20-30 minutes, which we killed by checking out the nearby thrift store and looking at tsotchkes. The food is good! I had french toast, and it was super yummy -- perfect for the sweet tooth in your life (hey, maybe it's you). They also have a variety of savory breakfast items as well. The fried chicken was a stand-out!"
12/23/2019,20191223,1,4.52,"The wait was long, the food was average and overpriced, and the restaurant itself was crowded/cramped. Definitely NOT worth the wait. On top of that I left my ring and none of the workers made an effort to find it. My husband and I called twice and no one was helpful. I wouldn't be surprised if one of them found it since they were trying to blame the busboys (how racist btw) Jokes on whoever tries to pawn it, but it's fucked because that ring had sentimental value to me. Good luck with the Karma coming your way."
12/23/2019,20191223,5,4.52,"Expect a wait, and expect it to be well worth it. Superb brunch fare - and great service too. Extremely busy even on a Monday morning, but the food was spectacular."
12/24/2019,20191224,5,4.52,"The food is delicious. The service is good.There is a waiting list but that's because this place is really good. Parking is a hit or miss so, make sure you plan that out prior to arriving."
12/25/2019,20191225,4,4.52,"Came here for brunch and the service was somewhat slow. My coffee didn't come until midway through my meal and I had to inquire about it again. Other than that, the food was great! I got the waffles with sausage, eggs, and bacon. The eggs were delicious and so was the waffle! Their caramel latte was delicious too!"
12/26/2019,20191226,4,4.52,"Tasty enough food for a trendy place, sufficient street parking, and the wait, while no fun, aren't awful.Main knock is the portions, the waffles feel like they're about half the size they should be... which is probably better for the waistline but means it doesn't seem like a good value. Protein portions, by comparison, were ample.Unlike some of their competition, where you're clearly paying to be seen, Met Her at a Bar doesn't rise to that level of obvious snobbery, and that's a point in their favor."
12/26/2019,20191226,5,4.52,"This location has the best customer service I have ever experienced while eating out! I felt very welcomed, as if I was in my own home. The food was also delicious! My breakfast was absolutely perfect. Definitely coming back."
12/27/2019,20191227,5,4.52,"Came here for brunch, and it was amazing! We were lucky to not wait in line because we checked in on yelp when we were almost there. We were seated right away and was attended by our server the second after. She was very helpful and helped us decide to get one dish or two. We wanted to share so we got the French toast and waffle Benedict. I was expecting the waffle to get saggy with the Benedict, but it did not! Everything was well seasoned, and the waffle was not sweet at all that would override the eggs and sauce. On the other hand, the French toast was also so tasty! It was creme brûlée based so I didn't feel like I needed the maple syrup but it was just the right amount of sweetness. Would definitely come back again and try other items!"
12/27/2019,20191227,5,4.52,"very cute story behind this place, and the food was fun and delicious! added ourselves to the waitlist on the drive over and got seated pretty quickly. We shared the breakfast burrito and the french toast and both were delicious. The atmosphere was light and happy and the staff were very nice and attentive!"
12/28/2019,20191228,4,4.52,"I came here for brunch with a friend and was super lucky to find close street parking. The wait was a bit long and they even said that we could go to their 2nd restaurant next door (called Met HIM at the Bar!) since there was no wait and it was a soft opening. We decided to stick to this one and it was worth it.The seating is really close and cozy but their service is amazing. There's someone to quickly take our orders, refill our waters and take away plates and trash. My friend got the Wafflebello and I got the Fried Chicken and Waffles. I really like the waffle! So I recommend getting any of their waffle dishes. The fried chicken was good but I wanted more of a kick from the Thai seasoning. Maybe they should offer levels of spice on the chicken? Either way, the chicken tender was moist and not dry at all. I like the chicken and waffle combo. The story of the owners is super cute too lol"
12/28/2019,20191228,5,4.52,"Truly a delightful breakfast. Eggs Florentine, vegan waffle with Nutella, drip coffee, avocado toast. Great, friendly service, delicious food, good portions. Will certainly be back."
12/29/2019,20191229,3,4.52,"I know Sunday at 11 is a peak time but I didn't mind putting my name down and going on a walk. However, for over an hour wait, the portions were not very satisfying. For the price, breakfast plates should come with potatoes!Staff was very friendly though. They're opened a second location across the street? Probably wouldn't come back."
12/29/2019,20191229,4,4.52,"Decided to try a new breakfast spot and opted for here based on the reviews. This is definitely a busy spot, even for 9:00am, which is pretty early for most  people of LA. We put our name is and waited maybe ten minutes. If you have a big group you will definitely be waiting longer as the inside is very small. They run pretty efficiently for the small space. A few different servers brought us our food and cleared us as soon as we were finished. I got the crunchy French roast and boyfriend got the fruity pebbles waffle with ice cream. Fruity pebbles waffle was good but he needed it to have some more ice cream and said if the fruity pebbles were in the actual waffle batter it would be better. My crunchy French toast was astetically pleasing but it did not have as much crunch as I was hoping for, flavor was fine. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but for the crowd and cramped tables I don't know if we will return. Great spot to try and snap some pics of your food but not memorable enough for us personally."
12/30/2019,20191230,4,4.52,"This is a very popular brunch place, and I think it's worth a wait of 20-30 minutes, but I wouldn't wait more than that - especially if you can come back during off-peak hours. It's a small-ish place, so seating is a bit tight. You can definitely hear the conversations of people sitting next to you. Service is very friendly, but it can become slow when they're busy. Food is the best part, and I have had a variety of dishes that have all been very yummy. The waffle eggs benedict was a great combo of sweet and savory. Their wraps are filling and fresh. Some of their dishes are Thai-influenced, so it adds a nice twist to the typical brunch dishes that you usually find at other places. It's quickly becoming a very trendy brunch place to try, so I'd add it to your list if you're in the area. Parking: street, metered. I usually park across the street at metered parking on La Brea."
12/31/2019,20191231,5,4.52,"A bit of a wait time, however soo worth the wait!! The service was AMAZING! & The food was even better! I will definitely be back to try more food from this restaurant! I highly recommend checking this place out!!"
12/31/2019,20191231,5,4.52,Very friendly staff and amazing atmosphere. The service is quick and the matcha with oat milk was incredible. I didn't have time to eat here but the menu was outstanding and those around me had food that looked incredible. I look forward to coming back here and trying more things on the menu.
12/31/2019,20191231,5,4.52,It's a pretty small place but honestly it's worth the wait! The food is so good and honestly it's just a cute back story to the place as well
1/1/2020,20200101,2,4.52,We made reservations through yelp and were pretty excited. When we got there it was total chaos. People waiting outside all over the place and people funneling in and out. We checked in and only had to wait about 15 min. During the time took a look at the food people were eating and began to lose my excitement. It looked like frozen food. Then they tried to place our party at the bar by the sink and kitchen. Not a great spot. We decided that the food didn't look good enough for us to sit in the sink to eat at this place. I wasn't impressed. Place is tiny and cramped
1/1/2020,20200101,1,4.51,"My New Year's Day was ruined by this place. I always pass it and wanted to give it a shot. I got on the yelp waitlist and checked in when told to check in. Once we checked in. the guy at the front said it will be another 20 minutes. I didn't mind waiting the 20 minutes. Once we got the text we immediately went to the front for our table. To our surprise they gave us a seat a this dingy bar all the way in the back where the food is prepared! Literally where they make drinks and all the employees are talking and getting orders ready. Why would I want sit in a cramped back area? By this point we have waited over an hour since I got on the waitlist. Then the hostess is making no effort to see why we would not want to sit there. There were empty two tops but she said they were for the party of 8. So annoyed at this point, then one of the bus boys says to us ""if you don't want the ""table"" go stand over there"" so rude for no reason. In the end left and never coming back. I see this place has amazing reviews but if you go and look at the bad reviews there are plenty and I'm glad I didn't spend my money here. Stupid place. I waited over an hour for a TABLE not the fake bar/kitchen area."
1/2/2020,20200102,4,4.51,"Upon walking in very over crowded Place (waiting list) and it was 9am on a Saturday. 12/21/2019I and My Date opted to sit Facing the Window towards the Crosswalk. (That is all they had)****No PARKING*****And no Parking near by either which sucks! And you have to have do some what of a walk , constant ibtirns, waiting for cars to move etc. and also a Parking sticker/Permit is needed to park on the Residential street.We got ice Waters Right away, the waitress was Extremely Nice . We opted to Both get something from the Menu without letting out other partner know and though this is absurd the waitress was in on it as well. I ordered the Omlette with Potatoes.And he ordered me the Eggs Benedict with Potatoes.He absolutely scored on what I where to order of the Menu , I not so well - A Burrito? Lol We weren't Rushed to leave, even after we had a long talk and just enjoyed the Ambience.(over 2 hours)Customer Service****(4)Food***(4)Location**(2)Ambience/Noise Level ****(4)-Pretty LoudI'd be back..."
1/2/2020,20200102,5,4.51,Every time I would pass by this place I would see a long line. Finally decided to go and check this place out. Ordered the chicken and waffles and it was the best waffle I've ever tried. The chicken was also so full of flavor and crispy on the outside. Just amazing. I can't wait to go back! The wait was not very long at all but I would not mind waiting in line for this place. Very impressed with the service and the food.
1/2/2020,20200102,5,4.51,"Finally made my way to Met Her at a Bar after having this bookmarked for a year! I ordered the Chicken and Waffle as recommended by all the other reviews, so I had high expectations. It was delicious! Dare I say it may be one of the best Chicken and Waffle dishes I've ever had. The chicken was crispy and flavorful. It was fried with basil leaves, so I had a few crispy basil leaves left on my dish. The waffle was perfectly crispy (I hate soggy waffles) and airy, just the way I like it. This place gets packed, so come early. I'm looking forward to returning and trying the other items on their menu."
1/3/2020,20200103,5,4.51,"After just one visit, I can easily say that Met Her At A Bar will be included in my regular rotation of brunch/lunch spots! I went with two buddies to grab a late afternoon brunch around 1:30pm. Parking nearby wasn't bad at all. The restaurant was pretty packed, inside and outside, and upon entering we were directed to sign up for the live Yelp waitlist which told us approx. 8-18mins. We were promptly seated within 10 minutes! I ordered the Waffles and Berries, and my friends ordered the American Breakfast with a side of home fries (a side is included) and the Grain Bowl Lunch with chicken. I got a hot caramel latte and my friend ordered a regular iced latte. Everything was DELICIOUS. We ended up sharing everything and none of us were disappointed. I'm more of a French Toast girl because I usually find waffles dry, but damn this one blew me away! Fluffy, tasty, and just the right portion. I'd say my second favorite was the Grain Bowl -- it's clean, tasty, fresh and the flavor profile is perfect. Great lunch option for $11 that'll leave you feeling way more satisfied than chipotle. I'd recommend coming early since they close at 4pm and it's a very small space. But nice ambiance and right in my neighborhood. Thanks, Met Her At A Bar!"
1/3/2020,20200103,5,4.51,"Crazy delicious! Prefect morning atmosphere! Cute love story, go here! I ordered tHe waffle portobello sandwich and I enjoyed it yes! My friend got the Thai chicken and waffles and the was the best chicken and waffles I have EVER TASTED!!!"
1/4/2020,20200104,5,4.52,"WOW this place is so underrated! Prior to my trip to southern california, I googled ""popular brunch places in LA"" and ofc only places like Blu Jam and Urth came up. On the last day in town, this place popped up on Yelp since it was only a few minutes from my airbnb and boy was I glad it did!The pictures of their french toast really sold me. I'm glad what came out really did look like the pictures. The french toast were indeed crunchy and sweet on its on. If your sweet tooth is rlly going at it, then you can dip your toast in the syrup but you definitely do not need the syrup since it is already pretty sweet. My friend opted for the Thai omelette. When it came out, WOOOW! the smell was definitely drool worthy. I will definitely be back in the future to get that omelette. The story behind this little cafe is really cute!"
1/4/2020,20200104,5,4.52,"We went here for breakfast before we hiked the Hollywood Sign. Join the waitlist on yelp if it is available, it saved us so much time and this place seems to get pretty busy! We went at about 10 on Tuesday and it was pretty crowded. We were able to find two hour parking down the street. My boyfriend got the French toast and I got the breakfast burrito, they were both amazing. The place is super cute and staff was friendly. I would highly recommend it!"
1/4/2020,20200104,5,4.52,"I grab brunch with my friends here whenever I get a chance! I love their chicken and waffles, and I'm not much of a chicken person so that's saying something. My friend and I sat near Stevie Wonder our first time here which was a sweet surprise! This could be an unpopular opinion, but all my friends prefer this joint over Roscoe's. Thus, hesitate no further because you're gonna fall in love with their food!"
1/5/2020,20200105,4,4.52,"Tasty food in a quaint setting .The one time we went in , I ordered a dirty chai, which came out like $7.It was very surprising . Maybe they figured out how to set a decent price now. Idk, Probably won't go back ."
1/5/2020,20200105,5,4.52,"Absolutely love the backstory to this sweet spot. Amazing food and coffee, artistic, unique, clean, cool atmosphere commissary prices. So many cool things to choose from on the menu. Definitely will have to visit again."
1/6/2020,20200106,4,4.52,"Pretty good Breakfast! My party and I had a pretty good variety of things on the menu. It's a smaller place for breakfast but the menu has a lot to choose from. It is definitely Asian infused, the photos on the wall are beautiful along with some of the spices incorporated in the food. If there were half stars I would give them a 4.5. Since it is smaller anticipate a little of wait, every time I pass by there is a line and they also don't take reservations over 4 people on yelp or over the phone. I would definitely go back, the chicken and the waffle was also pretty good."
1/6/2020,20200106,5,4.52,"Went here last week and the food was AMAZING! We had a table for 5 and they got us seated in less than 20 minutes. Our food came out so fast and everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the chicken sandwich. It was a little spicy but so good. And you can't come here and not get their truffle fries. Delicious. Would so go again if I'm in the area. They opened up another restaurant ""Met Him At A Bar"" across the street which is supposed to be for dinner. So I'll make sure to try that one too. Def recommend."
1/7/2020,20200107,5,4.52,"Very cute place! The food was really good! My sister ordered this Wafflebello Sandwich it was sweet and savory definitely a must try and definitely both of our favorites. Also we were haangry so on top of it we ordered a crispy french toast and the Wake Me Up Happy that comes with eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausages..also very good!!!"
1/8/2020,20200108,5,4.52,"If your craving a great American comfort style breakfast, this is the place. They offer a huge variety of breakfast items here. Breakfast is the focus.The pancakes, waffles, eggs and breakfast meats are excellent. Everything is made to order using the freshest ingredients. They care about the food they serve.The place is on the smaller side, so get ready to wait (it will be worth it)."
1/8/2020,20200108,5,4.52,The best gluten free waffles in LA hands down. Long waits go by pretty quick and the food is well worth it. Owners are always on site and very welcoming. Easily one of my favorite breakfast spots.
1/10/2020,20200110,5,4.52,"Whenever I am in LA, I always go to MHATAB for breakfast. The place always has great service, super delicious food and really good coffee.The atmosphere of Met Her is amazing. Very cozy, doesn't matter the time of day nor the weather - the place is just cozy. It's small, so when it's packed, you're going to be waiting a long time to get a table or a seat!!Wake Up Happy is my go to option with berries. It has a nicely cooked waffle, crunchy outside and warm, fluffy inside. The syrup is delicious, topped with their in-house butter. They have a small cast iron scramble eggs, topped with THREE pieces of bacon, crispy but soft! Crunch in every bite. As well as two sausages.The breakfast of champions I might add. Food here, is definitely a 5/5.Service here, is 10/5! they're amazing, quick, attentive, friendly as heck! Wait score may vary depending on the day. I always come early, so the wait is like 1 minute or less.If you're in the area, definitely stop on by! On weekends, you're in for a hectic treat"
1/11/2020,20200111,5,4.52,"Came here on New Year's Day because it was one of the few places open. My friend and I waited a little over an hour for a table, but the wait was worth it! The food is delicious, and their service is on point. Even though they were super busy, the staff as a whole made sure that their customers were being taken care of. This place is small, so they're only able to accommodate a certain amount of people at a time, but they do the best with the amount of space they have.The owners (whose story is the reason for their eatery) are super nice, and were there running it. To me, seeing that the owners care enough about their place (which is obviously successful after reading several Yelp reviews and seeing the loads of people willing to wait) to spend their New Year's Day making sure everything runs smoothly, along with providing excellent service really speaks to their dedication to their restaurant not just for money, but because they truly love it. This attribute spills over into their restaurant, and it shows!"
1/11/2020,20200111,5,4.52,I love this place! Great food and excellent service. Such a neighborhood gem. Can't wait to try their pasta bar next door.
1/11/2020,20200111,4,4.52,"We had a great experience here , waited for about 20 mins to be seated its a busy place so while your waiting check out the menu . Wow You're Different Waffle and Met Her Breakfast Burrito are two I can recommend and if I was in LA a little bit longer the Power Bowl would of been my next choice ..try the freshly squeezed OJ and coffee you won't be disappointed ."
1/12/2020,20200112,5,4.52,"One of my favorite places to have brunch at, their food is so delicious!!! Every plate I have tasted has been very tasty and looks stunning!!! Very colorful and love how they add beautiful flowers to their dishes. I went for Sunday brunch!! Had the Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast Burrito, Flintstone Waffle.Couldn't be a brunch without the Mimosas of course. Please note that their is a 45 minute wait to be seated but it is totally worth it, and its on the pricey side. The food comes out rather quickly, and the staff is very nice!!"
1/12/2020,20200112,5,4.52,AMAZING FOOD!! DELICIOUS and so worth the wait. I had the chicken waffles and omg is all i can say. My friend had the French toast and thag was heaven. We had marcha latte with oats milk and wow so creamy and yummy... definitely a must try..
1/13/2020,20200113,2,4.52,"extremely long wait, very basic food (food came out probably less than 5 mins after we ordered), loud ambiance with even louder music (the music was good though), and seating is too close to comfort. Thanks to the couple across, I now know how to control my IBS through yoga and breathing techniques.."
1/14/2020,20200114,5,4.52,I had the vegan salted caramel waffles and they were great! Service is very good as well. We waited about a half an hour in line to get a table but it was definitely worth it.
1/14/2020,20200114,5,4.52,"Great food, vibes and customer service. They get you in and out. I've only been twice, bit both times were perfect. Their Thai flavored chicken with waffle is DELICIOUS. I love the fact that they use the chicken thigh and it's amazing. Keep up the great work! I hope to return again soon!"
1/14/2020,20200114,5,4.52,The Wafflebella with a side of waffle fries. You're welcome! Our server/host was amazing as well WORTH the wait.

There was a small mess up in our order, we asked for no bacon but we told them and they happily fixed it. The food itself was amazing. I ordered the chicken and waffle (I liked that it was boneless chicken) and the nacho waffle fries. I'll definitely be back."
1/17/2020,20200117,5,4.52,Love that you can put your name on the waitlist in advance (must be within a mile of the restaurant for it to work). Great selection of food. Espresso was great quality. Avocado toast was delicious as were the scrambled eggs & bacon. Service was fast and friendly. 2 hour parking on La Brea outside of resto if you can find a spot. Definitely recommend.

1/18/2020,20200118,5,4.52,"This place really live up to my expectations. It's a busy Saturday's afternoon that they don't accept anymore Yelp waitlist but that's okay because we waited less than 30 mins for a table of 2!!! MHATB is really small from the inside. However the music, and the decors really what make this place stand out from the crowds. It is very DTLA look, if you know what I mean lol. Okay, now let get to the food. MHATB really know for their waffle so of course , that's what we got. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles (Thai style) with ice Matcha green with oat milk and my husband ordered His Waffle (Italian style). They were amazing!!!!!!! My plate came with this sweet chili sauce with a few basil leaves and chili on top. It was phenomenal. My husband was iffy about how crowded this place was from the beginning but now he doesn't wanna leave (hahah) . We sat at the bar where we can see everything the kitchen staffs cook our food fresh. Especially those yummy fluffy waffles baby!!The service was pretty great. They were very attentive and everyone here looks so happy of what they do. Like I said it was a busy day and none of them shown signs of exhaustion or irritation from the service. They look more like a family in my opinion!!!!! Parking is super convenient and plenty street parkingbecause it's in the residential areas so you can easily find a spot.Anyways, we will def be back because I want to try everything on their menu !!! Trust the crowds and be patience because it's worth the wait!!!"

Very delicious and well presented. **Ask about the story behind the name of the bar. It's very heart warming."

There were 3 of us and we arrived at about 11:00am, we were seated by noon. The interior is charming and the staff are all very welcoming, attentive, and upbeat. We ordered the following: Thai Chicken & Waffles: Wow, the perfect mix between sweet and savory. The spice of the chicken pairs well with the sweetness of the jelly and syrup for the waffles. A girl was hesitant but I was more than pleased. Chicken & Waffles: Crispy and crunchy chicken is always the way to go. This one was topped with an alfredo like sauce, you may think what?!? but trust them, they know what they are doing!Breakfast Burrito: Filled with chorizo, eggs, cheese, and WAFFLE FRIES (BOOM, MIC DROPPED). It was very tasty!We will be back :)"
1/21/2020,20200121,5,4.53,"Stop looking. Eat here. Order the waffle. Thank me later.Came here for a late brunch, around 1ish, waited about 20-30 for a table for two and the food was worth every second. I had the overnight oats which were made with almond milk, a plus. I also ordered the best waffle I've ever had in my life; I kept it simple just whipped cream and strawberries. My bf had one of their specialty breakfast toasts and a breakfast sandwich which were both also complete perfection. Service was good but not over the top but they were (as they always seem to be) busy and the food was so good that I don't even care to bump a star. I will literally come back to LA just for this place, seriously though, get the waffle."
1/21/2020,20200121,4,4.53,"I was in LA for other reasons but decided to eat because we had some time to kill. It's a very small but cute spot with some outside seating. We wrote our name down for 2 people but were seating immediately. I ordered the waffles with berries with a mimosa. The waffles were very soft and was topped with the perfect amount of whipped cream. Although it is definitely on the pricy side, I would come back."
1/21/2020,20200121,5,4.53,"Visiting LA for the weekend, this was on our list of places to try. It definitely didn't disappoint. Be prepared to wait on the weekend for brunch but it's well worth it. Probably the best breakfast tacos I've tried so far."
1/21/2020,20200121,5,4.53,I love this place! It's a great little hole in the wall and their chicken and waffles are so good!

Inside they have a weird layout so you may be sharing a table for 6 w 2 parties. Overall, the french toast is absolutely amazing. 10/10 would recommend!!"
1/22/2020,20200122,5,4.53,All the reviews are right. Great food especially the chicken and waffle. They also have great coffee which is the main reason I go. The line is always crazy long but you can check in on the app which helps.
1/23/2020,20200123,5,4.53,The name of this restaurant is the first thing that caught my attention - I mean seriously - how cute!!!! My friends and I were looking for a cute breakfast place to go to that had delicious food and mimosas. I came across this restaurant on YELP and decided to give it a try. We went on a weekday so we were given a table as soon as we stepped inside. All the employees were so friendly. Our waiter was awesome - he made so many recommendations for us. Totally forgot his name :( The food was presented very nicely and it was the perfect portion. Most importantly - it was delicious! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cute cafe-like brunch spot.
1/23/2020,20200123,5,4.53,Great delicious food. Mimosas were awesome. The service was great. Cute little restaurant. Definitely coming back to try the French toast.
1/24/2020,20200124,5,4.53,"This place was such a gem! Came for lunch on a Friday and joined the waitlist via yelp. As soon as I got there, the table was ready! The sangria was delicious and the chicken and waffles (Thai style) was BOMMBBBB. It was hot sauce was spicy which I love but if you're not into spicy I would stay away from it. It was pretty busy even during the day so I would suggest using the waitlist. Would definitely come back!"
1/24/2020,20200124,5,4.53,"We came here to enjoy our last meal before heading back to germany. We had a very very very! Friendly waiter and super duper good service ( waiter, if you read this, we gave you the pears for that perfect service) The food was delicious and fresh. Thank you for that, we are looking forward to come back."
1/26/2020,20200126,5,4.53,"Wow...tried coming for breakfast...45 minute wait..came for lunch..20 minute wait...but was worth it! Got the His chicken and waffles...so,so, so good! Enjoy!"
1/26/2020,20200126,5,4.53,"Met Her At A Bar is such a hidden gem! We were seated almost immediately after putting in our names, the food and drinks came out way quicker than we ever expected, and everything tasted absolutely delicious! This place will definitely be our new go to breakfast joint and our neighborhood! :)"
1/26/2020,20200126,5,4.53,"OMG such a rare find! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!! This cafe is so delicious & so cute inside!! Definitely a must try if you are in the area. I had the Thai Chicken and Waffle, side of Truffle Parmesan Waffle Fries, side of berries, and fresh squeezed orange juice. The staff is so friendly as well! Best chicken and waffles I have ever had. No complaints. 100% positive I will be back."
1/27/2020,20200127,5,4.53,"Attention to detail, their own personal touch generated effortlessly, wittiness that can't be duplicated .. it's a light ray of pure happiness. It begins with the name and the story behind it, someone grab me a tissue. Smitten enough that you can catch me at Met Him At A Bar sometime in the near future. I trolled by in the wee hours of the morning determined to hop on the buzz. And it's buzzing regardless of the time so plan accordingly! First things first, I'm not into breakfast nor brunch type of food and having anything remotely sweet is out of the question for me. So tell me why the first thing I order is the french toast, and tell me how it's possible that I absolutely adored and enjoyed every bite. It wasn't overbearing with the sweetness and the outer crust from the corn flakes spiraled me into a different realm. The mama's omelet didn't disappoint and we appreciated the sprinkle of sea salt on the breakfast potatoes. For your neighborhood eatery, this situation is solid."
1/27/2020,20200127,4,4.53,"I've driven past Met Her At A Bar a couple of times and have always noticed the huge hoards of people waiting outside to score a seat. I figured, it's just another trendy, hip and pretentious brunch place in L.A., can't really be all that special, right? Wrong. Believe the hype, this place is worth it!Background: I finally gathered the energy and motivation to eat here on a Sunday morning and was really pleased with everything! I arrived at 12:00pm and the wait was around an hour, but considering I don't really hang out around the area, I used this time to look at the stores up and down the street. There's a Goodwill a few stores down, so I used that time to thrift a bit. I also noticed a lot of people waiting in line were able to find cool Instagram backdrops in the side streets to take pics at, so that's another thing you could do to waste time as well (When in L.A., right? lol).When my table was finally ready and I entered the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was how small and cramped inside it was. I'm talking shoulder to shoulder type of cramped - which is why I'm taking off one star. The tables were so close to one another, I was able to hear all of the conversations around me. Not saying that I'm anti-social or anything but if you're expecting a private, intimate lunch, this isn't the place. On the bright side, the inside was cozy and gave off ~good vibes~ if you know what I mean.In terms of their menu, they have your typical brunch items. Eggs benedicts, waffles, breakfast burritos, avocado toast, chorizo and so much more but I knew I really wanted to try their waffles since I've heard so much about it. I ordered their egg benedict, which was priced at $14 and added a latte on the side. For most of their plates, you can choose to add a salad or potatoes and I chose potatoes because who doesn't love more carbs in their day. FYI: It doesn't say this on the menu but you can add flavors to the latte: caramel, vanilla or hazelnut. I added the hazelnut and it was to die for! Kind of on the sweet side but equally as strong. If you don't have a sweet tooth, ask for less sugar! The food came out really fast, which was nice after waiting for so long. I enjoyed it thoroughly and it left my pleasantly full. The waffles were SUPER soft and it was like biting into a bed of clouds. I prefer my waffles like this rather than super crispy, so all good there. The egg was also poached just right and I thought it paired well with the waffle.Overall, it was a really good experience! I would come back again.Tips:- Parking is limited but if you circle around, you'll be able to find street parking - They don't offer Yelp check-ins via mobile but you're able to check-in once you arrive. You can use this time to walk up and down the block or go back to your car and chill"
1/27/2020,20200127,5,4.53,"Been passing this place a lot so finally had a free weekend to try it out. There was a little bit of a wait but well worth it! I loved the atmosphere of the place not too big but just the right definitely felt like an Asian inspired spot (Thai to be exact). I was in a group of three which is nice because we all agreed to just order a dish and share, I love it when I go with people like this because how else are you suppose to try everything you want without looking like a fat*** LOL jkjk. Everything we ordered was hella bomb!! My personal favorite was the french toast and I don't even like french toast like that...I guess I do now. Fried chix & waffles had a little twist to it ordering the Thai version which I am a huge fan of Thai food and flavors, this was a pleasant surprise! The trouble I have when ordering this at other places is always the same question, will the meat be dry?!?! and the verdict is...MOIST AND JUICYYY. Yayyyy, honestly I've only been in LA for about two months but this has taken my #1 brunch spot and I don't know when that will change or if it ever will.. This place is the real deal!!"
1/27/2020,20200127,5,4.53,"Absolutely delicious, great service, friendly servers. Thank you for an amazing breakfast!! We will be back again!!!"
1/28/2020,20200128,2,4.53,"Ambience 2/5Service 1/5Food 3/5Drinks 2/5Cleanliness 2/5This Spot Is Cool, A Little Over Rated. The Wait Was An Hour With Minimal Seating For The Waiting Area Outside For The Smallest Table, Its Clear This Bar's Focus Is More About Quantity Then Quality! The ServIce Wasn't Great, You Can Tell The Server Was Nice But Everyone Was Running Around It Felt Under Staffed & Very Chaotic. The Cups Were Super Worn, We Had 2 Different Ppl Drop Off Water So We Had 4 Cups Of Water On Our Small Table & The Server Kept Apologizing For The Cups Being Ugly (They Had A Thick Film) I Ignored It. Then We Placed Our Order My Food Came Out Very Quick But My Friends Food Came Out 15 Minutes After My Food. I Waited For Her Food To Come Out Because We Came To Enjoy Brunch Together & They Said It Would Be A Minute But It Wasn't. My Food Was Cold By The Time Her Food Came! We Asked For The Check Which Had A 3% Health Love Fee Added, They Should Post It On The Menu To Make You Aware. The Whole Experience Was Terrible Honestly, For The Prices This Place Charges & The Fees Along With It They Should Really Have Clean Cups, Have Their Expo Bring Out Food Together For A 2 Top Table & Be Better Staffed!"
1/29/2020,20200129,2,4.53,"I used to like this place, but as if the last time the charm is gone. There are some good food options on the menu, but eating at this restaurant is not enjoyable. It is very loud, extremely crowded to where you are almost eating on top of people and one seat adjustment away from knocking a waiter over, and there are no shades on the windows so after waiting forever to be seated, you'll be wearing sunglasses inside while the rising sun blasts you in the face. This is further exasperated by the owners pulling that new annoying bill add on of whatever % since they are required to make sure their employee can go to the doctor and not be sick. Just adjust your prices instead of having this add on. I get it. You don't want to pay for healthcare"
1/31/2020,20200131,4,4.53,"Oh this wait! Nice place, really hard to hear the person sitting in front of you because everyone is so close together. The food is great! Maybe come during a week day to get seated faster."
1/31/2020,20200131,5,4.53,This place was sooo delicious! The wait time was not bad at all and I liked that you can add yourself to the waitlist before arriving. It was little but very cute. And THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! 10/10
2/1/2020,20200201,5,4.53,"Worth the wait! When you walk in, you enter your contact info which puts you on an electronic waiting list. The estimated time wait was ~20. We were given menus while we were waiting outside and were seated at 30. Food was excellent. French toast was amazing, creme brulee complimented it well and texture and flavor were great. Crispy chicken sandwich was great - slaw and pickles went well. The only thing is I wish it had more of the aioli. Truffle waffle fries - highly recommend. The food strongly makes up for the wait. (Warning: restaurant can get noisy)."
2/4/2020,20200204,5,4.53,Came for a Saturday brunch. Wait time was about 45 minutes since you couldn't check into yelp waitlist until you arrived. Parking is via the neighborhood (2 hour parking or permit for longer). Pro tip: they ticket on the dot so don't be a minute late to your car. While we waited outside they gave us cups of water to hold us over. We selected first available seats so we ended up with the bar style seats (I think next time I would request the outdoor seats since the inside was too loud and I like my feet touching the ground). Food: friend got the chicken and waffle regular. She LOVED the chicken and there were a couple of different sauces to dip in. Waffle was a bit heavy but otherwise delicious. I got the berry waffle gluten free. This was the most delicious gluten free waffle I've ever eaten. Berries and whipped cream were a nice combo. I will say though we both did leave a bit hungry still since it wasn't filling enough but I think that means that next time we order an appetizer to share! Definitely will return for another brunch. But maybe earlier in the morning on a Saturday or Sunday.
2/4/2020,20200204,5,4.53,"Incredible! Must have! The food is worth the wait! I my server to pick my meal. The waffles Benedict were mind blowing. It was a busy morning. Food was in front of me within a very reasonable time. Joseph was busy with other things, and still took the time to answer my question, let me try some of their sauces, and gave me the history on the restaurant. I had to use the little boys room, and to my surprise, it was pretty clean. The place is five stars above and beyond. I will be going back and trying their entire menu. I was very impressed with the service, cleanliness, and the attention they pay to they're patrons. I overheard an issue with an egg order. Joseph was all over it and made sure it was handled. For a little whole in the wall, (no pun intended) it is a very classy breakfast spot."
2/4/2020,20200204,5,4.53,"Yes there is a wait. We waited about 20 minutes, granted it was a Monday a little after lunch time so not bad at all. A little cramped inside but doable. The food? OMG why did I have to try the Waffle portabello mushroom sandwich??? It was hands down one of the best tasting waffle sandwiches I've had in my life! The cilantro sauce gives it a savoring spicy kick at the end that immediately explodes all the flavors in your mouth. I say why did I have to try it bc I live more than an hour away from this place and now I will be putting in endless miles on my car just to keep coming back! Downside, they close at 4 pm."
2/6/2020,20200206,5,4.53,"Had brunch with my friend here and the ambience was perfect, prices of the food was good too. Excellent and quick service. Of course, food was amazing! Very satisfied and highly recommended to all!"
2/7/2020,20200207,5,4.53,The chicken and waffles were on point! That piece of chicken was juicy crunchy and addicting!!! The waffle was one of the besst waffles I've ever had. I will be visiting tthis spot often.
2/8/2020,20200208,5,4.53,This food here is definitely worth the hype!The venue is a but small so i can see how it can get crowded on the weekend  But i would definitely wait for the food here.I got the fried chicken and waffles and oh my goodness it was great! Like mouthwatering good!My sister ordered a salad which looked amazing and she thought it was too!Ok so the mimosas was a bit pricey but again the food :)
2/8/2020,20200208,5,4.53,We ABSOLUTELY loved this place! The vibe of the restaurant to the food .. just perfect!! The story ending how the restaurant came about was super cute as well! I had the omelette with potatoes and my wife had the chicken and waffle. We both left nothing on the plate it was so good!! Def a LA must try!!
2/8/2020,20200208,5,4.53,The best waffle ever. Fuxk!! This will be a go to here on out every time I come to LA!
2/8/2020,20200208,4,4.53,"Jordyn helped and she was really nice. I had the chicken club and hubby had the turkey sandwich. I didn't know that the turkey sandwich was only half a sandwich. That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars. Place was super crowded of course. Service and food was great. would like more details on the menu though. Menu stated fries or salad, but they offered potato chips or salad."
2/9/2020,20200209,3,4.53,"Server was great. Food was good. Got the Nutella waffle. I forget the exact name. It was crispy and perfection. Breakfast potatoes were tops.It was freezing out. On and off raining. I didn't want to sit outside but my service dog was ""too big"" to be inside. Same amount of space in vs. out. Just as crammed. Clearly bias and just didn't want a bigger dog indoors. He knows how to navigate tight spaces. He's a service dog for PTSD. That's part of his job. Forcing me to sit outside was not only insensitive but illegal. I ended up sitting outside because I didn't want to cause a scene, but my experience was not what I waited over an hour for. Major discrimination. Super cold the entire time. Picture for how much ""space"" this 57lb ""huge"" dog takes up while the fake service dog chihuahua sits on someone's lap barking inside in the warmth."
2/9/2020,20200209,5,4.53,"First time coming to your establishment. Phenomenal breakfast. The waffle was cooked to perfection. Not to crunchy. Eyes were fixed exactly the way I wanted them to be. Atmosphere was great. I went around 10am and as time started to bypass, more people started to show up. The earlier, the better. Nice restaurant !"
2/10/2020,20200210,4,4.53,"My friend and I got there around 9:15am on a Sunday and we waited about 15 minutes. We were lucky to find street parking around the block but it was pretty packed as we were leaving so if say come earlier if you can! We were seated outside. My only complaint was that the tables were really small. We ordered two smoked salmon ($2 substitute) eggs benedicts on waffles, a crispy French toast, a matcha latte, and a power chai with oat milk ($1 charge). I was very concerned that the plates would easily tip over which is a shame because it would definitely discourage me from ordering more things to try.Tasty! My first time seeing an eggs benedict on top of a waffle and it was so good. I would've liked a little more hollandaise sauce because the waffle is pretty dry but taste wise, it was quite yummy. The crispy French toast was really good!!! I was worried it would be too sweet but I think it had a perfect balance of sweetness. The drinks were pretty average, leaning towards underwhelming. Also they do charge a 3% health charge!"
2/10/2020,20200210,5,4.53,"My favorite brunch spot in la. That's saying a lot! It's got a great menu, decent pricing, and i highly recommend anything with truffle on it here! Service was above board, and it's worth the wait if you're into brunch!"
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.53,"Let me just say that it is seldom that I write a reView whIle I'm on site and eating at the place. There's a first for everything so here it is:If you're in LA area (nearby, bc I realize LA is HUGE) this place is a must for brekky and brunch. We lucked out coming here on a Tuesday bc wait was quick and we got a good street parking (1 hour).Vibe is great, service and staff are friendly and wonderful, and the food, absolutely delicious. Now I'm quite picky about paying $15 plates for breakfast but this place is so good, it's really is worth the hype. The sorry of their owners is even more cUTe and inspiring, like heck, I maybe able to open up my own resto one day too! Worth a visit, worth ya money."
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.53,"This place is a must try. I came here two times while visiting LA for breakfast. The first time I had the French Toast and the second time I shared the Fried Chicken and Waffles Thai Style. The French Toast was delicious it was not too heavy or soggy. It was topped with fresh strawberry and blueberries with a dollop of whip cream. The fried chicken and waffles was one of the best I've had EVER! It had tons of flavor and was seasoned just right. Chicken was not dry. There were what seemed like fried basil and fresh red chili slices in it. It came with chili sauce, syrup, and butter. I mixed all three together and honestly was not disappointed. So yourself a favor and stop by here because you will not be disappointed."
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.53,This hole in the wall has revitalized the entire block. The food is beyond delicious and ambiance is fun and upbeat. Every friend who comes to town gets to experience this place. Mindy and Vincent are such an incredible couple full of kindness and joy for good food and good people. All their staff is amazing. They have become family we are there so much.
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.53,Get the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and ask them to put truffle oil on the breakfast potatoes!!!!!! So amazing!!
2/14/2020,20200214,5,4.53,"I love this place! It's a small setup, but it's trendy and super cute. I came by with one of my best friends before I left for Sacramento.We ordered the chicken sandwich, Thai style chicken and waffles, and the crispy French toast! The chicken and waffles were amazing! The chicken was savory and had a nice Asian twist to it. I loved the crispy Thai basil on top. I can't describe enough how delicious this was! I was in absolutely heaven. I've never loved breakfast, but man... no words. The French toast was also yummy. The cereal flakes on top certainly added to the dish. My friend really liked the chicken sandwich. The cold slaw in the sandwich was a nice addition.Service was great. Excellent flavors. I want to come back! And also visit Met Him at a Bar!"
2/14/2020,20200214,5,4.54,This place was amazing! Food is out of this world and service was great. I got the crispy chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the chicken + waffles. Both were stellar.
2/14/2020,20200214,2,4.53,On the corner so not hard to find. Crowded and cramped inside. Overrated and overpriced food since the food is average; nothing special at all.
2/14/2020,20200214,5,4.53,"Great hole in the wall, a little small but staff tries to work with it. Super generous on the amount of food given out, waffles are a MUST! Pesto panini and fried chicken burger are out of this world. Fairly priced and very welcoming staff. Must RSVP unless you don't mind waiting in line."
2/14/2020,20200214,2,4.53,"Really cute restaurant but very disorganized and the food was sub par... there was a wait, and when I finally got my food I was disappointed. The tables were way too small, The outside seating area was crowded like a school cafeteria. They also got my girlfriends order wrong and did not accommodate her whatsoever just replacing the order which completely destroyed the dining experience for me. I'm giving this restaurant two stars because it is very cute, But if you're looking for good food this might not be the place for you luckily the prices were fitting for the quality of the food. Pretty cheap and not too expensive. My coffee was average but they didn't offer me more even when my girlfriend got her order switched. If you're curious why this place has good reviews it to me though it's probably because it's very LA in it's aesthetic.. but if you're looking for a good dining experience with amazing food this isn't it."
2/14/2020,20200214,5,4.53,I am so happy I took my boyfriend for lunch here! They serve breakfast/ brunch all day and you can't go wrong!!!! I had the truffle oil toast and was out of this world also the power chai is something else! Make sure you put yourself on the waitlist on advance because is always busy! Thank you yelp for this amazing recommendation!!!!
2/16/2020,20200216,5,4.53,"This was a highly recommended brunch/breakfast joint that I heard so much about. I already could feel the hype and vibe just by looking at the long line amassed at the door. We put our spot in line and waited for about 40 minutes. But it was worth it. Service was on point and refilled drinks was more than a common thing so that was amazing. Parking was on the street so you have to walk a little bit, but not a big deal when you're excited about some waffles and crushing crispy french toast. We got the All-American Breakfast, breakfast sandwich and the crispy french toast. Everything came out fairly quickly and was really really good. I was expecting a little more crispiness for the toast but the softness and flavor was more than I could ask for anyways. Must go if you can! A+!"
2/16/2020,20200216,3,4.53,"This breakfast spot is a solid OK. The speciality waffles are more insta-worthy than breakfast-worthy, a common trend at LA breakfast spots. Additionally, the ambiance offers nothing special to save face. I would skip."
2/17/2020,20200217,5,4.53,"Worth the wait! Simple ingredients, crafted by hardworking and diligent cooks yield some amazing dishes. Friendly atmosphere, excellent service.Everything we tried exceeded expectations, drip coffee was quality stuff.Highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. Seating is limited, space is a bit cramped especially if it is packed, but again so very much worth it."
2/18/2020,20200218,5,4.53,"Decided to check this place out for brunch after seeing the beautiful waffles on Yelp, and I'm so glad we did!!We joined the Yelp waitlist around 11am on a Monday, and it took almost an hour to get in. The actual restaurant is quite small so there isn't too much seating, which is probably a big factor for how long the wait is here.I ordered the crispy French toast, and it was SO good. It has cinnamon, corn flakes, fluffy whipped cream, and the toast is so crispy and eggy! It's also beautifully presented. The portion size isn't crazy either which I appreciated.My friends also ordered the Chorizo Toast, which is poached eggs & chorizo w/ a yummy avocado sauce on top of a thick piece of bread! Really flavorful but it's on the smaller side.We also shared a matcha waffle which was AMAZING! The matcha sauce on the side is so rich, and the entire thing was just creamy matcha heaven... as you can prob tell I have a really big sweet tooth so I was very happy haha.Overall really had an amazing experience here; the food is great, the ambiance is light and fun, and it's all around an A+ spot for brunch. Highly recommend :-)"
2/18/2020,20200218,5,4.53,"The only word that comes to mind after eating food at the places is ""Amazefreakinglydelicious"". The place has a great vibe, duly accompanied by some healthy delicious recipes. I got the most tasty Avocado toast with some freshly squeezed orange juice. My wife got a healthy grain bowl and we shared a banana strawberry waffle which were awesome too. Friends got the French toast and the quinoa bowl too which were great too, judging from their reaction. I would highly highly recommend this place if you are near La Brea. 5 stars for me!"
2/18/2020,20200218,5,4.53,I came here on a Sunday which was a 1 hour and 30 minute wait. My daughter and I decided to wait. We wanted to know what the hype was. I got the avocado toast and the chicken and waffle. My daughter got the truffle toast. The food was great. The service was amazing. The food came out quickly. I recommend this place.
2/19/2020,20200219,5,4.53,My favorite brunch spot in LA. I love how the restaurant is not just hipster but also really tasty! Highly recommend their chicken and waffles
2/20/2020,20200220,5,4.53,Best breakfast I've ever had...no lie lol the freshly squeezed OJ was great my girl had the avocado toast which she loved and I had the breakfast tacos and man the sauce in them was amazing. We sat at the bar which made it even cooler as we were able to watch the kitchen work on the meals... we also shared the chicken and waffle which was perfect I recommend you get it.
2/21/2020,20200221,5,4.53,Food was great and the service was even better! The staff are very attentive and nice. Definitely a must try!!!
2/21/2020,20200221,5,4.53,Great aesthetics and super nice on the eye! Amazing place for a delicious brunch! The hardest thing is to chose what to eat because all of their food choices are amazing. A little pricey but Totally worth it!
2/22/2020,20200222,5,4.53,"Chicken and Waffle is a trendy food. I've had plenty of lazy versions with no innovation. A chicken and a waffle at a very high price for no reason, but Met Her at a Bar is special. The Thai seasoning makes this dish incredibly innovative. The sweet chili + syrup is a perfect marriage. The dried thai basil is a nice touch. The chicken itself is juicy and deboned. The waffle was light. This dish is worth the 16 price tag because it's a true culinary masterpiece.  Get it. It's so good.The match waffle (12.50) was a surprise. Subtle hints of matcha, a softness that makes it feel like you're biting into a pillow and a sugar level that delights, but does not overpower. I was shocked at how good this was.Khai Jiao (12) is a very asian breakfast. A perfect thin omelette on top of rice with a harmony of seasoning. My dining mate was impressed.Nacho Waffles Fries (10) are fun, we were drawn to the image of it on the walls, but skip it. It's stoner food and not worth the price.Latte (4.25) was weak and watered down but a fair price.The meal comes with a 3% healthcare charge that's then taxed. And the servers awkwardly hand you a machine to sign off your credit card like the rest of the world. Do the tip math prior so you know exactly what you want to add instead of using those ""convenient buttons.""Neighborhood parking was not bad at 9:30AM on a Saturday and you should use the Yelp reservation to get ahead of the line.I wonder who they ""met at a bar,"" but it's clear to me now that it's was someone with roots in Thailand. Together they really created something special, delicious and unique. Who knew. I Love it."
2/22/2020,20200222,4,4.53,Food was amazing!! Service was great!! The only down fall was the line! We waited about 30 mins to be serviced. But that is Bc it's worth it!! The restaurant is not that big as well!! My advice to you is join the waitlist before you go!! Enjoy
2/22/2020,20200222,3,4.53,"I had the chicken and waffles, for being a waffle place I thought the waffles where just okay nothing special but that fried chicken was one of the best fired chicken I've had here in California. Come early cause there was a wait, its a bit small but cozy. The staff was friendly and fast, I would come here again."
2/23/2020,20200223,4,4.53,"Came here with my friend for brunch. I didn't realize how small this place was thankfully we were able to walk right in and get a table but the table was outside and it was just too close to other people. there was absolutely no privacy and my friend and I couldn't actually have a proper conversation because we can hear the other person talking the whole time next to us and the stuff we wanted to discuss is not something we want other people to hear. That's my only con about this place. Anyhow in regards to the service and the food I have no complaints I enjoyed the French toast, the avocado toast, and the ricotta toast. We got too many toasts this day lol but I would definitely come back for the French toast and probably get something savory next time. The presentation is beautiful and I would recommend. Good luck finding parking on the street thankfully we were able to find a spot nearby."
2/23/2020,20200223,5,4.53,"I heard about this place through a few friends and I've been lagging on it. So I finally decided to come check it out on a late Sunday brunch. First thing you realize is the cute concept of the story behind the restaurant. Few typos on the menu but that doesn't take away from the fluffy waffles. I ordered the waffle sandwich with eggs chorizo, tomatoes and avocados on the side. The sweet flavor of the syrup and spicy from sriracha I added took it over the edge. The waffles are sooo good- crispy on the outside and soft and buttery in the inside. How did I not come here sooner!? I had 2 mimosa because 1 wasn't enough. I can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu!"
2/23/2020,20200223,3,4.53,"This is your typical brunch place. We arrived at 1:30pm on a Saturday and checked in on yelp. Yelp said it was 30-40 min wait. We decided to wait but there was 23 people ahead of me, Luckily a lot of people on the wait list left so we got seated outside in 20 min. We ordered the crispy French toast, mama omelet, and green tea waffles. The mama omelet originally came with bacon but we wanted to sub it for chorizo. It costed an extra $2 for no chorizo whatsoever... the omelette also looked like it was just scrambled eggs in an omelette form.. would not recommend. The crispy French toast is just corn flakes on top of French toast with some fruit and Nutella. It was pretty standard nothing special. The green tea waffles was okay too. I liked their green tea sauce that they drizzled on the waffle but other than that the waffle itself really didn't taste like green tea. Food was a solid 3/5 very mediocre brunch food. Overall don't think I would be coming back. It's worth trying once esp since lines can get super long here on the weekends."
2/24/2020,20200224,5,4.53,"Waffles are yummy - more Belgian style - soft and sweet. savory cravers - get the Khai Jiao or Thai Omelet. park on the street on 8th st and surrounding areas. come early or prepare to stand in line, it'll be worth the wait."
2/25/2020,20200225,5,4.53,I visited shortly after they opened and the food was amazing and dare I saw it's even better now! Service is always on point! This is going to be my regular breakfast spot from now on! This is my 4th time coming and I'll be back at least once a month!
2/25/2020,20200225,4,4.53,"Small venue with a lot of people looking to get a table. An honest breakfast/lunch spot with a decent menu. The stuff on there tastes more like home cooking than something out of a fancy restaurant. This is fine for my tastebuds, but there's a bit of a question in my mind why this place would be so packed and popular.The popularity might be a thorn in your side when waiting for a table. I had a wait time of over and hour- it felt like forever waiting for a spot for two. There's a few tables that could accommodate a couple, but most of their space is accustomed to large groups or you'll have to be somewhat social with strangers who share a table with you. I had waffles with bacon and egg. My girlfriend had waffles with fried chicken. I liked it, but it's not something I couldn't get at another spot with less traffic and a little more leg/eating space."
2/26/2020,20200226,5,4.53,"I ordered the Crispy French toast and the chicken panini and it was delicious! Place is pretty small, but it was very well kept. So many choices on the menu and prices are decent. Will definitely be coming back here and recommending others :)"
2/26/2020,20200226,5,4.53,Listennnnnnnnnnn breakfast food is my thing and this place goes above and beyond! I'm so mad I didn't try this place before. We got a bunch of yummy things but my all time favorite was the chicken and waffles and the breakfast potatoes.. the cilantro aïoli is amazing if you're into dipping your potatoes in sauces . Chicken was cooked crispy like I like it and the waffles were fluffy! all of it was incredible I will be back for the strawberry ricotta toast because it looked like a piece of art at the table over from mine lol. This place is definitely a must try and you won't go wrong with the iced chai latte it was a vibeeeeee. :)
2/29/2020,20200229,5,4.53,"Had breakfast there yesterday and WOW! Amazing!! I had an all American breakfast with fruit! Also, the sourdough with the strawberry jam was out of this world! Much love from Arizona"
2/29/2020,20200229,5,4.53,"Long wait for sure but what great restaurant doesn't have people waiting to dine because it's just that great? Found this gem on yelp and decide to give it a try. Waited almost an hour but then was seated. Our waiter was ready to take out order as soon at we were seated. We ordered food and drinks at the same time after the hour wait we wanted to waste no time and neither did the restaurant! Our food and drinks came out so fast! Ordered waffles, French toast, breakfast sandwich, and cauliflower tempura. Every item we ordered was delicious, flavorful, and exciting! We had no complaints, only compliments! If this restaurant existed in our home town it would be our go to! Super cute inside and out. Packed for sure but you don't feel at all like it's over crowded. Looking forward to revisiting next time were in town!"
3/1/2020,20200301,4,4.53,"We were heading back to Orange County after a fabulous weekend and wanted to try this place, partly because my husband I met in a bar and also because of their high Yelp rating.We arrived 5 minutes before they opened and were standing with 4 groups of people. The restaurant is small, so we were glad we got there early because right as we were seated the restaurant filled up. I ordered Eggs Benedict and my hubby ordered a Breakfast Burrito. Both were good, but my hubby had order remorse after he saw the Chicken and Waffles order next to us. The only downside was my Cappuccino was lukewarm. My hubby said his coffee was hot which was perfect for the birthday boy! Service was quick. Our orders were hot. And the staff was really friendly and had smiles for everyone."
3/1/2020,20200301,5,4.53,Ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict for myself while my friend and I shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries and the Peaches & Créame Waffle. Absolutely divine. I enjoyed every bite! Also when i ordered the orange juice it was fresh squeezed! It honestly was such a treat. Wonderful service and kind employees. I can't wait to go back and try all the other things they have in their menus!
3/2/2020,20200302,5,4.53,Best chicken and waffle i have ever had. Great little drinks. Cant wait to return and try new things.
3/2/2020,20200302,5,4.53,"First of all, the place has so much casual charm and ease its wonderful! Secondly the coffee and Mimosa(fresh squeeze juice) were rock solid, thirdly the food was AMAZING!!! Best chicken and waffles we have EVER had:):):). Vanessa our server as well as additional team members were some of the best I have had in some time. Fantastic job and well done. Your crazy if you don't go here if your in the area."
3/4/2020,20200304,4,4.53,"Very happy with my vegan Froot Loops Vegan Waffle. I'd definitely return here to try some of the other creative waffle ideas, but I would probably only go when the crowd is low. This was about a 3 hour journey from the arrival to the bill. About 2 hours were spent waiting around for our name to be called. Long wait times, good food, good service!"
3/4/2020,20200304,1,4.53,They don't tell you tip is included AT 20 percent BY THE WAY.... so me as a normal person tipped 20% ON TOP OF THAT..... don't ever come here they steal from you. Or if you do... don't tip on top. Servers didn't even deserve 20% and the food is trash
3/6/2020,20200306,5,4.53,"5/5 The food was excellent! I love a good chicken and waffles and I can say that theirs is definitely up there on my top 3 list. Service was great, staff very friendly. Only had to wait 5ish minutes and they're check in system is very dialed. Overall very impressed. Great work guys!"
3/6/2020,20200306,4,4.53,"Delicious food awaits! And I mean, a wait. We stopped by for Sunday brunch and waited for about 45mins. My name was called and then they told me to wait, as they were cleaning up. We had to wait another 20mins, after other parties went ahead of us. I guess that 5min grace period is actually about 20mins. The place is really loud, so it was hard to have a conversation. Our server was great! She was nice and brought our food out quickly, I think the biggest delay was the fresh OJ. The food was very yummy! My mom is very picky and she grubbed on her burger. So thanks for that! She left a happy lady, as we all did. Not sure if I would go back during that time, but I would definitely like to try other things on the menu."
3/6/2020,20200306,5,4.53,"A must breakfast stop in LA! Attentive service, tasty options and great coffee! Prices are reasonable. Pa"
3/7/2020,20200307,5,4.53,"This place has it all! Cute cozy decor, great service, and awesome food! There was almost no wait when we went (granted it was 9:30am on a Monday). Me and 2 other ladies were seated immediately after walking in. We ordered the Fried Chicken + Waffles, Nacho Waffle Fries, and the Crispy French Toast. The fried chicken (which was Thai style) was fried to perfection and still remained juicy. This paired well with the sweet chili sauce, which was a cool fusion of the standard chicken and waffles. The nacho fries were pretty bomb, you can't go wrong with melted cheese and bacon! The French toast could have been crispier but the berries were fresh and the toast was seasoned well. I ordered a matcha latte, which I may have regretted a couple hours later because of my lactose intolerance but it was worth it. It wasn't gritty or ""in-your-face"" matcha like other matcha drinks I've had. It was a nice change up from coffee. I wish I found this place while I was in college in LA, although it probably would've been killer on my wallet. Will be back when I'm in town again!"
3/8/2020,20200308,5,4.53,"I loved this place so much! I saw the reviews and figured I'd give it a try before exploring LA. My husband and I got two different versions of chicken & waffles- Thai and Italian style. I thought the Alfredo sauce would taste soooo weird but it was probably the juiciest and flavorful chicken I've had! Literally all chicken and waffles I've had the chicken is always overcooked and dried- this place is completely different. Plus if your a sucker for the sweetest love story, read their about me on the menu."
3/9/2020,20200309,4,4.53,"The chilaquiles are an amazing dish but $6 for orange juice???? Yikes. The coffee isn't all that good or maybe I just didn't order one that was good enough? It was very watery and didn't taste very nice. The food though was great and the orange juice I decided to get after tasted fresh and sweet. The staff is very friendly, although it is very packed the food is worth coming for."
3/10/2020,20200310,5,4.53,Tried to come here for brunch the first time but it was completely packed on a Sunday and we didn't make a reservation so we decided to go somewhere else but I was undeterred. I came back on a Friday and made a reservation and am so glad I did. We had the fried chicken and waffle (thai style) and it was incredibly good! The fried chicken was fried with all the thai spices which gave it such a nice kick and the waffle was good and fluffy (ever so slightly crispy) which made it a really nice counterpart. Super cute brunch spot for a nice unique twist on brunch foods.
3/12/2020,20200312,5,4.53,This place is always busy! Everything is really good. I like this business name lol.Food quality and service also perfect for me.
3/12/2020,20200312,4,4.53,Pro's:- food was delicious & creative- vibe is eclectic but charming - parking wasn't terrible since there is residence behind. Con's:- Wait is long. Very long. Don't show up if your starving or have things to accomplish on a weekend- place is small. Not ideal for large parties. Better for parties or 2- while waiting your on a busy street corner and hostess will call your name out but don't put a lot of effort in making sure your within earshot! Food was worth the wait and the story behind the name is cute.
3/13/2020,20200313,4,4.53,"I've passed by this place many times but have been hesitant to try it given the massive crowd that's always outside. Finally came here with 3 friends on a Saturday. We put our name in around 9:30 and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. I was surprised there was a wait at that hour but overall the line seemed to move fast. Once inside, the wait made sense. The place is tiny and kind of cramped. The tables are close together and servers/other diners were constantly passing behind my chair for the entirety of our meal.Service was very rushed. We had at least 3 or 4 different people who took our order, checked up on us during the meal, and then brought us our check at the end. While nice to have so many staff checking up on us, I have no idea who our actual server was or who I tipped at the end of the meal. The pace of the meal was also far too fast. We received our food about 5 minutes after we ordered. Our regular drip coffees barely made it to the table before the food did. Honestly, it just felt like the restaurant was ushering customers in and out as fast as they could.The food itself was good but nothing special.. pretty standard eggs, bacon, and waffles. I will note at least half of our group received food on plates that were significantly chipped. (You can tell somewhat in the picture below). Looked sloppy but even more so I would think this is a big liability for the restaurant. Also in a very cramped space behind the bar and between the 2 single bathrooms, there's a cart where the servers dump leftover food/drink and stack dirty dishes. I'm glad I didn't see this until the end of the meal but it was a little off putting to see this on display in the main dining room. There must be very little space in the back.Overall, this place is probably deserving of 3.5 stars but I'll round up. Decent food, cute interior, but very rushed and somewhat sloppy meal."
3/13/2020,20200313,5,4.53,"The food was amazing and delicious! The staff was great. This is an awesome spot! I'm glad he ""Met Her @ a Bar"""
3/15/2020,20200315,4,4.53,"On march 14 2020 drop all the way from San Jose California to this cozy little place just so we can tryout there waffle menus and chicken everything was great but service kind of lacked had to repeat asking for water, napkins and fork something that they can be improve on and no parking area only have street parking."
3/15/2020,20200315,4,4.53,"We had a nice meal here on our way out to the Getty Center. The Yelp reviews were good, so we gave it a chance. We visited on a Tuesday morning around 9:30am. It was full but we were able to get seated quickly. I can see how parking could be an issue like it is everywhere in LA. There are only a few spots curbside near the restaurant, but you can park between 8am and 6pm for free in nearby residential streets and there are nearby metered spots.We ordered the flagship dish, the Thai-style chicken and waffles, which we found to be awesome. We also got the eggs benedict (on waffles instead of English muffin at the suggestion of the server) and thought it was a tasty twist on the typical dish. It was also reasonably healthy (except for the waffles, LOL) with the side of vegetables and salad.The whole place is busy but cozy and clearly a favorite of the youthful locals. The servers were very nice and there were lots of interesting options on the menu we didn't try. The story behind the café is cute too. We would come back, but as with this trip, probably make it a late morning weekday visit to help avoid the busiest times."
3/18/2020,20200318,5,4.53,"Amazing service! Amazing food! I would come here every Sunday if I lived closer! It was a bit of a wait, but let me tell you. It was worth every minute to wait! We had a party of 6, so that could explain the wait. But worth it! The kids loved it and wanted more :)"
3/20/2020,20200320,5,4.53,"The food looks soo good and the service is amazing, it's certainly a go to spot for dates and or if you're close to mid city or Hollywood"
3/21/2020,20200321,4,4.53,"I went here to hang out with my friends for brunch. I was surprised with the food here. The fusion flavor was so good. With Thai interior design and photos of the farmers, I feel like having brunch somewhere overseas. A refreshing feeling! The food and services are good. Little twist like green tea latte (hot or iced) is a perfect drink for green tea fans. I heard the sweet story of the name, I will definitely come back to try Met Him at a Bar across the street. Highlights of the menu:1. Chicken waffle in Thai style: their sweet and sour sauce plus mint leaves are bomb2. Avocado toast: fluffy cheese and edible flowers on top of toast look really nice3. Green tea latte"
3/22/2020,20200322,4,4.53,"A meal to remember! The chicken and waffles is a must, and though the wait time was very long even with a reservation, we popped over to Met HIM at a bar across the street and had Bloody Mary's while we waited. We got a phone call from the hostess when our table was ready. Our servers were slammed but so sweet and gave us all the time we needed while ordering. be prepared to wait for a table for at least 45 minutes, we went on a Sunday. The ambiase is really cute, Thai themed, as are most of their dishes. Our table shared everything, the breakfast sandwich was our least favorite ( but it was still good), but when tasting everything else on the table, the various waffles, with various colors and exotic flavor pairings, that little breakfast sandwich was among high competition. I'd be happy to take any of my visiting family and friends here. Love this neighborhood spot."
3/24/2020,20200324,5,4.53,Great place for brunch! Only sucks because of the lines but its definitely because the food is good
3/25/2020,20200325,4,4.53,I didn't have time to take a picture of the strawberry ricotta toast. It was amazing!The wait is long but I think you can put your name in on Yelp first.The crispy French toast is good! The place is a bit small but it is a cute place.
3/28/2020,20200328,4,4.53,"Please note: review is based on an experience that took place before COVID-19They do not take RSVPs and would be hard to do as their place is pretty small in space. Most tables are indoors and I would say its a spot good for couples/2 in a party, but I did see groups as big as maybe 5 or 6 squish together. There is a small part of the sidewalk that they have for outdoor seating (but that's usually taken by a larger party). I would say, look at the menu in advance or while you're waiting outside to be seated. They have a pretty good sized menu with plenty of options to choose from. My friend and I decided to split our meals in half to trade and we had 1 round of mimosas. The Chicken and Waffles Plate and the Chorizo Toast were delicious. The flavors from both were quite nice. I wish there was more room on the table to have ordered one more dish. The service was great! Really cheery the wait staff was and it didn't take that long of a wait to be seated (maybe 10-15 minutes?). Not a good place for catching up as I felt like we had to leave immediately after we finished eating. Parking: street, meter, garage (across the street behind Commerson)"
3/28/2020,20200328,5,4.53,"Best brunch spot in Los Angeles - it's so popular that the wait is often really long. Wish they were able to buy all the property on the whole block and EXPAND. Love the food, service, and vibes. A meal to remember."
4/5/2020,20200405,1,4.53,"Very disappointing. Ordered an eggs Benedict and Eggs Florentine. This was the worst Benedict/Florentine I've ever had. Eggs were slimy and small. The English muffins were super thin and could not hold themselves to the toppings. They ended up soggy and hard to stomach. Both dishes were almost tasteless besides the hollandaise. Benedict was simply a sad English muffin with ham slices on it and a sad egg. The Florentine was the same, except with spinach. Even the side salad was an unfortunate dish. The dressing (I assume it was intended to be a vinaigrette) for the side salad tasted like someone just threw plain olive oil on my salad. The names of the dishes are hella cute though"
4/6/2020,20200406,5,4.53,"My sister & I were traveling to LA. We came across this place because we wanted brunch. This place is absolutely AMAZING!!!! Such a cool vibe on the inside and such friendly staff. The food was prepared so fast and it was so delicious. It was so good we thought about coming back a second time. Unfortunately, we were not able to but we did go to their sister restaurant across the street. That was also sooo good!! If I am ever in LA, I am DEFINITELY coming back!!"
4/11/2020,20200411,5,4.53,"Boyfriend chose this spot on Postmates for breakfast. They knocked it out of the park! He ordered the breakfast sandwich and I ordered the French toast with Nutella. OMG so good!! Once we're able to go back to eating out at restaurants we are definitely going to give this place a visit. For now, definitely a go to for us for food. Thanks for making our Saturday morning!!"
4/13/2020,20200413,5,4.53,A great brunch spot with fusion dishes (best one is their Thai chicken + waffles). Very cute interior and excellent service.
4/14/2020,20200414,4,4.53,"Yummy brunch spot that is essentially a hole in the wall with few tables on a patio. It's first come first serve with an insanely long wait time on weekends. The food is delish and aesthetically pleasing, but it is pretty pricy for brunch in LA. Because of the long wait times, I have only been once. It would be great if they could move to a bigger location!"
4/16/2020,20200416,5,4.53,"I had heard this name mentioned several times and just didn't ever feel moved to try it. From the outside it doesn't look like much and it's small inside but what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in quality. After my first visit, I've made a point to return numerous times. The fresh squeezed orange juice is fantastic, the vast beverage list is full of great options. The food is next level. My personal favorite is the waffle benedict. I like to add truffle oil to my side of potatoes. I always bring out-of-towners here to showcase the great California breakfast food we have."
4/17/2020,20200417,5,4.53,Love this cute little breakfast spot! The Thai chicken and waffles and Thai tea were THEE BEST!!!!
4/18/2020,20200418,1,4.52,"ordered a strawberry toast for takeout. received it soggy, and with five slices of strawberry. barely any ricotta. terrible."
4/25/2020,20200425,4,4.52,"Cute little corner spot! Great drinks and sweet plates! Definitely more of a breakfast/ brunch spot, wouldn't recommend for dinner."
4/27/2020,20200427,5,4.52,Great brunching while safe at home location. Placed order via Toast for pickup. Plenty of parking around for a quick in and out. (Dont forget your mask). I arrived and my order was ready but if you are early you are asked to wait outside. Friendly service. Food: I ordered the waffle benedict but easily subbed the meat for avocado. The platform is super user friendly for those that have lots of tweaks to their order. For sweet I ordered the delicious crispy french toast.They currently offer a waffle and mimosa special. Delicious!
4/28/2020,20200428,5,4.52,"First time visiting this place, and although this whole covid-19 is occurring, we had a pleasant visit. Employees were super nice and helpful. My boyfriend and I ordered their Crispy French Toast (AMAZING!!), Chicken & Waffles (MOUTH-WATERING), and the Mamas Omelette. The omelette was good, but I personally felt like it needed a little something. Other than that, coffee and matcha latte were also delicious. We're definitely coming back when we can dine in! :)"
4/30/2020,20200430,5,4.52,Amazing! Got the mushroom waffle sandwich (don't remember the name) and it was honestly the best breakfast item I think I've ever hadThis place is definitely a pretty good food hang out. Just be aware that the street parking can be a bit tough.
5/1/2020,20200501,2,4.52,"The service was good, but the food was both grossly overpriced and rather plain. If you care more about the aesthetic of your food than the taste, maybe it's worth your time."
5/2/2020,20200502,5,4.52,My friend got the blooming tea and it was such an experience watching the flower blossom over time and drinks. Maybe I just like flowers
5/7/2020,20200507,5,4.52,"Brunch done right. Strong coffee, good vibes, and fun menu. You have the classic sweet and savory options. I went with the Thai chili chicken and waffles and did not regret it!!"
5/10/2020,20200510,5,4.52,"I just found this place during the virus. It has fantastic breakfast options. Don't get me wrong, roscoe's Obama special is probably the top choice in the area, but the French toast and any waffle option here is sublime. Great fresh fruit, waffles are firm, and they make wonderful fresh OJ. I also recommend the dish they serve with bacon eggs and sausage. All three were executed wonderfully. Really nice people working there as well."
5/10/2020,20200510,4,4.52,"Boom! That's how you make a burger. Eggs Benedict are awesome too, good quality and fresh food. Hope it opens soon!"
5/12/2020,20200512,5,4.52,Not many places I got to with delicious vegan options. I must say finding this little jewel in LA was a treat for sure. I spent my birthday brunch there one year and the magic these guys do in the kitchen is phenomenally amazing!
5/13/2020,20200513,5,4.52,Man! The food is CRACKING and the staff is super friendly. Definitely one of the best in LA.
5/15/2020,20200515,1,4.52,"After visiting this restaurant many times over the past year I had one of the most toxic interactions with an employee this morning and it needs to be made public.My wife and I ordered a ""wake up happy""item off the menu via one if the usual online food services - grub hub or postmates something like that. Our card was charged and I approached the entrance of the store to pick up the order but was immediately met with some kind of toxic emotional response from the purple haired woman working there - it was as if she was already angry at someone and apparently I gave her the wrong information or order number because she snapped at me saying there was no such order - the crazy thing is though I could literally see the food on the counter, the receipt, everything - The order was literally sitting there but she refused to take my name or put any effort into handing over something that we had already paid for. I gave her the order number from the screen shot on my phone and once again she said there's no such order. After that I stood outside and called my wife - interesting thing is even she called the restaurant as I was standing there and was told there was no order. Minutes later we received a message from the online service saying the restaurant could not fulfill the order even though they already had made it, charged for it and sat it on the counter in front of everyone. In my opinion this person was having some kind of toxic meltdown at work, maybe even covid related and got caught up in a moment of frustration with the wrong customer. After I let her know I would be putting this up on Yelp she proceeded to actually follow me outside the restaurant to confront me about it. In all my life I've never had an interaction like this at a restaurant, I'm barely even a yelp user and have only left one other negative review ever - this was crazy and this person needs to get ahold of their emotions at work - this kind of thing is an embarrassment to the people who run this restaurant. Honestly though food there is good but after that kind of an encounter there is no way we would ever consider giving these people our money. I"
5/20/2020,20200520,3,4.52,A lot more hype then I think is real - it's ok food but nothing wild - not worth waiting on a brunch day -
5/20/2020,20200520,5,4.52,"The bomb! Looking forward to going back! Didn't even get to photograph my kids' food, they devoured it!"
5/22/2020,20200522,5,4.52,Soooooo delicious! Service was on point. Really cool atmosphere. I highly recommend this spot. Best breakfast joint around.
5/29/2020,20200529,3,4.52,"Not that impressed. The chorizo toast portion was small. The side potatoes were seasonless. Ricotta toast was decent. Meh, better brunch options in town."
6/9/2020,20200609,3,4.52,"it was decent food, but an insanely long wait. kind of crammed which i get is a vibe but also was a little uncomfortable. not sure that i'll be back anytime soon but overall it's not a BAD place to be... just wasn't my favorite!"
6/10/2020,20200610,5,4.52,"This place never disappoints. Although it can be a bit pricey, the food is not only tasty but aesthetically pleasing as well. I have been going to MHAAB since they opened and the only thing that has changed is the size of the crowd. Go early for breakfast/brunch because this place gets packed. Since the restaurant is currently closed due to Covid-19 their pickup/delivery service has been a lifesaver and super easy to order! The friendly staff is the icing on the cake. I really have nothing but good things to say anoint this restaurant."
6/12/2020,20200612,5,4.52,"The food was so delicious! We got the Thai style chicken and waffles and French toast. The service was so quick, lots of precaution for dining in. Definitely would come back again."
6/13/2020,20200613,5,4.52,"Food was AMAZING!! I had the Thai chicken and waffles, literally perfection!!! Also the service was wonderful, our server and other workers checked on us constantly always making sure we were ok! Owner came by and compd us a round of drinks and was very thankful to have our business!! When we come back to town this will def be a must go!! Thanks again!!"
6/13/2020,20200613,1,4.52,"Absolutely trash! Didn't even go in ! I waited over an hour on an non busy day told me to eat 20 mins I will get a text! No text at all! Then I called gave a different number still no text! Walk up and watch them serve people of different races before coming to me! I got the vibe that would happen when I gave my number the first time. I was judged upon arrival being a black man with an ""urban"" look. I work in this community in a well know shop and help the community so I feel so disrespected. Me or a single friend of mine will not support this business. Edit* owner responded . I gave the number I never received any messages until I called and gave another number I stood outside for a while I was around it wasn't like I wasn't paying attention I watched another group sat before me when I was #1 on the waitlist"
6/16/2020,20200616,5,4.52,"Cute name that caught my eye, during my never-ending brunch quest. After seeing their menu had Belgian waffles, I decided to have brunch delivered. I tried His Waffle (Italian style). Not sure if the ""Italian Style"" refers to the waffle or the chicken.... anyone's guess. Delivery via Postmates took about 35 minutes. My waffle was big and fluffy, soften due to moisture condensation in the box; but easily toast-able! The perfect Belgian waffle is soft on the inside and crisp on the outside; so I imagine this waffle is just that, had I dined in for it. More importantly is the TASTE of the batter and it tasted GREAT!! It came with maple butter and syrup on the side. The chicken breast was juicy, breaded seasoned spicy and came with Alfredo sauce on the side, which tempered the spice nicely. There was also a side of homemade hot sauce for that extra kick! I also got an order of Parmesan waffle fries which tasted great and even better dipped in that Alfredo! I apologize for not getting a picture of my order - my stomach got the better of me! That said, I would definitely reorder from here! They have so many other things to try! Next time, I'll get a picture of my brunch bounty!"
6/20/2020,20200620,4,4.52,"I'll be back! I wanna come back again before I give a more detailed review (and additional star), but if you're in the area, definitely stop by for great service and breakfast food!"
6/21/2020,20200621,5,4.52,"My best friend drove down from up north so we wanted to try out a few spots, we got recommended this place and boy are we glad to have tried it! They have the best waffles ever, my bestie was haunted by them, still is in fact! The service is fantastic, the place is very clean and super cute. I am forever loyal to this place whenever I want breakfast :) you can't go wrong with anything on the menu"
6/22/2020,20200622,5,4.52,"Amazingly delicious food! So flavorful and wonderfully prepared. I ordered takeout during quarantine and it did NOT disappoint. My favorites are the avocado toast, the crispy french toast, and the fried chicken waffle. Told them I was ordering for two but I literally ate all of these things BY MYSELF in my car . No regrets. If could eat here every day I would!"
6/23/2020,20200623,5,4.52,"Had to go to LA on an empty stomach to run an errand. Once we were done I checked on Yelp for a breakfast recommendation and we were not disappointed . Once we arrived we were told it would be a 45 min wait but it only took about 20 min.We ordered the breakfast sandwich which was good and the waffle benedict that I absolutely loved! Why have I never thought of this combination before?! You get both sweet and savory in one bite. We also had the truffle waffle fries with parmesan, they were ok but I felt like they added a bit too much of the truffle oil for my taste. To drink we ordered the iced latte and I ordered an extra hot vanilla latte which was delicious. The service was great! Our waiter was attentive and I can't wait to go back and introduce other friends and family to this place!!Also important to note that they do temperature checks before getting seated, employees all wearing masks, they follow social distancing rules, and they disinfectant the area before getting seated."
6/25/2020,20200625,5,4.52,"A friend recommended this place. It doesn't seem like much when you walk in, but the food is delicious. Their cold brew was delicious, one where the taste is great and doesn't require milk or sugar. The chicken and waffle (Thai style) was amazing! You should give it a try. I know the Thai style makes it sound weird, but the taste is different, but good different. It is sweet, but slightly spiced, so it wasn't an over masking flavor. Ultimately, it pairs well with the waffle. The Minted Quinoa Salad was refreshing and very tasty. It is more on the lighter side, so if you aren't too hungry I recommend."
6/26/2020,20200626,4,4.52,"**Pre-Covid19 review**We were in the area visiting our vet, so it was a perfect opportunity to visit. I think if it weren't for that time, we probably wouldn't have visited the place yet since I love to sleep in on weekends. We got there about 5 minutes before the place opened, and it already had three other parties waiting by the door. While we were eating, we saw the wait crowd grow at a pretty fast pace. The service was efficient and friendly. It felt like the wait staff was juggling a lot and there was a bit of wait for service, but they manage things relatively well. Food was great. Visually and taste wise. Good coffee definitely didn't hurt. It was not a relaxing brunch since the place got too busy too quick, but if I'm in the area early enough, I'd love to visit again."
6/27/2020,20200627,3,4.52,"My friend was visiting from another state and he wanted to get some brunch because he's never been to like a fun brunch place as of right now during Covid not really much fun brunch places to go to anyways we went to the restaurant for brunch very nice. Super cool that you can take a picture of the link that's on the table and it pops up the menu super super Technology savvy. I was on my carb cycling so I try to stay on meal plan, And my friend got the chicken and waffles which he absolutely loved. The only thing that kind of was a lot was that the manager kept coming to our table asking us if we were OK A lot of times. Overall really nice restaurant."
6/28/2020,20200628,4,4.51,"Desperate for some brunch, we found that Grub Hub delivered this place and were all in when we saw Nutella on the menu.We ordered breakfast tacos, crispy french toast, now this is love waffle, bacon (crispy), breakfast potatoes. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs but we wanted to taste a little of everything. The food was DELISH, even with a delivery that made it not so hot but we did not care. The restaurant packaged our items up with napkins/utensils (thank you!) without us remembering to ask.My personal favorite was a tie between the crispy french toast and the breakfast tacos. A special call out for actually doing the bacon crispy as requested."
6/28/2020,20200628,5,4.51,Delicious pasta arrabiata and Loved that dessert donut. Will go back soon. Great service too.
6/29/2020,20200629,5,4.52,Absolutely fucking amazing!!!! Get the chicken and waffles Thai style. Best chicken and waffles I've had in years!!!!!!!!
6/29/2020,20200629,1,4.51,"Not happy! On Yelp this place says it closes at 4 arrived and checked in at 3:30. They said the kitchen was closed. Super upset because we made a drive out here and all they said was sorry we are closed, the kitchen closed 25 mins ago. They didn't even ask if we wanted a coffee to go or anything. Poor customer service. I will not be coming back. Literally wrote the review as soon as we left."
7/1/2020,20200701,5,4.51,Just as soon as the world was slowly starting to open ..it quickly was closing. ... haven't had a dine in experience since the start of Covid-19..it felt good to walk up and be greeted by the owner (didn't catch his name unfortunately) with a smile. Wait was less than 10 mins. Normally its an hour but in times like this it was quick. We sat in the patio area. I clearly did bad with not getting names today but my waiter was super nice and came immediately and asked us what we wanted to drink. We scanned the bar code for the menu. Gave us enough time to decide. Came back and I ordered the huevos rancheros with a side of potatoes and my friend ordered the wake up happy. Everything was amazing..even my jabnero salsa was fire! Since everything is closing again ..take out will be the only option for now. But I will definitely come back to patronize this establishment.. KUDOS TO THE OWNER AND STAFF
7/2/2020,20200702,5,4.51,"This place is amazing!! I have lived in neighborhood for 5yrs, and driven by quite a few times, commented to myself about cute name, but never walked over. Wish I knew about how great this was years ago, because I would have been there every day. Stopped by for birthday lunch/drinks and food was awesome, very good! Had a chance to meet the owner who was incredibly nice as well. Staff was amazingly accommodating also. A really great place with great food. Looking forward to coming back. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
7/2/2020,20200702,5,4.51,The matcha waffle was lit lit . The ambiance inside is cool with dope pictures on the wall . I ordered the matcha waffle and it was amazing . I'm a matcha fan and I hate the fake sugary matcha but this was the real stuff . Not too sweet nor grainy . The matcha sauce on top was great so I did not need syrup and the waffle was moist . I got the chicken done Thai style with the Tom yum seasoning and let me tell you ...every bite was a two step for the taste buds.

7/3/2020,20200703,3,4.51,"Came here for brunch after an early morning flight. My friend got eggs Benedict waffle with ham- which turned out to be deli meat . I got the waffle eggs Benedict with spinach and tomato- the tomatoes were under ripe, hard and uncooked. The hollandaise didn't have much flavor. The only thing that saved the dish from being inedible was the potatoes. The atmosphere is nice and waiter was friendly but the quality of food is really bad...especially for this price point."

7/4/2020,20200704,5,4.51,"Best brunch I've ever had in LA. Hands down. I've been here a year and a half. I had the Thai chicken and waffles. Best. Thai. Chicken. I've. Ever. Had. Mimosa's are bomb. I took time to put periods between my words on describing the Thai chicken. Don't take that lightly. Lol. You know how sometimes waffles are big and overwhelming. Well these are amazing with the Thai chicken dish. Literally between the chicken and the waffle I can't tell who is the badder bitch. So enjoy lol service was super dope. Really cool people who make good jokes, which is important lol"
7/4/2020,20200704,5,4.51,"One of the best breakfasts we've had in a while. This place was worth the wait and the staff was SO attentive and helpful! We will definitely be back! Thanks Andrew for the fast and prompt service, on a holiday at that!"

7/5/2020,20200705,4,4.51,"I got the met her breakfast burrito and my friend got the spicy chicken sandwich. It was yummy. Nothing too special, but it's a cute place. The food was decent. And they have outdoor dining."

7/17/2020,20200717,5,4.51,"This place is awesome. I had the portobello mushroom waffle thing that was delicious. Parking isn't the best, but this place is worth circling around to find it. The best part about this restaurant was the service. Everyone was hospitable and they make you feel welcomed. Our table was well attended to, and overall it was an awesome experience. Definitely will be back."

7/18/2020,20200718,5,4.51,I've had two visits here in two weeks . First I had the Thai chicken and waffles.. it was sooooo good!!! Then the French toast .. OMG double good.. must try!
7/20/2020,20200720,4,4.51,"Met Her at a Bar is a pleasant neighborhood venue for breakfast and lunch, while its sibling (or bae?) Met Him at a Bar, directly across the street, is more focused on Italian-style dinner fare. Here, the lunch offerings primarily revolve around wraps and sandwiches, while breakfast offerings include healthful bowls, eggy dishes, and waffle dishes, which are perhaps their specialty. I tried the Thai-style fried chicken and waffle and found it a nice twist on a typical brunch dish. Tom yum seasoning and basil provided a slight kick to a decent portion of chicken and a waffle that came with syrup and butter on the side. Sweet, savory, and satisfying all at once - which was just what I was in the mood for after a long drive.Service is perky, and they make up for a small indoors space with additional seating outside. A welcome find!"
7/20/2020,20200720,5,4.51,Food is so good loved it can't wait to order again fresh and amazing cooked to perfection.
7/22/2020,20200722,5,4.51,My boyfriend and I had a brunch date here the other day and wooow this place is the bomb!! There was about a 30 min wait to be seated because due to the current pandemic they are not doing in door seating. As soon as we got seated the waiter was prompt with accommodating us with our drinks and orders. We were not left waiting around for our mimosas which is a plus. I ordered the Wake me up. The eggs were fluffy and soft just how I like it. The sausage was bursting with flavor and the bacon was even flavorful. The waffle was a great mix between fluffy and crunchy making the texture of the waffle perfect. The syrup they offered was probably the best syrup I've ever had. It had a pecan flavor to it that paired so well with the waffle. My bf on the other hand had the avocado toast and a vegan waffle with added fruity pebbles and fruit. He boasted about the food as well. Highly recommend this Met Her at a Bar for brunch!
7/23/2020,20200723,5,4.51,"Food was good and staff were super friendly. El Fresco dining was a bit loud with traffic, but overall was a super cool place to grab a quick bite and enjoy restaurant experience again."
7/25/2020,20200725,5,4.51,"Honestly I was craving French toast and this was one of the places that caught my eye. And I must say the French toast was so delicious!! The hype around this dish is worth it! Though my friend did have to wait a while to get seated, the service was very friendly. The restaurant is fairly small, however the decor,story and food behind it makes up for it LOL. Tip: may be hard to find street parking depending on what time you go, bring coins"
7/25/2020,20200725,5,4.51,"Literally some of the best breakfast I've ever had. It was soo good I got it twice. The eggs are beyond good, probably some of the best I've ever had in my life. I will absolutely come here every time on vacation. Even the taste and presentation on a to go order was excellent."
7/27/2020,20200727,5,4.51,The matcha waffle is delicious! You can really taste the matcha and it's not like other places where they don't use the actual matcha powder. My sister ordered the chicken and waffles. It came with a sweet and sour sauce which complimented the chicken so well !
8/2/2020,20200802,5,4.51,"Overall I love the food here. The staff is friendly and attentive. My favs are the eggs Benedict, the all American breakfast and the breakfast burrito! They have convenient online ordering through their website. Plenty of street parking nearby! Good brunch staple."

8/6/2020,20200806,5,4.52,"Went on a weekend baecation. With COVID-19, restaurant dine in was very limited. For most of my trip, I ordered Postmates. I ordered brunch via Postmates from Met Her At A Bar. It was so good that we had to dine in once more before we head back to the Bay! For my Postmates order, i tried the french toast, avocado toast, and eggs on the side. Eggs were cooked to perfection, perfectly salted and fluffy. Avocado toast was tasty, however, a bit too lemony for me. I wish the French toast had a side of maple syrup, but otherwise, it was delicious. On my last day of the trip, we decided to dine in for outdoor seating. After 20 minutes, my partner and I were seated. We both ordered the Chicken and waffles, which were amazing!! I highly recommend trying this. Waffles were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The chicken was perfectly fried with Tom yum spices, a unique blend that I've never had before. 10/10 would recommend trying this place! Tasty food & friendly attentive staff."

8/6/2020,20200806,3,4.52,"This place has outdoor patio seating available during these times. The staff was friendly and had a great attitude. Just a suggestion though - you should probably have your staff take down names and phone numbers instead of handing the iPad to every customer and then not wiping it down. We ordered the breakfast burrito and crispy chicken sandwich. The breakfast burrito was pretty tasty with prominent flavors of bacon and chorizo (7/10); however the side of potatoes it comes with was a disappointment to my life. The word I can use to describe those potatoes is rubbery. It is a food item you wouldn't want to waste your calories on. Next we have the crispy chicken sandwich, which was at best sub-par (5/10). It lacked flavor and was quite bland. . It was not juicy at all, but it was not dry. It is good for people don't like great food. It came with a side of waffle fries, which were cooked just right, crispy outside with soft inside."

8/7/2020,20200807,1,4.51,Didn't eat here however we tried to. I understand things are different due to COVID but they wanted us to sit at our table with the mask on the entire time- outside in the heat. Only time I could take the mask off is when my food gets to the table. We literally would've been sitting at breakfast in silence because it's a busy street we can't hear each other with the mask on. We decided to leave but really wanted to try it. It was on our to eat list since moving to LA right before COVID so we were excited when it was open but that would've been hard to do sit there with the mask the WHOLE time and basically not talking.

8/9/2020,20200809,5,4.51,"I had a really tough time figuring out what to order because everyone on Yelp claims their favorite menu item to be the best of the best. I must say, I totally agree! Everything is just so delicious! This is not your average breakfast diner, but more of an above average fancy brunch place.Fried chicken and waffle (Thai style): with tom yum seasoning and crispy basil. This combination of chicken and waffle strangely works so well together! All our friends who tried this dish agree that it was delicious. Sweet meets savory. I think the tom yum seasoning really makes it special, rather than just presenting us with a fried chicken and plain waffle.Avocado toast: contains sourdough, avocado, tomato, parmesan. I ordered this because someone hyped it up in the reviews. The parmesan and the toast are so FLUFFY. There is no other way to describe it, I feel like I'm biting into a plushy pillow or fluffy cloud. The edges are very crispy because it's sourdough bread. The combination of things on the toast is very well made. There's some cute little sprouts and flower petals on the top that don't add much to the flavor, but adds to the aesthetic. It's filling but won't make you super stuffed. It comes precut in 4-5 pieces if people want to share!Truffle waffle fries w/ parmesan: YES YES YES. The truffle oil was detectable and pleasant without being overwhelming. The parmesan cheese adds a fluffy layer of delight on top. The fries are crispy yet soft on the inside. Not your average Carl Jr.'s criss-cut fry. This was great to share as well!"
8/9/2020,20200809,1,4.51,Ordered the classic eggs benedict through postmates takeout. Gave me florentine benedict instead. Tried to call them to resolve this issue but they put their line on busy. Please contact me to solve this issue.
8/9/2020,20200809,5,4.51,"I had been wanting to try this place for a while and I was definitely not disappointed! We went this Friday and the food was delicious, and the staff was very attentive. The attention to detail in the food presentation was on point. We ordered a salmon lox waffle, a ""You Make Me Wake Up Happy"" and Nacho waffles and every single plate was made fresh and all tasty. I was honestly not expecting the food to be THAT good so I was very pleasantly surprised. Will definitely be going back!In the times of Covid they made sure to sanitize everything before we sat and all waiters and staff were wearing masks at all times. The wait was about 10 minutes after we were number one on the wait list. There's only about 9 tables for outside seating so expect a bit of wait. It is right on La Brea so the view is not the best and there is a bit of dust but they are making it work. Overall great experience *5 stars*"
8/9/2020,20200809,5,4.51,"What a cute brunch place to go! They expanded their outdoor area to accommodate for COVID regulations, and we were seated fairly quickly. I ordered the white truffle toast and it was absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend!"

8/16/2020,20200816,5,4.51,Great food ! Wonderful service . Highly recommend for brunch . Great waffles everything on menu is bomb
8/17/2020,20200817,5,4.51,This place was amazing we ate outside and I loved it. The food was WoW. I am from Florida and I have to come back to visit just for here
8/18/2020,20200818,5,4.51,"OMG SO CUTEE. Besides the long wait, they have good food. The waffles are amazing. Staff are so friendly! Great experience for a brunch date."
8/20/2020,20200820,5,4.51,"I like this place and it's because of the details. I'm crazy about details. First off, the staff are super friendly - front the hostess to the bus staff to the server. The outdoor seating area is composed of cute little colourful tables and chairs (WHICH DID NOT WABBLE), but rather sturdy and cute. They also have plants and flowers planted around the outdoor seating area. So, even though La Brea is noisy it makes up for it. Now lets get to the food. First, the coffee was good and I'm a bit of a coffee snob I must admit. But, I enjoyed it. A lot of breakfast/brunch places have great food but could use improvement on their coffee. Not this place...very decent coffee. We had the Eggs Florentine.Eggs Florentine: the english muffin was nice and crispy, the spinach was fresh and seasoned just right, the hollandaise sauce was not too thick and not too watery, just right...it didn't overtake the meal (which in some places it does) and the side potatoes were also cut fresh and pan fried....what I loved was that it was not hard nor too soft...just right and the amazing thing was that it did not taste oily....(which again, some place it does.) We also had the French Toast.French Toast: The size was perfect. The amount of Nutella swoosh, fruits and powdered sugar was the perfect amount...allowing the quality of the actual french toast to shine...Let's just say, I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I had a good portion of that dish! lolWill definitely be back!Well done."
8/22/2020,20200822,5,4.51,"The food was amazing. I had a party of two and waited 45 min. We got our food and sangria which were amazing by the way. The only thing that really ticked us off was that the busser told us if we're ""almost done because people are waiting"". Then Vinny - Owner- came out and apologized for this and even gave us a cold brew to go. So this obviously changed our perception of this restaurant."
8/23/2020,20200823,5,4.51,This place is simply excellent...ALL things below are 5 Star!!- Food - Service - Ambience
8/23/2020,20200823,5,4.51,"Love this place, Katrina helped us out and she was so nice. The food is also so flavorful, definitely recommend. I ordered the Thai chicken fried waffle and two poached eggs on the side because I was looking for that creamy texture and let me tell you, that combo was a party in my mouth. My boyfriend ordered the Benedict Florentine . The poached eggs were done beautifully and the hollandaise was flavorful. The potatoes were soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside . The drinks we ordered ( sangria ) were balanced and refreshing. Superb place and the staff as a whole are wonderful."
8/25/2020,20200825,5,4.51,Always friendly staff and great food and coffee. Neighborhood favorite! The chicken and waffle and the fried chicken sandwich are my go to items.
8/27/2020,20200827,5,4.51,Really great service. The place was very well prepared and kept clean and sanitary under the current circumstances. The food was absolutely delicious - I had the chicken pesto panini and it was so tasty and fresh. Definitely a place I am coming back to very soon!
8/28/2020,20200828,3,4.51,We had takeout from here and to be honest the food was lackluster. We ordered their crunchy french toast and expected it to be at least a little crispy. Unfortunately it was more similar to white bread. Our friends told us great things but upon trying we were hoping for better. Maybe we'll try again the the future. I am round the corner so hope they improve.
8/31/2020,20200831,5,4.51,Food was delicious! Chicken was seasoned perfectly! Waffle was fresh! Outdoor seating and about a 15 min wait. Definitely worth it.
9/3/2020,20200903,5,4.51,"Food is soooo delicious and creative, picking one thing to eat for brunch was one of the hardest decisions I've made for food in a while! Staff is super nice and really helpful in explaining dishes and helping you decide."
9/3/2020,20200903,5,4.51,This place is amazing definitely a MUST try and the fruity pebbles waffles is just an extraordinary taste that's so yummy !!!
9/4/2020,20200904,4,4.51,"Happy to say, that my fiancé and I felt comfortable with the precautions being taken during our visit here; All staff wore masks (some also had on face shields) and except while actively eating, all customers were also required to wear masks.We were able to check-in and ""get in line"" on the Yelp app when we were nearby (required to be within 1 mile radius before doing so) so that was helpful...we went from being 6th in line to 3rd in line by the time we parked and 2nd in line by the time we walked up to the restaurant. Street parking was pretty easily accessible.There were so many menu options that seemed like yummy choices that I feel like I have to go back again to try something else. However, I made a great choice this time around; the French toast were super flavorful and the corn flakes ""crunch"" addition just pushed them over the top. I'll definitely return."
9/6/2020,20200906,5,4.51,"Had a really nice experience here today. Considering all that is happening in the world and the heat wave in LA , I am appreciative of the owner and team for doing everything they can to ensure each guest has a a great experience. Requiring masks , having fans and tents available , texting when the table is ready. All of those steps really help to have an enjoying time . Thank you! Also the food is delicious  .Good ol comfort food, I had the chicken , waffles and a mimosa! I will be back!"
9/6/2020,20200906,5,4.51,Food was quick and delicious and service was great! Dog friendly as well! I would recommend the breakfast burrito :)
9/8/2020,20200908,4,4.51,"Good place to go to for COVID, had an off-putting experience hence the -1 star. While food was tasty, I can't imagine craving it, plus with health fee, and the incident below I don't believe I'll come back: 3.5 stars.Incident: our waitress accidentally dropped a sauce container from the next table on the ground. It splattered all over us. We got a sorry from her. I didn't realize the extent of it till I saw it splattered all over my mom and the wall behind her. I get it - things happen, and it absolutely wasn't on purpose. Her apology just didn't seem genuine: she did not really rush to bring a wipe and only just came back with more napkins without checking back on us later. We had to keep asking someone else for more wipes and the check as she was attending other tables. Especially during COVID, it was disgusting to have someone else's half eaten sauce splatter over our face/hair/clothes/food. So it really would have been nice of them to be more attentive afterwards. It's just a one-off incident - off-putting nonetheless.Also if you are dining in, there may be some flies - again nothing they can control. Just was bothering us.They also seem to charge a health fee of 3%. Just to keep in mind.Food: pretty good and tasty. A bit expensive but probably justified for the area and crowd.Chicken and waffles: juicy chicken and perfect portion. Crispy basil and spicy sauce/sweet butter adds to its uniqueness.Avocado toast: tasty, slightly elevated from the normal avocado toast. Side of potatoes: wish this was crispy. Try dipping it in the sweet butterMatcha latte: not our thing, but was fine. Was lukewarm.Service: friendly minus the incident above.Price: $55 (incl tip) for 2 people. We didn't have leftovers. Parking: plenty of metered street parking.COVID: outdoor seating (sidewalk) with good enough space between tables. Staff wears masks/clear plastic ones on top too. They are charging a health fee (when dining in?)"
9/11/2020,20200911,4,4.51,"Not even sure I need to write this review because the other reviews say it all. But, I still feel inclined to do so because of the wonderful experience my wife and I had here during breakfast. The service was great. We visited here during COVID restrictions and were promptly seated on the patio (10 minute wait +/-). The food was exceptional! Simple, fresh, healthy, and flavorful. My wife ordered a simple waffle and was blown away. That says a lot because she generally does not eat waffles or French toast. I, however, do eat those items and have had my fair share from various restaurants, and the waffles were fantastic! I definitely recommend you treat yourself!"
9/12/2020,20200912,4,4.51,"The food was average! The food is overpriced I like the restaurant decorations, vibe, and other things though! The workers are super friendly and it is a good place to grab a brunch!"
9/13/2020,20200913,5,4.51,"AMAZING brunch and service!!!! Outdoor seating, there was a small wait but well worth it"
9/15/2020,20200915,5,4.51,"Omg. I love this place! I've been to this spot a few times because I love some savory waffles for brunch! Part of the reason I love this place is that I'm gluten free, so I love that they offer gluten free waffles here. However, that doesn't mean the food doesn't taste good. The food is really good. My partner doesn't have any dietary restrictions and he's had the fried chicken which was also good. The atmosphere is very cute. I love the restaurant overall. The only thing I'd say is the wait is usually really long, so it's nice that you can check in on Yelp to join the waitlist prior. But other than the wait, it's all good. I am definitely a repeat customer at this joint!"
9/16/2020,20200916,5,4.51,Great fun times with good food and best mimosa chicken is juicy and tender omelette was cooked perfect
9/19/2020,20200919,3,4.51,I'm not sure if it was because of COVID-19 restrictions but the staff kept rushing us and asking if we needed anything else every 5 minutes and it was really annoying!!
9/21/2020,20200921,5,4.51,"I love this place. I first tried Met Her at a Bar last year and was so amazed by their waffles. I haven't found a chance to come back until a couple weeks ago and still amazing.What I ordered: the grain bowlTheir menu is huge - it has breakfast items, lunch items, waffles (obvi), and several toast. I went healthy this time around. The grain bowl was delicious. It's the classic grain bowl you'll find anywhere in LA, and Met Her at a Bar does it well. I got mine with a fried egg on top.The outdoor seating was pretty nice too. It's right by the street so a little loud, but what else do you expect in LA? The menu is contactless with a QR code you can easily scan right on the table.Thank you To Met Her at a Bar for the yummy food and great service!"
9/21/2020,20200921,4,4.51,The food was delicious and I'll certainly be back. I took clients here which maybe wasn't ideal because Covid restrictions kept us outdoors which was a bit noisy due to the busy road. The server was knowledge and attentive. They tack on an extra tax for employee benefits which I did not see mentioned on the menu but I was looking at it on my phone so I might have just missed it. If restaurants want to offer employees benefits I'm all for it but I think they should just make the meal prices higher instead of throwing on an unexpected tax with the bill. Hopefully it's noted on their full menu and I just missed it since I had the digital version pulled up on my phone.
9/22/2020,20200922,5,4.51,"This is a great spot right across the way from met her at a bar. Has outdoor dining, although they don't take reservations they do a great job to get you sat ASAP. Servers are all great and food is amazing!! Wish they had a bottomless or bottle deal for the mimosas but it's Hollywood and small owned business so happy to support during this time!"
9/25/2020,20200925,5,4.51,Delicious. Such an asset to the neighborhood. Obsessed w their wafflebello sandwich and fresh OJ. Drinks are always amazing. So many options.
9/26/2020,20200926,5,4.51,Came for brunch for my first time and was so impressed! The food was so tasty and the service was great! My glass of water never went empty - the staff was super quick and attentive which I really appreciated! I'll definitely be back!
9/27/2020,20200927,5,4.51,The service was amazing! Friendly staff. Constantly checked on you. The owner was great as well and they sang happy birthday to my wife with waffle dessert and gave us a small discount! Would go again.
9/28/2020,20200928,5,4.51,Great service and amazing food.There was an hour wait but totally worth it.As soon as we sat that we were approached they took our order and the food came out in less than 20 minutes. And I can say it was one of the best experiences I've had. I cant wait to go back!
9/28/2020,20200928,5,4.51,"I legit enjoyed every bite of the food! My friend and I had a brunch here and we ordered the French toast, chicken &waffles and avocado toast. We loved every single item! I am definitely coming back for more goodies!"
9/29/2020,20200929,4,4.51,"This place has become a neighborhood favorite of mine. My girls and I have become regulars as we have yet to have a bad experience. I am not sure that you can go wrong at this place as far as food is concerned. My two personal favorites are the Huevos Rancheros and the Chicken and Waffles. Beautiful presentation, unique approach to common dishes, and the aesthetic (pre-covid) which can come off a bit tight at times, gives the vibe of a New York Cafe. I would definitely recommend."
10/1/2020,20201001,5,4.51,"Seated immediately and was very strict about social distancing guidelines; WHICH I APPRECIATE A LOT. Server was nice, brought our food and water out quickly. The food was spectacular, my eggs and bacon were made to perfection. I love my eggs soft scrambled but places never seem to get it right but they were spot on! The chicken on the chicken and waffles was just ... phenomenal. I would go here for brunch everyday if I lived in LA."
10/3/2020,20201003,4,4.51,"We were a party of 5, however, they were packed and couldn't accommodate us. They directed us across the street to their brother restaurant Met Him At A Bar and they had the top dishes from Met Her's brunch menu. Still overall a good experience especially during Covid-19!"
10/4/2020,20201004,1,4.51,"Nice atmosphere but food was incredibly plain tastingand overpriced. We ordered takeout. French toast looked and tasted like regular ""toast"" not even coated in egg batter and crispy. Egg Benedict - the eggs were a little larger than the size of a silver dollar, Hollandaise sauce wasn't fresh nor did it even taste like hollandaise, the sourdough bread was so thin, also..they just threw big pieces of ham in there with no love. Peaches and cream waffle - no effort was put into it. These peaches we're supposed to be caramelized..think really they were? Definitely not. Overall very disappointed!"
10/4/2020,20201004,5,4.51,"Amazing foood!!!! The host saw us by the door and greeted us right away and took our order. The employees are so kind and welcoming. I felt comfortable being a person of color here. The food was amazing, the waffles are soooo tasty!! It's a little pricey if you have a bigger group but sooo worth it! This place made me a fan of breakfast."
10/5/2020,20201005,5,4.51,Love this place! A must stop if you are in the area! Green tea matcha wafffles ...ummmmm yaaaas! Delicious! Also had the Grain Bowl ! Pleasantly yummy
10/5/2020,20201005,5,4.51,Seating is limited and outdoor due to COVID. The waitress is very attentive. The food was delicious & I could tell they used real eggs which is a plus! The waffle was light and crispy. Honestly the meal was just PERFECT! I'd return & recommend it to my friends
10/5/2020,20201005,5,4.51,"I love Meet Me In Paris!!! I just got a thank you from my nurse at my Dr.'s appointment that I recommend her to try the restaurant . All my friends that I take there from out of town love love this place.Just delicious!! Please stay great!! Everyone plus me is highly impressed and we travel the world!! The owner and everyone has beautiful customer service. Keep up the great work!! This has helped ease the Pandemic Covid-19, some! Oh and I love the Alaskan!!!"
10/6/2020,20201006,4,4.51,First timer and let me tell you the service was great! And the FOOD WAS EVEN BETTER! Super cliche for my boyfriend and I because we MET a bar as well lol Due to Covid-19 seating is outside on the sidewalk which I wasn't too comfortable with because many cars and buses pass by! ALSO I DRANK WATER BECAUSE ORANGE JUICE IS OVERPRICED $6 to be exact ! Nevertheless I recommend this place :)
10/7/2020,20201007,5,4.51,"Came for brunch date with my bestie. I had been wanting to come to this spot for awhile and finally went. The waitress recommended ""You make me happy"" and I was for sure happy after my meal. It honestly hit the spot for me. I'm not big fan of waffles but this one was amazing fluffy and soft. The damn waffle was melting in my mouth lol. The lattes were delicious. They do have a small limit area of outdoor seating and the day I went it was super hot. The staff definitely checks in to make sure everything is going good."
10/8/2020,20201008,4,4.51,"We finally got the chance to try this place out, we were really happy with everything from the coffee, breakfast and mimosas, I can say the waiting was well worth it,"
10/10/2020,20201010,5,4.51,"Great food, great people, this place is definitely worth the wait. Had the French toast, my friend the Oreo waffles, both were AMAZING!!! I will definitely be returning, looking forward to eventually trying everything on their menu :D"
10/11/2020,20201011,5,4.51,This restaurant was wonderful. I took myBoyfriend for his birthday we had breakfast. We both enjoyed it. The customer service was great to.
10/11/2020,20201011,5,4.51,"Friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere & delicious food. My boyfriend and I had our anniversary brunch here and let me say, no regrets. The wait wasn't very long even though it was busy. The waiter was extremely chipper & friendly, very helpful. Mimosas were perfection. The food was to die for. Overall extremely satisfied. We even went back the next morning to get some food for the road we were upset. Definitely making this a goto spot when in town!"
10/11/2020,20201011,4,4.51,"I came on a Sunday and I got waffles and chicken. The service was great but I give the place 4 stars because the wait time is ridiculously long, we waited 2 hours to be seated."
10/12/2020,20201012,3,4.51,"This morning was the second time having breakfast here. I liked: Checking in on their iPad just inside the front door and then getting a text message when they had a table for me. It was 10 minute wait.  Being seated and having the gentleman adjust an umbrella so I wasn't sitting in the sun. The food (eggs Benedict last time, breakfast tacos today). I didn't like: The QR code on my table not working because it was faded, I logged onto YELP and viewed the menu there. The good news is the staff is wiping down the tables often enough to fade the QR code. Placing my food and drink order at the same time and never getting my drink (they did keep my water glass full). The louder than normal noise from construction vehicle traffic related to the subway station projects at La Brea Ave. and Wilshire Blvd. 3-stars is ""A-OK,"" and this place is okay. Both times I felt like the staff was trying hard to get everything right...but, just not quite able to pull everything together at the same time. I will go back."
10/15/2020,20201015,5,4.51,"Hubby and I stopped in for brunch on a Friday morning. We couldn't have been more pleased! There was quite a bit of a wait but not too shabby. Nothing unbearable. First let me say I love the set up. Tables outside, slightly socially distanced. All of the servers were great! We got seated and they brought us something to scan in order to bring the menu up on the phone! I'd already knew what I wanted. I saw a server bring out the chicken and waffles to another customer! There was nothing else for me to look at! The chicken was soooo juicy! So I'm not huge on condiments. There is a Thai chili sauce brought out with the meal that I'd planned to let sit on the side! But then my husband tried my chicken and waffles with the syrup on the waffle and the Thai chili on the chicken. And his humming while eating was enough to let me know I wanted the full experience! ZERO regrets! My husband had a breakfast platter (forgot the name) with waffles, eggs, sausage and bacon. Nothing too special but not bad. I saw quite a few options on the menu that I'd like to try! We'll have to circle back around and try it out! One thing I'll say, whether you met him/her at a bar, a club or the grocery store....this place is a good place to bring 'em for brunch!#Godisdope"
10/15/2020,20201015,1,4.5,"As a first time customer i had the most Horrible service from the minute I sat down. I was never asked if I wanted something to drink they brought water to the table maybe 10 mins after we sat down, they took our order maybe 25 min after we sat down.Even tho they have umbrellas for shade they won't let you move your away from the sun due to social distancing. I found a piece of plastic in my waffle it took them 30 kin to get me new one and I was still charged for it. And of course i did not leave a tip."
10/18/2020,20201018,5,4.51,"Okay, this place is a bit pricey...but so is every other restaurant on La Brea. My caramel vegan waffle was really really good. The coconut for a bit overwhelming after a few bites, but the waffle itself was the perfect texture and flavor. If I returned for it, I would either said less coconut or just get the berries on top of the vegan waffle. The berry waffle was not listed as vegan but my friend loved it! The breakfast potatoes were good.I would go back and just make the berries waffle vegan. The service was really good and they are really on top of the rules on Covid, which adds comfortability and safety to the environment. I really loved the chai latte with almond milk. I didn't have an issue with street parking and it was a Friday morning. It's such a cute brunch place. I would've had a mimosa except I was on a work break. But they have mimosas!!! I'm definitely returning!"
10/18/2020,20201018,5,4.51,This place was amazing and the French toast was incredible! The staff was also super nice and the outdoor seating was very trendy!
10/18/2020,20201018,5,4.51,Omg this place was amazing! Across the street from met him at the bar. John the waiter is so awesome. His customer service is above and beyond! All the food was amazing but the cauliflower tempura and the chicken and waffle (Thai style) was my favorite!!! Highly recommend.
10/19/2020,20201019,5,4.51,Just visiting from Texas and had to drop an review. John was great and knew the menu. Easily explained entrees and of course drinks. In LA for a nice brunch or lunch break? This place is perfect!!
10/20/2020,20201020,5,4.51,"Tried this place for breakfast/brunch Sunday morning and was wowed by the food quality AND service! So many restaurants during this Covid/pandemic time have slipped in service and food taste & quality that I really didn't know what to expect but my friends and I were pleasantly surprised. We arrived around 10am and were seated at about 10:40am (typical wait time for a good breakfast on a weekend in LA). Everyone was pleasant, thoughtful and in positive mood. We were greeted warmly and checked on throughout our time there. We ordered avocado toast which was some of the best I have ever had, tempura cauliflower, which was WELL SEASONED and cooked to perfection with a nice crunchy texture, the vegan salted caramel waffle which I added bananas to and an omelette with potatoes. The vegan waffle was delicious and an item I will come back for! High recommend this place but definitely get there early!! Due to only outdoor seating the space is limited and they are very popular."
10/21/2020,20201021,5,4.51,"This place is great! There's outdoor seating (covid compliant), but if you have a large party, you need everyone to be there to be seated. The food here is so good!!"
10/22/2020,20201022,5,4.51,"Cute little spot, Instagram worthy presentation, and everything tasted amazing! Would definitely come back here to try more!!"
10/23/2020,20201023,4,4.51,"Outside of the wait which they will say 15-20 mins which really is closer to an hour, everything else was great. The hostess is rude and tells everyone to order takeout if you ask her how long the wait is. She knew she was rude to me so that's why she didn't want to walk us to our table with our water once our table was ready, she had the bar back do it. Our waiter was very personable and made great suggestions, he has a good sense of humor as well. The manager, well whom I am assuming is the manager, was very nice and had good conversation as well."
10/24/2020,20201024,5,4.51,"After a friend recommended this place to me, I finally decided to try it and I must say the food didn't disappoint. The wait was quite long to get a table, but their service makes up for it. If you are looking for a cozy brunch spot in LA with a great atmosphere this is the place to go!"
10/25/2020,20201025,4,4.51,"Fantastic brunch menu, can't fault it, but for the limited outdoor seating option, so expect to wait. It's worth it, though, the food was marvellous!"
10/25/2020,20201025,5,4.51,Get the white truffle toast... wow just do it. Sooooooo freaking bomb!!!! I wish I could eat this restaurant every day!! Really want to go back and get the matcha waffles! We got our food so fast it was crazy!
10/26/2020,20201026,5,4.51,The food and service is beyond great . I'm truly going to miss this spot . I actually wished I hadn't waited so long to try .
10/26/2020,20201026,5,4.51,WOW! The chicken and waffles were perfection. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist with fantastic texture inside. The waffle was perfect size. The Thai chili sauce was an awesome spice to add to the chicken. I also had a chai latte that was awesome! Service was friendly and price was great!
10/26/2020,20201026,5,4.51,One of my favorite breakfast spots. Their avaocado toast is to die for. Bacon is cooked perfectly and scrambled eggs are nice and fluffy. A go to spot for sure.
10/27/2020,20201027,5,4.51,"This place gave me hope in LA...Coming to town from NY, the service everywhere seemed off. The service has been slow, the servers apoplectic, and everyone content with the mediocrity of it all.In terms of food, the places I had been up until today ran up $300 tabs for two for dinner yet delivered only on ambiance and hardly on flavor.Then came this breakfast before my flight this morning. The server was exciting, the service fast, and the food delicious. This is now one of my favorite breakfast spots anywhere. I would highly recommend."
10/27/2020,20201027,5,4.51,Awesome service and amazing food. Thanks for serving us sitting this pandemic. The outdoor dining was wonderful. It was busy but no wait!
10/28/2020,20201028,2,4.51,"Eh... nothing special to be honest.I think people might wanna go here just cuz of the name lol and it looks crowded. But there is just a few seats outside.Waited for about 40 min to get a table which wasn't bad. The service kinda sucked. The girl was nice and all but she wasn't really listening so I had repeat everything a million times. A little excessive on the whole covid thing. Which most places unfortunately are. I moved my chair a bit cuz of the sun and one of the guys working there told me to move so I won't be too close to the other people. Kinda just want to say relax. People are taking it to the extreme. Moved, but only for a few minutes. I'd rather take my business somewhere else if that's how these business will be. Parking, you pretty much have to get lucky. I guess depending on what time you get there. I was there for lunch and found parking right away. Food was nothing special. Had the chicken sandwich and it wasn't good. The morning potatoes were good but then again I love anything potato. Fried Cauliflower was okay. The one thing I liked was their vanilla latte. Wouldn't go back."
10/28/2020,20201028,4,4.51,"Overall the restaurant itself 4 stars while I give the waffles a 5 star. There is a long wait during the weekend but thank God for Yelp Waitlist. They are doing outside dining. It was kind of my first time doing outside dining in LA and it was kinda loud and dusty, but that comes with dining outside. I ordered a waffle that came with a side of eggs, sausage and bacon. The eggs, sausage and bacon were decent, your standard breakfast food, but the waffle is the highlight. The waffle is so light and has a good amount of that dough not just the crisp. Topped it off with butter and syrup and it was heavenly. Great size and tasting. Service was very good as well"
10/28/2020,20201028,5,4.51,Our new fave place to hang-out and eat despite the pandemic. They have exceptionally good food with great customer service! Will definitely go back again here with my besties!
11/1/2020,20201101,5,4.51,Food is excellent. Staff was very accommodating. There is a variety of waffle dishes that are certain to please everyone
11/1/2020,20201101,5,4.51,"This place was amazing, it's the cutest environment. They're also following the COVID safety rules which made me feel extremely comfortable being here! My server Duffy was perfect, he was so sweet & attentive! He looked out for my friend when she wasn't feeling good, he was just all around awesome! The food was amazing, & the mimosas were just right! Thanks again Duffy for the great service, I will definitely be returning very soon!"

Whenever I'm on this side of town for work though, this spot is a must! Normally I'd have a food picture for you but, I lit up my plate and scarfed that shit like the dragons on game of thrizones. Meet her at a bar... she fine! She can twerk! Make them pancakes CLAP! SKIRRRTT SKIRRRT!"

11/5/2020,20201105,1,4.51,This is my second time here the first time before Covid was great... however today the outdoor dining was definitely really disappointing due to the very loud street traffic and construction next door. The food was cold and definitely not as I expected we ordered the Florentine eggs Benedict and the wake up happy breakfast dishes and the taste was lacking. Not to mention there was a bug in my iced tea and didn't receive any refills on it. Had a few friends ask about it because the dishes in the picture looked appealing however wouldn't recommend.

Anyhow, despite of the wait and noticing that i was not sitted by the wait list wait, coffee was fresh ... and the weather was just perfect. Is the Healthcare love % mandatory? Shouldn't customers be advise of this extra charge? I think so. It is the principle. So not ok with this, yet I paid."

Nevertheless, the brunch menu still has good food for your first meal on a Sunday morning. *Be wary, my review may be different if the food was fresh and ready. I ordered for take-out.*Ordered the classic eggs Benedict, and it was a 3/5. The poached eggs were fairly small, and the ham didn't seem special. I love crispy potato bites in general, but the side potatoes were not that flavorful and not crunchy. The waffles, eggs, bacon, and sausage plate appeared fairly regular for a breakfast plate. I must say the food did seem delicious though.Overall, good restaurant for breakfast food. The meal just did not meet the hype the restaurant normally gets. I may give it another try after exploring other brunch spots in LA and a different plate."

I get it, it's busy but that's not an excuse. Staff members should be trained on how to handle busy situations better so they can treat their paying customers better and not take their stress out on us.Next, we were the only guests that were sat directly in the sun with no umbrella getting charred af, told our hostess and our server about it but got no help. No one came to check on us for a long time so we had no choice but to attempt to move tables to get out of the sun. Then we were put on blast really loud by the blonde hostess in front of all the other guests and told to move back to our table. It was embarrassing.ONLY THEN did the owner come out personally and get us an umbrella to block the sun. It's messed up that the owner even had to do that, staff members should be on top of it and pay attention to their guests.The Chicken and Waffles was bomb. But the bad service overshadowed the good food. If the service was great things would be different.Bad first experience. If I come back I hope it would be a better experience next time."

All delicious! Well made the food and coffee was hot! Mimosa was crisp and fresh. Service - super super friendly! I cannot remember the name of the gentlemen who helped me but he was the best. We had a nice conversation and he definitely knows what he's talking about when it comes to the food recs. Decor - I sat inside at the window bar. It was perfect for people watching outside and still inclusive of the interior. The have this beautiful wall mural to the right of in. The entire inside is bright, vibrant blues and yellow. Great place for daytime dining. Much more spacious and an appetizing space than the sister location across the street. I actually stumbled here because I was on line at Met Her At A Bar across the street(same owner I believe) but the wait was over an hour so I came to this spot. I went just three weeks after they opens so it wasn't crowded, it's so good I'm sure it gets more crowded nowadays."

I came here for breakfast and got the mama breakfast with a side salad. Since there is no indoor dining we had to sit outside on la brea Ave. it was still pretty early (after 8am) and the noise was very noticeable. I can't imagine what it's like later on the day on this busy street. The breakfast was pretty good, but nothing exciting. It did the job. Friendly service, pet friendly."

11/24/2020,20201124,5,4.49,"Compliant with covid measures (:We arrived around 2pm on a Sunday and waited approximately 30 min for a table for 3. We have been so excited to come try this place that we were overwhelmed with the menu options. We ended up sharing an organic matcha waffle, the crispy French toast, portobello mushroom sandwich and a strawberry ricotta toast. I wouldn't even be able to tell you which one of these plates was the best because they were all so bomb and had their own WOW factor. The basil on top of the strawberry ricotta toast was very refreshing. I definitely want to come back and try more thingsDrinks:My friend and I both ordered a matcha latte (one hot one iced) and I thought it was a bit too light on the matcha for my taste. I have had more rich matcha. It was also not very hot when it arrived which sucked but wasn't a deal breaker. All in all: the staff was friendly, the dine out experience was nice, and the food was delish!Expect to hunt for parking or better yet: get dropped off(:"
11/28/2020,20201128,4,4.49,"Great spot for brunch! The restaurant is heavily waffle based with different versions of waffles, some classics breakfast options and sandwiches. Cute spot - doesn't take reservations and is quite popular. Would recommend going early in the am. Street parking is available and also there is a parking lot across the street. They don't have unlimited mimosas and $12 seems steep for 1 glass, would recommend trying the coffees instead. They have taken precautions for Covid and are only seating patrons outside with social distancing rules. Highly recommend this spot for their waffles !"
11/28/2020,20201128,5,4.49,"Can't put into words how amazing this spot is...in particular the Thai chicken and waffles. Literally legendary status! Great food, great people! Somewhat of a wait due to the status of our current global situation but...make a reservation and be patient. Worth it"
11/29/2020,20201129,4,4.49,"Pretty good chicken and waffles!Service was okay. The host won't let you sit until your whole party is there but she says ""there are plenty of tables."" So not exactly the most hospitable. Parking is okay, not bad at all. I found metered street parking nearby and there's also other neighboring side streets to park at. Food again was great. My friend and I weren't too hungry so we had a few drinks and bites of food to share. Cute little corner spot that I always wanted to check out."
11/29/2020,20201129,5,4.49,So tasty. Been many times for breakfast and lunch. Avo toast with a side of scrambled eggs. Just like heaven. Will be ordering takeout for the time being. Hope they continue to thrive.

12/12/2020,20201212,4,4.49,"My brother kept singing about this place for so long that on his next visit I decided to join him and not disappointed at all!I liked how the menu had creative names for their dishes (love a good word pun) and how they also added their little love story of how they met - at a bar!We had the berry french toast (I dont remember the name of the plates but I'm sure if you show them a picture or describe they'll know), oreo waffles, fruity pebbles and ice cream waffles, and strawberry ricotta toast (only one I though it was a little meh compared to other plates but still pretty good) and left there completely full and satisfied!Gotta say because it's a small restaurant they are always packed but even then the wait is not that long (20-30 minutes on a saturday), and they have some meters around for street parking as well.They are dog friendly but their patio is very small with only three tables so you might have to wait a bit longer if you want to brunch with your dog (for which I do!)Also on that matter they make sure your dog is on the floor even though he's tiny, almost hairless, and stays quietly on your lap without bothering anyone :(("
12/14/2020,20201214,5,4.49,Great food!! The service is OKAY but can't complain for the price and the food and location. I do wish they had turkey bacon or beef bacon or turkey or beef sausages! Not many people eat pork anymore especially for a place that has vegan options I'd expect there to be some but food was good! Will be back!!
12/18/2020,20201218,5,4.49,"Get breakfast here about once a month and have never been disappointed or underwhelmed. I have to give them credit during COVID for their breakfast takeout, even though it's not the same as dine in, it's still fresh and delicious. Everyone that I've encountered who works here is super nice, polite and eager to serve. Owner is often present and displays same attitude as his employees. Will come here again and again and I would encourage you to do the same."
1/1/2021,20210101,5,4.49,I'm a night shift nurse and coming here always makes me feel better especially if I just got off a long shift. Their mimosas and waffles are amazing! And the french toast!Mimosas - champagne to OJ ratio on pointWaffles - sweet AND savory waffles are so good. My goal is to try all of them French toast - got this as delivery once and still great. The owners and staff are amazing. I always recommend this place to people!
1/4/2021,20210104,4,4.49,Bought breakfast from here last Saturday (Jan 2) for the first time and I'm glad to say it was a great experience! Me and my boyfriend placed our order ahead of time for pick up. The customer service was great. I got the vegan burrito and my boyfriend had the matcha waffle which looked amazing! Definitely will be going back.
1/6/2021,20210106,5,4.49,"I ordered two things that I am not really a big fan of when I went to this brunch location - chicken and waffle and French toast. I never find chicken and waffle to go that well together and usually I only get basic chicken tenders and waffles. However, this chicken and waffle really blew me out of the park! It comes with a sweet n spicy sauce that also complemented the flavor of the chicken. The chicken and waffle are 5/5!!Regarding the French toast, it was not too sweet and crispy on the edges just like I like it. The only complaint I have about it is that I wish it came with more berries. I feel like I was rationing the berries too much because of the amount.I should also mention since I had to do a pickup order I wasn't eating all this food super fresh (30 minutes or so), but both the dishes tasted amazing. I made my order through Yelp and the food was ready much before the estimated time, which I was thankful for but I wish the Yelp app was a bit more accurate."
1/6/2021,20210106,5,4.49,"My 1st time dining here was during the pandemic. Great service & food! Reasonably priced cocktails. There are just a few tables for outdoor dining, but worth the 45 min wait. I recommend putting your name down and finding something to do nearby as they will text you when your table is ready!"
1/15/2021,20210115,4,4.49,"I found this place on Postmates one morning, searching for Belgian waffles for my kids. This was one of the five places nearby, and after looking through their menu, we decided on giving this place a try. Since that initial delivery order, we have ordered from them 3 or more times now, and we are never disappointed.From the Oreo Waffles to the White Truffle Toast to the Breakfast Burrito and more, you can never go wrong. Everything we've ordered from this place has been great. Serving size is perfect. Presentation is nice and the flavors and tastes are just right for the palate.I can't wait until we can be back eating at the establishments, this will be one of my first stops, but for not, I will continue to support this small business with pickups and deliveries."
1/18/2021,20210118,2,4.49,"Gotta say this place used to be one of my favorites. Just moved back to the area and really wanted to come here again, but think I'm gonna save my money for somewhere else. $14+ for a cappuccino and dirty chai? I can accept that if it tastes good and is FULL. Unfortunately, after waiting 10+ minutes for our drinks when we were the only customers, my cappuccino arrived almost half empty. I was hoping it would at least taste good, but that wasn't to be either. I'm giving two stars simply because I used to love this place years ago and nostalgia makes me remember what it used to be."
1/20/2021,20210120,5,4.49,Probably my favorite breakfast spot in mid city. I always get the French toast but the power omelets are also really good AND everyone I've taken here has always loved the food. I've done takeout a lot during the pandemic and the food is always just as good when I get it home.
1/21/2021,20210121,5,4.49,"I love it, took my girl there to eat, really good, special flavors, good atmosphere if Covid wasn't around I'd be there all the time eating and recovering from a night out in the town! I recommend for sure! Go, don't deny yourself the pleasures of this place, and the waffles are fire!"
1/22/2021,20210122,5,4.49,"""What was that place called? 'Met my Husband' or something?  They had BOMB chicken and waffles.""An actual conversation between my mom and I that led us here. Luckily we remembered the name so we can pickup nice brunch. And they DO have amazing Chicken & Waffles!! [$19]It's Thai-inspired so it's slightly spicy with more hot sauce if you wish. Their waffles are buttery and delicious. It's not as good after a 30 min drive back home vs eating it there.. But still good as we can get! Tried something new -- White Truffle Toast. [$15.5]Great truffle taste and their scrambled eggs really good. Simple but executed well. We got it so I could be inspired to elevate my brunch game haha.Honestly it was the fluffy grated cheese on top (from the photos) that sold it for me. Wish it had more cheese. I kinda missed in-house dining bc then I could get endless parmesan cheese...nonstop...! Honestly I wonder if someone did meet their husband or wife at Met Her at a Bar! Love to hear it."
1/30/2021,20210130,4,4.49,"The avocado toast is delicious! I added an egg on top of mines and it was perfect. The bread edges are a little rough though and hard to chew, but besides that it's something I would order again. The chicken and waffles were solid too."
1/30/2021,20210130,5,4.49,"I never write reviews but I just couldn't let today pass by without expressing my thoughts after dining here today.

I've never had a bad experience with them and the story of how this place came to be is just the cutest. It is a bit small inside and can get crowded just as a warning; the earlier the better. i'll definitely continue to support their establishment. This place is a MUST!!! Can't wait to come back for more
2/7/2021,20210207,4,4.49,"Cute little spot in mid city/mid Wilshire area. Good food, good vibes, and service was great! Went Friday early afternoon and no wait so that's a plus since this place is always packed every time I pass it. Started off with a sangria and then ordered a waffle Benedict with a side of potatoes. Yum yum!"
2/12/2021,20210212,5,4.49,"Great brunch/breakfast spot and worth a visit! ~COVID 19~ Outdoor dining only with socially distanced tables. ~FOOD~1) Avocado toast, 5/5- This avocado toast is everything avo toast should be! Delicious avocado spread over a toasted sourdough, with tomatoes and a sprinkling of soft and cheesy parmesan and added two fried eggs on top. It was magical. 2) Waffletella, 5/5- SO YUM. Idk about you but anytime I go for brunch I need a sweet entree in addition to my savory dish so I opted for the nutella waffle. Fluffy, chocolatey, fruity and amazing. Sprinkled with a dusting of powdered sugar, no syrup is even needed. ** 5/5 on food presentation**~Service~5/5, service was great! Meals were brought out in a timely fashion and I was never left waiting for anything. Overall, I would definitely come here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a great brunch spot in LA. The restaurant also has such a cute story on their name and you can read about it on their menu *insert heart eyes*"
2/13/2021,20210213,4,4.49,"A big fan of their lattes! This time I got it with oat milk that gives my latte some body. Delicious!Their matcha waffles are crack! Great to share between two! Customer service is excellent, very attentive and they take orders outside during covid.I'd like to try their other restaurant across the street, Italian!"
2/13/2021,20210213,4,4.49,"Yummy Iced lattes , very friendly tall guy took our order out front for a to go order . We just got the iced lattes and the matcha waffle .The man who took our order was patient and gave us several suggestions without making us feel rushed or that we were of burden to him ( even though the restaurant is considerably busy )Met Him at a Bar is just across the street and you can take your food to the La Brea Tarpits and Museum just down the road if you are still feeling iffy about outdoor dining like us .Minus a star just because my latte seemed a little off on the coffee to milk ratio ratio this time , but still good and have had better coffee here before . Matcha Waffle"
2/15/2021,20210215,5,4.49,"Picked up some breakfast to-go and it was great! I ordered the Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. The fruit was very fresh and waffle was light and delicious. Ordered some bacon, sausage and waffles for my partner who also loved the food. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable as well!"
2/15/2021,20210215,5,4.49,"My wife wanted me to meet her at a bar and here I am writing this review. Are y'all ready for the Mihr Report? Covid Precautions 5/5: All staff were properly masked and tables were spread out and they were very clean. Customer Service 5/5: We checked in on the tablet inside and as we were waiting outside Emily, the hostess, made sure we had checked in. We had to run a quick errand while waiting for our table and were kicked off the wait list. When we came back Emily recognized us and remembered my name even while being masked! I don't even recognize my wife when she is walking straight towards me. All the servers were super nice and checked on us frequently. This is my long winded way of saying they take good care of you. Ambiance 4/5: Tables are setup along the sidewalk. Not the nicest views but very nice colorful seating. Drinks 4/5: I had the drip coffee and my wife had the latte and both were good. The mugs are a nice touch! Food 5/5: Very delicious and unique food options. We had the fried chicken and waffle, which was delicious and the waffle benedict. It was sweet and savory just how we like it! Parking 3/5: Street parking can be tricky but during COVID you should be able to find a spot. What are you waiting for? Go meet her at a bar."
2/15/2021,20210215,5,4.49,"Totally recommend the ranchos habanero's, and the Matcha waffles!! Even the matcha oat tea!!! Mmm. The presentation is absolutely perfect! Beautiful food, and tasty and great hospitality. The staff all works together as a team, they keep checking on tables and everyone to make sure they are taken care of!! Amazing service"

2/19/2021,20210219,5,4.49,This place was so good the yelp waitlist was so accurate and my friend enjoyed her birthday brunch
2/20/2021,20210220,5,4.49,"Another amazing trip to met her at a bar,. The food is nothing short of amazing! I was a little underwhelmed with the chicken pesto panini this time around only for the simple fact that pesto seemed like it was just all Mayo and a little dry. But everything else we had was spot on the matcha waffles were something new we tried and wow they were the show stopped of our trip! My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito and said it was delicious.We were taken care of by Jake and when I tell you that man was the sweetest, most upbeat server I've had in a while I'm not lying. Anything we asked from him he got it with no hesitation and you can tell he was smiling under his mask. We will Ofcourse be back very soon and hopefully Jake will be there!"
2/21/2021,20210221,5,4.49,It was a far drive out from where we live in LA; We had high hopes and they did not disappoint. Definitely come by here and give them a try if breakfast is your thing.
2/21/2021,20210221,5,4.5,"Every single time this place hits the mark with quality, presentation, and taste. I've only had the food delivered during quarantine and it is always delicious, perfectly packaged and flawless in its consistency. I've been a big fan of the layered style Huevos Rancheros and my daughter loves the waffles. Thank you for making many of my mornings brighter."

2/23/2021,20210223,5,4.5,"In my opinion you can't go wrong here!I live very close by this place so I've ordered breakfast here a handful of times. Everything tastes clean, fresh, and delicious! Some of my favorite items on the menu would have to be the Grain Bowl, the Strawberry Ricotta Toast, and the Black Bean Avocado Wrap. I've eaten in person and ordered takeout and both are great options. The only downside is that in person you might have to wait a bit for a table because this place is typically fairly crowded around brunch time.Highly recommend if you want a fun brunch with great food!"
2/23/2021,20210223,4,4.5,Very attentive service. Out door seating is so nice on a sunny day. Great brunch and amazing Nutella waffle! My bestie had the vegan waffle and we both can't wait to come back. Nice start to normalcy despite the pandemic.

2/25/2021,20210225,5,4.5,"Tried this place for the first time and loved it. Wasn't expecting the Chicken & waffles to be that different than what I am used to ordering at restaurants that have them as well, but they were really good! They are prepared Thai style with peppers and the Thai sauce. It tasted really good and unique.I will define you be coming back! Just make sure you get there early on the weekends because it can get busy!"
2/26/2021,20210226,4,4.5,"Pricing is fair & portion sizes are decent. The crispy French toast was perfectly sweet. The fresh fruit made the whole dish come together (I hate fruit syrups). The Thai Fried Chicken & Waffles was different, juicy & superrrr tasty with Thai spices. Sausages were good, but small & nothing special bout them. The Avocado Toast is pretty, but bland & overpriced. I make better avocado toast at home. Customer service was great and presentation is beautiful."
2/26/2021,20210226,5,4.5,"Can't explain in words how to describe except, All these items were so goooood!!!!! Worth every penny!!!!!"
2/27/2021,20210227,5,4.5,"I'm EMBARRASSED! I've been to Met Her At A Bar over a handful of times and I've never written a review. So here I am finally. This place is absolute fire and lives up to the hype. My normal go too would be a mimosa and some French toast but my life is different these days lol.This time around I got the breakfast burrito with some chipotle aioli. An absolute smash. Also light on the stomach... I subbed out the meat for some avocado. Fresh, flavorful, and a bit of basic. In the best way possible. Customer service is always super hospitable. The vibe and ambience is hip/trendy. Our server today Jon, hit us with great energy off the bat. Was extremely attentive and helpful.I recommend this place to everybody, especially friends and family looking for a lunch/ brunch to eat at while visiting LA."
2/27/2021,20210227,5,4.5,"Met Her At A Bar is by far the BEST brunch spot in LA. No contest. The food is incredible (and gorgeous, your IG feed will love it) and the staff is amazing & friendly. Literally everything is good but top choices for me are the chicken & waffles, the avocado toast, and the matcha waffles are to DIE for. All the servers are incredibly attentive and go above and beyond to give you a good experience. Also check out their sister restaurant next door for dinner, Met HIM At A Bar, for some great pasta dishes."
3/1/2021,20210301,4,4.5,"Let me start off by saying I love the food! Great service as well.However, one thing I hate the most is getting charged for things I am not made aware of. When it came to paying I was given a receipt with an additional 4 dollars for donation for healthcare. Keep in mind I was never asked if I wanted to donate....and when I was asked what that charge was for I was explained it was for donation but If I wanted they could remove it....I left it ..... but, then I also got charged automatically $20 for service tip. Again never told I would be charged this. (4 adults and 1 kid)"
3/1/2021,20210301,5,4.5,"Highly recommend Avocado toast and waffles! Back story behind the owners is really cute. I do recommend arriving early and expect to wait awhile as it is a popular place. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable. Parking can be difficult sometimes but again, arrive early."
3/1/2021,20210301,5,4.5,Tried this for the 1st time with a group of friends. California was closed so we pretty it to go. Ordered the chicken and the waffle. I knew it be delicious. Love thai fried chicken and the spices. The butter that came with the waffle was good too. Really like sweet and savory tastes. The next time I'm in California I will be sure to check out this restaurant again.
3/1/2021,20210301,5,4.5,This brunch is the bomb.com. My boyfriend and I went on a random Tuesday morning and were very pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. He had the waffles and I had the avocado toast.
3/2/2021,20210302,5,4.5,"there was a wait time but no more than 20 minutes, hands down one of the best place I've gone to! Outside seating but there's shade. Thank you guys for the fast and delicious service!"
3/3/2021,20210303,5,4.5,"This was one of the best brunches I've had in quiet some time! Came here on a Sunday around 11am. It was super busy at the actual resto, wait time was 30 mins. However that day, staff told us we could also go across to the blue restaurant who was also serving the same menu (might have been a partnership or both places owned by same owner?) for a potential shorter wait time. We ended up getting seated immediately for a party of 2, which was awesome. My friend and I ordered two plates and shared. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! The Breakfast Sandwich has a chipotle aioli on it that makes the sandwich super favorable and the Crispy French Toast has a nice crunch to it (lives up to its name lol) - I preferred not to add the syrup as it was sweet enough on its own. Customer service was friendly and they were attentive! The waiter who helped us out answered our questions thoroughly and was polite. Tables are separated and there's also a plastic see through separation from people waking by, so I felt comfortable dining outdoors. Would definitely go back again!"
3/3/2021,20210303,5,4.5,Breakfast is my favorite at this location. French toast are my go to. Also COVID-19 safe !!
3/7/2021,20210307,5,4.5,"Looking for a breakfast spot that was open and found this on Yelp. We had a party of 4 and got seated immediately. Our server John came right away to get our drink order. He was so energetic and had the best attitude. We each ordered something different and it was all delicious. I had the truffle toast and OMG, I ate every last bite. We will definitely be coming back for sure."
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.5,"The ABSOLUTE BEST brunch in LA. It's such a cute place. I love it so much and bring anyone that comes in town to visit me. Everyone that i have brought has been amazed by the food. The food is great, the staff is nice, and the owner is sooo friendly and accommodating! My favorites on the menu are the Thai chicken and waffles , the truffle waffle fries , and the smoked salmon which I order as a side. The iced latte is also really good which they let me choose flavors and the kind of milk I wanted. Definitely make the time to come here!"
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.5,"drove all the way from oc with my girlfriends and the food was superb! Cameron whom I believe is the hostess has an amazing attitude and accommodated my party, 10/10 recommend coming here and I will return!"
3/11/2021,20210311,5,4.5,"Crispy French Toast was so yummy! The service was fast and the workers were very friendly. Only downside is with outdoor dining, it's at an intersection so it's pretty loud with traffic. Besides that, loved the food!"
3/12/2021,20210312,5,4.5,today there was a wait but we got seated quite quickly thanks to our wonderful host Cameron! she was so nice and thoughtful and i followed her recommendation and got the chorizo toast and it was incredible! Highly suggest coming here and say hi to cameron for us!
3/14/2021,20210314,5,4.5,Amazing from start to finish well organized fast and efficient table booking calendar and service and yummO
3/14/2021,20210314,5,4.5,We drove here from San Diego for my sister's birthday and this place did not disappoint. The food was amazing with beautiful presentation. The customer service was great (especially when dining with twin toddlers- the staff was attentive) and we even brought our dog. This place definitely left an impression on my sister. Thank you!
3/14/2021,20210314,5,4.5,"Love this place!! I come here a lot for solo brunches. The staff is super nice, food tastes great!!!!! Service is pretty quick also! It's one of the few places in mid city where I can enjoy a cute, cozy brunch"
3/15/2021,20210315,5,4.5,"Omg, my friend and I tried this place a week ago for brunch and SOO happy we waited to try it! I got the french toast and it was delicious and their mimosas were perfect! Dont wait until you're starving to go and add yourselves to the waitlist because it did take about 2-3 hrs. The staff was super friendly and quick too! 10/10 highly recommend!"
3/15/2021,20210315,4,4.5,"We drove 30 mins for this pasta. So yumba, we got three pastas, an appetizer, and two desserts for two people. The staff was very kind and friendly. Great ambiance... definitely worth the drive"
3/15/2021,20210315,5,4.5,Visited here for the first time with my girlfriend (who I actually met at a bar lol) and the food tasted great! Service was awesome the staff was super friendly and made sure to check up on us often. Outdoor dining was great to enjoy the LA morning sun.
3/15/2021,20210315,1,4.5,"It was my first time at this restaurant, & I was trying to decide if I wanted to eat in or dine out. I asked for a menu, I was instructed to scan the scanner. However I didn't have my phone on hand. I asked was there any other form of menu that I could look at? I was told no! How is that possible? It's a restaurant for goodness sake's. I asked what were you doing before Covid? Therefore I was unable to order anything because the only option I had was to scan the scanner. By the Time I walked back to my car which was down the street to obtain my phone, I was too frustrated. Thanks but no thanks."
3/17/2021,20210317,4,4.5,"This place is very convenient, the food had a good taste to it. I tried the pesto chicken panini, the Nutella waffles and the Florentine poach eggs. The only complaint I had was not even the wait but how they are handling the outdoor seating! We sat in the sun the whole time, they don't have enough umbrellas or shade to cover all the tables outside! But other wise this place was good. The food and service were on point!"
3/18/2021,20210318,5,4.5,"The menu is fantastic and creative. I had the Thai fried chicken & waffle and it was delicious. The mâitre de, Sunny stopped by our table to check on us and he was lovely. Every employee we encountered was wonderful."
3/18/2021,20210318,5,4.5,"This was literally some of the best chicken and waffles we've ever had - and everything else was amazing too! We got to chat with Mindy, one of the owners, and our server was awesome. Highly highly recommend!!"
3/19/2021,20210319,4,4.5,The food was outstanding and the wait time wasn't so bad. A little more attention to detail would have been nice. The traffic noise was a bit much which was the top reason of losing a star. The restroom walls are very fashionably modern. The mid to top portion. The seating was a bit iffy until we got use to it then it was fine.
3/20/2021,20210320,5,4.5,"Met friend here today for brunch. It was a first for the both of us. Surprisingly not a long wait, as we were seated right away. They offer indoor and outdoor seating, as well as additional seating across the street. But I don't think the seating across the street has the entire menu. I ordered the You Make Me Wake Up Happy with no breakfast meat, added mushrooms and avocado instead, with a side of breakfast potatoes. The portions are huge and definitely didn't need to order the potatoes. However, they were delicious so glad I got them! The waffle was great as well. And the mimosas were well made. Had a nice little buzz after 2. Staff was friendly and attentive and I would definitely go back!"
3/20/2021,20210320,1,4.5,"Burnt toast, terrible service. Unorganized pick up process. Spent 20$ for a terribly bad brunch. Im a start looking at other places."
3/21/2021,20210321,5,4.5,"Visiting from Sacramento and this place was AMAZING. The attention to our table, the presentation of our food, the atmosphere, and service was all phenomenal! Will come back next visit down to SoCal"
3/21/2021,20210321,5,4.5,"I definitely wanted to try this place out after reading the reviews and i was highly satisfied. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with a side of potatoes , it was a nicely sized portion and everything was seasoned perfectly. Will be returning when i visit California again ."
3/24/2021,20210324,5,4.5,"Out door seating, the wait wasn't long, the food was fantastic. I wasn't a fan of the mimosas but the food was good and the coffee was good"
3/24/2021,20210324,1,4.5,"First of all, when I called and tried to make a reservation they said they don't do reservations. When we arrived at the place we still had to be on a waiting list. We waited at least 20 minutes. Second of all, after we ordered our food we waited a another good 20 minutes, the Hispanic server finally beings our food out and gives it to the wrong table. After 2 minutes he realized that he gave it to the wrong table. So guess what he tried to do? He tried to give the food back to us after the other customers touched the food. As a former food industry worker, that's a BIG NO. You should always throw the food away as soon as you gave it to the wrong person. He never even apologized for his actions. We got very upset and just left. I felt like they were disorganized because while we were waiting. The server brought out food and asked others if it belonged to them. Other than that, Sunny and our waiter was friendly to us. We really wanted to love this place because of the cute story behind it, but unfortunately, it only takes one person to ruin it."
3/26/2021,20210326,1,4.49,The place was absolutely awful. They basically seat you next to a busy and extremely loud and polluted street eating your breakfast next to homeless people. I could not hear my friend and I was so annoyed by the noise of the street. We decided to sit inside and it was even worse. Pretty load and noisy. If you're looking to go somewhere decent to enjoy your meal this is not the RIGHT PLACE. Very disappointed. The food was nothing to write home about.
3/26/2021,20210326,1,4.49,"If you are a tourist in LA, DO NOT BE FOOLED by all the five-star reviews of this place. It is literally in the middle of nowhere with a teeny tiny indoor eating space that has mishmash decor and an outdoor seating that is absolutely abominable. There are homeless people literally next to you as you eat and what appears to be a busy thoroughfare street for transportation trucks - smog and exhaust fumes hovering over my omelette is not exactly appetizing. Not the Los Angeles glamour that I was expecting and definitely didn't see any celebrities which they probably post as a hook to lure you to their restaurant because otherwise no one in their right mind would be going to that area. I busted out laughing when I saw the place because I thought the locals are trying to play some cruel joke on unsuspecting tourists (by artificially inflating the reviews), or that celebrities do come here sometimes to see what it's like to live outside of the Hills and feel more grateful for what they have. One star because the waitstaff was actually quite nice and attentive."
3/27/2021,20210327,5,4.49,Customer service was Great! Cameron did a great Job assisting us !! Food was delicious!
3/28/2021,20210328,5,4.49,"I am particularly difficult to please, which should speak volumes about me recommending this spot. A LA must for brunch any day of the week!"
3/29/2021,20210329,5,4.49,"First time going this Sunday, it was fantastic. The host Cameron was amazing. She sat my party down immediately and had load of recommendations, had a great time and will be back"
3/29/2021,20210329,4,4.49,There's a big hype about this place that I have noticed. It is a super good place with tons of options for waffles and a few other things. The price is about average and everyone there is extremely sweet and friendly.
3/30/2021,20210330,3,4.49,"The food is so yummy here!Except when the Chicken & Waffle arrived, the waffle was cold! When I told the waiter, he asked rudely, ""how long has the food been on your table?!"" They did end up making me a new waffle. However, when I asked for check, the waiter Proudly said ""I didn't charge your for the new waffle"". Seriously! It is not my fault the waffle is cold. Also, I think they tried to scam you to tip more here!!!When you check out with your card, they put a suggestive Tip for you. The ""suggestive"" tip is after their Healthcare Love and Tax!!!! Why would I tip on Their Health insurance surcharge aka Healthcare Love & Tax!This is ridiculous! So when you ask for the bill and calculate the tip yourself! Also the parking is hard to find here! Overall, the food is good, so take it to-go!"
3/30/2021,20210330,5,4.49,I love this place ! Such good food and vibes. My friends and I had such a nice lunch made even better because of our great waitress Cameron! definitely get the chicken and waffles if you go.. so bomb!
3/30/2021,20210330,1,4.49,"This restaurant has horrible food servers who do not understand English, and does not know which table to deliver food. It is disorganized and has a very small menu. The location is not great either. Also, they do not take reservations apparently. But in fact, they tell us to come in and we go there and wait 30 mins."
3/31/2021,20210331,5,4.49,"Wow!! What waffles!!! Amazing. Love the cute colors for the outside as well as flower dividers at some sections. We sat next to Cameron Diaz and she got the end with the flowers but we both all got good food the same. Had the waffles which was just perfectly soft, crispy, sweet, and perfectly presented with plentiful maple syrup and butter cream. Sitting out here in day time morning is just superb given the chill vibe and of course the love story of how this place started, all displayed on the menu. If you feel like Asian food, this place has a mix of it too as I got my eggs and rice. Yes rice!! Nothing to beat a hangover, for me at least. That and good coffee, yea it cures all. Meet her or him at the bar!! You won't regret. Seating can be tricky without indoor seating, though."
3/31/2021,20210331,2,4.49,Food wasn't that good. Small portions. The waffle fries were good but the nacho fries were nasty. Outdoor seating is decent until the bus / cars pass and all the dirt goes into your face and food. And you won't know who your actual server is because everyone is doing everything but no one does anything if that makes sense.
3/31/2021,20210331,5,4.49,"I got the chance to try this spot on Sunday and was delighted. Best place to spend a Sunday if you can- the food is great, service is great- Cameron recommended the huevos rancheros and they were incredible. Will definitely be coming back for more."
4/1/2021,20210401,5,4.49,"Great place the chicken and waffles is amazing !!! The service was good and the wait wasn't bad we were actually seated almost immediately. The mimosa was alright nothing special. I also had a side of potatoes which was good, simple yet flavorful. And took home 2 slices of coffee cake which was amazing loved it !"
4/2/2021,20210402,4,4.49,"Decent food, friendly staff!! Cozy vibe! One of those place you wish to have around the corner where you live."
4/4/2021,20210404,5,4.49,"This spot is small and amazing! The food was to die for and the service way above par. Went for breakfast with my girlfriend on a girls trip. Had mimosas, lattes and mouth water food. Found this place on Yelp and past reviews are accurate and if you want a great experience with tasty food go here."
4/4/2021,20210404,4,4.49,Thia place very popular and we had to wait about 30 minutes. I had the florentine hollandaise with potatoes which was very good. My wife had waffles hollandaise and daughter had French toast. Both approved of their choices A personal peeve of mine is hot plates. If the plates are not hot the the food cools rapidly. That was the case at this restaurant as well and he food was slightly hotter than lukewarm. We also ate inside and the music was too loud and it was difficult to have a conversation Service was good with refills being made without having to ask
4/4/2021,20210404,5,4.49,"This has to be one of the most amazing breakfast/brunch spots that I've ever been to! You walk in and it has such a great ambiance. It's a small space, but they make it feel open and welcoming. It's also the little touches like the We Met at a Bar mugs, the logo burned into the table top, pictures of the owners who met at a bar, and the decor. The staff was amazing, so friendly and everyone took care of your table, which made it so you were always taken care of. And we haven't even gotten to the food! The sausage tasted like maple, the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection, and the eggs were perfectly soft. The waffle with berries was melt in your mouth good. Even the butter was delightful! Would recommend We Met at a Bar without hesitation!"

4/4/2021,20210404,5,4.49,Love this spot and of course the food is delicious. I always get the Thai fried chicken and waffle. The chicken is very flavorful and the waffle is a perfect texture. Better than roscoe's in my opinion. Today we encountered a dope soul in Sonny. He's the perfect person to have represent your business...great conversation and very attentive. I would 1000% recommend this restaurant
4/4/2021,20210404,5,4.49,Love the food! Servers were great! Came back multiple times considering I live 1 hour away :)) love the history of the two restaurants!
4/4/2021,20210404,5,4.49,Best place & the hostess cam made the experience so enjoyable!! Will definitely be coming back!
4/5/2021,20210405,5,4.49,"So actually a friend who lives in the area recommended this brunch spot for us. There's always a wait so make sure to call in ahead or make reservations before hand. This is such a cute brunch spot & overall has great vibes. The staff is AMAZING. Probably some of the sweetest people i have met. Our friend highly recommended the Thai style original chicken and waffles and myyyyyyy goodness, died & went to chicken & waffles heaven.. who woulda thought sweet chili sauce on a waffle would work so well. Y'all have to try it if you go there. Also had their açaí berry drink, can't remember the name but that was very refreshing as well. Y'all need to come check this place out!!!"

4/6/2021,20210406,3,4.49,Not great and not bad either basic food. Basic service. I recommend some note worthy breakfast options
4/6/2021,20210406,5,4.49,"Visited for the first time this morning, been wanting to try it out for some time now. Couldn't be happier that I did! First and foremost, parking is easy, plenty of spots on side streets or even on La Brea that are within a block of this location or less. Secondly, the food = incredible, we even ordered additional main dishes because we simply wanted to try more of the menu (this is not something that I ever do tbh). I ordered the waffles covered in fresh banana slices and strawberries and smothered with the perfect amount of Nutella (if you're a chocolate fiend this is the breakfast/brunch item for you) and the Iced Mocha. Both were a perfect start to the morning. Admittedly the Nutella smothered waffles were sweet but I knew that before ordering and don't mind (just a heads up for those who don't enjoy a sweet breakfast.. I'd still suggest it though). The Avocado toast was a surprise as well, it's dusted with thinly shredded cheese that coats the top of your mouth with every bite, I'm not a cheese guy but it was delicious. The food alone will bring me back without question. Covid safety procedures are followed by all staff members, guests are socially distanced, outside seating is still available, and they have tables inside as well now that we're in a less restrictive tier in Los Angeles. Now, the staff, what to say about the staff. They are nothing short of INCREDIBLE/FRIENDLY/AMAZING. They seemingly work very well together, they were incredibly inviting, very attentive to the tables (but not TOO attentive which everyone enjoys). Also, the owner is a Kansas City Chiefs fan (GO CHIEFS!) so I knew I was in good hands after I saw the sign on the wall and gave the owner a shoutout from a fellow Chiefs fan. In summary, food is excellent and with great presentation (plates look professionally done which isn't really that common for a small shop such as this); the staff is great and helpful, they make you feel at home, a great place for a brunch date/meeting friends/family/going by yourself for a quick and tasty breakfast/any occasion really. Give them a visit, you won't regret it!"

4/8/2021,20210408,5,4.49,"Met her at a bar! Nice little place in the Mid-Wilshire area. There's plenty of street parking. Love the vibe and decor. I came here with my wife and we were seated fairly quick. The staff is very friendly. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it exceeded my expectations. It came with a side of potatoes, very tasty. We also had the nutella waffle, I loved that it had fresh cut fruit on top. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area."

4/9/2021,20210409,2,4.49,"My partner and I have been to Met Her at A Bar many times before the pandemic and have always happy with our meals. Today we ordered two chicken and waffles with a flat white for pick up. We arrived exactly on time and the coffee was already lukewarm. That's fine, it's busy and the timing can be off. It tasted bitter and not as good as it tastes dining in, but can't expect perfection in these times.However, what is not excusable is the preparation of the fried chicken. We went home which is 5 minutes away and when we opened our takeout boxes, I was extremely disappointed. In the pictures you can see the chicken is already cut up and it looks like they used left over pieces to fill up the box. It looks ridiculous!I've truly never seen any restaurant advertise chicken and waffles and then give out visibly cut up pieces of fried chicken. Why wouldn't you the leave the chicken pieces whole instead of shorting the customer of maybe a little more meat? I'm paying around $18 for each box, only to feel duped by cheap shortcuts to fill up portions. The waffles were soggy as well. Used to love this place, but this order let me very angry and feeling cheated."

4/13/2021,20210413,5,4.49,"So so yummy! We came in on the later side, about an hour and a half before closing, and got seated right away. I forget the young man who helped us around 2:30 on Saturday but he was so nice and very attentive in making sure we had what we needed.I had the chicken and waffles, the Thai spice and chili dipping sauce made it such a tasty and unique dish. I loved it and would absolutely get it again! Beware though, you will feel much food envy as you watch other tables receive their waffles and Benedicts! Overall great staff, very cute location and decor, and awesome food."

I'm super pleased with my decision. I ordered her the thai iced tea, matcha waffle and avocado toast. I asked her to send me pictures of the food and wow the presentation is so cute! I love how there's a lil flower on the whipped cream that comes with the matcha waffle. She told me that all of the food items were delicious. I will definitely stop by myself some time and try it out. ^.^"
4/17/2021,20210417,5,4.49,"Bruh, these waffles are the tastiest fluffiest things you'll ever eat! Coupled with the Thai fried chicken The French toast was also excellent and really good. Honesty one of the best ones I've hard with just the right crust. Come hungry! Can get quite busy."
4/20/2021,20210420,5,4.49,"Amazing food and service! Friendly atmosphere, great vibes! I was surprised with the food here. The fusion flavor was so good. With Thai interior design and photos of the farmers, I feel like having brunch somewhere overseas. A refreshing feeling! The food and services are good.The staff here have the most incredibly energy - a shoutout to Sunny & Jake for going above and beyond to create a positive and memorable experience.Definitely coming back for more."
4/20/2021,20210420,5,4.49,Food was amazing. Service phenomenal. Literally quick service. And the food was really really good. I got the chicken sandwich and nacho waffle fries. Omg so good and my friend got the fruity pebbles waffle it has ice cream and whip cream on top of the warm Belgian waffle. Really good and the service was polite and had great customer service. I love it. Highly recommend

4/25/2021,20210425,2,4.49,"Let me start by saying...I love this place and always take plesure in bringing friends and family for a great dining experience.... HOWEVER the last two visits (which both visits occured in the same week) has raised concerns.... Monday's visit was met by Megan, the server who was not very warm, friendly nor knowledgeable..... every request (BTW... did i say I come here often, am a creature of habit because I order the same thing always, and know the menu by heart.... so nothing new ....other than MEGAN.....Every request....as simple as creamer and flavored vanilla syrup on the side..was met with attitude, opposition and/or not presented as we ordered. Ok.... everyone has an ""off"" day........Pass granted on poor service on Monday. Now today's visit ...Megan again.... was a total night mare.... not only did she NOT listen to the order request whereas half our orders were incorrect and the others were cold by the time they arrived. Our consolation prize...a free coffee and a mimosa Next time we come back....wow... In one week I've spent over $250 for poor customer service and cold incorrect food after waiting at least an hour on Monday and up to 2.5 on today.... Thanks for the next visit offer for a mimosa (from GM).......To bad that champagne gives me a headache just like these dining experiences did.  News Flash.....People Dine out for great customer service and great food... when both are lacking it truly creates a Poor dining experience......Special Note to future dining guest......do yourself a favor and save your frustration...Ask for another server if her name is Megan."
4/25/2021,20210425,5,4.49,The food here is to die for. It's crowded but in my opinion worth the wait! I had the fried chicken and waffles. Nice spin on a classic dish!
4/26/2021,20210426,4,4.49,"You do not have to be a misogynist to like this place... just marinate in the local, chill- vibe LA cafe oeuvre...that just might be so unpretentious... actual pretentious people hang out here. Hmmmm. Discuss.Good interesting food with some kind of hook. That's omelet, you say, yes ma'am. Eclectic LA staff? One worries, but very friendly and on the mark.My only gripe would be the coffee. I'm not an Illy-or-bust coffee commie. Just think its meh. Can't add much more to numerous reviews...just have a debt to the universe I have to work off. Payin it forward.Food is good across the baord"
4/26/2021,20210426,5,4.49,"Pleasantly surprised and enjoyed brunch here. We always go to republique close by and havnt considered trying another spot. Got an americano (really good), omelette, waffle, and burrito. We got the Nutella waffle but the waffle itself tastes so good all you need is syrup. The additional stuff masked the good flavor."
4/27/2021,20210427,5,4.49,5 FREAKKKING STARS because their chicken and waffles is amazing as hell. Plus the owner and managers are wonderful.
4/28/2021,20210428,5,4.49,I lived across the street and would see a line out the door at any given time even during covid with the delivery people so I finally had to try it. Brunch is phenomenal - every menu item has a twist to it and is not your basic brunch. My two favorite items are the avocado toast and the thai omelette dish. Their green drink is also good!
4/28/2021,20210428,4,4.49,Whenever I'm near I usually stop for a good cup of coffee. Everyone working is really nice to new and old customers. Will definitely be back if in the area.
4/28/2021,20210428,5,4.49,Great for brunch! The dishes are all picture perfect and nicely decorated too. Just be aware that it's very popular so the wait times reflect that.
4/30/2021,20210430,5,4.49,Wonderful brunch spot. They accommodated to a party of 7 (split tables) which was very considerate. The food and drinks arrived at a timely manner and the clean up process was smooth. The wait was about 40 minutes.
4/30/2021,20210430,3,4.49,"Wonderful food, a nice spot for a coffee and convo with friends. Gotta have the mimosas"
5/1/2021,20210501,5,4.49,"I came here for brunch with some friends. It's located by a busy street so we had to park in a neighborhood a street down. The inside is small but cute and the staff is all very friendly! The atmosphere is fun and a perfect place to hang out with friends for brunch. We started off with some mimosas which were so good, and then ordered some food. I got the Eggs Benedict Florentine with potatoes and they shared the crispy French toast which hadNutella. We were all very satisfied with our food."
5/1/2021,20210501,5,4.49,"The food here is exceptional. I brought my sister here for her birthday 03/06 and food was incredible. I ordered a chicken and waffle which was crazy and my sister order the waffle with fruit. Although my experience was 2 months ago and I'm finally writing a review, it was a memorable so much so the food was just the icing on the cake. The staff is amazing and very personable. Super shoutout to the Manager ""Guy w/Tats"" who stopped us as we were leaving to gift my sister a brownie on the house for her birthday. That was dope champ because you didn't have to do that."
5/2/2021,20210502,2,4.48,"Food looks good but was pretty mediocre for the price in my opinion, it's something you could probably make at home. The eggs benedict wasn't anything special and the english muffin was so small. Don't get the matcha latte because it was literally just watered down soy milk and you could not taste the matcha. The truffle waffle fries were really good though and were the best thing we had at the restaurant."
5/2/2021,20210502,5,4.49,"They offer Yelp check in to get in line for a table before arriving I recommend doing that, however it said an hour wait and I got on the list and with in 15 min I was sat. They have indoor and outdoor seating available, pets are welcome on the patio only. I of course had to have a mimosa which was the perfect ratio of champagne (possibly Prosecco) to OJ. I ordered the breakfast sandwich, brioche bun, scrambled eggs, cheese, bacon, and chipotle aioli. Slather this chipotle aioli on a piece of liver and it would taste good it's just that yummy! The service here is on point. You won't be disappointed."
5/4/2021,20210504,5,4.49,"Such a hidden gem! On vacation and was looking for a nice place to have breakfast. The ambiance is quaint and inviting. The wait staff was wonderful and friendly and made sure to check on us several times. On top of the great service, the food was absolutely fantastic! I have never had a better waffle. Definitely would go back again the next time I'm in the area."
5/4/2021,20210504,5,4.49,"This place was amazing, the staff is so nice and even though there was a lil wait time, they were able to get us in before closing time, and let everyone finish their food before they had to close. We didn't feel rushed. The food was so good and i will be coming back again. Thank you for such great service."
5/5/2021,20210505,4,4.49,I visited this gem while I was on vacation. Worth every penny. Innovative menu with a nice Asian flare! Only thing pay attention to your receipt.
5/6/2021,20210506,5,4.49,"i had a feeling this place was gonna be dope, but WOW WOW WOW did it completely blow my expectations out of the water! the white truffle toast was unreal and the chicken & waffle was unlike anything i've ever tasted. if you're on the fence about either of these two plates, just do it! and as someone who's not a huge fan of ricotta, the strawberry ricotta toast was good as well ~ sweet, refreshing, and extremely well balanced with the basil and lemon. 11/10 recommend checking this place out!"
5/7/2021,20210507,5,4.49,"Probably one of the best brunch places I've been to. The food is great and the service is AMAZING. The staff are really nice and often check up on you to see if you are enjoying your food and if you need anything. My party and I left and we were waiting outside for our Lyft and we had been outside for about 10mins already and one of the staff(tall shaved head man) came up to us and said ""thank you ladies for dining with us! You guys have a great day"". If i could give this place more stars i would. Will definitely be back."
5/10/2021,20210510,5,4.49,"I came here a couple years ago and got the eggs benedict waffle, immediately decided I would be coming back daily but then for some reason I never did. Until now! I was quite worried when there was a line out the door and then I couldn't immediately find parking. I was ever so sad to find that the Yelp waitlist estimated 38-53 minutes, especially with the number specificity. TIP: JOIN THE WAITLIST AHEAD OF TIME ON YELP! But I was optimistic that the wait for one ""first available"" would be much shorter, and I'm so glad I waited because it was only 14 minutes. They have nice outdoor eating, although eating three feet away from a bus stop on busy La Brea on a Monday can be only so pleasant. They have done the best they can do.I meant to order the ""Wow You're Different Waffle Benedict"" waffle but mistakenly ordered the other aggressively affectionate ""You Make Me Wake Up Happy"" waffle. When the wrong food came I fumbled around with my phone to look at the menu again to confirm it was my mistake. My server patiently waited and was ready to fix any mistake, even though she was swamped. But then I realized it was my mistake so I thanked her for helping. ""Are you sure?"" yes, it is not you're fault I ordered the wrong cheesy, pushy waffle! The manager came by to make sure to everything was ok, which I really appreciated. I write this in detail because it was so diametrically opposite of the experience I had yesterday at Du Par's, which review I will do next. Food is important but service makes or breaks the dining out experience.The waffle was perfect. The butter is so soft and spreadable. Berries wonderful, worth the extra $$. The portion of egg whites was generous and chives were a nice touch. The sausage was tender. The bacon was good as far as bacon goes but I'm not a huge bacon fan. I know, weird, right?Staff asked me several times if everything was ok to the point that I worried that they were trying to turn the table but they were just being helpful (by then there was no wait and plenty of tables.) Worth the max tip. I will be back to get my waffles benedict again!"
5/10/2021,20210510,5,4.49,"A favourite little spot on La Brea with a cozy hall facing the street. The food and coffee are excellent. Great spot to sit and enjoy a small meal and cup, in non-pandemic times."
5/12/2021,20210512,2,4.49,"Super friendly , super clean , food was good . Parking omg a nightmare.. best to go on week days !! But overall nice experience"
5/13/2021,20210513,5,4.49,The best food I think I've ever eaten! The service was great and anytime I come into town I will for sure be back!!
5/15/2021,20210515,5,4.49,"Cool little spot with a delicious breakfast menu. I didn't have any issues finding a spot close by and didn't have to wait long to be seated. They have quite a few outside tables so that was def a plus. The staff are friendly and attentive. I really liked my dish but wish I went with the chicken and waffles. Dude next to me ordered them and I was a little jelly. Don't get me wrong, my plate hit the spot but I'm just saying. Don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu."
5/16/2021,20210516,5,4.49,"one word, DELISH! everything we ordered was so flavorful! makes sense why always a line to get a table"

Make sure to join their Yelp waitlist because there tends to be a line if you go any later than 10 am 2. Its busy location makes it difficult to find street parking so don't forget to read street signs when you do (unfortunately, we got a parking ticket)3. GET THEIR FRENCH TOAST. I promise you there will be no regrets in doing so other than not getting it. Hands down, one of the very best I've had because not only was it perfectly crisp all throughout but they hit a bull's eye with the sweetness. Price point was average for the portion size & location in LA ($14). We loved the aesthetics + vibe of this place & excellent service was definitely the cherry on top."
5/17/2021,20210517,5,4.49,"Great place in LA to grab breakfast at. Food is so good, I had their omelet and didn't disappoint. Totally recommend this spot to anyone."
5/19/2021,20210519,4,4.49,Their French toast and eggs Benedicts are just haves. The toast comes with some fresh fruit and I love their syrup. The Benedict comes with a side of potatoes. Even the potatoes were very good. I feel the portion isn't enough for me so I always get two dishes like these. I'm always starving in the mornings so breakfast has always been a bigger meal for me. So glad I found this place.
5/22/2021,20210522,2,4.49,"I wonder why use guys keep raising and lowers your prices? It's annoying when you deem a place a ""favorite"" of yours and they are not consistent... how does the chicken and waffles start off at $18 jump to $23 and now is $20? This is ridiculous! I've been patronizing this business since it 1st and met the couple personally when they were taking orders and bussing tables. I absolutely love the food but the prices not being consistent is annoying. Avocado toast was $14 now see what it?"
5/22/2021,20210522,5,4.49,Cute comfy spot for brunch anytime of day! So cool to have our Chewy Ann the Shihtzu join us. She loves to get the attention of everyone. Our first time here and we tried the Truffle Fries with Shaved Parmesan- oh so delicious! The Met At Her At the Bar Cold Brew is great for this warm sunny day. I loved my Grilled Chicken Salad because the balsamic vinaigrette side dressing was just yummy. They thinly sliced red onions were perfect with the salad too. My son had the Strawberry Banana Nutella Belgium Waffles and I tried a bite and it was very good as well. We'll definitely be back.
5/24/2021,20210524,5,4.49,"This spot is such a local hidden gem (not so hidden anymore I guess). There's just so much to love about this place. First off, it's Asian American owned (love it), prices are reasonable for LA, and there are so many egg dishes to choose from! I've noticed over the years that a lot of more popular places in LA that serve brunch usually have a limited selection of omelettes and eggs so I am always super excited to see all the options here. We got 2 dishes and 2 drinks for a brunch date. Khai Jiao (Thai Omelette) (5/5)- Huge portion size packed with a jasmine rice at the bottom- Hint of asian twist and the seasoning just reminded me of something I'd eat at home growing up as an Asian American - Smelled amazing Waffle Eggs Benedict (5/5) - Very generous portions- Interesting twist swapping out the english muffin with waffles (which I actually prefer) - Eggs were cooked to perfection not too runny not to solid - Would definitely get this again Hibiscus Cooler (4/5) - Cute presentation- The taste was not that memorableCold Brew (3/5)- Nothing really special, it just tasted like a cold brew"
5/24/2021,20210524,2,4.48,"Food is mid and inconsistent. Perhaps it was because I ordered takeout but I noticed the food was just thrown in and not taken care of like as if you were dining in. Food is overly expensive for simple foods and teas that don't require much experience in cooking, I'd rather cook at home. Maybe my third visit to this place would be worth while. Third times a charm..."
5/25/2021,20210525,5,4.48,"Loved it! Food amazing and not too long of a wait if you Join the waitlist , I suggest them adding some bottomless mimosas to the menu"
5/27/2021,20210527,5,4.48,"Been going there on weekends to pick up breakfast for my family. Been there before the pandemic and thought it was a nice place but nowadays somehow it seems better. I would say 4.5 stars. Their breakfast/brunch items are excellent. Omelets, sandwiches, French toast, oatmeal... tried a good number of their items in the menu and none of them disappointed. Their coffee is well brewed as well. There are plenty of similar joints with good breakfast all over town but this is where we usually get ours."
5/28/2021,20210528,5,4.49,This place is great! I got the crispy chicken sandwich and it was delicious. Definitely coming back.
5/30/2021,20210530,5,4.49,Recently moved to the area and I wanted a new experience. Yelp suggested this location and of course the name is very catchy. Molly was my server and she was giving that real good customer service realness! *snap snap*Not only the food was delicious but the atmosphere was cute indoors. Since i live down the block I'll be coming more often.
5/30/2021,20210530,5,4.49,"What a phenomenal meal! I got the Flintstone Waffle, French toast, and a side of fried chicken. I have to say the fried chicken was top 3 that I've ever had. I'm coming back with friends!"
5/30/2021,20210530,5,4.49,The food was delicious! I only had 2 mimosas and that's all i needed! Enjoyed this cute spot in Cali!
5/31/2021,20210531,5,4.49,"We missed this breakfast/brunch place! Amazing service, the staff were all so friendly and food came out quickly! I personally love the additional seating outside - barely any wait time and it was quiet. Food is always delicious, gluten free waffles take a little longer but are delicious."
6/1/2021,20210601,3,4.49,"The food was good, but i don't think it's worth the almost 2 hour wait. And then to be rushed out by the wait staff. I'm glad i tried it because of the stellar reviews, and maybe i ordered the wrong thing (i got the breakfast burrito), but don't think I'll go back. More because of the long wait paired with getting rush out than the food."
6/1/2021,20210601,4,4.49,"Got take out because I've wanted to try this place for so long. Order was ready pretty quickly (about 20 minutes or less after I ordered online) and pick up was easy. I went on a late Tuesday morning so finding street parking close to the restaurant was really easy. First, the chicken and waffle was delicious. I had to drive about 20 minutes home so it definitely wasn't as crispy/hot as it would be if I were dining in but I did take a bite in the car because I couldn't wait. The chicken was so perfectly crispy and juicy, not heavy at all and so flavorful. You can definitely taste the tom yum seasoning. The slightly spicy sauce they give is also really good and I'm thinking it might be a sambal-based sauce. The maple butter is also really good. The waffle itself was understandably not crispy anymore but it was still so fluffy and slightly sweet. I would definitely recommend this if you're visiting for the first time. The crispy French toast uses a cinnamon swirl bread I believe. I don't think it was particularly crispy even though I tried it immediately after I picked it up. I prefer the corn flake coated french toast that gives a nice crunch. The presentation was really pretty though even if it was in a take out box. The flavor was pretty good, not too sweet or too much of a cinnamon flavor. I like the addition of the berries which give a little tartness to balance it out. Their maple syrup is also quite good. Overall, this was good but nothing really special."
6/7/2021,20210607,5,4.49,Great food!!! The French toast is to die for! Really enjoyed my experience the staff as always super friendly and helpful. The waiters always come to the table to check up on the party often and refresh beverages. I would say get there early and be ready to wait for a little bit but I will say the wait is worth the food. I always have a problem coming here because I encourage friends to try things from the menu and by the end of it we have a tableful of food but leave the plates clean from how delicious they were. Truly recommend this place
6/8/2021,20210608,5,4.49,"Sunday morning: I came 2 min after they had just opened and saw one table was already filled! Good for them, but Y'ALL we gotta get here on the dot for a sweet seat (But hey street parking is easier to find in the morning anyways).#1: Brioche French Toast w/ mixed berries, honey butter, cornflakes, and Nutella (on the side) - The menu description says it all. As a lover of ft, I was satisfied with this fun combo. If you get a kick out off texture and bursts of flavor, try this. 4 half-triangles were served so I shared this plate in order to also eat the...*drum roll* #2: Eggs Benedict Waffle! The answer to savory bfast. This was one of the non-sweet waffle items offered on their current menu. Classic eggs Benedict with an (obvious) twist. Note: soft fluffy waffles, not caramelized/crunchy. Comes with a side of bfast potatoes or vinaigrette salad.The cute, colored coffee mugs they served us coffee in added a nice touch of personality! I'll be back to try the many other items I wish I had the room for ^^ Note on seating: (Indoor)2 tables of 4-seaters 3 tables of 2-seaters 1 long window bar-style table 1 long high stools/table seating (Outdoor dining available too!)Service: - Everyone who helped us was v friendly. Even though we were eating for awhile, I did not feel rushed at all! I appreciate this, knowing this little place is popular ~"
6/8/2021,20210608,5,4.49,This spot has BOMB food. The service was excellent and I HIGHLY recommend the fruity pebble waffles and the fried chicken. They were AMAZING.
6/14/2021,20210614,4,4.49,"I ordered for pick-up, everyone I ordered for really enjoyed their food. The French toast, cold brew, fresh orange juice and breakfast sandwich was pretty awesome. Will definitely come back!"
6/14/2021,20210614,5,4.49,"Came here on a Sunday and I tried to join the waitlist on Yelp but it seemed like it wasn't live so I wasn't able to join it. I got there at around 10:40 and there was actually not much of a wait! Put our name down and there were 2 groups before us but we got seated in less than 10 minutes! Seemed like they had a lot of outdoor seating which helped! We got the crispy french toast, wake up happy and chicken and waffles!! The crispy french toast was DELICIOUS!!! The cereal flakes added to the crispy ness and they use cinnamon swirl bread which made it even more yummy!! Enjoyed the extra fresh berries on top to add a lighter and refreshing flavor! DEF recommend this!!! The chicken and waffles were AMAZING too!!! The chicken has a thai spin on it and it wasn't overly heavy which I loved (and i'm not usually into sweet and savoury things)!! The wake up happy meal was an absolute classic and a good variety of everything - waffles and eggs and bacon!! Love the variety of options here and definitely would come again!!!!"
6/14/2021,20210614,3,4.49,Picked up our breakfast over the weekend. They forgot syrup and other condiments that goes with the waffles French toast and other egg plate. The food would have been delicious with it. Please check your bag next time before picking up the food. Otherwise everything is great
6/14/2021,20210614,5,4.49,Food is great! Price went up but the waiting time wasn't too bad compared to covid19 because they had more outdoor table settings. I'd choose indoor seating next time though because it was so loud from the cars and buses passed by nonstop.
6/15/2021,20210615,5,4.49,Went to brunch here a few weeks ago and loved this place! Staff was kind and friendly with prompt service. And the food OMG the food was amazing. Amongst other things I ordered chicken and waffles which was superb. A must try the chicken was cooked perfectly and the asIn twist on this classic dish put it over the top. Simply put...
6/15/2021,20210615,3,4.49,"I've frequented met her for a few years.. but lately service has declined. I see a lot of new faces working, this may be the reason. Hopefully they get it back together soon! Used to be one of my fav spots!!"
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.49,"great service, food is plated nicely, portion size is not too much/less & I really enjoyed the gluten free waffle options. will be back with more friends"
6/20/2021,20210620,5,4.49,"We were lucky enough to come in on a Monday with no wait. The inside is a small area, but felt like a homey brunch place. The matcha latte was rich, perfect combo with the matcha waffle, it was so good. Not too sweet, which I prefer. The chicken waffle Thai style was the best. Honestly, I could eat more of that chicken. It was delicious and tasty. The outer part was crispy while inside was tender and juicy. Staff and owner were all smile, kind and welcoming. Highly recommend while in LA."
6/20/2021,20210620,4,4.49,"Holy F#%#*}%CKKKKK probably the BEST chicken and waffles I've EVER had like EVER. The waffle was prefect and crispy on the outside with a soft inside. The fried chicken was perfectly fried and crispy yet so juicy and tender! It was absolutely seasoned to the gods. My friend and i agreed that we would even eat the chicken in a sandwich or with rice; that's how effing good this chicken was. My other friends got a breakfast burrito, lox bagel, and Florentine Benedict, all of which they had no complaints about and said shmacked. Although the food was A1, I had to dock a half point because our server was not very friendly. We were definitely being nice and playful but she just wasn't having it. Also there was a miscommunication with one of the orders and she was super passive aggressive about it. I docked another half point because they charged us a ""Healthcare Love"" charge that they never disclosed to us in the beginning. Apparently they add this charge to help support their kitchen staff with insurance/healthcare, which is something we support, but not when it's imposed on us without any notice. They just added it to our bill and expected us to pay for it and didn't even verbally mention it when dropping off the tab. They said it's an optional fee so we asked them to take it off. It's the principal, people!!! Cmon now. Anyway, food was fire. Service was meh. But also very cute decorations."
6/20/2021,20210620,5,4.49,"Thai place is awesome! While it said 45 min wait, we actually waited only 15 mins! While waiting I was trying to take a photo & 2 guys were standing by me I asked could they step to the side so they did. Later after we were seated we found out it was the owner and the GM they were so nice and humble. The foooood is amazing y'all. & the service is top of the line! Made us feel so welcomed!"
6/21/2021,20210621,5,4.49,"Outstanding service, incredible food! Chicken and waffles is last meal request for sure- hands down. Holy wow! Like- WOW. Kiera provided a friendly smile and personable service. The manager/owner was awesome! Thank you guys for everything!"
6/22/2021,20210622,3,4.49,"The restaurant is a cute little location right on the corner of La Brea & 8th street. The parking wasn't so great due to street cleaning. Luckily there was no wait to sit down. I was seated with a few waters by a hostess but never provided with a menu or the QR code to view the menu. The waitress approached me to asked my drink order and then provided me with the menu upon request. We ordered the Thai style chicken and waffles which tasted great. The only issue was the service. It appeared there was only 1 waitress for the entire restaurant, leaving us to ask for everything such as refills, condiments, etc. The only thing I did not have to wait for was the check. Overall I'm not sure if I'd return to the restaurant because the pricing did not amount to the service given. Keep in mind I got there at 930am. Barely anyone in the restaurant."
6/22/2021,20210622,5,4.49,Came here for brunch and I was definitely not disappointed! Food was really good and so were the mimosas. Staff is super friendly and nice. I will say the place is a little small and can get overcrowded but they do have indoor and outdoor seating so the wait isn't long at all. I will definitely be coming back next time I visit LA!
6/24/2021,20210624,2,4.48,I really don't understand all the positive reviews here. The salads I have gotten here were just messes of ingredients with little to no dressing and tasteless chicken. The coffee drinks were just not tasty.
6/26/2021,20210626,5,4.48,"My friends who live a block away from here have dropped by numerous times and order from them often. They always rave about their visit. For some reason, I've only ever been to the spot across the street which is different vibe. Our party of 4 dropped in for brunch on a Friday right after a smoke session. It also happened to be a holiday. Be prepared to wait because there's always a line outside the door. Our orders:Breakfast burritoChicken and waffleEggs BenedictThai omeletteOreo Waffle (shared)I don't know why it took me forever to come here. The food was so good. Not surprising, I cleared my plate. I can't speak for everyone else, but I finished everything, every last bite. So good. The flavor was something else. Just wow. I highly recommend the peach bellini. My meal was also paired with an iced matcha. I stay thirsty. The service was great. Considering how busy it was when we were there, they all had everything running smoothly. Everyone was checking on each other and helping one another. It was the teamwork for me."
6/26/2021,20210626,2,4.48,"A really cute place and nice location, but I was a little underwhelmed personally. I tried the Met Her Breakfast Burrito and Oh Wow Crispy French Toast. Both were mediocre, and I have had better breakfast burritos & crispy French toast elsewhere."
6/27/2021,20210627,3,4.48,"The name of this restaurant caught my eye and I thought I would give it a try. It's a super small restaurant inside but they had lots of outdoor dining tables. The pictures online had great presentation of the food but we just weren't impressed on ours. However, the crispy French toast that I ordered was one of the best French toasts that I've had. So sweet and so crispy. Just how I like it. Still, I wasn't impressed on the presentation and feel like they should have made mine the same as how it looks like on other Yelper's pictures. I also feel like they should've added more fruit on mine. My friend ordered one of their eggs Benedict, but when I got to try her plate, the waffle was so soggy. We were expecting it to be at least a little toasted but the waffle underneath the eggs were so soggy and soft. We were wondering if that was a mistake or if that's actually how it's supposed to be. The Oreo waffle my other friend got was really good. Thought it was really unique. It came with vanilla ice cream so we thought that was a good balance. Their other waffles on the menu sounded really interesting and unique as well, I wish I got a chance to try."
6/27/2021,20210627,1,4.48,You guys seriously need to do better with to go orders. If you get a order for Bruschetta... don't throw all the wet tomatoes drenched in olive oil on top of the bread. Separate it. I live 5 minutes away and the bread was SOAKED and soggy and was thrown all around the box because its such little food in a big box. When i dine in things are so great but every time I get takeout from you guys something is always wrong.
6/27/2021,20210627,5,4.48,"I really loved this little spot. Service was awesome food was delicious and drinks hit the spot, perfect little combo."
6/28/2021,20210628,5,4.48,"I was in the middle of eating my waffle and had to stop to write a review. That's how bomb this waffle is! I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Every time I have attempted too the line is always really long so I end up leaving. But, now I see why the line is always long for this establishment! The matcha waffle I got was amazing! I love matcha so I've tried quite a few different matcha waffles from different restaurants. This is the BEST MATCHA WAFFLE IVE HAD! The waffle was so soft and fluffy and flavorful. The matcha sauce was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be trying more of their dishes."
7/1/2021,20210701,2,4.48,"Did some Yelp search and found this place thought I'd give it a go & test it out from the "" reviews ""The atmosphere was pretty decent so if you are sitting outside just now you are right in front of the bus stop.. and the seating/tables outside are pretty small, as well as the indoor seating is very tiny . The chicken and waffles was pretty good ⁣ enough for me to finish the plate for my partner who wasn't a fan.. but be aware if you are getting the "" Wake me up waffle "" You have to pay an extra $3 just for them to add the fruit on top . I will say this place is pretty "" pricey"" but if you want to try it out for yourself I feel like this is a good place to try for the one time but not a place I would go frequent .  they do add a "" health care love "" of 3% & will charge you already ( 30% ) party gratuity. Lemonade is $5 as well as a latte had 1 of both . ( wasn't good at all ) The service was all right. I've had better . I will say though the backstory of this place is adorable and that's what makes people go here.  Total bill $70.50 for brunch . .⁣"
7/2/2021,20210702,5,4.48,Wow this was an unexpected surprise!! Three of use starving found this place on Sunday and it was great. I had the breakfast burrito and mimosas and beyond delicious. The rest of my party felt the same. Will definitely come back.
7/2/2021,20210702,5,4.48,I go here every time after getting my pedi and manicure done best breakfast so fancy love it
7/2/2021,20210702,4,4.48,Finally had the pleasure of trying Met Her At a Bar and it was delicious. Sunny the general manager was the perfect host he gave us background on the restaurant and chef. He suggested the chicken and waffles and it was a hit. Didn't get a chance to try the crispy French toast but that will be for next time
7/3/2021,20210703,2,4.48,"We got the portobello sandwich and the berries and cream. Taste is fine but not for 14.50$ each, especially the berries and cream waffle which is literally a not-that-crispy waffle with a few berries and dollops of cream. Cmon... at least the portobello sandwich had some interesting sauce and effort put in.Call me out for my European privilege but I HATE that they tacked on a 3% charge to help supply their workers with healthcare. Like why do these American companies just ??? Ask? Their customers? To be responsible? For THEIR employees? And act like they're woke and we're woke for doing so. Just pay them more. Don't bring us into it. I literally don't care, I'm sure your profit margin from that 14.50 waffle can cover something."
7/4/2021,20210704,5,4.48,"Stopped here on a trip out to LA. Not too much of a wait, sat outside with the family. I'm so glad we stopped. I ordered the panini, it was delicious. Flavorful, crispy... that pesto sauce was perfect! Upgraded the side to fries.. so delicious! My son got the breakfast platter. He really loved it, the waffle was his favorite. We also got the peach waffle. Now, let me tell you something about this waffle. It's a pricey waffle coming in at about $15. But it's the most delicious waffle you will ever have. The waffle itself was thick, soft inside and and light crunch on the outside. So much flavor. The topping was this amazing flavorful cream and when you make yourself to the middle of that cream, it's an ice cream center. They start to blend together to make this whipped ice cream that's so good... then you add the peaches and that waffle to your fork and take that bite and all your waffle dreams have come true."
7/4/2021,20210704,5,4.48,Was recommended this spot by a work friend and so glad I listened. Has the best French toast I've tasted in my life. It gets pretty busy at times but totally worth the wait. Staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is warm.
7/4/2021,20210704,4,4.48,"The area is very nice and the outside seating is so nice. They have some of the best eggs Benedict i've had, and love the mimosas. My one note would be they are very very light on the seasoning especially on the breakfast potatoes."
7/5/2021,20210705,5,4.48,"Right or wrong, Met Her At A Bar has found itself in at least some cases labeled as a sort of touristy spot where out of towners come to grab some California Brunch and oh by the way celebrities tend to meander in and out on occasion and might snap a picture or two with a fan. Typically that might not be the best rep, but with Met Her At A Bar it works, and it works because even celebrity locals and LA locals alike know that the food and service here are excellent. Star 1: How was the Service and Atmosphere?I've been thrilled to see Met Her At A Bar weather the storm that was covid, and even though the noise level around this part of town is such that their patio dining experience tended to get a little loud, they did what they needed to do and did so while continuing to serve up amazing breakfast foods. Star.Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Sure you might think $14.50 is a bit expensive for what is essentially a waffle, but look at the picture of this dish. Look at it. That right there is a piece of art, and it tasted as good as it looks which very often isn't the case. Star. Stars 3 & 4: How was the food?I'm not typically one for flashy, picturesque insta-worthy meals that don't deliver on the actual flavor combinations, but this worked and boy was it a literal treat. The fresh berries and cream came together with what is an excellent waffle and from there the fruity pebbles played their part as a texture addition with a bit of nostalgic flavor in the mix as well. It was excellent. Two Stars. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?No Doubt. Star."
7/5/2021,20210705,5,4.48,"Cute restaurant, great service, funny staff, and lots of yummy options to pick from. I had the crispy French toast and left 100% satisfied"
7/6/2021,20210706,4,4.48,"The wait was long but the food was worth it. It's pretty busy around afternoon time. Definitely going back to this place. We ordered a Waffletella, crispy chicken sandwich and a green matcha latte. The food was delicious I enjoyed it."
7/6/2021,20210706,5,4.48,"It's a cute concept my boyfriend, sister and I came here for brunch from finding them on Yelp. Staff was really nice and the food was pretty good definitely want to come here again"
7/6/2021,20210706,5,4.48,"Today was my first time coming since having seen the crowds every time I passed by. The food was amazing but what really made the experience was the excellent customer service. Not only was our server Molly super attentive and polite, she was very sweet and even asked my friend and I what we had planned for the day. It was quite busy so she could have easily just closed us out but she took the extra step to make us feel welcome. Keep up the great work y'all!!"
7/6/2021,20210706,5,4.48,"Awesome place to eat breakfast and brunch. I would like to believe all of the food is good, being that I've been twice and can say they don't owe me nothing. I will go back for a true lunch and dinner to confirm."
7/6/2021,20210706,5,4.48,"The staff is all so nice! They sat us so quickly, too. We sat outside and they had an easy up to shade us. The sangria was very refreshing, and I loved my omelette. Would definitely eat here again."
7/8/2021,20210708,5,4.48,"The sandwich was delicious. The brioche bread was nice and soft, the eggs were perfectly cooked the bacon had a nice crunch and the chipotle Aioli was the right amount of spice. I also tried the plain waffle with powdered sugar.. it was super soft and fluffy. All of the staff was very attentive and friendly."
7/8/2021,20210708,4,4.48,It's very cute and tastes as good as it looks but it's super sweet. So only go if you're down for a sugar overload. Portions are huge too. I recommend the matcha waffle!

7/9/2021,20210709,5,4.48,"I liked French Toast very much! Good service, nice menu. I definitely will come one more time."

7/10/2021,20210710,5,4.48,Love this place! We went around opening time and only had to wait for 1 party in front of us. I absolutely have not complaints. I got the chicken and waffle & my friend got the French toast. Presentation was cute & the vibe in the restaurant was nice too. Nightly recommend!
7/10/2021,20210710,3,4.48,"Lived across the street for a few years and tried this place a couple times given all the hype, but always found it quite disappointing. Nothing really wrong with it but for me the value isn't there for quite average brunch food."

7/11/2021,20210711,5,4.48,"BEWARE: the ""join waitlist"" function is disabled on weekends. And now that we've gotten that out of the way... this place instantly became our favorite brunch place!The food was delicious and super flavorful. All dishes are very well served and the portions are perfect. Tip: if you have a sweet tooth like me, try the crispy French toast. You can thank me later."
7/11/2021,20210711,1,4.48,Ate here again with my husband since the first time was good pre-pandemic. Not sure if they changed cooks but we both ended up getting food poisoning. Never eating here again.

7/11/2021,20210711,2,4.48,This place is ok waffles are good eggs and bacon the same like everywhere. Funny atmosphere overpriced overrated I mean if you like to seat at someone's lap for breakfast is a place to go. Owner funny more like sarcastic and not funny after all..

7/12/2021,20210712,5,4.47,"This is an extraordinary experience. The menu is wonderful (try Wake Up Happy), with terrific waffles, yummy eggs and scrumptious bacon. Service is always stellar. We always meet interesting people here. Mindy and Vince are marvelous hosts. Tony & Susan"
7/12/2021,20210712,5,4.47,"Besides the great food for brunch, chicken and waffles Thai style, breakfast sandwich, and Matcha waffles, the experience is impeccable. The GM, Sonny, is the best ever. Maggie was a great waitress. Best service and awesome food."

7/13/2021,20210713,5,4.48,"Been here a couple times but procrastinated with my reviews. Every time I came here for brunch we left so full and happy. My boyfriend ordered the Fried Chicken + Waffle and I got the You Make Me Wake Up Happy. First off, I'm in love with the creative names for the dishes. The food was amazing as usual. The fried chicken and waffle had an asian twist to it so that was different! The you make me wake up happy was a simple dish but delicious. Our server was very attentive and full of energy."
7/13/2021,20210713,5,4.48,"This spot is highly recommended. It has such a nice vibe, and a cute place. The service was amazing, helping and checking in constantly. Check it out!!"
7/16/2021,20210716,2,4.47,"I visited this place after reading a book where the author mentioned this place has the best waffles. Perhaps my expectations were high but the waffles were mediocre. The outside was not crunchy but super soft and didn't have much flavor. Super pricey for what they offer.The server didn't mention that there's a 3% service and based on how the receipt is itemized, it's hard to know whether the 3% service fee is after the taxes of food items or not. So are customers paying taxes on the 3% mandatory tax?"
7/20/2021,20210720,4,4.47,"A cute place for brunch with plentiful outdoor seating in nice shade during the pandemic. The Belgian waffles are delicious! Generous with toppings and the seasonal peaches were really nice. The khai jiao (Thai omelette) was aromatic and the hot sauce added a huge kick, so be careful if you are sensitive to spice (I thought it was perfect).Loved the latte, which was decently strong. The matcha latte on the other hand was pretty dilute and tasted like soy milk. Overall a nice brunch place with very efficient service despite how popular it is! (For reference, we were about 11th in Yelp waitlist line on a Thursday morning)."
7/22/2021,20210722,5,4.47,"Came by here after a night shift for brunch with some coworkers. Dog friendly establishment with super friendly staff and the owner even came by to chat with us!Parking: I had to find and pay for street parking here. The streets behind the restaurant are pretty residential, so you cannot park there without a permit. There is a parking garage right across the street that I noticed afterwards, but I did not get to ask if they validate parking from that garage - worth asking though!Ambiance: We sat outside on the street, which was naturally very loud at that time of the day given that it is on a busy street. The inside of the restaurant when I popped my head it looked really nice, though. It was nicely decorated with nice lighting and comfy seating. Food and drinks: I ordered the eggs benedict and it was solid! I am usually an eggs benedict or chicken and waffles guy. The rest of my coworkers got the chicken and waffles, and it looked amazing. It was served with maple syrup, butter, and a spicy sauce to add a twist to it. All three were served on the side so you can add however much to it you want. Definitely getting the chicken and waffles next time I come. We also got mimosas, which were solid as well!Service: The service is where they stand out here! One of the staff brought some water for my friend's dog. We were in our healthcare attire and everyone kept profusely thanking us for the work we do. Considering the long hours we work, how underappreciated we are at times, and the current state of the Pandemic, their words were greatly appreciated. They even offered us a couple rounds of mimosas on the house and included a discount! Seriously, other establishments can take a page out of their book! Not necessarily free things, but just the words and sentiments that mean a lot, especially when our work can sometimes seem futile!Overall, I really appreciate this restaurant and had a great time there. I almost went to sleep instead of joining my coworkers for brunch. I am glad I went and it was totally worth it! Definitely coming back again and taking more coworkers with me! Thanks to all the staff at Met Her At A Bar!"
7/23/2021,20210723,5,4.47,"Love this place! The food is so fresh and yummy and the service is exceptional! It's a small joint but unlike other restaurants where you have only one server, here all the servers look out for every table. So you can flag down any of the lovely staff and they are all super friendly and helpful!"
7/27/2021,20210727,4,4.47,"Great vibes, energy, presentation, and style. Mix that with a perfectly above-average breakfast burrito that (while not ground breaking) really hits the spot and fills you up? I'll be back for sure."
7/29/2021,20210729,1,4.47,If you want to be mistreated go here! The employees are racist and have such an attitude ! I had the worst experience ever! They need new employees ASAP. DISGUSTED!
7/31/2021,20210731,5,4.47,"I LOVED IT! Best decision was to order the chicken and waffles, would love to come here every day to eat that dish. SO YUMMY!"
7/31/2021,20210731,5,4.47,"I absolutely recommend the classic eggs benedict! For some reason, even the chamomile tea tasted otherworldly (in a positive way)."
7/31/2021,20210731,4,4.47,Food is decent but outdoor seating under construction and buses passing by wasn't a great dining experience.
8/1/2021,20210801,5,4.47,"The dishes were incredible. Chicken and waffles is one of their most popular dishes on the menu. I now know why, the chicken is incredibly seasoned, very moist interior and crispy exterior. Add a splash of the Thai sauce in top, for that extra kick. Pair it with a piece of the crispy, buttery waffle with a bit of maple syrup. Mmmmm that sweet and savory taste! Guarantee, that you can't go wrong with this pick. Second dish, is a traditional breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage and waffle. It was good, the eggs were soft and buttery, the bacon and sausage were flavorful and the waffle s nice and crispy. Second time for me here and I'll sure I'll be back!"
8/2/2021,20210802,4,4.47,"Obviously, the name is brilliant.I've been twice... both times for breakfast/brunch. It's OK.  The joint is quite popular so make sure to join the waitlist (on Yelp) before you arrive. And allow plenty of time for parking, which can be tough. The brunch menu is heavy on the waffle offerings but also has the standard breakfast dishes. Service is always friendly - I think everyone in the place stopped by our table to check in at one point during our most recent meal. I've had the standard American Breakfast (not bad) and the Florentine Benedict. The latter was less successful - not so much a benedict as a bunch of spinach on an English muffin with an egg on top... lacking even close to enough of the necessary hollandaise to pull it together.  My SO is a French Toast fan and he enjoyed the berry topped version here. A friend had an omelet and enjoyed it. The coffee I have found to be consistently great - served properly hot, strong and in a nice big mug. I Just really find their outdoor dining so uncomfortable though. I know it's necessary and saved the restaurant business, but the chairs here are terribly uncomfortable and it gets hot on that sidewalk and noisy too.  Their indoor dining always seems to fill up but if I come back, I'm going to wait for an inside table."
8/7/2021,20210807,1,4.47,Rude manager refused to serve us after taking our order because we had a box of food with us. Racially biased. Never brought our drinks to the table.
8/8/2021,20210808,5,4.47,"Fast, friendly, and scrumptious bits in the city! I love the story of this place and the friendly staff give great representation to this restaurant. The crispy French toast with berries was my favorite one of the best I have ever had tbh. The parking is a bit of a hassle so make sure to park where the garage is in front of the restaurant and you can validate your ticket at the nearby grocery store (FREE VALIDATED PARKING)."
8/8/2021,20210808,2,4.47,"I will start by saying I've had good experiences here before. however this particular time, we were given EXTREMELY bad service. There were lots of flies where we were sitting. On top of this it took forever for anyone to come tend to us. They barely came by to check in or refill water. We asked for a side of ice cream for our waffles and berries and it took forever to come and then we had to remind them again till we got some. My friend ordered eggs and he said they tasted like they had gone bad. We came around 10:00am and ordered peaches & cream waffles and they were already out of it as well. I was super disappointed by the service and this visit definitely did not deserve the pre added 20% tip! We were only a table of 4."
8/9/2021,20210809,5,4.47,Loved the service and the food!!! I thought the Crispy French Toast was good as well as their Sangria. My fave though is their Truffle Waffle Fries with Parmesan.
8/10/2021,20210810,4,4.47,"Although they were really packed, their waitlist to be seated went by pretty fast. All the staff was very nice and friendly. Our food also came out pretty fast. Everything we ordered was great! This is a good little spot and I'll definitely be back :)"
8/12/2021,20210812,5,4.47,"Man does this spot know how to do brunch! Stopped by with my gf, and everything was absolutely delicious!She had the savory Lox Waffle, waffle was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, it had the perfect balance of cream cheese and lox. Neither were over powering and complemented each other so well. Loved the capers and dill on it. That's something that makes me hesitant to order lox at restaurants, the ratio of cream cheese to lox is almost never right, but they've got it down!I had the classic Eggs Benny. The English muffin was so perfectly soft but had the right amount of toast; I didn't have to hack at it with my knife to slice a piece off. My eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was well balanced. My ham was tender and the salad was refreshing.We shared a Crispy French Toast, and it's definitely top 5 best French Toasts I've ever had. I dream about their French toast at least once a month lol."
8/14/2021,20210814,5,4.47,"Went around lunch time, there was a long line/waitlist but we got seated after waiting around 10 mins. The service, food and drinks are amazing. I had crispy French toast; it was crispy, soft, super tasty, topped with Nutella, syrup and fresh strawberries and blue berries. The only thing bugged me was that my French toast didn't have flower petals on it :'( I was having a difficult time deciding what to get but I went with the French toast after I saw how pretty others' French toast look. My friend had classic egg benedict and she said it's amazing. My Thai tea has just the right amount of ice inside. Very creamy and flavorful. We enjoyed everything and can't wait to come back and try something different."
8/14/2021,20210814,5,4.47,"This place was pretty cute ! The French toast was really good but I think next time I would get the chicken and waffles, I thought the breakfast potatoes were going to more of that but they were just the thick cut potatoes good but not what I wanted !"
8/15/2021,20210815,5,4.47,"Definitely my favorite breakfast! I am not even a breakfast person but this place makes me craveeee it! The food is soooo good, service is quick and staff are friendly! It is usually pretty crowded especially on weekends but the wait is totally worth it! You have to try the waffles, i don't care which one you choose, it's going to be the most amazing waffle you have ever had! Give this place a try atleast once and i promise you'll be back for more"
8/15/2021,20210815,5,4.47,"So so good! Chicken and waffles with a Thai twist?! Ruined chicken and waffles forever because this is the best version of them I've ever tasted! The chicken sandwich was to die for also, we added an over easy egg on it and that elevated it that much more. I can't wait to brunch here again I didn't get a picture of the chicken and waffles sorry, we ate that up so fast"
8/15/2021,20210815,5,4.47,Awesome food awesome service awesome place will definitely come back. Lots of vegan options
8/15/2021,20210815,1,4.47,Please do not order online. They will somehow mess up your order! I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was missing. So careless considering it was $20 for the waffle. This also happened more than once already...
8/21/2021,20210821,5,4.47,"Wow. Just wow. Small but efficient. This place has superb service. Attentive servers who are super aware. Accommodating, polite. Good mimosas great coffee. I was not expecting this but I am blown away by the level of professionalism and service. Thank you. Very much recommend."
8/21/2021,20210821,5,4.47,I was looking for a new place to take a friend for brunch and happened upon Met Her At A Bar. I loved the food. I got a waffle. The vibe was better. I loved the manager.
8/22/2021,20210822,4,4.47,The food and customer service was GREAT ! 10/10 would recommend. Just a heads up I wish someone would have told me before we placed an order . There is a health care charge that comes on your bill as well as the included tips .
8/23/2021,20210823,4,4.47,Brunch is amazing here! Definitely order the waffle fries. For our meal: The chicken and waffle thai style was our favorite with the chicken sandwich as a close second. The French toast was also really good!! Felt a chaotic / little rushed to order with multiple different waiters asking us but overall good experience and will be coming back!
8/24/2021,20210824,4,4.47,"My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday around 2 pm. The spot is pretty popular so we recommend joining the Yelp waitlist. There's street parking only which can be a pain especially on the weekends. The joint itself is super small and cute. They added tables outside the building because the restaurant itself does not seat a lot of people, it can get pretty crowded in there. The staff were super friendly and attentive. Food and coffee was okay, the waffles were pretty good though! The food came out pretty quickly considering how busy it was so that was a big plus for us."
8/25/2021,20210825,4,4.47,Food was really good considering it's a tight space indoors and outdoors. Their pineapple mimosa is really good.many options and great service. Will def be back to try more items on the menu!
8/26/2021,20210826,4,4.47,The hostess and server was very kind and accommodating! The vibe was great though I wish that the peaches n cream waffles were a little more crunchy since the ice cream makes it soggier but brunch was still great. I recommend the french toast if you like sweet breakfasts :))
8/26/2021,20210826,4,4.47,"The menu is great, love their crunchy French toast. The space however is very small. It is important to book to avoid waiting in line."
8/28/2021,20210828,5,4.47,"Best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The chicken was Thai-style so it was spicy and came with fried thai basil, peppers, and sweet chili sauce. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and juicy and paired well with the crispy waffle and syrup. I was a little apprehensive of this version, but I only order this now whenever I go. It was also one of our friend's 21st birthday, and they have her a complimentary mimosa!"
8/29/2021,20210829,5,4.47,"First experience here an it was lovely. I was welcomed by the staff, they are extremely friendly. I ordered the crispy French toast, pineapple mimosa, with a side of turkey bacon! Delicious food and the experience was nice."
8/29/2021,20210829,4,4.47,"Really good peach waffles! I also loved their breakfast potatoes and iced Matcha latte! It was very crowded (even on a Monday!) so we had to sit at the counter which was not so comfortable, and we sat very crammed up next to another group, but the food was good and the service was great."
8/29/2021,20210829,1,4.46,"COVID-19 DISCLAIMER TABLES INSIDE ARE 1-2 FEET APART: if you are still doing anything to protect yourself from being exposed to COVID-19 just know that inside the tables are only spaced 1-2 feet away from each other. I think this should be illegal during these times, but I know times are hard so I would appreciate being told that when I select a table. I would rather have waited 90 min for an outside table before being sat 1-2 feet away from 3 separate tables and feeling unsafe removing my mask to eat. I know restaurants gotta stay afloat but I'm just looking for some proper hosting and full disclosure of information so I can make my own decision. (This rating has nothing to do with the food or service (at the table, just overall covid protection and line/ reservation management)."
9/1/2021,20210901,5,4.47,"Found this restaurant from looking at the top brunch restaurants in Yelp. Ordered the brunch plate with eggs, bacon, and waffles with fruit. Overall a great experience with quick service."
9/2/2021,20210902,1,4.46,The worst coffee ever honestly couldn't take a sip I had to dump it out. it was so bitter and acidic ...sadly a waste of money this place is expensive for no reason price doesn't match taste will not return !
9/5/2021,20210905,4,4.46,"We had brunch here on a Friday morning. The place was very busy but we were seated right away and the staff was very nice and answered any questions. We started off with mimosas, which were the perfect ratio of orange juice to champagne. We also ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was pretty good. The aoli sauce made the sandwich. Lastly, we also ordered the classic eggs Benedict which was fabulous!Everything was very nice. The only reason for 4 stars was that our waitress disappeared for an hour. Last time we saw her was when we ordered our food. So we sat there waiting to pay for an hour and finally had to ask another server to check us out - it was a weird situation. I would definitely come back to eat here and would hopefully have a 5 star experience."
9/5/2021,20210905,5,4.46,Super creative menu and friendly staff. I had the chicken and waffles. Delicious but I couldn't really taste the Thai flavors that they were claiming. Beautiful presentation
9/5/2021,20210905,5,4.46,"How can you not give this place 5 stars when everything was so delicious and the service was top notch. It was a little hot sitting outside but to be expected during the time of Covid. I went totally boring and basic and even then I wasn't missing anything. The bacon was cooked perfectly, the sausage was so good, eggs not over cooked, and OMG that waffle with the maple butter and berries was to die for. I loved every bite and then some. My husband got the Waffle Benedict and was thoroughly impressed. The waffle was still sweet but the real ham was a nice touch to the perfectly poached eggs and the hollandaise sauce was nice and creamy. Even the potatoes were cooked nicely. I would definitely recommend. No matter what you get you will not be disappointed."
9/5/2021,20210905,5,4.46,"the vibes in this place are immaculate and the food is really good. Went here with my friends during our trip to LA and originally got told the wait time would be around 40 minutes, but we got seated in 15 minutes!! I can say 10/10 would come back here again!"
9/6/2021,20210906,4,4.46,"Lots of amazing waffle options here! I ended up getting the waffle and lox (smoked salmon, cream cheese, and capers). They were able put the cream cheese on the side per my request. The dish was pretty interesting - smoked salmon on top of waffles. The salmon was delicious, and the waffle was fluffy. The waffle was a little plain, so I'm not sure if maybe I just needed to add more cream cheese in each bite, or if some other flavors could be added. I still enjoyed the dish overall. My boyfriend got the chorizo toast, which was super small and didn't have much chorizo on top. He overall liked it, but it was so small, he had to get more food when we visited the Original Farmer's Market."
9/6/2021,20210906,5,4.46,"This was a nice little find for breakfast on a quick stop in LA! We ordered the fried chicken and waffles and the ""you make me wake up happy"".The Thai style chicken was an awesome twist you the traditional chicken n waffles dish. Hints of sriracha in a light crispy batter made us crave this dish again and again. The waffle was a nice balance of sweet and savory fluffiness on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside! What an amazing meal this was!You make me wake up happy was hands down the best scrambled eggs we have see in our years of foodie adventures together! It's so easy to overcook scrambled eggs but this was perfectly soft and slightly runny - the way eggs were meant to be scrambled! Paired with your standard proteins, nice crispy bacon and juicy sausages, you can't go wrong with this standard dish! The berries over waffles provided the perfect sweetness to cut through all the heavier meats and the flavor palate was all there. Fresh ingredients, chill vibe and and a quaint neighborhood cafe feel to this place; lots of amazing photographs of real humans adorn the walls and you can't help but smile and be happen when you're sitting there!

If you're into that then 5/5, but otherwise it's something you can get anywhere.* Khai Jiao: 5/5 Really good mix of flavors and felt like an Asian breakfast!! The Sriracha on the side added the perfect amount of spice.* Power Bowl: 5/5 Super large portion of healthy food and if you add chicken, more protein!!!* Cauliflower Tempura: 5/5 Definitely some of the best cauliflower tempura I have ever had!! It was on the more oily side, but it wasn't soggy at all and had more of a tempura coating compared to other places.The servers were kind and helpful and I'd be down to come back here again!"

9/6/2021,20210906,1,4.46,"I was really disappointed!! Traveled 1 hour just to get cold food.Breakfast potatoes were cold, waffle was cold,omelette was cold and Avocado was hard as a brick. My husband peaches n cream waffle was good but I was not satisfied.Service was just ok but I doubt if I go back."

9/10/2021,20210910,4,4.46,"~Food~- This place has a good selection of breakfast foods. My friends and I ordered various dishes: chorizo toast, Thai omelette, Benedict Florentine, cauliflower tempura, and power bowl. The few that stood out were the cauliflower tempura and the chorizo toast. The tempura was so crispy and delicious, with the sweet chili pairing it was amazing! The chorizo toast was also a yummy dish, with a nicely toasted bread and perfectly cooked eggs. The rest of the dishes were good, but not much to rave about. The price wasn't too unreasonable but the portion is a little bit smaller than I would've hoped. But nonetheless still a solid place to go for brunch! I also saw some cookies and brownies, which looked so delicious but they sell out pretty quickly~Service~- Service is very friendly! There's always someone walking around to help and refill waters whenever needed. I love how chill the atmosphere is ~Parking~- There might be some trouble with parking, as we were only able to find street parking on the busy street"

This is their strong point, in fact I want to give them a 5 star rating just because of that but I gotta be fair & take all things into account hence the 3 stars. We got the chicken waffle, breakfast burrito, chicken pesto panini. Breakfast burrito was bland. I didn't care for the waffle. the pesto panini was the only item that was very good."

9/13/2021,20210913,4,4.46,"You 100% have to come early - this spot is super popular and the wait can get pretty bad. We showed up closer to the breakfast-side of brunch, and still had to wait ~30 minutes for a table for three.Avocado toast - fresh avocados and microgreens. I get that they grated cheese (parm?) over the top for an added bit of flavor, but it was overall kind of flat. It needed some acidity or saltiness that the cheese didn't really provide. I'd skip unless you were craving avo toast.I miss you waffle and lox - comes with a side salad. I was happy to try this out, but I think I'll stick to bagels and english muffins for my lox/capers. The waffles were cooked perfectly, but the sweet-savory combination didn't work for me. The salad was the highlight for me here.Food was overall a 3.5/5 for me, but I'm rounding up because I'd come back to try out more of the menu (and for our fantastic waitress)."

9/16/2021,20210916,2,4.46,"Seems like everyone else either had a better experience at this place but first we ordered coffee and cappuccino and my coffee was cold. Then they brought out old and cold fries, which I sent back. Then for our main course my boyfriend was served hot chicken on cold waffles (they still were crispy). And I received cold soggy waffles, cold eggs, and lukewarm potatoes. Ended up paying almost 100$ for a cold breakfast."
9/18/2021,20210918,5,4.46,Best French Toast on this #MyWestCoastViews trip goes to @metheratabar La Brea Ave location. The inclusion of cornflakes was a tasty surprise. Great Breakfast food and music vibe. The Thai Seasoned Chicken and Waffle is great too. #TheFrenchToastConnoisseur
9/19/2021,20210919,2,4.46,"I really wanted to like this place. The reviews were great, it was a very LA kind of place, but I left disappointed. My fiancé and I ordered a latte (with oat milk), All-American breakfast, Waffletella, breakfast burrito, and a matcha latte (with oat milk). All of this came out to be (with tip) close to $80. For brunch... for two people.I wouldn't mind the price, since the service was excellent, but the food didn't hit the spot for me. It looks visually appealing, but the price is just not justified. The environment is great, though, and I can only comment positively about the people that work there. But the food wasn't that special to me, especially the matcha latte! Went to little Tokyo and could immediately tell the difference. Anyway, good place to go just once or for a business meeting or something, but if you're really into flavors, you might look elsewhere."
9/19/2021,20210919,5,4.46,Great brunch menu. We just ordered from here for the first time. The waffles and the chorizo toast were delicious. The side of fried chicken was one of the best I've ever had and had an awesome kick to it. We'll definitely be adding this great find to our rotation.
9/20/2021,20210920,4,4.46,"A+ service and ambience. A super cute brunch spot in mid-Wilshire! We waited about 30 min for a table of 2 on Sunday morning, but the servers were so nice and even offered us water while we waited. Given how busy it was, it was amazing how attentive they were! The food was good but not amazing. It did come fast and fresh though, so I'll definitely return for the service and ambience!"
9/21/2021,20210921,4,4.45,"Tip: Check the Yelp Waitlist for wait times prior to coming here!I came here for a Saturday brunch around 12:40PM and the wait time on the iPad said that it'd be at least a 40 minute wait. It was my first time here so I wish I had looked at the Yelp Waitlist first. Thankfully, my friend and I only waited 10 minutes to be seated after signing in on the iPad at the front.AMBIENCE:The cafe is small inside, so it's not the best place for a large group brunch. Most of the tables are for 2 people, which could also be pushed together for groups. There are tables outside on the sidewalk too.We were seated inside, which I found to be a very loud environment- we could only hear each other talking if we leaned in closely.FOOD:Classic Eggs Benedict ($15)- comes with a choice of salad or breakfast potatoes; I opted for the breakfast potatoes. This was a standard eggs benedict. The potatoes were salted with a heavy hand.Khai Jiao (Thai Omelette) ($14)- my friend and I both agreed that this was your typical Asian breakfast of eggs with rice. Our ancestors would be rolling in their graves if they knew we paid this much for this meal. The rice was slightly dry and not fluffy. The eggs had maple sausage which added extra protein into the dish. It was filling, but had no wow factor.MENU/PRICE:You have to scan the QR code at the hostess' podium prior to coming in (metheratabar.com/menu-1). The prices and portions here are standard for LA brunch.It's a good spot for your local neighborhood brunch. It isn't worth a long drive in my opinion though."
9/21/2021,20210921,5,4.46,"Wake up Happy was delicious and would order again, my sister has sugar tooth and loved her Oreo waffles. Delicious food and friendly staff. Can get crowded so come early to avoid long wait times."
9/25/2021,20210925,5,4.46,Got here at 830 am on a Saturday. Was sat immediately. First let me say the service was amazing. Didn't have to really wait for anything. Asked for extra napkins (came immediately) asked for an extra fork (came immediately) and they made their rounds refilling water on a regular basis. I definitely appreciate itShared a breakfast burrito and french toast. The food came out quick. The consistency of the french toast was nice. The bread was soft and the corn flakes added a nice crunch. It was goodThe burrito was cool. The salsa they give you was a nice compliment. My only gripe was they could have added more meat to the burritoBut the service was A+ and the food was an A. Will definitely be back
9/26/2021,20210926,5,4.46,Love the place! Good food! Reasonable priced. Indoor & outdoor seating! Cozy! Chicken & waffles are my fave! Range from $-$$ in price!!!
10/3/2021,20211003,5,4.46,Good spot ! Quick service clean cool vibes. Definitely would go back.Had brunch here with a friend gotOvernight oats bowl it was fantastic!StaffVery attentive very wonderful I appreciate you all for the quickness!Waffle was also amazing !
10/6/2021,20211006,4,4.46,"I came here for Labor Day weekend on a Sunday morning and wait time was pretty long. The food was very good, and the mimosa was okay. Definitely not worth $13 for 1 mimosa. It could be a bit better especially for the price. Overall vibe was good. Hated that once it got closer to noon, we were sitting outside under a canopy and it started to get super hot. That was the only downfall, but I'm sure fall/winter weather will be a great time to eat outdoors there."
10/8/2021,20211008,5,4.46,"Highly recommend for Brunch!! So delicious service is great, And fast, indoor and outdoor seating available. Staff is very friendly and constantly checking up on you."
10/10/2021,20211010,5,4.46,This was the first restaurant I visited in LA and it set the bar really high. I got my birthday started off right at this place. I really love the vibe of this place. It's on the infamous LaBrea Boulevard so I thought that was pretty cool. We started out with some pineapple mimosas to bring my birthday in with a bang. For my entree I had tbe Huevos Racheros. I was eager to try this dish because I've never had authentic California style Mexican food before.It was on point. I'm glad I went with something light. I loved that the egg was little runny and that the tostada shells were crisp. The tomato's and onions have the dish the kick it need. I alsoloved how fresh the jalapeño was. I would recommend this place to any one visiting LA.
10/10/2021,20211010,5,4.46,I highly recommend the matcha waffle! It's amazing and beautiful. Some of the best food in the area.
10/11/2021,20211011,4,4.46,"Very nice place for brunch. It looked busy inside but we were sat just a few minutes after we got there. Parking is the only thing that was a little hard, you might have to walk a little if you don't find parking nearby (also it's good to check the street sweeping on Mondays and Tuesdays after you park to avoid getting a ticket). Food was really good. The portions are appropriate--it doesn't get you too full but just satisfied. I had the Power Omelette with a side of smoked salmon and I thought that they were delicious. My friends too were very happy with their meals."
10/11/2021,20211011,5,4.46,"Flew in from utah, made the 20 minute drive to eat here, was worth every minute. I got the breakfast burrito without egg and extra fries because I don't like eggs. It was delicious! I left feeling stuffed but i definitely would have kept eating if I hadn't cleaned my plate."
10/13/2021,20211013,5,4.46,"I've heard a lot about this place and my friends have mentioned wanting to go a bunch of times. I was a little iffy when I got there considering the super long wait, but all in all I'd say it's worth the hype. The host was nice and understanding, and they had no problem accommodating our party of 6. Chicken and waffles was soooooo tasty, I'll definitely be going back just for that. They also have a ride range of mimosa flavors which is always a plus. Good location that isn't too busy or loud."
10/15/2021,20211015,5,4.46,"Started my LA trip with an amazing brunch! My friend highly recommended this spot, so I had to check it out! I came here with a friend and we ordered: You make me wake up happy (breakfast plate with waffle, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and maple butter), Unforgettable chorizo toast (Chorizo spread with avocado mousse and poached eggs), and Oh wow crispy french toast (cinnamon brioche with corn flakes, and berries). The 'You make me wake up happy' was a classic plate of everything you want! The eggs were fluffy and the waffles were perfectly crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. My favorite was the 'Oh wow crispy french toast' which was not overly sweet with the brioche and had perfect texture with the corn flakes! I would pass on the Unforgettable chorizo toast because the chorizo was just a thin spread and the bread was too big. The portion was a little off. Overall, I enjoyed the brunch and will have to come back!"

Staff were friendly and even gave my little pup a bowl of ice cold water before I even had the chance to ask them for it. I truly appreciate that! Food selection was incredible and all sounded amazing tbh. We decided to try their spin on the classic waffles and eggs benedict. They were delicious and beautifully plated. However, portion was a bit small and I was starving from the hike, so I ordered some fries after devouring the waffles and the eggs benedict. Food was also decently priced, not too pricey. But, expect a line and longer wait times during peak hours and weekends."

We sat inside and it felt very homey with a lot of personal touches in the restaurant! I ordered the truffle toast and the matcha waffles and I wasn't much from the toast but it was SO good! The matcha waffles were delicious since they weren't too sweet. The server was very friendly and overall it was a great experience!"

10/22/2021,20211022,3,4.46,"I have lots of mixed feelings about Met Her At A Bar. The service was great, everyone was so friendly. The food was delicious. The space was a bit small. But, it is all very pricey. I get it, they are in Hollywood but some of the fees were ridiculous. For example, there was a ""health love"" tax. You check out on the little toast device they have and it automatically adds gratuity (which I thought was ridiculous for a party of 4) but then you do not see that they added gratuity until they print out your receipt and before getting your receipt, the last step on the toast device is to add your tip. So, I ended up double tipping them! I just felt deceived. The food was good, but nothing really outstanding for what we ordered. I had their Huevos Rancheros which was ok. The plate itself wasn't super appealing because it was just shades of brown...the habanero sauce lacked spice in my opinion. My husband had their breakfast burrito, which he enjoyed. My cousin had the Florentine benedict and she finished her plate, however the side of fruit she was given was really old. My sister had their berry waffle and it was really good. I had a few bites and I knew I messed up on my order. Should have went with the chicken & waffles. We also had mimosas, which were $14 each for a flute. CRAZY for us because we are from Sacramento, where $14 mimosas are usually bottomless...Personally, I think the restaurant is overrated. Food is good but you can get similar items else where and the fact that I was charged twice for tips without realizing it was very off putting."

It seems to have food influenced by Thai cuisines. I got the chicken and waffles ($21), and it tasted great! It had a kick of spice to it, which was unexpected. It wasn't super spicy to most people, but I have an extremely low tolerance of spiciness. The chicken did not have a bone inside it, and had a good crisp to it. The sauce was flavorful, and the waffle was cooked finely.The service of the place was great! The waiters and waitresses were so great, friendly, and checked in a lot. There is a decent wait to get seated, and the employees gave us water outside while we wait. The hostesses and hosts say that the wait will be 40 minutes, but it doesn't take that long. Parking can be tricky; you're best luck is to find street parking and have to walk for a little bit. Overall, I highly recommend trying this place!

""You make me wake up happy"" is your traditional waffle, bacon, sausage and eggs.Ordered the breakfast burrito sans meat, add avocado.The ppl next to us ordered the peaches and cream waffle dessert, that thang smelled and looked so delicious.Mimosas are $13 to begin and $10 refills.Fun fact: this business adds 3% fee to your bill to pay for kitchen staff health care. Met her at a bar, keep doing the damn thing!"
10/31/2021,20211031,1,4.46,Possibly worst breakfast burrito I've ever had. That's all I'll say. Literally terrible.

I bless this restaurant and cook with all of my heart.. my breakfast was the BOMB.They have great coffee, a variety of food delights including some vegetarian/vegan options.The servers are friendly, the service was fast and the ambiance here is amazing. Felt like I was in my own kitchen hanging with family and friends."
11/7/2021,20211107,4,4.46,"the Flintstone waffle is very Instagrammable but isn't as good as it looks. It's solid but the ""ice cream"" tastes like whipped cream. We had the regular plain waffle with syrup as well and that was absolutely delicious. I would recommend getting that.The wake me up waffle comes up scrambled eggs and a sausage. The eggs were the same quality as shitty hotel eggs. Definitely recommend sticking with the plain waffle at this place"
11/11/2021,20211111,5,4.46,"One of my favorite places for brunch. Friendly service and the mimosas are very generous on the bubbly. I have had savory items and sweet items : waffles, sandwiches and really it's all good."
11/13/2021,20211113,3,4.46,"Have always seen this place on my drive to work and finally went with my friend to try it. The service was great and all the staff were super friendly! The food was a bit underwhelming. My ""unforgettable"" chorizo toast was pretty forgettable. There wasn't much chorizo on it to begin with. The classic eggs Benedict was pretty good, it was a decent dish. All in all, it was an alright experience. Probably wouldn't come here again as I think there are better places in the area for brunch."

And I had the avocado toast which was tasty as well. Our 2nd time I got the chicken and waffles and he got the Thai omelette. It reminded us of home and childhood. Would recommend to everyone visiting Los Angeles."
11/16/2021,20211116,5,4.46,The chicken sandwich is LEGITTTT. I love me a chicken sandwich and this is the best I've ever had. Highly recommend.
11/17/2021,20211117,3,4.46,"I'm disappointed in my experience today. I ordered the Wake Up Happy Breakfast with a side of potatoes. It came with a waffle, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage. I paid to add fruit, a side of potatoes and side of Nutella. Cost $31 and change after tax and fees.When I got my order the waffle was super cold. I asked the waitress if she could just warm it up for me. She asked if I would like a fresh new waffle instead. I said yes, thank you. I asked if she would put my eggs back on the stove while she was at it since they were wetter than I'd prefer.When I got the food back the waffles were hot and the eggs well cooked, but the cast iron skillet holding the eggs was completely rusted. I don't know if I was being spited or if it was a mere oversight, but I didn't feel comfortable eating from a rusty pot. I quietly pointed it out and to the waitress and left it at that. The three stars is because despite my experience today the waitress was polite and helpful. I've been here a few times before and food and service was good."
11/18/2021,20211118,1,4.46,"Ordered on grubhub and it arrived within 10 min of being picked up. Presentation of waffletella was good but it was soggy and cold. Matcha latte was also cold and lacked flavor, probably worst one I've ever had. Breakfast potatoes arrived the same, cold and not crispy as requested. Did I mention this was $46??? Ridiculous."
11/18/2021,20211118,4,4.46,Food was good. I would go there again. Odd restaurant name; not very appetizing lol I had eggs and bacon and waffles and OJ. They used 100% real maple syrup and fresh squeezed OJ yummmy :)
11/19/2021,20211119,4,4.46,"Really good food , refreshing drinks and fast service. Had breakfast here on our last day in LA , wish I had done it more than once."
11/20/2021,20211120,5,4.46,"Another breakfast/brunch café that hits the spot. We came during prime brunch time around 10AM and there was already a line waiting out of the door. You have to place yourself on the waitlist, but the wait was only about 20 minutes. For brunch, it usually boils down to sweet vs savory. Not sure which one you want? That's okay because this place has got you covered for both. I ordered the white truffle toast with smoked salmon and my friend ordered French toast with berries. Both dishes were amazing in their own way! They were also pretty generous with the white truffle, maybe a little bit too generous for my liking haha. As with any other restaurants in LA, parking can be a little difficult. Street parking is your best bet for this place."
11/21/2021,20211121,5,4.46,Such an amazing breakfast. Delicious food and excellent service!Any place that has waffles with ice cream for breakfast is a win for sure!!
11/22/2021,20211122,5,4.46,"Excellent breakfast/brunch spot that hit all the notes. Wonderful service, cozy vibe, and incredible food!OH WOW CRISPY FRENCH TOAST ($16.50) - Absolutely decadent! Great to share with the table! This hits all the spots for the perfect french toast - cinnamon, soft brioche, Nutella, and berries. Highly highly recommend this dish!FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLE ($21) - This was a unique Thai twist to chicken & waffle. The chicken was seasoned with tom yum seasoning, which adds a bit of spice and tang paired with sweet maple syrup and a spicy-sweet jam. The waffle was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Highly recommend!WOW YOU'RE DIFFERENT WAFFLE BENEDICT ($17) - I always order an eggs benedict when I go to a brunch place because I would never make this dish at home. This hits the spot! A little complaint was the outside of the waffle was not crispy enough and the potatoes were overly crispy. The waffle in the chicken & waffle was perfect! Nevertheless, still a good eggs benedict.MATCHA LATTE ($5.50 +$1 Almond Milk) - Splendid cup of matcha latte that wakes you up in the morning. Not overly sweet and perfectly creamyFRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE ($6.50) - Underwhelming cup of OJ. Would skip this and order something else.Shoutout to everyone that works at Met Her At A Bar! The service was impeccable! The waitresses made great suggestions and checked up on us from time to time. Can't wait to return and try the other items on their menu!"
11/23/2021,20211123,5,4.46,"Man I can't believe I'm yelp elite and didn't think to see if they had a yelp waitlist... they did. I came on sunday and waited about an hour for a party of two. They had tables but I guess not enough staff. Their chicken and waffles sounded amazing. We ordered our food and it came pretty quickly. I just got the cold brew coffee with oatmilk and chicken n waffles and waffle fries. The chicken and waffles was thai style with tom yum seasoning and fried basil. It came with a thai hot sauce, maple butter? or some form of butter. and maple syrup? Pretty sure it wasn't just normal syrup. but yeah. tom yum seasoning.... more like tom yum sauce? Not sure what the seasoning was. Anyways. The chicken was super crunchy and crispy. pretty moist on the inside but had some dry parts. the hot sauce was pretty spicy. Everything worked so well together. crispy crunchy sweet salty spicy juicy chicken on a soft waffle. so many components that blend so well together. The waffle fries were pretty good. soft just the way i like em. had curly fry seasoning and stuff.... and yeah. not much else to say.The cold brew was alright. I'm not a coffee snob like i am a snob of other things so not much to comment about there.... oatmilk is $1 extra. ummmm. i didn't see that on the menu and would have been nice to know but eh. Overall, pretty good. would eat again. gotta remember to check in on yelp ahead of time next time."
11/24/2021,20211124,3,4.46,The food is not as great as it looks and it was definitely not worth the price. We had the chicken and waffle and the chicken was delicious but the waffle was kinda cold. I got the waffle with eggs and the eggs were watery.
11/25/2021,20211125,5,4.46,"Favorite brunch spot along La brea! I love how they look out for their workers as well! The customer service was great as well as the food. It is a pretty small spot, however it makes it very cute and cozy which is probably why it gets packed really quickly. Their matcha latte was also really good as it was not too powdery unlike some places. Parking can be a iffy, but we got lucky and found street parking just right in front of it. Overall great place!!"
11/27/2021,20211127,5,4.46,"We came during the week to this spot after one of our hikes. There was very little steer parking so we drove down a couple street down into the neighborhood and found a paid parking lot. From the parking lot, it was a short 5 minute walk to the restaurant. After approaching the host, we were seated outside right away. I normally don't prefer to sit outside, but it was a nice warm day.After looking over the menu we were sold on the Avocado Toast ($14.50) which came with avocado, tomato, parmesan cheese on a sourdough bread. It was delicious! We tried their Fried Chicken and Waffle and it was pretty good! We also had their Lemonade which was very refreshing. It's a very laid back atmosphere and our waitress was friendly and attentive. This place has very good food and some vegetarian and vegan options. I was impressed."
11/27/2021,20211127,5,4.46,"Met up with friends for brunch & we had a blast!Wait Time 4.5/5Arrived around 10:15am today aka Saturday , seating was available right away.Only con was that we weren't able to be seated until our whole party arrived. Service 5/5Our server, Jake was beyond amazing! He took his time with us & was very insightful when we asked for his help deciding between dishes.Workers are very attentive & constantly check in Food 4.5/5Chicken & Waffles were crispy & delicious highly recommended ! Waffles & Berries were perfect not too sweet!Huevos Rancheros were okay, could have used some more sauce in between the layers.My friends had the Chai Lattes and said they were good ""subtle chai flavor and couldn't taste the matcha but felt it's effects"" , there is an extra charge for oat milk.Mimosa was small for the cost don't recommend.HOT TIP: Park at the parking garage right across the street to avoid driving in circles.Overall my friends & I really enjoyed the environment & food."
11/27/2021,20211127,5,4.46,Got the waffle eggs benedict with mimosas and it was *chefs kiss*. Service was good and the environment was really chill. Definitely would recommend
11/28/2021,20211128,5,4.46,"This review is for my takeout experience this morning. I ordered both variations of eggs Benedict off of the yelp app. The whole process was smooth and the order was ready for pickup in a timely manner. The only con, and it's understandable with takeout, is that the meal is sort of disassembled. The eggs rolled off of the muffins into the corner of the box, and the sauce is separated and slightly too small of a portion. Despite that, the food was amazing!!!! I can only imagine how much better it would taste eating at the location. That is exactly what I'm going to do next time I throw this business lots of cash for delicious food!!!"
11/28/2021,20211128,3,4.46,"Don't have much to say about this place except that I don't understand the hype? I stopped by here on a Saturday. 30 minute wait, not bad. We ordered breakfast burrito, an omelette, French roast, and fried chicken and waffles. We all agreed that we gave it a 3/5. Tasteless, but decent quality? Wouldn't visit again."
11/30/2021,20211130,4,4.46,"81 degrees out in Los Angeles as we end the Thanksgiving weekend!!! My sister was visiting from Seattle (after 2 long years) so what else better to do than go to brunch to enjoy this beautiful weather. As a backstory, we have been deciding on where to go for brunch this weekend a week before the actual outing. After looking through Yelp reviews and reviewing la.eater.com's 14 Essential Brunch Destinations in LA, we opted for #5-Met Her at a Bar. It's right on the corner of busy La Brea Ave & 8th street. There is of course a line outside and be prepared to wait at least 30-40 mins, longer for a larger party. We waited patiently outside on the side wall and opted to buy some drinks while we waited. You can get your Mimosa or Hibuscus Cooler in a plastic cup and look through their menu online as you wait to be seated. Definitely gave me a bit of a buzz as the sun struck high above my head at noon. Finally, as we were seated 45 mins later, we definitely knew what we wanted. As for me, I opted for the Lox Eggs Benedict. I've eaten a lot of Eggs Benedict in my life and theirs did not disappoint. The egg was perfectly poached and runny inside and the hollandaise sauce was not broken as I'm sure we've all had to experience in other brunch places. It's served with a side salad of field greens which is a much better option than going heavy with potatoes on the side. My daughter had their Wake Up Happy breakfast that came with a large waffle (berries additional), sausages, bacon and scrambled eggs. My brother had the Chicken + Waffle plate. The chicken was crispy and had good seasoning. My sister had the Classic Eggs Benedict, and as I already mentioned, the sauce was creamy and smooth and didn't feel as heavy as most sauces in other places. The Huevos Rancheros plate was okay only because I've definitely had better. Last but not least, their White Truffle Toast. The white truffle was grated over scrambled eggs and ham on top of wheat toast. Although good, I could've ordered this with a poached egg and it would've been dynamite. Perhaps next visit. Overall, the food and drinks were all amazing. If your carb of choice is a short stack, then you've come to the wrong place. This establishment does not have pancakes on the menu. Lucky for me, my daughter was not disappointed by the waffle, probably because it was laden with fresh berries. Be prepared to show a copy of your vaccination card as part of SafePassLA, which requires certain establishments to verify that patrons (not employees) are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Also, be prepared to pay 20% party gratuity for larger groups and a ""Healthcare Love"" tag at an additional 3%. Will definitely try coming back another time and trying out other dishes on the menu. Stay safe and healthy diners!"
12/2/2021,20211202,5,4.46,"I have had a grudge against L.A for as long as I can remember. Between my hate of heat, overpopulation, and the idea that it's overrated I was bound to find something wrong. But I went just to say I went. Met Her at a Bar has quickly made L.A one of my favorite places to travel to. Let's explore further. Ambience/Service: The space is filled with plants, beautiful, almost industrial style lighting, and sweet staff. Both times that I've gone, I was seated literally within 5minutes during rush hour. No reservations here but you are put on a waitlist when you arrive. Ive never had an issue. Food: I didn't expect the sheer size of my food. The first time I went back in February, I ordered the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken is cooked Thai style with Tom yum seasoning--I'm sorry what? That absolutely threw me for a loop. And the waffle? Waffles are very easy to mess up-- no such much here and thank goodness for that. I'll be honest, this last October on my second visit I was in the middle of family trauma, so I don't remember what I ordered. And I also forgot to take a picture, but it was lovely nonetheless. What I do remember is that they were kind and that's really all that mattered at that point. Drinks: Enter the main reason why MHAAB was on my mind for 8 months: the Power Chai Latte. If you get nothing else, this is the reason that you go. Potent, balanced, and quite frankly addicting. I mean if I'm flying nearly 3,000 miles to get it... I'll let you figure that one out. The red sangria is also delicious. I feel like I just undersold the sangria. *chuckles*L.A, my one hated archnemesis, MHAAB saved you all those months ago and you now have the pleasure of seeing me again soon. As always, happy eating and drinking. M&M"
12/6/2021,20211206,5,4.46,"Good food and spot for brunch. Really enjoyed my time. The only thing is if you are sitting outside, there are lots of trucks and busses passing by which might be a little disturbing and noisy."
12/7/2021,20211207,5,4.46,"Incredibly friendly staff, quick service and great quality food and coffee! They never cease to deliver amazing services and kind attitudes! Parking is easy on the streets around here."
12/8/2021,20211208,1,4.46,"I go this place to eat everyday , I live across the street in the building complex and the food is great , the new manager MARIA PULL ME TO SIDE AMD SAID THAT I NEED A MASK TO COME IN , I was wearing my mask from the out side to the seating area and she said that the Id and the vaccine card was not good enough and I would have to sit out side , I come here everyday and love the staff and food ,, But the new manager MARIA IS RUDE AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND NEEDS TO BE TRAINED ON PROPER WAY TO TALK TO CUSTOMERS . Very poor service today"
12/10/2021,20211210,5,4.46,There's a reason why the celebs come here! It's delicious and offers lots of options for breakfast. The chicken waffle in particular is so savory and delicious you will not regret ordering it. The mocha latte also amazingly crafted. We are from the Central Valley and would definitely come back again next time we're in LA.
12/11/2021,20211211,1,4.45,Overpriced place and food was cold and mimosas were nasty. Place is dirty. This experience was Very disappointing.
12/11/2021,20211211,3,4.45,"Got food to go. With the Khai Jiao omelette and waffle Benedict. Order was ready quickly. Customer service was very nice. Food was overall OK, but was given a English muffin and potatoes rather than the waffle and salad that we ordered."
12/12/2021,20211212,4,4.45,Covid- i've been a few times and they're definitely checking for vaccine cards at the door. Customer Service- I think the customer service is pretty decent sometimes you'll get a grumpy bartender but I don't know that it's LA so what are you expect sometimes. Food- personally I've had several dishes there and the two most popular ones that I've always going back to are the truffle ravioli and the crispy calamari appetizer. Definitely have to give this a five star review. However some of the other pastas I've tried I feel like I've been just mediocre. Bar- i'm often at the bar and go at least once every 3 to 4 weeks and find the drinks to be pretty great the jalapeño beverage is delicious. And there's another one with blueberries! Overall it's a go to spot at our corner.
12/14/2021,20211214,5,4.45,First time visiting and I MUST SAY EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! I had the chicken and waffles (so good that you could slap your mama) and my fiancé had the Waffle make me so happy (or something like that). Food came out super quick and service was excellent. The spacing is a little small but other than that everything was GREEEEEEAT
12/15/2021,20211215,5,4.45,"I fall in love with this place. It is a small but cozy place where you can enjoy the tastes of the waffles. This place has a great selection of food and everything is too tasty. My favorite two so far are Chicken Waffle and White Truffle Toast. Those two taste great! Chicken Waffle comes with maple syrup, butter, and spicy sauce. If you like to spice the way I do, you have to try it! My favorite drink there is Thai tea. Its sweet but not extra sweet. The staff is nice and friendly. They serve food fast, you do not have to wait for so long. The atmosphere there is so cozy."
12/15/2021,20211215,3,4.45,I sat outside and the chairs and tables aren't the most comfortable.. it's also on a busy street so it's hard to talk with company... I got the chicken and waffles what was the best chicken and waffles I had! The mimosas are good! The food is also not too expensive. We spend around $75 together with mimosas and chicken and waffles. The waiters did come check up on us 5 times by different people in one hour time what started to get us in a not so relaxing mood.
12/21/2021,20211221,4,4.45,"Very good food, unfortunately not very well organized from tables point of view otherwise once you get a table it's a real joy. Great job keep it up very well recommend it. Book your table in advance"
12/22/2021,20211222,5,4.45,"Wanted to have brunch with my daughter and niece found this place on yelp. It was extremely busy but the hostess was very sweet and have a wait time of 25min ,she winked and said it was worth the wait and let me tell you it definitely was both food and drinks were amazing and the service was great too once we sat down we got the menu our water took our order brought out our drinks Bloody Mary and mimosa yummmmm.Then the food came avocado toast, chicken and waffles a breakfast burrito you can enjoy the next day it was soooo good and calamari was delicious too ."
12/27/2021,20211227,3,4.45,"I visited this spot for brunch while in LA upon a local friend's recommendation. We sat outside in this super cute gated park let decorated with living trees and cute little tables. They also had plenty of other outdoor seating along the side wall under a makeshift tent. When we visited they were also seating indoors. The menu is large and has lots of fun waffle options. Both my friend and I order the eggs benedict, she ordered the original and myself, the florentine. My Benedict was just okay. The English muffin was barely toasted and the hollandaise was nothing special. The Benedict does come with your choice of greens, potatoes, or fruit. I asked for greens, but they brought me potatoes and when I mentioned it, quickly brought out a side salad as well. I considered myself lucky because the potatoes were delicious! I'll need to come back to try the matcha waffle!Overall, the service was great and the dishes came very quickly, but the food was just okay and not worth the brunch price tag."
12/27/2021,20211227,1,4.45,Worst customer service ever even if you spend money and buy 6 items do not even try asking for anything else like extra ketchup because they are very very cheap when it comes to that. Some lady actually counted my items and said they already gave me ketchup and that asking for extra is a big NO NO I even offer to pay for that extra ketchup never been to a place like this where customers have no right to ask for anything extra. Beware you can Always spend your hard earn money some where else.o
12/28/2021,20211228,4,4.45,"I came here to catch up with my friend! They added little flower vases on every table. The food is cute! The waffle was warm, crunchy, and tasty. It was good, but it wasn't filling at all. If you want something more filling, don't order this. It was pretty costly for something so small. It was around $20 for a waffle and some berries.My friend ordered the waffle and chicken. She had 3 dipping sauces. The service was nice! The waitress asked/checked up on us a few times to make sure we had everything we needed. I enjoyed it, and I would definitely go back again if it wasn't a longer drive for me. I took off one star because of the price. It was a little overboard, but everything else was great!"
12/29/2021,20211229,5,4.45,The waffles were delicious! It's very hard to find crispy and flavorful waffles but they were able to make delicious tasting waffles! Will be back!
1/2/2022,20220102,4,4.45,"Today was my first time, customer service is good and the waiters are friendly but honestly the outside seating is horrible on the sidewalk and the table is so tiny there's not even room to put the food, I highly recommend they work on their patio seating especially that now a lot of people like outdoor dining and we are in sunny California so people will always like sitting outside/outdoors :-)  Food is good"
1/5/2022,20220105,5,4.45,"This is such a cute brunch spot known for celebrities spottings. I didnt see anyone the day I went lol. We added our names to the waitlist and also went later in the day so didnt have to wait too long. We were seated in maybe 15 mins. It is also located on the corner of a busy street so definitely plan to arrive a bit earlier to find parking.Typical brunch menu but tastes delicious and instagram worthy. We got French Toast, Eggs Benedict and the cauliflower tempura based on other yelpers. Cauliflower tempura did not disappoint and caught me off guard since we had breakfast food but my oh my. I practically inhaled the cauliflower. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a light appetizer"
1/7/2022,20220107,2,4.45,"Wouldn't know how good the food is, because when we got there they wouldn't sit us. We drove 30 mins to go here and called ahead because we knew we were cutting it close getting there at 2:30 when they close at 3:00 but they assured us as long as we knew what we wanted and put our order in by 2:45 it would be totally fine. Got there at 2:30 and they said no lol We told them about how we called and it still didn't matter. So just so you all know they technically close at 2:30, I'm sure the food is bomb."
1/9/2022,20220109,1,4.45,"Lol. They would t serve me because I left a review about them trying to sneak in ""insurance"" money on the bill with out informing me"
1/10/2022,20220110,5,4.45,"I LOVE IT HERE !!! Thai tea is amazing ! Nutella waffle is my go to with Thai tea, their omelets are also very good !"
1/11/2022,20220111,5,4.45,"First time trying this place and it was a great experience! I was seated right away so make sure to make a reservation as this place can get really busy. I tried a not so popular dish from their menu (based on the photos I've NOT seen here on yelp) and MAN, it was gooood!!! Perfect portion and it wasn't too heavy. Just right! Also, I don't typically order a flavored latte but their hazelnut latte was perfect for my wafflebello."
1/14/2022,20220114,5,4.45,"I'm a big fan of this place, I love the Asian twist to their dishes. For example it wasn't just a regular fried chicken and waffles, but it was enhanced with a basil chili flavor to the chicken!"
1/16/2022,20220116,5,4.45,"Egg Benedict, Avocado Toast, and Waffles are my fav at this place. Love the atmosphere and their scrumptious food are even more lovable."
1/17/2022,20220117,4,4.45,"I was curious about this place after seeing the restaurant sign while on the road, and got a chance to try it out this morning for brunch. Unfortunately, the Yelp app waitlist was turned off and we had to add ourselves on the waitlist only in person. We braved ourselves for a 35-40 minute wait but we're surprised to be seated within 10 minutes. Honestly, I think it is because I chose next available seat versus choosing indoor or outdoor options. We ended up sitting outside the restaurant in camping looking tents-- which is not always ideal, but we were already hungry and anything will do at that point. We ordered the Thai omelette and chicken waffle dishes. We also ordered coffee and a matcha latte, but those came out so late-- after our food came out. Ugh. So I did ding a star for that.The food saved this review. Honestly, so good. The omelette dish could've done with less rice, but it was still flavorful. The chicken and waffle was certainly a fun twist on a classic fav--- and it came with a sweet/sour sauce, butter, and maple syrup. Chicken was not dry. Company wasn't bad either.I am curious how the inside of the restaurant looks like though! Maybe I'd return? And not sit outside by the loud road..."
1/17/2022,20220117,3,4.45,"I'd give the food a 4-5 star. Pros: definitely try the chicken, it was really good with a hint of spice. Yummy! I got the Turkey bacon and the French toast with easy Nutella. I'm not really a French toast person but it was really good. Soft with the right amount of crunch also. The chai latte was also really good and my friend loved the pineapple mimosas. 10/10 recommend. Cons: The Turkey bacon was basic and could have passed on that. I'm giving it a 3 because of the service. We had to flag down our waiter just to leave. Also to order we weren't even provided a QR code and had to ask for it because of course there's no hard menu due to covid. So it was weird when the waiter asked for our drinks when we hadn't even been provided a way to access the menu. The wait was a little long but the upside is you can add yourself to the waitlist and they'll text you when it's your turn. Covid: seating is wayyyyy to close to the next guest especially outside seating. You can still get covid outside so having a little more room between guest would be nice for future.Ehhhh idk if I'd come back on my own, maybe if someone invited me, there's a possibility."
1/17/2022,20220117,5,4.45,They're super fast as well to bringing your food fast. The food amazing and everyone was so sweet. I definitely will coming back again and will tell more people!
1/18/2022,20220118,5,4.45,"This place is awesome! Right across the street from the brother location. Brunch is always good here and the environment is always fun and energetic! If you're in the area, you can't go wrong."
1/20/2022,20220120,4,4.45,"4.5 star for dine in3 stars for take-outThis is an adorable brunch spot in mid-city! And the story how the owners met is literally the cutest thing. They have great waffles and other brunch items. Usually gets pretty busy during the weekends so definitely plan ahead. They have both indoor and outdoor seating options. I've only had good dine-in experiences-- friendly staff and delicious food (but questionable take-out experiences...). Their menu is on the pricier side, but it's worth it to check out at least once!I work close by so I order take-out quite often. Unfortunately this place have gotten my orders wrong multiple times. And each time it's quite hilarious and disappointing. The first time I ordered take-out for the crispy chicken sandwich, they forgot the chicken in the chicken sandwich--- it was just a bun with the sauce and the kale slaw (I have no clue how they could forget the main ingredient ahh). The second time, they gave me a salad instead of my favourite waffle fries (I was sooo sad because waffle fries are my favourite). So they did reimburse me when I notified them of my sad wrong order, but I will not recommend ordering take-out ever.. or make sure they have all the ingredients in your order before leaving when you pick up!"
1/20/2022,20220120,5,4.45,"Food always on point vibe and energy is dope perfect for a nice brunch date , I'm always here"
1/21/2022,20220121,4,4.45,"The food was delicious, waffle was soft and they have Turkey bacon, a huge plus for me. The fruit were fresh and the staff was amazing. The pineapple mimosa is amazing! There were tiny bugs flying around our food however and it became annoying. The parking is ok, there's a parking garage near and it's about a 2 minute walk from there to the restaurant. You must be vaccinated to be seated there however and there's a 3% charge added to your total. Otherwise, good food and staff, just the flying bugs."
1/22/2022,20220122,4,4.45,"Who doesn't love brunch on a Sunday?! I came here for brunch around 11 and there was definitely a wait (they don't take reservations on the weekends) but the line does move fairly quickly! I waited about 45 minutes before getting seated. My friends & I ordered a few different items to share and our favorite was the chicken & waffles. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and came with a spicy dipping sauce that paired well with chicken. The waffles were also light and fluffy!TIP: I found out later that Met Him At A Bar (right across the street) also serves the same popular brunch items since they're managed by the same owner! Although the menu is limited, it does help if you're in a time crunch and don't feel like waiting over an hour for brunch."
1/23/2022,20220123,5,4.45,"They have a wide assortment of French toast and waffles, which I love. The crispy french toast is as pretty solid. The cornflakes on the bottom was a nice touch. Also tried the chicken and waffles. The sweet and sour sauce was a nice touch."
1/23/2022,20220123,5,4.45,The portobello waffle sandwich was soooo good! Our server was very helpful too and really knew the menu very well.
1/25/2022,20220125,4,4.45,"Sometimes takes a while to get a table, it's a small space and popular... so prep your tummy. The servers are always super awesome. So friendly. The new(ish) manager is incredibly nice. She even sat down with us to talk to my wee lass. She told me how she switched to this place from another restaurant and was really enjoying this place. Totally showed. I've been here a few times previously, but she def made the experience the best thus far. I always get the waffles n berries. I don't eat breakfast often, so when I do, I want dessert for breakfast. Sweet and carboriffic."
1/26/2022,20220126,4,4.45,"Good but a smidge underwhelming because the hype is so big. Everything is good - but the kind of good where you don't feel the need to bring your leftovers home and you don't stuff yourself 'cause the taste is incredible. We had the waffle benedict, burrito, and french toast. Would never suggest someone not go here, but for the price and the wait I'll continue to check out other brunch spots."
1/27/2022,20220127,5,4.45,I like wafflesh.here you can eat the most of delicious waffles in the city. I ordered chicken and waffles. It was perfect.
1/29/2022,20220129,3,4.45,"Cute spot, was expecting a tad more cause of the hype... Food was pretty good, but we were asked to leave after only siting for 40 minutes cause they needed the table, I found that uncalled for and rude given it was 40 mins! Lol."
2/3/2022,20220203,5,4.45,"Want a cool trendy safe place to have a good meal in one of the busiest city? Look no further. Met Her At A Bar has you covered! From the moment you arrive they make you feel safe by checking your ID and vaccine card. They make you feel welcome with their constant smiles and checking to make sure there's nothing else you need. They make a killer chicken. I couldn't decide between the chicken and waffle or the French toast so my husband had me order the chicken, since I didn't care to have waffles, and the French toasts. Their chicken was boneless, crispy, and spicy to perfection. I'm so glad I tried it! The French Toast were good too. Oh and did I mention I tried their top quality Macha Latte?! Another must try! And I'm usually not in the mood for Macha, but the waiter convinced me and I'm so glad he did. Overall, everything was great and I can't wait to be back in LA to visit this place again."
2/4/2022,20220204,5,4.45,"LOVE it here. We stopped in for a friend's birthday and the service was incredible. They were so sweet and nice, and they even put a little candle in her waffle!The food was beautiful. One of my friends ordered the vegan salted caramel waffle, and it was the prettiest breakfast food I've ever seen. I ordered Mama's Omelet, which was great!! My other friend said her chicken and waffles ""tasted like joy on a plate"", so if that's not a glowing review, I don't know what is.The story behind the restaurant is so cute - the owners really did meet at a bar, and their love story is adorable.Definitely recommend it here, and I'm very happy we picked it to celebrate."
2/5/2022,20220205,1,4.44,This happened twice now Order shame thing either it's cold or uncooked (microwave). Chicken and waffles.
2/6/2022,20220206,2,4.44,"The gnats are abundant in this restaurant! It's was so annoying to need to swat 7 gnats away from your food constantly! You have to know some got in the food! The food was good however, due to the incessant bugs flying nonstop and dive bombing our food constantly I'll not come back. The wait was 35 minutes on a Sunday. Not bad. You have to electronically put yourself in line to be seated. Unfortunately, there is nothing posted to indicate that this was necessary in order to be seated. This caused a group of confused people gathering at the entrance waiting for a hostess to help them only to be ignored. They could at least point you in the right direction. Signage is needed. They added the gratuity on the bill when we where not a large party. They also charged us extra for the employee health care! They also charge tax on the healthcare! Most definitely will not be back!"
2/6/2022,20220206,5,4.44,"This place has a special place in my heart! I love it. I had the eggs with the bacon and sausage with the waffle and it was all extremely good ! Very much a place to take good breakfast food pictures if you know what I mean. I've heard it gets extremely busy to the point where you're too close to the people next to you, but overall I'd definitely recommend coming here."
2/6/2022,20220206,5,4.44,Delicious food. Ambience is great and the service is nice! Definitely a go-to spot for brunch!
2/6/2022,20220206,5,4.44,"Brunch is my favorite meal. And this place is a standout for someone who likes almost all forms of brunch. My cappuccino was foamy and perfect. My husbands Orange juice tasted fresh squeezed from an orange you can only dream of. We shared a coffee cake that was dry and nothing special, but that didn't detract from the main meals. I had the waffles Benedict. The hollaindaise was spicy and lemony which went well with the salt from the ham and sweet from the waffle. He had the Thai chicken and waffles which was the right amount of spice and sweet and crunch. We both enjoyed our meals and each other's, and will be coming back."
2/8/2022,20220208,1,4.44,Waited over an hour and 50 minutes for a terrible meal. The grain bowl was bland and the didn't taste fresh. It took almost 45 minutes for my cappuccino to arrive and it was so cold.
2/16/2022,20220216,4,4.44,"Just noticed, they add for ""Healthcare Love,"" pretax onto the bill. Luckily, they've extended their outdoor seating beyond their small patio, further down the sidewalk. Met a girlfriend here for brunch on the weekend. I ordered the berry waffles, which was beautifully presented, with a chocolate heart drawn on the plate and a yellow pansy flower garnish. It tasted as good as it looks. The coffee wasn't bad either.Regarding parking, there is no lot, so you have to look for street parking. No meters."
2/16/2022,20220216,5,4.44,In town for the week and decided to try this place out. Let me say it was worth my 45 minute drive for some amazing breakfast. Everything tasted so fresh and my mocha latte was perfect. The poached egg was the right amount of runny on my toast. Will be back again!
2/16/2022,20220216,5,4.44,"Sooooo delicious. Found this place off of tiktok and thought I'd give it a try. First, their waffles are to die for. Perfectly fluffy and crunchy and the sweetness from the fruit and extra toppings is a perfect after breakfast treat. Their matcha latte is so delicious and tastes super smooth and will leave you craving more. Good items and good vibes definitely coming back again when I'm in the area"
2/18/2022,20220218,4,4.44,"This is a really cute location for brunch but I wasn't swept away by the menu.The food that I tasted was solid. It was good. However nothing that amazing. Pricing is also on the high end. Along with my matcha latte I had a mimosa. Mimosa was pretty standard and unfortunately not bottomless. Price of one mimosa was $12 and a refill was $11. The matcha latte was fine. My partner ordered the Thai omelette and I had the eggs Benedict. The Thai omelette was yummy but definitely something that can easily be whipped up at home. The eggs Benedict were good, not great.Overall what earns this place 4 stars is the service. Great service on a Friday afternoon. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken a couple minutes after we were seated. Server came to check on us throughout our stay as well.Would definitely return here if given the opportunity but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
2/18/2022,20220218,5,4.44,The food is amazing and the service is great as well. I went in Valentine's day for bunch and it was great. The waffle was so fluffy and the fruit was fresh. Cotton candy mimosa was delicious and their orange juice was freshly squeeze. We didn't even mind sitting outside and watching the bus stop every 7 minutes. I would definitely go there again.
2/18/2022,20220218,1,4.44,I unfortunately didn't have a pleasant experience at the restaurant.The hostess wouldn't let us dine in without a face maskWhich I understand is the law right now but the restaurant should at least PROVIDE THEM.Come onWe'd enter your restaurant just to take off our face mask 5 feet after!!! My husband and I are also vaccinated! Which we showed proof of. Again I do understand it's what is required right now but the hostess didn't have to be so rude about it Which is I left instead of eating outside You guys lost some loyal customers here and will no longer be recommending this place to anyone anymore.
2/23/2022,20220223,4,4.44,"On the corner of La Brea right across from Met Him at a Bar. Yelp waitlist: time shown on iPad inaccurate. 95 minutes on waitlist = 35 minutes, though I wish the hostesses would have said something about the very large disparity when I was signing up my name. 1/2 star off. Star of the show: chicken (and waffles). The chicken was so tender because of its marinade. The chicken skin was crispy and spicy, but not too thick (when flour bunches up and you only get large bits of fry without the chicken itself). The fried lemongrass and chili peppers made it more flavorful, and the waffle underneath was good enough as a complement. The matcha waffles and oreo waffles were tasty as well. Speed of service: the servers were friendly, but who really went above and beyond are the busboys/dish collectors. We tipped them individually because they brought out our food, took away our plates, refilled our water when no servers did, and gave us napkins when we asked. I really hope management tips them equally as the servers, but I definitely doubt it so PLEASE consider tipping them individually (in addition to servers of course)."
2/26/2022,20220226,5,4.44,"This was my first time here and my experience at this place was fantastic! Jake was my server and he took care of me extremely well from making sure I always needed a refill on mimosas to making sure my food tasted how it was supposed to taste. He set a tone !As a representative of the company, Jake did a fine job representing who works at this establishment.Management was also great with how they handled their customers as I was absorbing the vibe of the place. People need to come here for brunch!"
2/26/2022,20220226,5,4.44,"During our stay in LA, we stayed across the street at an AirbNb & found this spot via yelp. The food was amazing, the chorizo toast, the eggs, everything was great. This is definitely a place to eat if in the area. Staff was attentive & friendly"
2/26/2022,20220226,4,4.44,Went here for brunch with a friend! The menu was large and inclusive! The vibe is very laid back and cozy for its size. We waited for a smidge and found parking on a back street. I got the benedict which is honestly hard to go wrong with.
2/27/2022,20220227,5,4.44,"Came here for brunch today and were so thrilled with our experience! We had about an hour wait (which we expected), but once we were seated we really enjoyed ourselves. Our server was super friendly and gave great recommendations. I had a pineapple juice mimosa topped with cotton candy and the chicken and waffles - both were divine! It took a few minutes for us to close out, but we weren't too put off by it. Can't wait to come back!"
2/27/2022,20220227,5,4.44,Came here without a reservation on a beautiful Sunday in November while my parents were in town. We're sat immediately at a nice table outside and they gave us umbrellas for shade. Every one we interacted with was an absolute joy! The food came out fast and hot which was so surprising considering the time of day! My mom ordered a virgin Bloody Mary and holy cow it was the best Bloody Mary I have ever tasted! Great service great price for portion and loved the location! Will definitely be back.
3/2/2022,20220302,5,4.44,"The food was so good! The entire vibe of the restaurant is super cool! I went on Sunday morning and the place was pretty packed. Even with that, the food came out MUCH faster than I expected. Service was efficient as well. I do wish they served water in larger water cups, I had to request our waiter to bring water several tips. I definitely want to try more menu items!"
3/3/2022,20220303,5,4.44,Amazing!! Food was delicious I got the lox waffle it was so good. And also the Thai iced tea so yummy would definitely come again. Customer service is great. We got seated in 5min we came around 11am on a Thursday. Would definitely come again!
3/3/2022,20220303,3,4.44,"I really enjoy the food here but I have to say I had to send my drinksback cleanse isn't a top priority here. My mug was really old and chipped had to ask for a to go. I asked for cream on the side. The cream cup was dirty as fuck, it had a stain inside could had been espresso chia but it was gross"
3/3/2022,20220303,5,4.44,"This place is guaranteed to be packed on the weekend for brunch but is worth the wait. (Pro-tip, join the waitlist on Yelp before leaving your house!) Every dish I've had is yummy and the drinks are too. Portions are perfect, not too much food that you're wasteful and not too little that I'm still hungry after paying $20 for a plate. The staff are friendly and the hostesses really do a good job managing the hungry crowd. Your entire party is to be present before seating so plan accordingly. Street parking is tough but there's a parking garage across the street."
3/6/2022,20220306,5,4.44,"First time here. My group and I (10 total) didn't have reservations but we were put on a wait list and seated within 15-20 minutes! I think that was pretty fast considering how busy they were! The service was great, the food was AMAZING!! Everything !! I would recommend this to anyone. They have vegan/vegetarian options as well, you really can't go wrong. The flavors, the fast service, the atmosphere..I don't think I need to go on. It is a must and I will come here as often as I can from now on. Make sure to get your mimosas with the cotton candy! SHOUT OUT TO THE CHEF, Chef Miguel because he did his thing back there!! The waiter Armando is THEEEE BEST waiter/server/host! He gave us a little background on the history of the restaurant which was really nice!GO TO THIS PLACE FOR BRUNCH! You will not regret it! :)"
3/6/2022,20220306,5,4.44,Best food and service hands down! Armando was great and made sure we had everything we needed.
3/7/2022,20220307,5,4.44,"So delicious, the crunchy French toast was perfect and the potatoes were savory. The food was amazing no complains at all. If you go you have to get the orange juice, it was fresh and the right amount of sweet and so fresh. I will say the tables outside were kind of small so the food didn't all fit and and seating wasn't extremely comfortable but I don't even mind bc the food was that good. However I will say it's a bit pricey, I paid 90$+ for 2 ppl"
3/7/2022,20220307,5,4.44,"Visited on a Sunday around noon. We were quoted an hour wait time and the wait was much shorter. Service was great and everything came out super quick. The hibiscus mimosa was very refreshing. I definitely recommend. We ordered the Thai chili chicken and waffles and the waffle and berries. The food was really good!! The prices were a little high for breakfast, but I guess that's to be expected for LA. Overall, I would visit again if I'm back in LA."
3/7/2022,20220307,5,4.44,Well worth the wait- you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Truly one of the best brunch spots in LA.
3/8/2022,20220308,5,4.44,Best Thai chicken ever. Literally obsessed w the food Vibes is ok but the food why I go so much.
3/9/2022,20220309,4,4.44,I liked the place. I took avocado toast and ice latte it was really good. I enjoyed time there.However it was a lot of people that's why I felt I have ro leave already. Waitress gave me a check when I didn't even asked for that. They were in a rush
3/11/2022,20220311,3,4.44,"My waffle was cold and hard. Although they offered to replace it, the replacement took forever. I think they forgot. Everyone was already finished when the waffle arrived. Also the outdoor tables are ridiculously small. Dust and fumes from the construction down the street and the buses. Only stellar item was the Thai Chicken."
3/14/2022,20220314,5,4.44,"Parking will be tricky and difficult, but that is pretty much expected in LA. We came on a Monday so the wait wasn't bad. The french toast was okay but we wouldn't get it again. My matcha latte was delicious and I highly recommend it. Their chicken and sale was the best I've had and my boyfriend said he wished he had that. Brunch came out to be $70 for two people."
3/14/2022,20220314,3,4.44,"I decided to checkout this place with two friends on a Monday afternoon. It's only ok. We ordered the Flintstone waffle and Oreo waffle to split among 3 people, and it was a good amount of food. However, our total bill ended up at $44 for only two waffles, which felt a little pricey. Flavor-wise, the waffles didn't taste too special. The waffle itself tasted pretty average for a brunch place. They provided a good amount of whipped cream on both waffles, and both that we ordered came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream too. We agreed that the toppings were what made these waffles edible and without them, the waffle itself wasn't that amazing. Overall, I'm not sure I'd return to this place in the future since the food was only ok."
3/14/2022,20220314,5,4.44,The food was great! The service was amazing. We love Maria!!! I love the little cotton candy touch on the glass of mimosa. The French toast were my favorite sweet! The potatoes with the eggs Benedict were crisp to perfection. The huevos rancheros were my favorite savory.
3/19/2022,20220319,4,4.44,"Got brunch here recently, and it was a quite a wait, which was to be expected. With such a long wait, they were able to seat us at ""Met Him At A Bar"", which had the most popular items from ""Met Her At A Bar"". The food was great, however the service was slightly lacking. Our waiter was spread very thin and didn't check on us very often, and admitted himself that he didn't know the menu and couldn't give us much help recommendation-wise. I totally get that he likely wasn't prepared to be serving brunch guests for ""Met Her At A Bar"" at his restaurant, but I do hope that they've sorted out the service issues now. Also, the hostess unknowingly let a random man walk into the restaurant, sit down at the table next to us, and hit on the customer seated there. It was only when the customer threatened that her partner was coming back did the man leave, but it was certainly an odd experience. The hostess did apologize and was very kind, but I do hope in the future they're able to prevent random strangers from entering and harassing women, regardless of how busy they are."
3/22/2022,20220322,5,4.44,My Fiancé & I visited LA just this past weekend and we had a very excellent experience. I had the crispy French toast and my fiancé had the waffles and both were absolutely fresh. We both their breakfast potatoes and they were almost the best side dish on the menu. We both also had the turkey bacon and it was extremely fresh and crispy. The eggs tasted really great scrambled and seem like it was cracked right from a shell. And also the orange juice was freshly squeezed with pulp and it was the greatest orange juice that I've ever had. Not one bad experience for us and the vibes and customer service was excellent! I will recommend this place every time to anyone who is looking to visit!
3/22/2022,20220322,5,4.44,My favorite breakfast spot in LA - I feel like that says a lot given how many freakin options there are in LA. I always order the You Make Me Wake Up Happy. It is THE PERFECT thing if you like a savory breakfast but also crave something a little sweet. Coffee is also great and service is always great.
3/22/2022,20220322,5,4.44,LOVE this place! My boyfriend took me here after we visited The Broad in DTLA for some brunch and it's so good!!! I ordered the waffletella which included strawberries and bananas on the waffle drizzled with Nutella (so YUM). My bf ordered the LOX waffle and he was very happy with his order too! Waffle texture was soft and flavorful and they are generous with their toppings. We also got an order or the waffle fries with Parmesan truffle oil and they were so packed with flavor!! Unfortunately we didn't get our server's name but she had amazing energy and made us feel so welcome. We can't wait to come back here again!!
3/23/2022,20220323,4,4.44,The breakfast here is amazing. Hands down one of these best waffles I've ever eaten. The potatoes were also in a class of their own. The chorizo burrito was very greasy but it still had great flavor.
3/26/2022,20220326,3,4.44,This was my first time visiting. I sat outside and it was a party of 3. The tables outside are very small. The table they used was not made for 3 people. The space was very tight and did not provide enough room to eat comfortably. In addition they did not bring out the French toast I ordered. It's a very busy place so I suggest you come early as parking is limited and it is street parking only. Overall it's an ok place but if you have a large party don't sit outside.
3/28/2022,20220328,1,4.44,This was one of our favorite breakfast places. We were really disappointed with the service and management last weekend. We were told the wait would be up to 45 minutes and after an hour they said it could be another hour. Awful management! total waste of time !!
3/29/2022,20220329,4,4.44,"Fun spot. We got a nice table a little away from the crowds which was cool. We had, among five of us, chicken and waffles (not as spicy as advertised but really tasty!), chilaquiles, which were beloved, a beautiful salad, and good old fashioned diner like coffee. We loved it and the charming server whose name escapes me but she has red hair. We are coming back for brunch ASAP!"
3/30/2022,20220330,3,4.44,"Went here for brunch and tried their salmon eggs benedict. I think it's a decent place for your classic brunch food, but definitely not worth the long wait."
3/31/2022,20220331,4,4.44,It's a nice place i was not impressed with the food per say. Its not bad but also not all that. Don't let the lines discourage you from trying it at least once.
3/31/2022,20220331,1,4.44,"overrated, it's a cute place but the food is 6/10 at best. my food was cold when i got it"
4/1/2022,20220401,5,4.44,"Initially when looking at the menu, my friend and I were so overwhelmed by the endless amount of food options! I ended up getting the matcha waffle and breakfast sandwich to get both my necessary intake of sweetness and protein. I also got the hibiscus mimosa, and my friend got the Wake Up Happy, lemonade hibiscus, matcha latte, and truffle waffle fries with parmesan. Everything was SO GOOD! I was extremely happy with my meal and I was definitely full for the rest of the day.Service was amazing too. The waitlist on Yelp only works when you actually put yourself on the waitlist from the restaurant. There were 10 parties ahead of us but the wait was only about 30 minutes. I am so glad we went here and I can't recommend this place enough for anyone wanting to grab a delicious brunch."
4/1/2022,20220401,4,4.44,"This place is really cute! Came here for a ladies' brunch on a Sunday morning. I parked in the residential area, and we were quoted a 30-minute wait for a table before being seated on the (what looks to have been extended down the sidewalk) patio.Mimosas available were pineapple, peach, jaimaica, orange, and lemonade, so of course, we had to try all of them! The servers were very kind and attentive... they brought us more cotton candy (served on top of the mimosas) a few times because we wanted more or we wanted to take photos of our drinks (we were those bitches). They also brought an extra side table so we would have more space. Mimosa pours were generous, too.... each was barely the color of the juice and mostly transparent! I ordered the white truffle toast and the cauliflower tempura to share. My friends really liked their waffles and wafflebello sandwich. We all loved the cauliflower.... it was perfectly battered to be just crispy enough and not too heavy.If you aren't in a rush and can wait for a table, I'd come back and I'd recommend it! Hip, cute, good food and drinks, but without the slightest amount of attitude that sometimes comes with hip-ness."
4/2/2022,20220402,5,4.44,"Such a yummy breakfast spot. Got the truffle toast and eggs Benedict. Both were great, the truffle toast is super rich but delish if you like truffle. They also made a great iced latte. Cute and trendy spot and the staff are all very sweet. They have a little machine that they bring for you to pay on which is makes everything easier. Def recommend and will be going back!"
4/3/2022,20220403,5,4.44,"MY FAVOWIT BRUNCH SPOT STILL. Starting from their love story of how they met to all the yummy food. I remember when they first opened and now they're doing so well!! Along with their next door ""met him at a bar"" pasta joint. It is a littttle bit pricey, but the food is worth it. Not sure if they have bottomless mimosas now but I did buy mimosas by the pitcher and it was good but a bit pricey as well. Honestly though, give this place a shot. I promise, it's worth it 1000%. Get the ""wake me up happy"" and you can add berries to it too if you'd like!"
4/3/2022,20220403,5,4.44,"A very aesthetic-pleasing brunch spot that I would 1000000%% recommend! If you are looking for a place to have breakfast/lunch spot to catch up with friends or families then definitely come try this place! The wait was totally worth the food! And it is also an awesome photo spot as well! Can't miss on that, am I right!"
4/3/2022,20220403,5,4.44,"Traveled from San Diego to LA for an early morning LAX pick up. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Great food, great service, good price, minimal wait. Took a big to find parking but found free street parking a few blocks away. We will be back."
4/3/2022,20220403,5,4.44,Very chill spot to go have brunch. Food was delicious! Quick and friendly service! Definitely will be going back
4/4/2022,20220404,5,4.44,The food was really good.Decently priced.Wait time wasn't awful considering how packed it was. The staff was quite professional. Remember to bring vaccination card or at least a photo(lesson learned)I got the unforgettable chorizo toast it was very good. I didn't know how to eat it though; hands or fork?
4/7/2022,20220407,5,4.44,"I stumbled across this place years ago and it is one of my favorites. I came in on a saturday around 11, there was no wait which is perfect. We parked on the street there was plenty of parking. The music here is always a vibe. It is on the louder side but still nice. There is indoor and outdoor seating. We sat inside. I decided to try the Matcha waffles, SO GOOD! I had a side of bacon it was too crunchy for me but I took some of my friends turkey bacon which was perfect. We had mimosas pineapple and hibiscus both were very good. The waiter was so nice and pleasant. I'll be back again. If you come on the weekend get on the waitlist."
4/10/2022,20220410,5,4.44,"Went during peak brunch time on Friday. After checking in we were seated less than 15 minutes later. They have both indoor and outdoor seating options. The interior is an absolute vibe, perfect for a quick date. Their waffletella is a must try. Super suprised with how chewy it was on the inside and crispy on the outside. The portabello mushroom waffle sandwhich was also filling and packed with mushroom. For drinks, we enjoyed their house cold brew and their iced vanilla latte. Be prepared to find street/metered parking around the block. They also have a gender neutral restroom."
4/12/2022,20220412,5,4.44,"What an awesome brunch spot! Located on the corner of LaBrea & 8th in the heart of the Mid-Wilshire district, this spot has a great vibe and energy. Indoors is a cool eclectic atmosphere but was a bit loud. Outdoors their restaurant extends down the sidewalk for a nice open-air cafe feel. We came around 2:00 pm on Sunday and our wait time was about 15 mins. They texted me when our table was ready.Their menu is wonderfully innovative which we saw first hand watching the food coming out while we waited. To start, their coffee is a nice roast & was bold - not your typical restaurant coffee. I got the fried chicken & waffles ($21) on the recommendation of our waitress and it was so tasty & delicious and was plenty of food. The waffles here taste like the amazing & delicious food you smell at the county fair (in a good way) and the fried chicken breast is made with a nice tom yum seasoning & comes with a side of chili paste which mixes with flavor of the waffles & the sweet maple syrup and plays off your tongue like a well tuned symphony orchestra of flavor. WELL DONE!My girlfriend ordered the You Make Me Wake Up Happy ($18) which is a waffle, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon & maple butter. This sounds fantastic on the menu (and even as I was writing this out it sounds good), but when it came out it was very underwhelming after seeing so many other innovative dishes so she called an audible, sent it back and opted for the Oh Wow Crispy French Toast ($16.50). That was the right call because this was some of the best French toast I've had in a while. Also, our waitress was great and happy to take it back to get her something she really loved.All-in-all this was a great 5 star experience and we can't wait to come back and try more of these awesome dishes!"
4/12/2022,20220412,4,4.44,I would say to at least go once to get it into your social media apps. The 4 stars has nothing to do with the customer service which was great even for being very packed. The food was a good breakfast just felt like this place was too hyped up for me. I hope to bring down your expectations and maybe you will have better experience than me.
4/13/2022,20220413,5,4.44,Had the Vegan Salted Caramel Waffle and it's the best waffle ever!!! I simply wish I ordered two plates because I didn't want to stop eating it at all! Caramel and toasted coconut were drizzled on top and a cute flower was placed there as well. I love a great presentation of food I also had a side of fresh berries which went perfectly with my food! So happy they had this delicious option for the plant based and vegans!
4/14/2022,20220414,2,4.44,This was probably the worst sandwich I've ever had. The turkey breast was really dry. The bread was stale and tough. I did not enjoy it at all. The customer service was good. I liked the idea of outdoor seating. There was street parking available. I would not return or recommend to anyone.
4/15/2022,20220415,4,4.44,I've gone here for brunch twice and the food is soooooo good. The atmosphere is very fun and they play good music. I've tried a variety of things each time and they all were delicious. For a little fun I would suggest trying the cotton candy on top you mimosa.
4/16/2022,20220416,5,4.44,"Great breakfast spot! loved the vibe, service was excellent and the food was perfect. Their eggs Florentine really hit the spot; as did the chicken and waffles. Best breakfast so far during our 10 day visit."
4/17/2022,20220417,1,4.44,This place is just hype. Only thing good here are the waffles. My gf ordered a waffle and I got the breakfast burrito with potatoes. Breakfast burrito was like 6 inches with basically just egg and onion. Almost no bacon or chorizo. Potatoes are drenched in oil and hard to enjoy. Waiters were helpful until I told them I didn't like the meal and then they were just rude. Will not be coming here again plenty of other brunch spots with better food.
4/17/2022,20220417,5,4.44,"It was delicious! Stumbled upon when we were visiting CA. I think we ordered a waffle, huevos rancheros & a breakfast sandwich with bacon!"
4/17/2022,20220417,1,4.43,"They DO NOT HAVE MIMOSA (Unlimited as advertised) . I found out after going there. I asked why is it still advertised you provide mimosa (unlimited) if you guys know you do not provide brunch as in Mimosa brunch. The waiter said he doesn't know; So people if you looking for brunch, a real brunch this is NOT IT!!! Breakfast/Lunch with champagne , mimosas or other alcoholic beverages EQUALS BRUNCH. Gas is high, let's be transparent and save mileage and money before being mislead. Smh"
4/18/2022,20220418,5,4.43,"This spot is worth coming to. Had no wait time to be seated. The staff are kind, respectful and fast. Food is all the hype. Must try the avocado toast!"
4/19/2022,20220419,5,4.43,"Such kind staff! Loved the service, it's so beautiful and food was amazing- just what I wanted"
4/20/2022,20220420,2,4.43,"Horrible bad attitude not friendly, bad service. Menu is not diverse............ I don't know why o drive to come over here"
4/21/2022,20220421,5,4.43,"This is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places. The wait time is never too long and the staff is always nice. They use fresh ingredients and they are consistently good. I always have a pleasant experience with my sever and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. You can catch the owners in there every now and then and they have so much pride and it shows in the food. The taste, service and experience outweighs the only downside (no parking structure or lot). Highly recommended."
4/24/2022,20220424,5,4.43,"I love brunch. Who doesn't? Unfortunately, this make me quite picky when it comes to waffles. Fortunately, my friends suggested ""met her at a bar"" and I was not disappointed. The indoor restaurant space is rather small, however, they have expanded their seating to include outdoor seating which is next to the road. There can be quite a wait as well! When we were there, they did not take reservations in advance or over the phone, and required us to put our name down in person. We had about a 30-40 minute wait...but it was worth it!The absolute standout was the Oreo waffle. This was a perfect waffle. Perfectly golden brown on the outside, and fluffy on inside. The whipped cream, ice cream and Oreo combo was to die for. This is a must have!The other item we got was the eggs Benedict on a waffle. I'm not much of a sweet and savory person, but it was pretty darn good! Again, waffle was done amazingly well and the eggs and ham were delicious too. I would 100% come back here again. Would love to try all the different waffle flavors!"
4/24/2022,20220424,5,4.43,"A great breakfast spot! Friendly staff, cute interior and delicious food. We came here in a group of 3 on a Tuesday and got seated immediately. I got the Benedict Florentine with a side of potatoes. Everything was delicious and we had such a nice and relaxing start of the day there. I'd definitely go back."
4/25/2022,20220425,3,4.43,"Would be interested in trying this place again but it didn't really live up to expectations. This place has a long line and wait with a waitlist try theoretically managed with Yelp. In practice the waitlist didn't appear to actually be working. I thought the food was good but nothing really stood out as amazing or worth the wait. It may just be that we ordered items that were too basic? Definitely worth another try as the menu certainly seemed interesting. Also, service was pretty good. 3/5 breakfast burrito. Description sounded amazing but in practice the burrito was rather bland and tasteless. Really needed the hot sauce to give it taste. 3/5 Thai omelette. I looove Thai omelette. Didn't really think anything in this dish stood out as Thai other than the inclusion of a bed of rice at the bottom4/5 Nutella waffle. Nutella + waffles. Couldn't turn out poorly it they tried"
4/26/2022,20220426,3,4.43,"Came here for a little catch up with my girlie and decided to get their White Truffle Toast because anything with the word truffle will literally instantly catch my eye. Sadly it was pretty disappointing, if I have to be honest. This seemed like something I could've just made at home, the toast was just topped with scrambled eggs, ham, and truffle infused cheese. There was no sauce to it nor anything that gave it a wow factor. The truffle cheese was definitely good, smelled AMAZING as well but they could honestly made this dish a little more appetizing. As for the restaurant itself is pretty small, not too spacious but definitely cute though. Service was just okay, it was hard to get their attention when we needed things. Also other tables were dropping things and they weren't really attentive to notice to help those table with spilled glass and such. Food for me was just okay, maybe their other dishes are better and I just ordered the wrong thing but probably not a place I would recommend."
4/26/2022,20220426,3,4.43,It's a really tiny restaurant on the corner of the street. We sat inside on a tiny two top table. It does get a little cramped as I saw two separate tables knock things onto the floor so be aware of that. My friend ordered the White Truffle Toast and I got the Chorizo Toast. The White Truffle Toast had a strong truffle scent but I feel like it's a little underwhelming as it didn't really taste as good as it looked. I liked the Chorizo toast. I was just a little confused on how I was supposed to eat it lol. It's pretty difficult to cut with a knife but I felt awkward eating it with my hands.
4/26/2022,20220426,5,4.43,I literally had one of the best brunches ever at met her at a bar. The Thai fried chicken and waffles was TO DIE FOR. The matcha waffles were also super yummy. I also tried the matcha latte which was delicious. Service here was amazing and I am 20/10 coming back.
4/28/2022,20220428,2,4.43,"I regret to leave such a low rating. Here goes the review...A coworker and I ordered lunch for delivery. We work outside and do not have access to utensils. We both opted for utensils in the order option, but none came, for either of us. We also did not receive any napkins. Which would have been very useful as we both ordered eggs benedict (hollandaise can get messy.)I ordered the eggs florentine. While I really liked the hollandaise flavor, it was a bit thick in style, and the consistency was more like warm sour cream. Regardless of texture and consistency, it was very tasty and satisfying. I was slightly annoyed that my poached eggs were overcooked. I loved the generous portion of spinach and I appreciated the bright red color of the tomatoes. They appeared healthy, fresh and ripe! I had fresh fruit as my side. I was happy with the portion, ripeness and sweetness of the cantaloupe and honeydew. I also ordered a side of bacon, for $4 extra, which came in an order of 2 strips. They were tasty and I enjoyed the flavor and texture. My coworker ordered the classic benedict with potatoes. The potatoes looked very appetizing but we were sorely disappointed when we took a bite and they were undercooked and hard. My low review is due to the fact that we paid nearly $50 (before tip) and we received undercooked potatoes, overcooked eggs and no utensils. This is a meal that obviously is well under $10 for food costs, and we couldn't get properly cooked food, or utensils to eat it with, for the final cost due. This restaurant needs to step up consistency and quality control, especially because of their high prices, and be sure their paying customers receive utensils - ridiculous."
4/29/2022,20220429,5,4.43,"Sometimes places have hype around them because they really are just that good.Met Her at a Bar is one of those places. I would wait an hour any day of the week for those waffles. The founding story is also very sweet and special. It was a beautiful night on the Sunset strip when Vincent saw Mindy walk into the bar he was at. He couldn't take his eyes off her as she sat at the bar and he knew he had to talk to her. However, he was nervous and didn't secure her number. Luckily, thanks to social media, Vincent was able to track her down and she still thanks him for it. You can feel the love in the high quality food and drinks they serve. Definitely found my go to brunch spot and can't wait to come back.GET THE WAFFLES. ANY AND/OR ALL OF THEM. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
4/29/2022,20220429,5,4.43,Stopped in at this place during my vacation with my husband and all I have to say it was amazing. The staff was very attentive and although it was busy it never felt like we were forgotten. Definitely recommend eating here. (:
4/29/2022,20220429,4,4.43,"While visiting from Missouri we found a small close by breakfast restaurant. Originally intrigued by the name, my family and I went to check it out. I had waffles and lox, the salmon was perfectly smoked and mixed just right with the waffle and cream cheese. My daughter had the ""wake up happy"" that she demolished and my son had the eggs Benedict and waffles, he said it was ""delicious""! I would definitely recommend the restaurant"
4/30/2022,20220430,5,4.43,The staff are stellar and the food is amazing! Great place to grab brunch but sharing might be the better options if your eyes are bigger than your stomach.
5/4/2022,20220504,5,4.43,"Stopped here a few weeks ago for breakfast and scored a prime people-watching seat outside. the friendly waitstaff said the crispy French toast or the chicken & waffles were the popular dishes ... so I ordered the white truffle toast. The perfectly scrambled eggs with smoked ham, parm & white truffle oil was very heavenly savory. No matter how fantastic is was, I already know what I'm ordering on my next visit."
5/4/2022,20220504,4,4.43,Such a fun vibe here and really solid brunch menu. Their classic eggs Benny was perfect and the spicy chicken and waffles was delicious. Our waiter was attentive and comped my mimosa just because he needed to ask me to stand up so he could get something from inside the bench I was seated on. Lots of parking available on the street.
5/4/2022,20220504,1,4.43,I'm probably the easiest person to please and since I've actually worked in the service industry im able to understand certain situations but the whole automatic gratuity for 2 people is dumb and when the food and sides came out in the worst order possible.  You start thinking what am I paying this for aslo. There actually is federal regulations in these stations I just didn't have the time to actually go in dept and find them all but most importantly the food was no higher then 1.5 out of 10. Its Just the hype. One and done forsure.
5/5/2022,20220505,5,4.43,The chicken and waffles were so good and the service was great. And they had the cutest drinks for brunch.
5/5/2022,20220505,5,4.43,This place is super cute and has the yummiest food! I love the sister café as well. Definitely worth checking out. I had a delicious pasta dish and glass of wine at Golden hour and it was hard to beat.
5/7/2022,20220507,5,4.43,My wife and I love this spot for breakfast. I would highly recommend the Thai chicken and waffle dish! It's delicious!
5/10/2022,20220510,4,4.43,Killer chicken and waffles. Hands down would go again but crowds on the weekends of course. There are some nice hipsters and some stuck up hipsters that work there though.
5/11/2022,20220511,5,4.43,Delicious Breakfast!!! Super friendly service and attentive to customers.. I would definitely recommend this spot..
5/12/2022,20220512,5,4.43,"We have seen this place for years but never tried it. Our breakfast yesterday was absolutely delicious. Fresh, clean, flavorful, bountiful, and graciously served. We might recommend weekdays on the early side unless you enjoy waiting!"
5/12/2022,20220512,2,4.43,Food was horrible and service was not that good. I would not recommend this place for breakfast. I had ordered the breakfast burrito and it was plain and bland.
5/12/2022,20220512,5,4.43,Great indoor and outdoor seating! Good food and friendly people. Chicken and waffles are good.
5/15/2022,20220515,5,4.43,"The food is always great! I love coming for the breakfast potatoes and their french toast. It's a cute small place, but the food is AMAZING!"
5/16/2022,20220516,5,4.43,"First timer, came in for a quick bite and got their chicken (spicy chicken breast ) and waffle plate. The chicken was super on point. Just enough spicy on the chicken for it to be favorable and not burn your mouth. There lemonade, is super great as well."
5/16/2022,20220516,1,4.43,"Honestly I heard so many good reviews for this place because of the food. Was excited to go have breakfast. They close at 5. I called and ask if they served breakfast All day. The lady said yes and there is no waiting time and I said ok I'll be there soon. I came 15 min after so the hostess can tell me they are not taking one in anymore because it's slow, so they decided to close early that day. If that was the case they should've informed me before & not do last min decisions to close 1 hour before closing. So unprofessional of the manager to make last calls like that."
5/18/2022,20220518,5,4.43,Best breakfast and mimosas ! Great people watching and celebrity sightings if you are not from LA!
5/23/2022,20220523,5,4.43,"I first heard about this place in a book by a local author, she based the restaurant in her book after this one and I knew I needed to try it. I invited a friend to come here on a Monday we had off work knowing it can be really busy on the weekends. And honestly, it was waffle perfection. I basically had a food-O when eating my waffles they were so perfect. And my latte was delicious as well. My friend got the flinstones waffle and he loved it so much. Everything was designed so pretty I will definitely be coming back here when I am able.It's a small space so plan to come early and wait or come on a off day. There's lots of street parking nearby just be mindful of the street signs. There's outdoor patio seating and a small indoor as well."
5/23/2022,20220523,5,4.43,This was the best breakfast we've ever had. Food was amazing and service was excellent
5/24/2022,20220524,5,4.43,This place is amazing. We had the French toast and Mama's omelette. My girl wanted mimosa's and got hers with cotton candy. The service here is perfection everyone works together. Molly was taking car of us and she is the best
5/25/2022,20220525,5,4.43,"Sheer mother of god, get the fried chicken and matcha waffles. They are heavenly. Wait time kinda sucks due to how popular this place is though, you can wait up to 2 hours to get a table."
5/25/2022,20220525,5,4.43,"Obsessed with this. From the Matcha waffle, to the Wake Up Happy, to the Chorizo Burrito and trust me the list goes on. It's a must eat there for me, I've ordered to go and like anywhere else things tend to get soggy."
5/26/2022,20220526,5,4.43,Great breakfast spot with awesome vegan waffles. Good mimosas as well for anytime during the week. I would recommend to anyone visiting LA to make this one of your breakfast spots.
5/29/2022,20220529,5,4.43,"My girlfriend and I, who I haven't seen in a while decided to catch up over breakfast. We wanted to find a location that was right in between where we live (NoHo, and LA) so, we chose to try out this restaurant. We only waited about 10 mins on a Sunday morning. The staff is very nice and attentive, and the food was delicious. I really love the add on of the cotton candy on my mimosa, it's $2 extra but very cute and fun. I will be back to try their different waffle selections, they all sound so amazing."
5/29/2022,20220529,3,4.43,"Food was good all around, and it was nice there was a vegan waffle. No soy latte available (though I think they had almond milk).For parties of 4 or more they automatically add 20% gratuity, HOWEVER this is not apparent on the screen and then a tip option comes up and asks you to add more tip. Luckily my husband had seen the tiny gratuity added sign on the menu so I had to click ""NO TIP"" in order to tip 20%. I believe the server had no intention of letting me know the tip had already been automatically added had I not asked. Felt a bit like trickery and thievery. I don't like dishonesty."
5/29/2022,20220529,5,4.43,Love this place. I go by myself a lot and just grab a table to eat alone. The servers are great. Food is pricey but I think it's good for every once in a while when you want chicken and waffles. Very unique flavors for their Thai chili sauce and waffles are really fluffy.
5/30/2022,20220530,5,4.43,"Great food ALWAYS! everything I've ever ordered from here, I've loved !! The eggs Benedict, the peaches and cream waffle, and the truffle fries are me fav!"
6/1/2022,20220601,5,4.43,"Met her at a bar has been on my list for a long time. I want sure if it was worth going to just for the cute cotton candy mimosa. It definitely surprised me. I'm not a big chicken and waffles person but their chicken and waffles are amazing. The butter, syrup, and spicy sauce all complement each other super well. It's also not insanely heavy and does not leave you in a food coma after. My boyfriend is vegetarian so he got the portable lo wafflewich without egg, he very much enjoyed it and ended up asking for the spicy sauce from my chicken and waffles meal. The breakfast sandwich looks and smells amazing. If u want to get something safe definitely breakfast sandwich is the way to go. I recommend getting their breakfast potatoes as they are cooked very nicely. Their cotton candy mimosas are so cute and super good. We got the lemonade and hibiscus flavor, both are amazing. The service is wonderful. Our estimated wait time was an hour but we only ended up waiting 20 minutes. Food, service, aesthetic, are all amazing. I would definitely come here again to try more of their food. Overall impressed by met her at a bar."
6/1/2022,20220601,5,4.43,"Delishhhhh! Have to try this and also ""Met Him At A Bar"" right across the street. Such a sweet love story"
6/4/2022,20220604,5,4.43,Still as amazing as last time a full year ago! We had the Nutella waffles which taste as great as they look! Perfect amount of sweetness so it's not overwhelming. My partner had the breakfast burrito which also was amazing!! This time I also had a hibiscus mimosa which was light and fresh! The cappuccino was delicious as well.The automatic gratuity added for 4 people was a bit odd and we would have loved to know about it upfront.
6/5/2022,20220605,5,4.43,"This has been one of my go-to brunch spots in LA since 2019. Even amidst the pandemic, I was happy to see them still thriving, though the restaurant itself was closed for the dine-in experience. I visited again last week and got to enjoy my meal there. I've yet to be disappointed! Great food, great service and friendly atmosphere."
6/6/2022,20220606,5,4.43,"This place packs a punch with their chicken and waffles. It only opens half day, breakfast and brunch but does make a statement with their food. Stopped off for lunch and it did not disappoint. The menu isn't big but the selection of dishes all looked amazing. Had the Thai style chicken and waffles and a side of the truffle waffle fries. And the fried chicken sandwich with truffle fries as well. Everything was amazing. Chicken was flavorful with a chili sauce and syrup on the side. Waffles was also cooked perfectly. Everything was great. Food wise, it did not disappoint. Downfall, it's pretty cramp with the seating as it does get crowded. We were sat along the the wall area which had the long bench. Everyone seated there had to either move their table a bit to exit and enter. Also, trying to get the menu from the QR code was horrible. It wouldn't load, had to ask for the menu instead. Us and the groups to our left and right had the same problem. Beside that, pleased with food and service. All friendly staff."
6/6/2022,20220606,5,4.43,"If I were to sum up Met Her At A Bar, it would be: Small space, delicious brunch. On weekends, you will have a wait as this is a popular spot - which of course is an inconvenience but also a great testament to their food. My favorite item here and something I can't avoid ordering every time is their chicken and waffles. It has a thai spice twist to it, which makes it unique to the million chicken and waffles in this chicken and waffle loving town. Having said that, I've taken several friend groups here who've ordered collectively the entire menu and I haven't heard a complaint yet. Their drinks are delicious as well!If you're looking for a good brunch in this area, be sure to bookmark this one but come prepared to face a bit of a wait."
6/6/2022,20220606,4,4.43,"Cute. Cozy. Fresh food. Friendly service. Parking sucks but it's LA, not a surprise. Stop by if you're in the area."
6/9/2022,20220609,4,4.43,Cute little spot for brunch! Food is also great! The decor is definitely LA vibes. Small and the wait on the weekends is more than usual.
6/13/2022,20220613,5,4.43,"I've been hearing a lot about this place. Apparently there is met her at the bar and a met him at the bar. While taking a break from apartment hunting we stopped here for some brunch. Anytime you see chicken and waffles you have to get it so I did and it was top notch. Crispy on the outside moist on the inside, with a fluffy waffle on the bottom with deep squares to hold your maple syrup. We also got a Thai omelette that is verified authentic--oh I miss Thailand. There's also mimosa with cotton candy on top and other very insta-worthy things you can order. Overall this place lived up to the hype and I'm excited to be living nearby."
6/13/2022,20220613,5,4.43,"Great service; Delicious food , lovely ambiance I'd definitely recommend this place to everyone!!"
6/13/2022,20220613,3,4.43,"The food was good but the prices were not good. Also, I'm sure it's fair to tell customers that fries aren't on the plate. I paid 16 for a small chicken sandwich and 6 for truffle fries. Also, this is good food, but spend my money elsewhere."
6/14/2022,20220614,4,4.43,A great place with a great breakfast/brunch menu! The food is as good as it is aesthetically! I can't wait to go here again soon!
