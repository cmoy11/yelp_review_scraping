3/15/2013,20130315,4,4.5,"UNDERSTANDING HIS ANGERAn old Japanese legend tells of an angry dragon that rose out of the sea. To appease this dragon, the royal court offered a sublime soup noodle that was, until then, enjoyed only by nobility. The dragon was so awed that he took this secret ""udon"" to the people. A hero to all, he peacefully returned to the ocean to take a nap.Three hundred years later (that's 15 dragon-minutes), the dragon awoke and returned to the city of Edo, only to discover the art of udon had been corrupted. Lazy commoners were making these thick wheat noodles with machines. Many businessmen were making large batches cheaply and freezing them. The dragon traveled far and wide but was unable to find his beloved handmade udon. Lacking a human tongue to enunciate his desires, and incapable of making udon with his claws, the dragon exacted his rage upon villages and cities. There are different stories of what became of this creature, but some say he returned to the sea in despair, never to be seen again.However, few knew there was a special child born of this dragon who took the form of a human. Oracles foretell that one day this anointed one will go to the people and show them the greatness of udon. People will once again appreciate simplicity. They'll see that the most beautiful brushstrokes are by hand.Monzo grand opens today in Los Angeles. In the kitchen a man is quietly at work, restoring honor in udon. His arms are muscular from kneading dough. Kake, zaru, kitsune -- any variation you can think of -- no problem. He rolls, folds, and cuts with superhuman deft. Yes, the legend is true...but this man in the kitchen is NOT the son of the dragon. Let it be known that I AM THE SON OF GODZILLA, and with this review, THE PROPHECY BEGINS TO BE FULFILLED TODAY!!! I SPEAKETH......wait, my sweetie's calling me to unclog the toilet...bye."
3/16/2013,20130316,5,4.67,"Monzo is located on the north side of 1st Street by Daikokuya. It's a great addition to Little Tokyo. It serves hand made udon as well as other Japanese food. Pre-Monzo required me to drive to the South Bay for authentic udon.The grand opening was on 3/15/13. Bf and I rolled in here and ordered the scallops carpaccio, cold udon with daikon oroshi and Carbonara udon. The Carbonara udon was rich with layers of flavors. The cold udon with soft boiled egg was ostensibly simple, yet had complex tiers. The servers all spoke Japanese, which is rare these days even in Japanese restaurants run by Japanese owners. I really enjoyed visiting Monzo."
3/18/2013,20130318,4,4.5,"In the former Fat Spoon space, Monzo is staking its claim on a E 1st St space next door to the vaunted Daikokuya ramen shop. Ramen, meet udon.It's a wonderfully renovated space that had me scratching my head trying to remember what used to exist here pre-Monzo. It's hard to pry your eyes away from the guy kneading, rolling, and cutting the freshly made udon noodles that are on display behind giant glass. There are sushi restaurant style seating around the glass walled kitchen to take in the show and small tables along the length of the front of the restaurant.The classic shrimp udon was excellent. Chewy noodles, good broth, perfectly fried tempura. The carbonara udon is a fantastic choice if you like creamy pastas. I could only have so many bites before I was craving my shrimp udon. The clams in garlic butter are addictive - I could have finished an entire bucket full of these with a side of beer. The seafood salad was probably the least exciting item that I tried - I'd recommend hitting a different item on the menu.If the line at Daikokuya has you down, try some udon - Monzo won't let you down."
3/22/2013,20130322,5,4.6,"F#@K a pot of gold, I found a bowl of magic!!!!!yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…ATTENTION EVERYONE: My quest to find fresh, fresh, fresh udon in LA has ended!yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…I am madly in love with this place! I would gladly buy a welcome mat and change my mailing address over to Monzo's. I can eat here EVERYDAY!!!!REASON I WANT TO CALL THIS HOME:yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…1) The food is AMAZING!!!!!!.....Appetizers are a WHOA-HEY-WHAT'S YOUR NAME deliciousness. And the udon, man the udon.....upon first taste I really wanted to jump on my seat and be like Tom Cruise on the Oprah show professing his love for Katie Holmes. The texture on the udon screamed and oozed FRESH.... perfect, perfect, PERFECT chewiness. The broth was bomb too, perky, lively and just enough brininess to it. I literally ladled it, ladle after ladle, ALL down!!! The tempuras were excellent as well, not only was it battered and fried right, the ingredients were extremely fresh too.2) The atmosphere..... very clean, and the dark wood paneling and Japanese business men at every other table gave it a nice level of sophistication. But the killer wow factor was the udon chef making the noodles right in front of my face as I slurped down my udon. The chef even gave each of us sitting at the bar a lil bow before AND after he transformed the dough into strings of magical goodness. 3) Variety. There were plenty ways to have the udon....cold, miso based broth, soy base broth, cream or even curry.4) The waitstaff were extremely friendly and eager to help.5) Very reasonable prices. For this caliber of quality, the price on the menu was dirt cheap! GREAT EXPERIENCE, GREAT FOOD!! I'm coming back, don't try to stop me!!!!"
3/23/2013,20130323,5,4.67,Great Udon and broth. More expensive than next door's Daikokuya ramen...but worth every penny.
3/24/2013,20130324,4,4.57,"I loved the tempura a la carte options that come with an order of udon. The ones that surprised me the most were the egg and the squid. I haven't had egg tempura before and the squid tempura was as big as a box of poker cards! I also liked that the double order of udon was only $2 more so you and a friend can share and still have money and room for dessert. (Points for romance if you're on a date!) Unfortunately, they don't have a dessert menu, and that's what I was in the mood for tonight.My friend ordered the Curry Udon. I would have liked the sauce to be thicker, but it was more soupy than I expected. They put pork belly and sauteed onions with the udon, so the flavors were pretty yummy. It's a little hard to tell from their picture in the menu that it's pork belly.The waiters and waitresses were really nice, polite, and attentive to filling our waters. I also liked the clean bathrooms and the view of the chefs making the udon noodles by hand. It's kind of mesmerizing."
3/25/2013,20130325,5,4.62,"Wow, I think that was the best udon I have ever had- and I grew up eating that stuff! My dad and I were looking for a fun place to eat in J-Town and I suggested we pop into Monzo, since it was new and had been reviewed well so far. After a quick look at the menu, we were seated at a table by the door. Next time, I want a table in front of the noodle window: you can watch the chef making all the beautiful udon noodles by hand!Anyway, the servers here are eager to please and answer any questions, although one guy tended to hover a bit. I decided on the Duck Nanban Udon, with the added sides of the Jidori Soft-boiled Egg and a Baby Octopus, both tempura battered and fried (I didn't expect that with the egg). My dad ordered the Kakiage Don, which is a bowl of rice topped with one of those tempura ""nests"" of fried shrimp, grated carrot, onions, and other veg. We also shared 3 skewers: Shrimp, Scallop, and Shiitake. The skewers came out first and I was a little sad to find that they only had one shrimp and one scallop on the skewers, and two pieces of the shiitake. That explained the low price though. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, the scallop was a good size and tender, and the shrooms were tasty as well. They gave us a little condiment dish for our skewers with some curry salt powder and the tiniest dab of tonkatsu sauce. More sauce next time, please!Then my noodles arrived, in a ginormous bowl on top of a wooden platter. They also gave me a small dish of grated fresh ginger and a shaker of Japanese white pepper and our server suggested I swirl both into the broth. I like the large wooden ladle, for happy slurpy time. The duck pieces in my soup were quite good, with light grill marks. Definitely not complaining, but I like my duck a little closer to medium Maybe next time I can ask for the meat on the side and I can drop it in and control the doneness? But the star of the dish was obviously the udon noodles themselves. They were so tender and fresh tasting, I was in heaven. The broth was really delicious too. I added the ginger and the pepper, but nothing else, since the salt level was perfect. I happily dunked my egg in the broth as well. The icing on the cake was that adorable baby octopus- it was the best I have ever had! It was perfectly cooked, without any unpleasant rubbery texture. Amazing.Our whole meal came out to $29.10 after tax, which seemed quite reasonable, especially for the quality and the attentive service. I am looking forward to returning to try more of their unusual and creative noodle creations soon!"
3/25/2013,20130325,4,4.56,"The style reminds me the Udon from Kagawa Prefecture in Japan. They make the noodle at restaurant, not buy in, handmade noodle, means fresh!! perfect thickness and hardness.I really enjoyed Bukkake Udon, which is one of the standard style, nothing fancy, simple and minimum ingredients, no soup. It was really good. I glow up eating that way so I was happy to find this place.My friend had one of the fusion style ""Mentai Squid butter Udon"". Udont is like a pasta, noodle itself does not have strong flavor so it has potential to go well with any kind of sauce or soup. But to be honest it was okay, I think the butter and cheese(?? Not sure) was too strong killing the flavor of Mentai and noodle. I know Mentai and udon really goes well so I wish if they could put less butter... But that's me, you may enjoy it.Among all the Japanese noodles, Udon noodles is my favorite, I glow up eating it all the time and I think this place is one of the best Udon in LA."
3/27/2013,20130327,4,4.5,"I've never really been to a restaurant that was all about the Udon until Monzo, but I'm definitely glad I tried it. FOODThe noodles are made right in front of you where everyone can watch. They all seem so pro at what they do and everything is seemingly an intricate and well thought out process.The Duck Nanban Udon was good, but I wasn't blown away by it or anything. It did have that warmth and ""chicken soup for the soul"" feeling to me and I'd like to order it if I was sick or it was snowing outside. But in Los Angeles, I wouldn't hold my breath for that snow. What I ordered was: Cold Udon + Kakiage + Shiso + Baby Octopus + Shrimp Tempura. I prefer cold over the hot especially with the summer quickly approaching. The Kakiage here is pretty good, and I was so tempted to order another. I heard the Baby Octopus was really good too. I just love that I'm able to order something and customize it in my own way because I feel like I have very very specific taste.SERVICEThe waitresses here are sooo nice and in their own way, kinda funny too. They're fobby Japanese women and that just makes this Udon joint even more authentic. They're pretty helpful too in case you're a newbie when it comes to ordering. ATMOSPHEREI love it. It's clean. It's modern looking. It's tasteful. You can watch the dudes make your noodles from scratch. There's like even a bar for you to sit at to watch it up close. I love when noodle shops have bar seating or counter seating, however you wanna call it. Simply put, the place looks legit.As much as I like Monzo, I can't give it a 5 stars just because I'm still in love with the Udon from Fukada more. Fukada is also cheaper too, which is saying a lot for being in Irvine. I'll probably eventually come back to give it another try and possibly fall in love with it and update my review. I definitely wanna try the Uni Creamy Udon and the Flaming Konnyaku (though I didn't see it on the menu). P.S. Lunch Special is basically $3 instead of the regular price for the Donburi options. P.P.S. They don't validate parking at all at any structure. They're still new, so it's forgivable. I had to pay $7 for parking for like an hour or so. Fuck. That."

3/28/2013,20130328,5,4.5,"I went for lunch on Tuesday- I got the shrimp tempura udon and my friend got the duck nanban udon. First off, I never knew udon could taste ""fresh"". I love clean tasting food, and even though there were fried bits of tempura in my broth (which could make it oily), the whole thing tasted light. We sat at the bar and watched as he pounded and rolled out the dough, twirled it around a wooden stick and out again, then rinse and repeat 5 more times. Maybe it was simply novelty, but watching the process of hand-cut noodles and how it gets to my bowl seemed to really elevate my noodling. We also got the pork belly don, listed at $5.45 on their menu but discounted to $3 for lunch. !!!!!!!! I love a good deal... the don was lightly seasoned with a predominant salt taste. It wasn't what I was expecting (thought it was going to be saucy) but in retrospect I like the simplicity better for lunch (and then back to work!)On a side note, there was an option to get double portion of noodles by adding $2. I highly recommend this for a large eater. The only reason I felt fully satisfied was because we had ordered the pork belly don.I'm going back today (Thursday) with some coworkers. And I'll probably come back on saturday for lunch with some friends. I highly recommend people go before this gem gets too crowded and the long wait starts counteracting the deliciousness."
3/28/2013,20130328,3,4.38,5 star for service and cleanness. Since it's a udon place so my choices are limited. Nonetheless I was able to order delicious inferno konnyaku as appetizer which I \ended up keep ordering (the portion is so small). I actually like their one and only wine (taste like chardonnay) thank you for taking care of non sake drinkers...

3/29/2013,20130329,4,4.4,"The udon is freshly handmade. It is of a slightly thinner variation. The soup base is excellent with the right amount of sweetness. The tempura was pretty decently fried and not too greasy, and the soft-boiled egg was just perfect. Oh, and you get to eat all that with a wooden ladle!Also served at Monzo are cold udon, fusion-style udon (eg. udon carbonara, sea urchin cream udon, udon gratin, etc.), donburi, and various trendy appetizers. Will definitely try the other dishes next time I go.This place has a great ambiance, great for get-togethers."

3/30/2013,20130330,4,4.35,"My friend and I came here on a Friday night for dinner. We ordered the scallop carpaccio, jidori fried soft boiled egg, baby octopus, tomato seafood udon, and the miso carbonara udon. The scallop carpaccio was very good - medium slices of sweet scallop on a bed of tomato topped with a wasabi?? cream sauce and fish roe. The sauce had a nice kick and the fish roe gave the perfect balance of saltiness to enhance the sweetness of the scallops.My friend had the jidori egg and baby octopus. The egg had a nice thin layer of tempura batter and a perfectly runny center. The baby octopus was so good that she wanted to immediately order a second skewer.The tomato seafood udon had a well balanced tomato cream sauce. My miso carbonara udon smelled a bit weird upon arrival, I don't know if it was the cheese but the flavor was good. It was a bit too creamy for my liking. The sauce coagulates and gets a thick once the dish cools down but I'm glad I tried it. The udon itself is pretty great. It has a lovely bouncy chewiness mouthfeel that was simply delightful. The udon is freshly prepared in small batches throughout the day so you don't have to worry about eating old noodles or that they will run out. As this is a new restaurant, I think the staff is still trying to figure out how to run the place especially during the weekend dinner time rush. There isn't a hostess to play list nazi which led to my name getting skipped over three times on the sign in sheet. Also be prepared to wait a little for drink refills and to get your check. They're also implementing a new system where your orders are entered through an iPad and some of the servers are still learning where the food items are located in the app. Be patient, the servers are all very nice once you get their attention.I will be back for more delicious bouncy udon!!"
3/31/2013,20130331,5,4.39,"Great! Awesome! best udon place ever! I got beef tataki, cream cheese tofu, uni cream udon, and miso carbonara.beef tataki was good with very attractive look.and the two udons were so good that me and my friend were so amazed by it.there was a guy who was making the noodles right in front of us, so it was a good entertainment for us too.Made friend with the people next to me, talking about how each food is so tasty."

4/1/2013,20130401,4,4.45,"I haven't had udon this good in a long time. Monzo has a relatively large and diverse selections of udon that really play up the taste buds. in addition to the more traditional, oriental-tasting udon, they also have interesting fusion options like carbonara and udon gratin.many reviews have commented on the wait already, which is not unusual in this district. just be prepared to wait a while even when there are empty seats. i guess they are just pacing the customers to maximize their service. one can get a bit impatient but trust me, DON'T LEAVE, the food is worth the wait. we ordered udon with creamy uni, curry udon, and udon carbonara, and shared a plate of garlic clams. the clams were cooked in a garlic buttered sauce to perfection. we had to resist using the clam shells to scoop up the rest of the sauce, and disappointed not having bread around to dip into. all the udon dishes were above average. the texture and the consistency of the noodles were more than satisfactory. you can really taste the amount of work that went into making the noodles. we did not sit close enough to see the noodle making in action, but we definitely enjoyed the fruit of their labor. the soup base were all on the heavier, creamier side. so even though the portion is not enormous, you'll still feel a tiny bit guilty for finishing the whole bowl. recommendations:1. try sharing a creamier udon and a lighter udon dish with a friend for variety and health reason2. don't mind the wait, bring a book3. try the garlic clams"

4/3/2013,20130403,5,4.46,"Hands down the best udon I've ever had the pleasure of eating. A nice aspect about the restaurant is the open kitchen, which allows you to watch your udon noodles being hand made for your viewing pleasure. Pricing is pretty reasonable (a little bit on the high side for the meat dishes). Non-meat options can be had for less than $10 dollars. Came in for the lunch special (basically noodle dishes are the normal price, but the rice bowls are only $3 - except for the tempura which is $4). I had the kake udon which came with the hot broth. The noodles were superb, and the broth was also very flavorful without being too salty. I opted for the pork belly rice bowl, which was also very tasty. You can also have the option of doubling the portion size of your noodles for $2 (a great deal if you are really hunger). Overall, a nice new addition to the Little Tokyo dining scene."

4/3/2013,20130403,4,4.46,"This is my new most favorite place for Udon! Freshly made noodles and a good selection of sides for a tiny price that you can add to your udon order. I had the duck udon with pumpkin tempura and it did not disappoint. Also love that If you sit at the counter you can watch the chef make the noodles as you eat. Only down side to our visit was the service. Waitress was friendly, but forgot our utensils and napkins and it was nearly impossible to flag a waitress down as they walked by, we had to steal a napkin from the just emptied table next to ours. If the service had been better I would have given them a perfect score, but the food is so delicious that we will definitely be eating here again soon."
4/4/2013,20130404,5,4.48,"I've been always wondering why there was no delicious udon place in Little Tokyo. There's plenty of ramen shops, but not a udon specialty shop. And since I tasted the amazing udon at Marukame in Hawaii, I was having udon withdrawal!! But finally, my wish and craving has been granted! Monzo is located right next to daikokuya. I can see the two going head to head in a competition to see who has the longer wait for delicious noodles! The shop may be slightly bigger than daikokuya, but not much more. So definitely expect a wait as more people find out about this hole-in-the-wall. The udon noodles here are made perfectly. It has the perfect balance between chewiness and softness, which is pretty difficult to master. They have the traditional soup and the more modern fusion ones. I tried the Wakame Seaweed Udon and the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. Both were amazingly delicious! I even got a tempura soft boiled egg, which was made perfectly! The size of the order were pretty big. I would share the udon and order other appetizers, especially if you order a creamy udon. Just remember that those thick round udon noodles are made from flour, so it gets pretty filling. I also tried the scallop carpaccio which was light and refreshing. The pork belly don was only ok in comparison to the rest of the meal. Thinly sliced stir-fry style pork belly on top of a bed of rice. Service: Attentive even though the place was packed. Parking: Little Tokyo street metered parking or the surrounding parking structures."
4/7/2013,20130407,4,4.46,"The newest noodle shop to give their try their hand at the DTLA noodle game is Marugame Monzo. It's located on 1st Street right smack next to Daikokuya. Their specialty is their udon, which they serve fusion or traditional style. If you like watching the udon-making action, there is limited seating in the front. I'd suggest getting there before opening time to ensure you get a seat if you like dinner and a show. They also allow reservations, which I disliked. For me, noodle shops should be a in and out, no-frills experience. Holding seats for others just complicates things. In addition to the see-through glass with the Udon Master, which I think is one part authentic and two parts borderline gimmicky, there is also an open kitchen. I ordered the duck nanban udon, a hot soup udon with slices of duck meat and the uni sea urchin cream udon. The duck udon was average. It was the noodles that really stood out with their chewiness and freshness. Although I love uni, the cream sauce was too thick and heavy for me. If eating too much pesto sauce makes you sick, then the uni may not be for you. Make no mistake though, their udon is good. It's also great to not have to dry to Torrance for good udon. Also, it's $2 for an extra helping of noodles. I also ordered the jidori tempura soft-boiled egg. The runny egg was delicious, but I felt that the tempura skin actually took away from the flavor of the egg. Monzo is open for lunch from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and for dinner from 5 to 10 p.m.. It's closed on Mondays."
4/7/2013,20130407,5,4.48,"Ramen or udon, ramen or udon. The decision was difficult. Try the newbie in town. The wait was short. Thank goodness as I dragged my Mom here as I normally do. The decor is nice and simple, so zen. There is a glass enclosure toward the back of the restaurant where you can watch the magic happen yelp.com/biz_photos/maru… . yelp.com/biz_photos/maru… Now, this is what i'm talkin' about! After much deliberation, I ordered the Uni Creamy pasta. Unfortunately, to my dismay they do not serve this dish for lunch. I then opted for the mentai squid butter yelp.com/biz_photos/maru… , hubby ordered the champon with a shrimp tempura yelp.com/biz_photos/maru… . Mom ordered the kitsune udon. No pic, she was too hungry and couldn't wait for me to take the pic. The handmade udon was cooked to a perfect al dente. The squid butter sauce was perfect with chunks of squid and the mentai, oh so perfect mentaiko en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me… . Hubby's champon was full of scallops and veggies on top of again, perfectly cooked udon. The broth was creamy and flavorful. The shrimp tempura was cooked close to Otomisan's tempura. A very close second. Mom's kitsune broth was so oh my gosh like what I remembered in Osaka. The noodles again, perfectly cooked and the shiso yelp.com/biz_photos/maru… was perfectly cooked. Once again, the tempura was close to Otomisan. I am a self proclaimed ramen master, however, in my prior life I was a udon master and take it from me, this place next to Daikokuya will help revive Little Tokyo. Ambiance - clean simple lines with an open (behind glass) udon making area - 5 StarsDishes - 5 Stars! With Mom, hubby and I just loving our dishes, how can I rate it any lower? Service - 5 Stars! With waitresses who speak and understand Japanese and English, I feel like I am at home. This place is worth the trip no matter where you live if you LOVE noodles, especially udon. Can't wait to come back and try the uni for dinner."
4/7/2013,20130407,5,4.5,"Best udon place I've had!Cold noodles are amazing. The carbonara pasta is seriously yummy with bacon bits. The wait could potentially ruin the experience, so make a reservation!!"
4/8/2013,20130408,3,4.45,"I can't say I'm an udon snob, so take my review with a grain of salt. I came here last week around 6 p.m. and my party of two was almost instantly seated at the udon bar - if you have two people or are dining solo, I'd recommend sitting here because you can actually see and hear the chef making the udon while you eat.I ordered the mentai butter udon and added a tempura soft boiled egg just to try it out. My portion was a little small. I get that mentai (cod roe) is probably pretty expensive, but I was expecting at least a little more noodle. My friend who ordered the curry udon, for whatever reason, seemed to get a bigger portion than me. Other than that, the flavor was good: a little creamy with pieces of cod mixed in. The noodles are pretty good, but again I'm not an udon expert.It might have been because I waited to start eating my soft boiled tempura egg, but the outside was no longer crispy, even though the inside was definitely soft boiled and done very well. Still, it was a little disappointing.I'm a fan of the half open kitchen design, too.Service: Our waiters were very friendly, and one demonstrated friendly patience as he answered all my questions about the menu - a lot of stuff I hadn't seen or heard before, and I didn't want to look everything up on my phone. For what it's worth, I think everyone was speaking Japanese too.Bottom line: At this price point, I'd probably opt just to get a bowl of ramen somewhere else in Little Tokyo, but if you do have a specific udon craving, I don't think Marugame Monzo is a bad choice."
4/9/2013,20130409,3,4.41,"-Lunch Review-I really wanted to fall in love with this place, but sadly I walked out disappointed. I came for lunch, which turns out to have the same pricing as dinner with the exception of discounted rice bowls. The bowls are discounted to $3 (Beef, Kakiage, Pork Belly Don) and $4 (Shrimp Tempura Don). My order:Miso Carbonara Udon - $12.50Too Rich, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack after a couple of bites! I've read over and over the other reviews about this dish being too rich, but I was being stubborn. I am a fan of Carbonara, but this dish made me feel like I was getting injected with butter into my veins! Yikes!!! I would NOT recommend this dish for your sole entree, but as one to share with a party of 4.Chicken Tempura Udon - $8.95It's just a regular Udon noodle soup with Chicken Tempura on the side. Hmm? I wasn't wowed, the bowl was as simple as it gets. Plus, there were only two pieces of chicken for this entree. The Udon noodle itself was superb, so I am willing to come back to try their other entrees. As for the ones that I have tried, PASS! For those who has no idea what an Udon dish is, here's the general description: Udon is usually served hot as noodle soup in its simplest form in a mildly flavored broth....think soy sauce! They also have cold ones available, which is great on a hot summer day. Monzo's Udon noodles are made at location guaranteeing the freshest noodles available and I agree with everyone on this point. As I was leaving, I saw a lot of orders for Beef Udon that actually looked pretty good. The chef makes it with the regular Udon noodle soup with the addition of the marinated beef inside. I foresee this being my next order! So who wants to try some more noodles???"
4/10/2013,20130410,5,4.42,"Sit at the bar in front of the theater of the Udon and enjoy the show. Intricate dance of flour and dough, all leading to the climax of the all mighty Udon slicer. Noodle texture was out of this world. 1st time: Had the straight up Udon, pretty much J'ed in my Ps. Udon brought back memories of the Usui's of old.2nd time: Udon Japanese Pasta. The pasta udon took me to another planet, 10/10 would bang again."
4/10/2013,20130410,4,4.41,"Went at lunchtime pretty late almost closing time. Good thing it wasn't too busy, or I was rushed to order, while waiting for my friend to arrive. The staff is really friendly, but I did not get to watch them make the udon, maybe next time. It's a very small place. We ordered: Miso Carbonara Udon: First taste, very good and creamy. The flavors were really good, but if you add bacon to anything it tastes good. By the end of the the dish, way too creamy and rich. I couldn't finish! This a a udon that should be shared, only one or two bits is needed. Cold Udon with Egg: This dish was really delicious and refreshing. The sauce was on the side, so you can add as much as you want or as little as you want. These udon were definitely more ""chewy"" (Im not sure that's the correct word for it, but it was chewy in a good way) The price is a bit steep, but I'm willing to go back an try one of their hot udons."
4/12/2013,20130412,2,4.34,"Dude, what a freaking let down. Monzo is adjacent to Daikokuya and this is the first noodle restaurant I've seen in Little Tokyo that has a line longer than Daikokuya.But wait! The line is not long because more people are eating at Monzo but it's because the wait staff is completely utterly incompetent. I get that the restaurant is small but it's really not that hard to clear tables, set tables, and bring out bowls of noodles. But apparently it was too challenging for the 3 who were working the night that we went. During our one hour wait, there was always at least 2 tables that were empty but either 1) not clean or 2) not yet seated.  It took up to 20 minutes after parties left before the wait staff got around to cleaning the tables and then several more minutes before they went outside to call names. When we left (at 9:45pm), there were at least 15 seats open and still a huge line, which was totally ridiculous.Ok, enough complaining about the wait. When we were finally seated at the bar, we were able to see the noodle master in action. It was the coolest part of the experience. Udon has always been my favorite type of Japanese noodle and I was so excited when I first heard about Monzo because come on, enough ramen already, LA. And my first handmade udon experience was subpar not because the noodles were not good but because the broth was flavorless and the duck in my soup was also very bland. The bf's mentai squid butter udon wasn't much better. And the braised pork belly bowl that we ordered to supplement the meal (since the portions are tiny) was the worst pork/rice bowl I've ever had. It just tasted like fat and salt over rice. I was super disappointed but perhaps now is the start a new udon trend so I hope I will have more choices soon."
4/13/2013,20130413,5,4.36,"So we were in LA waiting for a table at Daikokuya and couldn't help but notice that there was a line waiting to get into the restaurant next door. Being the curious peep that I am I googled Marugame Monzo. Bam - what comes up...fresh handmade udon!Next night here we were in line again, on the same street, same time, just different restaurant. We waited an hour for this meal and was it worth it? Hell yes! I love udon and we ordered the more unusual signature dishes that other yelpers seem to be raving about....the miso carbonara and the sea urchin udon. Both were rich but extremely flavorful. The udon had a nice smooth and chewy texture. For the miso carbonara - it was extremely rich.  Didn't taste too much of the miso but it was still delicious either way. After all, it's all about the noodles right?I admit I am not a big fan of uni so when I put in my order I had my reservations. Believe me, this dish was good.  They were extremely generous with the amount of sea urchin in the dish. The unique taste of uni was toned down with the cream sauce and it was a nice merry of flavors. Maybe my experience was heightened knowing that less than 10 feet away there was an expert noodle maker stretching and cutting my noodles.We also had the tempura appetizer. It was good but a little pricey considering it was about $7 for 5 pieces. There was only one shrimp but it was a quality one I must say.  Had to keep reminding myself that the $7 I was plunking down was for quality not quantity. Was the tempura memorable? Nope. Would I order it again? Nope.Would I wait in line for Monzo again? Absolutely... only this time I think I am going to try the more traditional udon in soup."
4/13/2013,20130413,4,4.35,"Great option for those that want some Japanese Udon. I've been going here ever since it opened and every time the food was excellent. From their signature Udons to their appetizers, everything is awesome and worth a try. However, their service still needs a bit of work. They are friendly but extremely inefficient at clearing tables and getting people seated."
4/14/2013,20130414,5,4.37,"After a long absence, I had no choice but to come back to Yelp. Reason being? Marugame Monzo's specialty udon. I'm sure their regular Japanese Udon is just as good as these dishes since their udon noodles are handmade in-house. We came here on a Sunday evening so there was no wait at all which is a plus--although their phone doesn't seem to be working as I had attempted to call in ahead of time to make sure they were open. (My extreme curiosity for their Uni Udon compelled me to drive there blindly even though my phone call didn't go through)After looking at their menu, it was an easy choice on what we wanted to try. We got the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, Sea Urchin Cream Udon, Udon Gratin, and a few of the Tempura Soft Boiled Eggs. First of all, if you love any creamy style pasta dishes, you will fall in love with this place. The Mentai Squid Butter Udon was not only packing with flavor, but they add a lot of fish eggs as well. These tiny little eggs from the sea gods added so much texture to the dish. The Udon Gratin is just as you would expect a dish like this, full of creamy cheesiness. Definite must try for someone that is not a fan of seafood because they add chicken. My favorite of the night has got to be the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. Not only do I consider myself a noodle whore, but I am a dirty slut when it comes to Uni. Those two elements combined with the flavor of their sauce was just to die for. Plus they dont go stingy on the Uni, there was PLENTY. As for the Tempura Soft Boiled Eggs, these could have been a lot better if the egg wasn't overcooked. The tempura did add a lot to the egg though, giving it a nice crisp when you bite into it. My friends and I hadn't even finished our meal yet and we were already discussing about when we wanted to come back again. Restaurants that create these original dishes like Marugame Monzo are one of the main reasons why I wanted to move to LA in the first place. Of course everyone has the right to their own opinion. However if you disagree, you are considered a terrorist."
4/14/2013,20130414,3,4.33,"I had the Kake Udon Noodle and ordered a bunch of tempera sides (Soft boiled egg, lotus root, baby octopus, shrimp tempera, kakiage).The Good- Delicious bouncy noodles. They make their own noodles and they are just the right thickness. It is not has large as the udon noodles at the market.- The Kakiage was delicious! There was onions, sweet potatoes, shrimp, and scallop! What a great variety all lightly fried together.- Shrimp tempera was batter was also very lightly fried :)- Baby Octopus Tempera was chewy not rubbery.- Great service.The Bad- I was really thirsty after my meal. How much MSG did they use? Yuck.- There is nothing too special about the udon broth. At least the crushed ginger they give you brightens up the broth.- Since this place opened a month ago, you will have to wait if you come during peak eating hours.The VerdictI would come again to try their Sea Urchin Uni Udon. I won't come back for the udon soup. I wish I could give this place more stars but I dislike MSG in my food."
4/14/2013,20130414,3,4.3,"I miss Fat Spoon.I was excited to find a restaurant dedicated to making udon, since all the other noodle shops around Little Tokyo serves ramen. I came for dinner on a Friday night and waited almost 40 minutes to be seated. Wow, the wait was as bad as Daikokuya's. I tried the kitsune udon. The broth and noodles were really plain. It tasted a little bland. I recently also tried Tsurumaru near by, and I think their udon and broth was a little more flavorful. But Monzo has more variety on the menu and better toppings."
4/14/2013,20130414,4,4.29,"4 stars because I'm being conservative. I've never tried udon before, so I have nothing to compare it to. And I probably ordered the wrong dishes to fully appreciate the udon noodles. But nevertheless, my tummy was happy by the end of the night because the food that came out was great. Made reservations a week ahead for the bar. Sat 10 minutes as we got there during peak hour (7pm thurs)I know, I know the udon is the star but i'll easily and strictly come back just for their appetizers!- Crispy Pork Skin - Definitely a must have! Chicharron serve in a tasty sauce. It's savory, salty and sweet.. - Konyaku - Has a starchy texture, blended in spices. - Braised Pork Belly - HOLY BELLY! this is probably what I've love the most here, the pork belly was tender and juicy. It was served like a soup that complimented the belly so well. Again! a definite must have!- Assorted Tempura - Not a lot for the price, but fresh and hot when it came to us.Entrees - We were actually all new to this type of food. SO it took a while to know what to get, there were no descriptions on the menu as well. We just based it on previous yelp reviews and the names of the dishes.Curry Udon - Really really good! It was light and not as rich as any of the cream based soups. Curry was not too bold but just right. Sea Urchin Cream - Creamy and Heavy but very good. For the price! it is totally worth it because there is so much Uni in that dish !!Mentai Squid Butter - Light and refreshing. Topped with seaweed that went well with the udon noodles. For all that we ordered, I think the prices were reasonable because their proportions were huge. You can share a bowl of Udon with another person. Service is fantastic and anyone who is impatient should try and work in a restaurant. There's only 3 servers who are also bussers. And that's hard to keep everyone happy. They all seem like they were giving a 100% effort of pleasing and accommodating everyone. Food comes out fresh, hot and fast as well. Well recommended! but with reservations of course."
4/15/2013,20130415,3,4.26,"I enjoyed my mentai squid butter udon and my friend's curry udon (but mine was better). I'd love to come back and get a regular soup udon to try. The noodles themselves were definitely good and you can tell they were just made. The side dishes were more of a let down. Tempura wasn't great, wish the batter was a little lighter but I did like the pumpkin. Shiso tempura is a waste of time. Red ginger was intriguing. We tried the diced konnyaku and wasn't a huge fan. My friend said it tasted like buffalo wings which is sort of true. For a friday night with two people, the wait was maybe 30-45 minutes."
4/17/2013,20130417,5,4.28,"What a wonderful addition to the never boring Jtown! Freshly handmade udon, who wouldn't want that?The restaurant is small and narrow, but it felt cozy and comfortable. Service is excellent! The waitresses are very efficient and attentive. So we had;Appetizers -Beef Tataki ($12.95) - Big portion! I guess it comes with the price. The beef is nicely medium rare. The pickle vegetable on top of the beef is very flavorful (think Japanese chimichurri), but it gets a bit salty after a few bites. Braised Porkbelly ($6.25) - The meat is tender and the sauce is delicious! I'd definitely order this again. I suspect the sauce to be more miso based instead of soy-sauce based like most restaurants. It's quite rich, I loved it!Udon - Mentai butter squid udon ($12.95) - Yum!!!!!!!!!!!! The sauce is delicious!!!!!! You must like the taste of seafood to enjoy this. We are talking strong, deeply flavorful, fishy (in the best way) sauce just completely dressed every inch of the chewy udon. Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($15.95) - This is just brilliant... They are generious with the Uni. Besides the one uncooked uni on top of the udon, you get a bunch cooked ones in the sauce! Uni shrinks and turns brown when its cooked, but still delicious. I slurped the cream sauce with the udon without an inch of guilt, don't waste it people! MUST ORDER.Curry Udon ($8.95) - I didn't have to much expectaion for this particular udon since you can get curry udon at a lof of places, but it turned out very tasty and satisfying! This comes with generious amount of very thin pork belly slices, so if you're not a pork person you might want to ask for subsitition. But I personally think pork works best! I recommend family style when you come, order a few different types of udon and share with your party. That way you get to try a little bit of every flavor. And I find udon to be filling, it doesn't look or feel like a lot but you will get full pretty quickly. Fun place to dine and watch them make udon in front of you!"
4/18/2013,20130418,4,4.27,"I came here on Good Friday which meant no meat for me so my choices were limited. I went with the Mentai Squid Butter Udon which was yummy at first then I started to get sick of it and ended up taking lots of leftovers home. I'm still dying to try the Miso Carbonara which has my name written allllll over it.While the location is fairly new, I wasn't too concerned about wait times. However, it was packed. And I didn't get to choose seats (which wouldve been right smack in front of the udon chefs). Very clean and small restaurant which is dimly lit and pretty intimate with mostly black furniture (all modern fixtures). I was just excited to walk pass the horrid crowds of Daikokuya and walk right on into Marugame Monzo for a nice and quick dinner. Servers are Japanese too which is rare but they're so friendly and welcoming!!"
4/20/2013,20130420,4,4.27,"I'll give you the best dinner tip you'll ever receive - get there before 8pm. I don't know what it is, but at 8pm, that line goes out the door.I came here with some friends on a Saturday night at 6:30pm, and we were immediately seated. I couldn't resist the Mentai Squid Butter Udon ($12.95), so I ordered it and was very pleased. Because the sauce is so rich and creamy, the portions are just the right size. I've never seen a take on udon like at Marugame Monzo, so I enjoyed the food. My dish was more like a thick noodle spaghetti with a seafood sauce. My friends ordered the Wakame Seaweed Udon ($7.95) with extra noodles ($2) and a soft boiled egg ($1.50) and the Chicken Tempura Udon ($8.95) with all the same extras. Not gonna like, the soft boiled egg looked amazing. They all said they were happy with their meals.Of course, the fun part is the show. You can watch the guys in the kitchen make udon noodles from scratch. They roll the dough and cut it behind a giant glass pane. It's like a sushi bar, where you can take a seat, eat, and watch them make magic."
4/20/2013,20130420,5,4.28,"Since my Japanese yelp elite friend sang many praises for Marugame Monzo, I definitely had to go try it for myself. They are already very busy even though they haven't been opened very long. I went on a Sunday night and it was still packed. The restaurant is right next to Daikokuya. They will take a reservation if you have at least 7 people.The place is set up so that you can watch them make fresh udon by hand. It's entertaining and quite impressive. The chef was cutting up udon with this giant cutter lightning fast and all the noodles came out even.It's nice to finally have a place that specializes in udon. After all, there are so many darn places doing the ramen thing these days. I'm normally not a big fan of udon because most places are not good at making the broth. I can confidently say that this is one of the best udon I have ever had. The noodle has the perfect texture and the broth has a deep delicious flavor.I chose the kake udon, which is basically plain udon with broth. It's the purest form you can get. I added jidori egg. It's lightly breaded tempura-style and fried. The yolk is still perfectly runny inside. I really enjoyed it. The best addition though is the kakiage. Kakiage is a big round fried tempura with tons of stuff inside. Mine has different kinds of vegetables and squid. It is super delicious with my udon but I see other people ordered it just on rice.They have very unique udon dishes where they basically use udon noodle like pasta. The most popular looks to be Mentai Squid Butter. It's a butter sauce with mentai (cod roe) and pieces of squid. I didn't get to try it this time around and I'm a huge fan of mentai so I will come back and try this dish."
4/20/2013,20130420,5,4.3,"Excellent food all around. Had the kitsune udon, beef tataki, lychee ice cream. Everything was superb. Need to go back and try more. My only complaint would be the waitstaff's uniforms. This place is new and modern, and all their bowls and dishes were too. They even have iPads to take orders. So why make your waitstaff wear grungy white tshirts? They should wear something more modern."
4/21/2013,20130421,2,4.25,"I don't understand what the hype is about. The service was lousy and noodles overly rich and creamy.(1) We waited for 1.5 hours on a Friday night. You sign-up on the pad of paper and you wait, and wait, and wait. Mind you, there were several empty tables. Some need to be cleaned and some are ready to go. The problem was that there's not enough wait-staff/servers to clean and arrange the tables. There were only 2 servers working the floor - on a Friday night! (2) We had a party of 6 and we watched like a hawk to make sure our table was prepared. Suddenly, the party next to us (6 ladies seated on a table fit for 4) grabbed our 2 chairs before we could sit. I asked the server to do something about it and she said ""ok I'll talk to the customer"", but no, instead she walked back to the kitchen and served food to other waiting customers.(3) Our party of 6 finally got seated on a table for 4. At this point, I was fuming but did not want to confront the lady next to me about stealing our two chairs. That would have ruined everyone's evening. Instead I patiently sat and kept my mouth shut with a fake smile. Halfway through dinner, the table next to us became available and we politely asked the server if we could moved that table and chair next to us, so that all 6 of us can comfortably eat. Finally!! Besides the service woes, the noodles were good and unique. But there are a half-dozen restaurants in the same block that are equally as good. These family-owned restaurants are small and need our business and support."
4/22/2013,20130422,4,4.24,"A simple udon house but, oh so good. The udon noodles here are the perfect texture, probably owing to the fact that they are handmade (you can watch them if you sit at the bar). The broth, a perfect consistency (not too overpoweringly strong but definitely tasty enough). The menu here is pretty simple, you basically pick your Udon Noodle Soup base (with seaweed, sweet bean curd etc) and decide if you want to add on Tempura pieces on the side. It's about $2 for a shrimp tempura piece and $1.50 for the squid (if I'm not wrong). Not exactly the cheapest add-on, but, pretty worth it I would say - as they were very well fried (not too batter-y!) and complimented the noodles / broth perfectly. Portion wise, I know - the bowls look huge. But, they are not. Perfect portion for me (and it's not like I'm a small eater!), but if you're a really big eater, you might want to double the portion for just $2 more (boys, you know what to do!). They also have Udon Pasta here (I never got why Japanese people loved that but hey, I don't judge. maybe I'll try it one day)On top of that, the service here is excellent and the bathrooms are really, really nice and clean (in my opinion, how you should judge the cleanliness of a restaurant in the first place)."
4/25/2013,20130425,5,4.26,"Marugame got game. Mad udon game.When I got wind about this place, I had to go. One day, my lover & I were on our way back home from a day out. The choices in front of us as we got in the car after I assessed traffic on Google Maps was to either sit in traffic and road rage, or travel the other way where there is no traffic and head straight to (the coincidentally close in proximity to where we were) Marugame.I'll let you guess which option we went with.We arrived to a warm welcome by the staff and luckily beat what I am sure is a normally full house. It's a sweetly small spot, nicely decked out in simple, modern Japanese decor. We immediately got seated at the bar tables, because I like to watch thing get made. They are definitely not faking the funk..the noodles are indeed freshly handmade..with such exquisite precision & ease.We shared a few appetizers..the fried chicken skin (it was like chicharon) & a dip that came out with crackers. Service was extremely gracious.Although the traditional udon items were certainly tempting, I'm the type to be adventurous and I love trying something new. I also love uni. Hence, I ordered the creamy uni udon. Duh.Threw in a side of tempura to gnaw on..the tako + pumpkin, both of which were cooked to perfection.My bowl came out, it was topped with a bathing beauty uni..floating on a leaf in the middle of all the creamy goodness. I had to eat her. To my delight, I found many more of her uni friends, swimming in the noodles. They aren't shy with the uni. It's not just creamy udon with a single uni sliver on top, to which I say domo arigato, mister robato. Worth every penny and I can't wait to go back again & again."
4/25/2013,20130425,5,4.27,"[big-sean-voice]oh god[/big-sean-voice]attentive, courteous and fast service (YES!). can watch them make the udon from scratch if you sit by the bar. the food is frickin' delicious.in addition to everyone else's recommendations for udon (i like the kitsune, personally), try the kakiage. it's like a pakora on steroids."
4/26/2013,20130426,4,4.27,"Experimenting with Paleo for awhile has made me become very particular with what carbs I decide to stuff my face with. Hand pulled udon noodles? SOLD!I came here on a Wednesday night at 8pm. Luckily it wasn't too packed. It's on the same street as Daikokuya, tucked away. I walked right by past it the first time!Me and the boy opted to share two dishes: a traditional Curry Udon and a fusion Miso Carbonara. Oh, and a side of tempura fried soft boiled eggs!The Curry Udon and tempura eggs came out first. The curry had a wonderful flavor to it. It was very rich but wasn't too thick. Perfect for slurping. The udon noodles had a good chew to them. It came with a generous amount of thinly sliced pork belly...nomz! The tempura eggs were perfectly boiled and fried. Yolk oozing everywhere.Our Miso Carbonara came out next. (The reason why our order was staggered is because we had trouble deciding what to order lol.) I never really understood Japanese-Italian fusion dishes, but this one works! It has the familiar richness of carbonara without being too heavy and overpowering (as some carbonaras can be). The miso definitely added another flavor dimension to it. So good, I might have to try making this at home! The sauce had a hint of sweetness to it, which paired well with the smoky bacon pieces. We absolutely enjoyed this dish.Kinda bummed I didn't get to see any fresh udon noodle pulling action going on. Another reason to come back, and check out the rest of the menu. I'm eying that Uni Udon!"
4/27/2013,20130427,4,4.26,"After reading all these five star reviews, I had great expectations eating at Monzo. Unfortunately my experience just didn't meet them. I went during lunch and had the duck udon and carbonara udon. The udon noodles are phenomenal, which helped me round my 3.5 review to a 4. But the dishes as a whole just weren't that memorable. All I remember was the carbonara was really creamy and the duck udon.. well the noodles were perfectly chewy.. and that's about it. I really wanted to try the uni udon but they didn't serve it at lunch so I'll be back at dinner time to try that."
4/28/2013,20130428,4,4.26,"My boyfriend and I had the intention of having dinner at Fat Spoon and when we got there, it turned out that the place is now called Marugame Monzo that specializes in handmade udon. I love noodles and soup, but not a big fan of thick noodles. Somehow my boyfriend convinced me to stay and try out the new place.This place is a bit small but it is really nice inside and clean. If you sit by the bar you can watch the chefs make the udon. Customer service is great with nice and friendly staff. I ordered the miso carbonara and beef tataki. The beef tataki is pink and juicy, marinated very well, and cooked just right. My miso carbonara was delicious! When I think udon, I think of thick noodles in chicken stock. I was taken by surprise when I saw my miso carbonara. It was like pasta and the cream was not too thick or watery. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back!"

4/29/2013,20130429,5,4.27,"I'm no ordinary person when it comes to Udon. As matter of a fact I have just came back from Japan, Takamatsu (Udon town with more than 200 udon shop in one tiny area).I can tell you that, most Udon shop in the Udon town taste out of the world and the noodle itself has such a good texture that you can chew chew chew to get the deeper texture, flavor and taste. Marugame Monzo is probably the only other Udon that I have had outside of Takamatsu or most famous Udon shops in Tokyo, that has this spirit of soul going with the noodle.The noodles are unevenly cut, which makes each strand unique and have their own character when you chew them. It is sooo chewy, flavorful that I rather be chewing on this noodle than the most delicious Mochi.This is perfect example of a well made, soulful udon noodle. The noodles are alive and they will dance inside your mouth. You just have to enjoy them and try to understand what the noodle is trying to speak to you. Better the ingredient, it is best to try them raw as possible. Hence I recommend anyone that is reading this review to try the Udon, ""Zaru Udon style"" which means dipping the cold noodles in the plain sauce. This helps the noodle to not overcook in its hot soup because if you get the perfectly made udon noodle in hot soup, you must eat it or finish the bowl in 5 mins or it will lose its elasticity or its chewyness.I can proudly say this place is it. The best UDON you can have outside of Japan INDEED!"

Front row viewing of the master working his udon skills!

I wanted to lick my bowl!!! We asked to order one more to go, first time ever getting rejected. I think it's because if you take it to go, it kills the integrity of the dish... the udon won't be as fresh - i get it i get itI want to go back!!!!

Long strands of the thick noodle held their characteristic, addicting chew that I love, sitting in a hot comforting broth. Chopped scallions and crispy tempura pieces floated in the soup while the shrimp tempura were excellent as well. Served on the side by default, they were plump sweet pieces of shrimp in a crispy, light batter.Zaru Udon - I loved the presentation of this udon. Served cold, the udon showed off even more of its chewy texture - cooked perfectly. A side sauce complemented with grated radish, scallions, grated ginger, and fried tempura chips completing the simple dish.Udon Gratin - This was definitely something different for me, but apparently something my Japanese coworker had seen before. This was basically a take on the classic French preparation using the thick noodle; bits of chicken were added in to make it more of a complete meal. As expected, this was rather rich and kind of heavy and the noodles didn't hold up their chew quite as well. It wasn't bad at all, but not really my thing...I prefer the lighter preparations for udon.Marugame Monzo makes some great udon and is a very viable lunch/dinner option in the area; I'll be back.

It came in a sweet brown sauce and a few large (but fatty of course) pieces of pork belly. This was my favorite dish of the night, even though the udon was supposed to be the best here.-Hot Udon w/ Chicken Tempura ($8.95) - Another reviewer mentioned that the chicken tempura was bland - correct. Very bland fried chicken, though the pieces were somewhat large.-Duck Nanban Udon ($12.95) - Came with a few pieces of duck but otherwise tasted like my chicken tempura udon.-Takana Bacon Udon - This was an udon that came w/ a creamy sauce. It was a little strange eating udon without soup, but it tasted okay. I preferred the hot udon instead.Food was solid, but nothing really stood out for any of us. Portions are a bit small, as others mentioned. Maybe I just don't appreciate good udon!"

Great service and we made a reservation to sit at the counter and watch the chefs roll and cut fresh udon noodles. I got the carbonara udon and it was amazing. Full of flavor, nice chewy noodles, and smelled amazing. Have a glass of sake or Japanese beer and you are all set. I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu.

5/1/2013,20130501,4,4.24,This place is solid. They specialize in udon noodles and you can see the noodles being made right there. I got the beef udon and the broth was clear and flavored. The udon's texture has a chewy texture and was simply delicious. We also got the prosciutto as an appetizer and they were very generous with the prosciutto. My only complaint is how the restaurant is set up. The tables are literally so close you could smell their food and hear their conversation. Next time I will try the udon gratin and pork belly.
5/2/2013,20130502,5,4.25,"After seeing Yui Y post pictures of the udon here I knew I had to check the place out. Just having taken a trip out to HNL and eating at Marukame Udon I decided to make the trek out to J town the next day. We were out and about and arrived right as they opened at 5 pm. Was seated at the bar right in front of the udon making chef yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. The dough was already sitting on the side waiting for him to start rolling it out yelp.com/biz_photos/maru… yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. After he has the correct thickness and size of the dough he busts out the udon cutter yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. After making his way down the line the udon is ready to be cooked yelp.com/biz_photos/maru… yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. After the 10 minute or so show we decided to browse through the menu. Ordered the assorted tempura to start off with (forgot to take a pic) and a few skewers (chicken, lotus root, gobo wrapped in bacon, and the shitake mushroom) yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. Something unique was that the skewers were served with tonkatsu sauce along with curry salt. Both were tasty and each added a unique taste to each one. Both were perfectly fried to a golden brown and weren't oily as you'd find at most cheap Japanese restaurants. Also ordered two tempura jidori eggs yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. Don't expet the yolk to be as runny as your normal jidori egg as they had to fry them yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. After devouring those few items I decided to order the cold udon which of course was served with a jidori egg yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. This time around the yolk of the jidori egg was perfectly yelp.com/biz_photos/maru… and the udon noodles had the perfect chewiness to them. Fiance ordered the duck nanban udon which was tasty yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. The duck breast was cooked perfectly and the dashi was damn tasty. Again the udon noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. Was stuffed and am trying to figure out when I can head back to try some of their more specialized items."

Sorry.. it was still good though! It was piping hot when it came out and the udon was PERFECT in texture. Mentai Squid Butter Udon - my bf ordered this and it was quite interesting! It was full of flavor. I only had a couple bites but not sure if I would have been able to eat a whole order myself. Nonetheless, very good and should try at least once!Egg Tempura - I was expecting this to be oozing and delicious and flavorful... I was sorely disappointed when it just tasted like a plain ol' egg lol.. not sure why I thought differently.I think I ought to come back and try more items!"

5/5/2013,20130505,3,4.23,"I love soup noodle and when I read about this place making their own udon noodle, I had to come and try it. The place is right in Little Tokyo and the place was pretty pack. We sat at the counter so we can watch the udon master make his udon. It was quite interesting so watching him and how many udon he had to make. We both sat down and order 2 different type of udon. Mine was more of a soup base which was ok. The udon was a little too thick for me and every single noodle sizes were different so some were tasty and some were too thick. My gf got a udon dish that came in a water broth and you dip your noodle in the intense broth which tasted better. I do like this place but it isn't the best udon that I tasted but i give them another try when I get a chance or when I feel like eating udon."

You can watch the chefs make the noodles while you eat - I love places like that!Came here for lunch on a Saturday with a group of 4. We ordered:- Mentaiko squid butter udon - I love mentaiko (spicy cod roe) and this was creamy (but not too saucy) and plenty of mentaiko. I added more spice onto my noodles.- Mini pork belly don - added for $3.00 as part of their lunch special. Pork belly was nicely seasoned and peppery over a big bowl of rice and green onions on top.- Seafood tomato udon - tasted very much like pasta- Duck nanban udon - steamy clear sanuki broth - very refreshing- Champon udon - I didn't get to taste this one but it looked good.- Soft boiled egg tempura - unfortunately, my friend's egg came out pretty much hard boiled =(The servers are all SO NICE I LOVE THEM. They take your orders on an iPad mini and some of them don't speak English very well, but it all works out in the end. Restaurant is surprisingly spacious and we were seated with no wait.

Glass window for you to see the kitchen at work. Chefs are professional in facing the constant picture taking. Thinking in their heads, 'Another picture? Two cameras this time ?' But the business is doing pretty well to where they will be making noddles every 20 minutes or so, so if you missed the show, just be patient. Just by the visual effect makes your udon tastebuds all the more appreciative. There are so many different types of udon all prepared differently, from your standard udon broth to the way American-fusion taste. I definitely need to come back to try new stuff.I got the udon gratin. It just sounds awesome. When it came ..it was AWESOME! I love the creamy and cheesy goodness. Just writing this review makes my mouth water so..I tried the mentai squid udon as well. It was good too but I liked the gratin udon more.The restuarant is not big and staff are pretty friendly.

Just like when I tried Daikokuya my first thought was ""it's just Ramen"" and the same went when I thought of Monzo, ""its just udon."" But boy was I wrong! I loved the atmosphere and the ability to watch udon being made fresh! I ordered the seafood tomato cream udon dish. You can definitely taste the noodles as homemade, fresh and a good chewy consistency.  If you do not want to wait for a long line next door and crave noodles, then try this place out.

5/8/2013,20130508,4,4.23,"This place def stands out from all the ramen and sushi places in the area. It's basically udon noodles as pasta with different kinds of sauces, and traditional udon in soup too. Decor is nice and new, and the restaurant is spacious without much of a wait the times I've been there. Good place to take a date.As for the food, I LOVED the uni cream udon. If you like uni, you must get this!! Generous amounts of uni cooked into the sauce, and then one fresh uni on top of a leaf garnish. The sauce is creamy and garlicky. It's a bit pricier than the other options (came out to $20 with tax and tip) but I think it's worth it because of the amount of uni that's in it! Also tried the Mentai Squid Butter, and it was pretty good/interesting.Sadly the second time I ate here the pieces of uni didn't taste nearly as fresh (and they were overcooked?), and the portion seemed smaller too, so can't quite give 5 stars. Oh and service is very friendly BUT I think they need some more experience. They tried to cram us into the corner of the bar when there were plenty of 2 person tables available and additional bar seating. What were they thinking??Anyway, only place I know serving specialty udon so it's my go-to place for that now!"

I got the mentaiko udon, and wow...it was delicious, on the heavier side but not too bad. My friend had the udon gratin... but I probably wouldn't order that because of the creamy sauce. We ordered the braised pork belly, and that was okay, I wish it was a bit tender, but still tasty. Reminds me of thit kho (Vietnamese braised pork) so it wasn't anything special to me.Next time, I'm going to have to order the more simple broths. Service was friendly and fast."

5/11/2013,20130511,4,4.22,"Every so often as part of my run downtown, I end my workout here in Little Tokyo for a quick bite. This week's destination was Monzo -- the new establishment that replaced the previously (equally) lovely Fat Spoon.For those who liked and missed Fat Spoon (me included!), Monzo has kept that very casual, homey, ambiance. I arrived around 5:20 and the restaurant was already quite bustling -- good job for a new restaurant situated next to the likes of Daikokuya and other age-old popular spots. The food was solid -- while it didn't have the ""woah"" factor I had hoped for, I can see why it justifies the crowd of hungry people. I had the miso carbonara -- a hand tossed udon dish with creamy carbonara infused with the wholesomeness of miso paste -- and the scallop carpaccio -- scallops with a light marinate of Japanese mayonnaise and roe. Overall, the food, while not exceptional, was interesting and satisfying. I will definitely come back again and give the other items on the menu another try."

They have their traditional udon dishes with a delicious broth! I tried my friends Beef Udon and the sauce was amazingly savory.  My other friend had the Curry Udon which was pretty good as well. For the traditional udon dishes you can upgrade for a double size portion for only $2 which is a very good deal because the portions are HUGE.My eyes set sight on the sea urchin cream udon which I took as a must order through my fellow yelpers, however they ran out of it at the time of order (8pm on a Sunday). So I then eyed over to the also delicious sounding second choice, ""Mentai Squid Butter Udon"" - the pink creamy sauce with buckwheat noodles was so delicious with the fusion of creamy sauce flavor, fish roe and classic udon.

5/15/2013,20130515,5,4.23,"Udon has always been my go-to comfort food. Upon hearing that Marugame Monzo serves up great noodles, I came here with a friend early on a Friday night. The place had plenty of seats left, and we were lucky enough to sit right across from the man tossing and carefully dividing udon noodles.Monzo has a pretty extensive menu. In addition to the wide variety of udon, Monzo also has small dishes that should not be overlooked. After some discussion, my friend and I decided to share everything and ordered the flaming diced konyaku and some kakuni to start along with the miso carbonara and the sea urchin cream udon for our main dishes. The konyaku, a chewy gelatinous Japanese dish, was a pleasant surprise. Konyaku is usually served plain, but Monzo decided to coat itskonyaku in chili oil, giving it a kick and some flavor.The kakuni came not too long after, and there really isn't much to say about this dish except for the fact that you NEED to get it. Bring your fork down on the kakuni and it falls apart into perfect delicate slices. The fat melts in your mouth and the meat is a little sweet but mostly savory.Then came the two different udons. I didn't get too much of the miso flavor for the carbonara, since the cream sauce and the bacon were the main attractions of this dish. But in all honesty, it was so good that it didn't matter. The same goes for the uni cream udon, which had plenty of uni pieces in addition to the uni infused in the cream sauce. You'd like all this cream sauce would make us feel a bit queasy, but the udon was just so good that every bite felt like the first bite.We came out of Monzo feeling extremely full and only $25 lighter. I've heard that some of the more traditional udons are not as incredible, so try to go for the more unique dishes, like the miso carbonara or the uni cream udon. And make sure to order at least two small dishes while you're at it. You won't be disappointed."

5/16/2013,20130516,5,4.24,"Amazing place! Their udon noodles have a sweetness you wouldn't get from an instant udon bowl. And to watch them flatten out the udon dough and cut it is awesome. Kind of like what I would see in a Japanese documentary about udon. For an appetizer, my friends and I got the caprese - cherry tomato, same sized mozzarella balls, sliced shiso, and yuzu dressing. OH MY GOODNESS. Amozzaballs (like amazeballs). The udon: The first time, I ordered the Kitsune udon. I know, sounds lame right? But NO! The kitsune part (I think the fried tofu thing) was SO SWEET and delicious! It was amazing! The second time I went, I got the Plum Shiso Bukkake (hahaha) cold udon. It was also good but for some reason, the cold udon didn't fill me up as much as the hot one. I'll probably try another hot one next time. I saw other yelpers' pictures of the soft-boiled egg tempura so I had to get one. It truly was boiled perfectly. The inside had enough gooey-ness/hard-boiled yolk where you didn't have to think about salmonella. I also ordered the tempura tako (baby octopus). OMG. MUST TRY! It's perfectly done so you don't see the face of the tako, and I was amazed that it wasn't chewy at all. I was expecting it to be more like the sushi tako but it was nothing like that. Definitely will go back. FOR SURE."
5/17/2013,20130517,5,4.25,"Came here on a Tuesday, right before the rush. Order the clams and beef tataki as appetizers. Clams were really good but the beef tataki was AMAZING! I highly recommend! I also ordered the Mentai Squid Udon, which was nice a light compared to the Miso Cabonara that my friend ordered. It was heavy but still good. The handmade udon noodles just melt in your mouth... YUM... Next time I think I'll get the classic Tempura Udon because it looked so good! Great service and nice clean decor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
5/20/2013,20130520,5,4.26,"More like 4.5 stars, was going to round it down to a 4 because I was feeling a little snooty but then realized this place played the best music while we were dining there so 5 it is! A quick glance of the restaurant's front and you may think this is a traditional Japanese place but upon entry, one will realize it's pretty modern with its vibe and decor. Plus they were playing soothing jazz and a nice selection of old Kaskade tracks (who is my favorite DJ btw, so automatically rounding up just for that!).Now let's get to the menu. Appetizers? Beef tataki for sure, so smoky and then with the red peppercorns on top added such a nice peppery flavor but with a hint of sweetness as well. The acidity from the dressing did not take away from the natural sweetness of the beef.Braised pork belly? Very generous portions and just the perfect sized layer of fat on each of the pieces of pork. The sweetness of the sauce made the thing taste like a savory dessert rather than appetizer. However, the meat wasn't as tender as I would've liked, but still good.Now for their signature udon dishes. We ordered their top 3 most popular udon dishes.The Sea Urchin Cream Udon: ORGASMIC, the sauce is so creamy and rich. Huge chunks of quality sea urchin with that ocean flavor. Not going to lie, when they placed that bowl of golden uni in that creamy, buttery sauce, my stomach triggered a slight food boner.The Mentai Squid Butter was perhaps the lightest udon dish out of the 3. A little on the soupy side but the texture off the fish roe that they put in really gave it an interesting feel. The squid was so soft and plump. Perhaps the sweetest tasting dish out of the 3.The Miso Carbonara was probably the richest and creamiest out of the 3 and that's what I was expecting anyways. The bacon did not help in easing my guilt of eating such a rich dish. However, it was not too salty and it was a trip that pasta carbonara worked better with udon noodles here than anywhere else I've tried with regular Italian style pastas.Regardless of which toppings, sauces, or broths you chose the star will always be their handmade udon. When you think of pasta served perfectly al dente, than this Japanese udon place has hit the bulls eye on that. Their udon's firmness was definitely tender-crispy like but not hard. Soft on the outside, firm on the inside and velvety smooth going down. You want this in your mouth, trust me."
5/20/2013,20130520,4,4.26,"Very good freshly made udon. We ordered mentai and uni cream, both are awesome. I also ordered the shrimp tempura as side order, but not as good, therefore took one star out. For the price of $15 something, I think may be too much for just a bowl of udon...."
5/22/2013,20130522,4,4.26,"My review may be slight premature. I would like to try this place out again. But anyway, here goes. We brought my dad here on his birthday around 1pm on Sunday, and we had to wait a good 20 - 25 minutes. Though Yelp says they take reservations, they DO NOT take reservations. On the plus side, they started serving the Uni Udon for lunch. Service was good, though I expected the lady to speak to us in Japanese as we made it pretty clear we spoke Japanese....but she continued to speak to us in English. We ordered the chanpon, zaru udon, bukkake udon with soft egg, and the miso carbonara udon. I would say the best one was miso carbonara. I should've ordered that, my husband did. I ordered the bukkake udon, and now that I think about it, I should've ordered a hot udon. It was hot on Sunday so I wanted something cold. However, on top of the bukkake was a mound of orosi (grated daikon), katsuobusi (bonita flakes), negi and goma. All of which I am usually not a fan of. I wished they put it on the side. I'm one that likes the udon pure and simple. Udon only, no orosi or anything. The soft egg was good, but not runny enough. Also, the dipping sauce was way too watery!! It didn't have a good deep mentsuyu flavor like I was used to. It was disappointing because the udon were deliciously chewy and al dente but the sauce did not live up to it. I also ordered a shrimp tempura a la carte, for $2, which is a bit of a ripoff. Dad said the chanpon was a bit too garlicky. It was a huge portion though. My husband's carbonara sauce was to die for. Creamy, thick, garlicky, cheese, all things that should not go with Udon......I'm all for the unorthodox, and this dish was definitely unorthodox to Japanese cuisine. I would get that or the udon gratin next time. Small cute little joint right next to Daikokuya. Service can be a bit slow at times. Definitely a good selection of udon."
5/22/2013,20130522,5,4.26,"Holy crap. No wonder this place always has a mass of people waiting outside. Hot tempura udon was amazing. Tempura was served on the side so it didn't get soggy and they're very generous with the tenkasu (score!). The cold soba was my second favorite of the night. All the components worked so well together. The variety of garnishes on the side gives yo the power to customize the dish as you wish which is really nice.The uni creamy udon was THE BEST. Rich and creamy (as expected) and a perfect complement to the freshly made udon noodles. I would definitely come here again despite the typical 30 minute wait. You will leave happy, guaranteed."
5/22/2013,20130522,5,4.27,"Uni Udon is amazing! I love the fresh pulled noodles although the frozen santouka ones are pretty good comapred to these actually!The soup for the regular udons are good and the lunch with the rice bowl addition is a great add on. I'm so glad there is an Udon place now to go to when you are not feeling for a fatty ramen broth! The pork bowl was good and it was char grilled thin slices of pork belly deliciousness. Also had the tempura. I had the shrimp which was good, chicken which is a piece of chicken breast in tempura- it was okay, and the squid was meh for me. If you have friends, i would suggest to share an uni udon and get another broth udon so you get a good mix of both instead of feeling like UNI RICHNESS OVERKILL (which might be something some of you want)."
5/22/2013,20130522,4,4.27,"Lovely little udon place in the heart of Little Tokyo. They make the udon noodles fresh at the restaurant, and if you sit at the bar you can watch the noodles being made through a glass window.We started with the mushroom salad which was rather simple but fresh and delicious - iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and a light dressing. It was a good start for the heavy meal that was to follow, but I was eyeing the pork belly that the table next to us ordered and it looked amazing - may have to get that next time.I had the sea urchin udon and my boyfriend had the shrimp tempura udon with an added softboiled egg. I am a huge fan of sea urchin and I did enjoy the sea urchin udon (has lots of pieces of sea urchin in it!), but it is VERY, VERY rich and CREAMY and perhaps not something I'd order again because of that. The sea urchin taste is very strong and it is definitely delicious, but for me the creamy factor was a bit much. My boyfriend's udon was very good - a bit on the salty side, but altogether excellent. The shrimp tempura was perfectly done and the lightly fried soft boiled egg was great. The serving sizes are very large so next time I think we will order a few appetizers (so many looked good!) and then split an udon entree."
5/23/2013,20130523,4,4.26,"Came here last Sunday for lunch around 1. Waited about 10-15 minutes. Sat down in front of the dude making the noodles and watched as we waited for our meal. The gf ordered the Uni Udon and I got the Duck Udon. I don't like Uni and my gf doesn't particularly like Uni either... however she did enjoy the uni udon. I did not like it at all. The duck udon was good. Duck was cooked perfectly and the udon soup and homemade noodles were great! Service was good.Note: It is hot inside the restaurant, especially if you sit in front of the window where they make the noodle. I would come back here to try some other menu items such as the miso carbonara or the curry udon. I was going to get the carbonara but decided that it was too creamy especially since my gf ordered the uni udon which is creamy as well. Oh well, next time!"
5/24/2013,20130524,4,4.26,"If I could give it 4.5 stars, I totally would.. but alas, I had to round down.The food here was awesome and the two times I've been here, I've hardly had to wait. I've tried the mentaiko cream, uni cream, and had samples of the wakame udon. The quality of the noodles is fantastic! So chewy (or as Taiwanese people like to say... very 'q q'). The broth for the wakame was good too. The dashi stock wasn't too salty and there was just a hint of sweetness. Personally, though, I prefer tsurumaru's broth more though... The cream udons were yummy. So creamy and so generous on the mentaiko and the uni! However, one downfall was that after bite 10, I was done. The flavor was so powerful that I got tired of it pretty quickly (and I usually NEVER get tired of food)But overall, the quality was awesome. The food tasted great! The price was reasonable. I just wish there was a way to make the cream udon a little less overwhelming (but then again, I'm a broth kind of gal and cream in general gets a bit overwhelming to begin with). But other than that, I am so glad there are finally solid udon houses in little tokyo."
5/24/2013,20130524,2,4.24,"It doesn't matter how good the food is if the service is terrible. Our server was not only bad, she was straight up rude. They don't have high chairs, they ran out of salad, and they ran out of draft sake. And I've had better udon before. Totally overrated. But I had to give it more than 1 star because the food wasn't bad. But I'm definitely never going back."

It was good, not great.Pork Belly - Nope! The Fatty pieces are good, but I think it was too much of a thick cut. It was like a dried thick tough piece of meat attached. But the Belly itself was good, just not the meat attached.Plum Shiso Udon (Cold) - Yum! I liked this one. The broth & udon made a very good mixture and there was not anything was too overwhelming.Duck Udon (Hot) - Good Broth Flavor. The udon was very good and a great consistency. 2nd Favorite Udon Dish.Mentai Squid Butter - Ehh! I think the aquid made the broth way too fishy. Like not the good fishy either. =XCarbonara Udon - Nope! Creamy Udon. I think I may not be a fan of an creamy Udons because it added to the texture of the Udon. I couldn't really enjoy the flavor as the creaminess was just overwhelming. I believe it was a big too much MSG for me.Overall - More Hype. I would go back for the cold udon, beef tataki & to try the Uni Udon."
5/25/2013,20130525,4,4.23,"when you go to a restaurant that has ""good food"" and at least decent service .. it's bound to be packed on weekends and typical ""busy"" hours on weekdays. I went on a weekday, 740pm. No lines. service was excellent. I don't take my kids to these places unless I check them out beforehand. Not sure if the place is suitable for kids younger than ~3 ish. I give 5 stars simply for the taste of the noodles itself. Perhaps I'm biased but watching the guy make the noodle with his hands makes me feel special. I feel the ""heart of craftsmanship"" put into each string. when your food comes out and you take that first sip/bite, it's very warm/homey. I enjoy food that touches my heart, emotionally moving. This was one of those places. I'm sure not everyone would have the same experience as me but i'm sure you have had similar experience elsewhere eating special food. As I chew down on the noodles, with my eyes closed.... reminiscence of eating this type of food in Japan a long ago when I was there. note: I feel that generally people use too much salt / soy sauce in japanese food in America. please don't say food is ""bland"" when it's supposed to be ""bland"" duh?"
5/26/2013,20130526,4,4.22,"4 stars on second visitDecided to bring a friend here for dinner since I've been raving about Marugame. For a Saturday night, the wait wasn't bad perhaps a good thing as I was starving. Was quickly seated at a table and ordered a few appetizers to start:Kakuni yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. Good flavor but there were several pieces of the pork belly that were overcooked and was dry. Spinach and bacon salad yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. Just as the name states it is exactly that....a spinach and bacon salad. Nothing to go home raving about but everyone still needs some fiber with each meal.Chicken and lotus root skewer yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. Once again perfectly golden fried and was once again awesome. These skewers are a must order when dining here.Finally uni cream udon yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…. Though the flavor of the cream sauce was good I was sorely disappointed with the bits of uni. They were all overcooked and had an unpleasant texture. The udon noodles were once again cooked perfectly but the bits of uni were the most disappointing part of the dish. Perhaps they should add the uni when the cream sauce is off the flame? Not sure but hopefully it'll be better the next time I dine here."
5/27/2013,20130527,4,4.22,"After all those ramen cravings by us Los Angelenos, it seems that now the udon fad is starting to spread...Located right near Daikokuya, Marugame Monzo is an authentic Japanese Restaurant that advertises its homemade Sanuki Udon, originated from the Kagawa Province in Northeastern Japan. The restaurant's waiting time is decent (compared to Daikokuya's...) and you'll be entertained as you watch the chefs rolling and cutting strips of handmade udon. Here's what we ordered.1) Scallop Carpaccio - Handpicked fresh scallops served with 2 slices of tomatoes, a scoop of fish roe, and special mayonnaise sauce. The scallop's delicate texture certainly mixes well with the tomatoes and fish roe.2) Sea Urchin Udon - Probably the most advertised udon, the Uni udon is served with Marugame's unique uni cream sauce with actual strips of fresh uni. The taste is quite surprising since it's my first time eating udon with uni. It's quality definitely deserve some praise, a must try for customers.3) Tomato Seafood Cream Udon - The udon's appearance might be fulfilling, but the sauce is surprisingly light! Blended with a handful of mixed seafood, this udon is very well-made.4) Mentai Squid Butter Udon - Perhaps the tastiest of all, the Mentai Squid Butter Udon is served with their Pink Fish Roe Sauce tossed with freshly sliced nori and LOTS, yes, LOTS of fish roe!!! Coupled with slices of squid, this dish is by far one of the most unique dishes I have ever tasted. I'll definitely recommend this udon to my fellow yelpmates...5) Tempura Egg - THIS IS THE BOMB!!! Nicely fried tempura egg which it's yolk will ooze inside your mouth as we took our first bite! Too bad we haven't ordered any soup udon.. :(Overall, Monzo deserves a 4 stars out of 5 for it's well-made appetizers and udon dishes. We haven't tried their soup udons yet, so we'll probably reserve our additional one star per our next visit. For those who are tired of waiting outside Daikokuya, I will definitely suggest Monzo since the waiting time is way way way shorter. We'll definitely return."
5/27/2013,20130527,4,4.22,"Handmade udon!! Request to sit at the counter to watch the process of udon being made.Kitsune Udon- The broth was light, flavorful and perfect for an overcast and chilly day. I love the chewiness of the freshly made udon.Plum Shiso (cold udon)- I must admit, I've never been a fan of cold udon, but I think this might be my new favorite! The flavors and sauce compliment each other perfectly!Tomato Seafood Cream Udon- At first sight, it looks as though it's a thick and heavy dish, but it was surprisingly light and creamy.Marugame Monzo is a great addition to the J-Town community!"
5/28/2013,20130528,5,4.23,"I work not too far from downtown, so I'm always looking for something new to try over there, particularly when it comes to Japanese. My periodic visits to Shin Sen Gumi, while much appreciated, are no longer novel and exciting. But when I read about Marugame Monzo on Yelp today I became excited by the prospect of a truly great udon.I arrived around 1pm to a half-empty restaurant. They positioned me just in front of the man preparing noodles, who was behind a thick pane of glass. I did not see the uni cream others here have mentioned, which I attributed this being the lunch menu. So I ordered the less exotic tempura shrimp udon.It arrived in less than 10 minutes, a big bowl of bonito-scented broth harboring thick udon noodles, sliced green onion, and tempura bits. A small dish of fresh ground ginger accompanied the bowl for seasoning according to taste, and two tempura shrimp came on a separate plate. These shrimp were divine: flavorful and delicately fried. The broth and udon were both excellent, though I have little experience with udon and therefore cannot make a comparison with others. As has been previously discussed, the udon first arrive with a wonderful chew to them, but this eventually gives way to something less interesting as they continue to steep in the hot broth.Shortly after ordering I overhead a server telling a customer that due to popular demand the uni cream is now available at lunch, though it is not yet printed on the menu. Take-home lesson: it pays to ask!  At least it is something to look forward to.And...apologies Shin Sen Gumi, but I think I need to take a little break!"
5/30/2013,20130530,4,4.23,"Came here on the Sunday of the Memorial weekend - MISTAKE!Waited 2 long hours and by the time we got seated, the famous uni udon has been sold out! Lucky for them, their other udon alternatives were also gastrically bombtastic.Here's what we tried:carbonarasquid butter udoncream cheese tofugrilled chickenbeef tatakiCarbonara: this is a very heavy tasting udon. Super creamy and fulfilling. Tasted mostly of cream? It was not a favorite, but nevertheless, satisfying.Squid butter udon: this was YUM!!! Although, I must say, I didn't really detect the squid taste in the sauce. Doesn't matter, because it was delicious. The texture of the sauce might put off some people, because it's jam-packed with masago roe. This is a very savory, but lighter udon.cream cheese tofu: silky, cheesy tofu. Served cold with 3 different toppings: masago, iruka, and the last one.. I think it's some sort of fish? Very appetizing--it was sort of like a softer, almond-tofu textured Philadelphia cream cheese.Grilled chicken: skip. The sauce was just ginger and green onion. The chicken itself was mediocre as well.Beef tataki: can't speak for the quality of the meat, because I do not eat beef. However, the sauce that comes with it was extremely tasty. I kept dabbling and eating the sauce by itself or the tomato that comes with it.Overall, this place is not worth the 2 hour wait. However, if the wait time is cut down to 30 min or less? Definitely. I will be back to try the uni udon!p.s. Please be courteous, fellow foodies! With a place this small, it's not a place for you to spend hours for chitchat. It's J-Town! Plenty of other venues where you can sit and talk the night away. There are people, near starvation, ogling your delicious UNTOUCHED food while you're chatting up a storm. Please, give others a chance..."
5/30/2013,20130530,5,4.23,"Love this place! Great for a $6 bowl of handmade udon OR full meal with appetizers, sake, etc. The cold udon with Ume and Shiso is AMAZING! Also the Gobo tempura is creamy and amazing!"
5/31/2013,20130531,5,4.24,"This place is just right next to Daikokuya. The wait at Marugame Monzo in comparison to Daikokuya is not bad at all. Even though they serve totally different type of noodles, I prefer the handmade udon especially during the hot summer days-very refreshing. My past two visits has been great and I would love to keep coming back to try the different type of udon they offer- I have my eyes set o the plum for next time. So far, I've tried the mentai squid and butter, uni, and the duck udon. My favorite one is the mentai. The store is famous for their uni, however, I find the flavor a little too rich for my taste- especially half way through. I've had uni pasta at other places and I would say I had it better- still worth a try though."
6/3/2013,20130603,5,4.25,"I've been wanting to come here for some time since it opened. I arrived for a late lunch and avoided the lunch rush. The hostess put me up against the glass for the show of one of the noodle artisans pulling and cutting noodles. Awesome. I was between meetings, and the waitress suggested ordering the cold noodle bukkake for the fastest service. It came out in minutes. The dashi was so delicious with complexity and layers of flavor. The handmade udon noodles were quite thick and chewy. Well balanced in flavor. Added some spicy stuff and fresh ginger for extra bite. Service was friendly and prompt. I'm coming back again to try more of the menu."
6/3/2013,20130603,5,4.25,"Udon galore! This place is really special. It does the Japanese pasta style of udon very well. I usually ask my udon to be made harder or more chewy when I order one of those pasta udon dishes as they are further cooked in sauces after being boiled. So far, I love the sea urchin udon, tomato seafood cream udon. The carbonara is good but it's kind of heavy and the squid butter udon was kind of fishy. I would give this place 4.5 stars because it does not have parking and also because some dishes like Takana bacon udon were not that great. But overall, great place for handmade udon!"
6/5/2013,20130605,5,4.26,"THE BEST UNI UDON EVER. I am not typically a fan of Udon noodles but I absolutely love this place. It's really thrown me off my paleo rails--BUT IT'S WORTH IT EVERY TIME.I came here for lunch once and when they told me that Uni was not available for lunch, I swear the server was about to give me a hug out of sheer sympathy. However, because of how many people have cried about this--they now serve Uni Udon for lunch as well! YAY TO THE HEAVENS. The only thing I DISLIKE is that they clearly changed the recipe--my Uni Udon clearly did not have as much Uni as it should...the cream sauce was white instead of the uni color it used to be...Expect to wait, it's quickly becoming Daikokuya-level lines/wait. One thing that I've noticed time and time again is that there are people that put their names on both the Daikokuya list and the Monzo list and tend to go to whoever calls them first."
6/5/2013,20130605,4,4.26,"Lunch Review~ came in 4 minute before their lunch closing time, but was not turned away ^^Ordered beef udon + karikai don + soft boil egg = $17.00. (yelp.com/user_local_phot…). Beef Udon - beef melts in your mouth, udon was chewy and definitely freshly made, soup base was on the salty side, but light Karikai Don - fried perfectly, no excess greasy oil lingering in your mouth when you bite into it, additional $3.00 when order with an entreeSoft Boil Egg - didn't expect it to come fried, the yoke is not runny enough, a little over cook for my tasteP.S. wait can get long here~ so be patient!"
6/5/2013,20130605,3,4.25,"I came to this restaurant because of a email I receive about LA activities (called Thriller). I thought I would give it a try because I do like Udon noodles. It was just my girlfriend and I so the wait wasn't that bad. However on this evening, I could see that if you had a larger than two group it will be at least a 30 min wait. As we looked at the menu, I realize this isn't your ordinary udon restaurant. They seem to have Italian influence. My girlfriend ordered the Uni Udon which had a creamy sauce instead of soup. I ordered the miso carbonara udon which also came with a creamy sauce. With both type of Udon, you start to taste the Italian influence more than the Japanese influence. You can taste the good hand made udon noodles. We also ordered the Beef Tataki which had a good taste to it. I will come back and try their traditional Udon selections. I believe the prices are over what they should be charging. I don't think you get what you pay for here. In other words, over priced. As like any restaurant or activity in Little Tokyo, parking is always an issues. That day I was lucky enough to find parking a few feet away from the restaurant."
6/6/2013,20130606,3,4.24,"Came here on Sunday night. Waiting wasn't that long, i guess we had pass the rush hour. menuscallop carpaccio- portion was good but the dish was mehUni Creamy pasta- After a couple bite i felt the cream was very rich and heavy. Also bits of uni was overcook and didn't taste that goodCold Udon- cant say much about this dish. After eating the uni udon it made me very full. Didn't have the chance to enjoy this dish. Servicesthere were 4 waitress walking around in this small restaurant and you cant get anyone attention. Even it you do, you had to request it two times in order to get what I needed."
6/6/2013,20130606,5,4.24,"This place was deeeelicious!! There was about a 15 minute wait on a weekday lunch, but I think it's only because the restaurant is tiny! Almost everyone, customers and workers included, were Japanese! Well, I guess that has to do with the restaurant being in little tokyo!I came with a friend and we ordered their squid udon and uni udon and omg both were mouth watering. The uni udon is creamier, but lighter in flavor whereas the squid udon was much more savory and flavorful. Both were equally delicious, just different in texture and depending if you want something creamy or savory. I didn't see very many people ordering these two dishes, but they all looked over at us when we were eating so don't be fooled. You MUST try this if you come!Service is quick and friendly. I like the open kitchen concept, nice to see Japanese people cooking and rolling noodles! Is this what Japan feels like? :)"
6/9/2013,20130609,5,4.25,"Came here for an early dinner, around 6pm on a Saturday. There was no wait!! :D We quickly ordered the uni udon and the squid udon from what was suggested in the previous yelp reviews! We also added the tempura soft boiled egg with each one.The udon came out surprisingly fast, maybe 10 minute wait. I tried the uni udon first it was creamy and really tasty. The squid udon was probably my favorite out of the two. It has eggs in the sauce and its slightly more savory than the uni one. The squid in the udon was also cooked perfectly. I hate when squid is all chewy :[ My favorite part of the whole meal would probably be the tempura soft-boiled egg! Soooo good, it is a ""must have"" add on. It's perfectly hardboiled and the runny yolk is my fave! Paired with the sauce and udon it rounds out the udon entrees.I will definitely come here again!"
6/10/2013,20130610,4,4.25,"Go on the weekend for lunch! Absolutely no wait! I was thrilled since the last time around, we waited for 2 hours.We went back to try the uni cream udon and the tomato cream seafood udon.For the uni, it was very creamy and filling. It does have a distinct taste of uni and they are very generous with the amount of uni they put in the udon. However, since it's a hot dish, the uni is cooked, which gives it an unpleasant texture as to if you were to eat it raw. The tomato cream seafood is delicious as well. I love how it's a little bit sour so the creaminess of it isn't so overwhelming. The portion of this dish is a lot bigger than the one for the uni cream. The part about the seafood? It's just these little, most probably frozen, pieces of scallops and shrimp. I'd be happy to do without the seafood and just with tomato and onion... Since there was so much, I had to take it home. The udon becomes really soft after microwaving, but the sauce itself is still amazing. I almost wanted to save the sauce for dipping."
6/10/2013,20130610,4,4.24,The name marugame is in japanese. Look for monzo.
6/12/2013,20130612,3,4.23,"I've been to Margame Monzo twice now, and both times I had just an ok, mediocre experience. The fact that the udon is made at the bar in plain sight it pretty cool, and adds a bit of fun to the restaurant. As far as the actual food though, it's been somewhat disappointing. The first time I came, I tried the cold udon--the udon itself was fine, but the sauce it comes with is too salty. I've had better at one of those food court options at the Mitsuwa market (the one in South Coast Plaza, can't remember the exact name of that place). The second time I went, I tried the chicken udon, which is udon in soup, and comes with a side of fried tempura chicken. The udon was fine, but the tempura was not. The entire batter falls off as soon as you take a bite of the chicken (maybe chicken isn't suitable for tempura batter?) and the chicken itself was tough and tasteless. I left most of it on the plate. Overall, the prices are a bit on the high side for what you're getting. I'm not completely opposed to trying the place again, but so far, I haven't had a great impression. Parking is not convenient. Be prepared to pay for parking at one of the meters (I believe $3 an hour) or in one of the parking lots/structures around the area."
6/14/2013,20130614,4,4.23,"i always thought udon could be this good! im in love with udon noodles but everywhere i went, the broth was just...so...BORING. this is the first time i've tasted broth that had some flavor and boldness. maybe a tad on the salty side. i had the regular udon with some tempura sides. tempura stuff was excellent! light and flaky....my cousin had the duck udon. broth tastes the same as regular and comes with like 5 pieces of duck. she was disappointed in the lack of duck. and i thought the duck tasted ducky :P...u *know* wut i mean! menu was big and awesome looking! and it was fun to sit at the counter watching them make noodles :)"
6/16/2013,20130616,3,4.22,"Stopped by Monzo for a quick dinner with some friends visiting from out of town. We ordered the beef tataki and fried chicken skin appetizers. Both were really delicious! I particularly liked the chicken skin- they were crispy and full of chicken flavor! I ordered the uni udon, while my friends ordered the beef, miso carbonara, and curry udons. The uni udon was very average in my honest opinion. My sauce was a little runny and was lacking any depth of flavor. The udon was cooked perfectly though, nice and chewy! I tasted the carbonara and it was really bland!!! My friend had to ask for salt and that still made the dish only marginally edible. The curry udon was decent but the sauce was too watery. The beef udon, which I did try, looked decent. I have mixed feelings about Monzo. Perhaps I came in on an off-night and the consistency wasn't there in the preparation and execution. I still liked the appetizers a lot and the service was excellent. I'd give this place another try again sometime."
6/16/2013,20130616,5,4.23,"This place was awesome. Went at 530pm on a Saturday and it wasn't crowded at all. The menu is a little confusing because a lot of the dishes aren't obvious what they are from the name; there's pictures for some of the dishes but not all of them. And I was disappointed my iced green tea was from a can rather than freshly brewed. But anyway. I got chicken tempura udon and added some ala carte tempura eggplant and tempura ginger. So it was basically a simple soup broth with fresh udon noodles in it, and the tempura on the side. At first I thought the broth was too plain but it got better and better as I ate more of it. The tempura was definitely among the better tempuras I've had in my life. And, wow, I've never seen tempura ginger before. It was great! Definitely looking forward to coming back here."
6/20/2013,20130620,5,4.23,"I absolutely love the fact that they make their own udon! Uni + Udon = match made in heaven! The creamy sauce is rich and decadent. As for the noodle, it's not too hard and not too soft. It's chewy at it's best. Just thinking about this place is making me salivate. Pounding fist* Why must you be so good?!?"
6/22/2013,20130622,2,4.22,"This place sucks, just seated other people before us after we were waiting for 45 minutes with 2 kids. Annoying"
6/23/2013,20130623,4,4.22,Food was real good. THey have a good variety of udon flavors. The texture of the udon is not as good as Fukadas though in Irvine. The decor was also interesting since you get to see the chef making udon as you eat.
6/24/2013,20130624,5,4.22,The best udon I have ever had! This may seem like a bold statement but I am a ramen fan so I rarely eat udon. I would eat at this place over a ramen place and that says a lot. I got the infamous uni udon which is definitely worth the $15. FYI - servers are Japanese and they let you know that if they have a difficult time understanding you they will ask someone to help.
6/28/2013,20130628,1,4.2,"I came here with four of my girlfriends for dinner last night. My experience started off badly when they forgot to seat us. At some point, I had to flag a waitress down because there were two available tables. She obviously forgot about us. I kept pointing to the sheet where I wrote my name down and she kept thinking I was a party of three when I kept pointing at my name and telling her that we were a party of five. Anyways, it was very frustrating. We were all excited to try this uni cream udon. It was disappointing. It basically tastes like alfredo sauce. The uni is cooked and the uni flavor is not within the sauce/soup. Granted the noodles were pretty good. We also shared a plate of Beef Tataki, which tasted better than the uni udon. The total for five udons and one beef tataki was $100.To top off the already mediocre experience, I got so sick last night. Threw up eight times and it was absolutely horrible. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. ITS NOT THAT GOOD. AND YOU MIGHT GET FOOD POISONING LIKE I DID. 1 STAR SEEMS A BIT GENEROUS."
6/28/2013,20130628,5,4.2,"Still five stars at this update. I've now been about 6 times, and this place is always great. The uni cream tops my list so far.One thing to note is their A/C isn't all that great, and the closer you sit to the kitchen (particularly at the bar) it can get uncomfortable. I certainly hope they take notice and are able to address this. Perhaps I'll just stick to cold udon on hot days."
6/28/2013,20130628,4,4.2,"The star of this place is defimitely the fresh hand made udon noodles. The creamy udon (sea urchin, carbonara etc.) is to die for but half way through it could be a little too heavy. You can't go wrong with the traditional udon and the tempura. And as far as the appetizers and salads, they are good but not what I would go there for."
7/1/2013,20130701,5,4.21,"They're usually pretty busy on the weekends (came on a sunday), but it was worth it.Uni (sea urchin) cream udon is SO FRIGGIN GOOD. Also had their mouth-watering Beef Tataki appetizer which had an amazing onion topping. SO GOOD.They make their udon noodles at the shop (like sanuki) and the texture is pretty awesome. I went with a group of 5 and we all gave thumbs up for these menu items:Kitsune UdonUni CreamMentai SquidMentaiPrices range from $6.95 (Kake udon) to $15.95 (uni cream). The uni set the price high for my dish, but everything else was around $8.95-$12.95 which is pretty good for dinner.Space is a bit cramped so I wouldn't try going with a group of more than 5 people. 5 was even pushing it.If you have time, endure the wait and get some delicious traditional or non-traditional creamy (like pasta) udon."
7/2/2013,20130702,5,4.21,"Wow wow WOW. FINALLY a resto in J-town that is an absolute must travel-to-LA spot like how it is with Momofuku and Ippudu in NYC. I am not even an udon fan but man this was good stuff. All I can say is....UniCreamyUdonGahhhh! Generous amounts of uni and it's so freaken flavory. It's the definition of delish. The other udon dishes were very delicious too and give you a different experience for your palate. They also have pretty unique tempura like soft-boiled egg and baby octopus tempura. So damn yums. This place is easily one of my top, favorite, and highly recommended restaurants in LA hands down.NOTE: The udon isn't chewy like the usual. Expect that."
7/2/2013,20130702,4,4.21,"I'm seeing udon differently now. What has once been a soupy, clear broth noodle dish is now a creamy pasta with endless possibilities. Now why didn't I think of that?I'm not gonna lie. I hunted this place down because I saw my friend's drool-worthy picture of her uni udon and decided I must try it. So clearly that same weekend, the boyfriend and I strolled in here for lunch and were seated at the counter without a wait. Score! We got a first-row look at the man wearing a towel over his head making udon. Although this was definitely cool and Din Tai Fung-esque, I could clearly see pearls of sweat about to drop onto the dough. Let's just say all was forgotten when the food arrived, which was within minutes of ordering! We ordered the kakiage, soft boiled egg tempura, beef don, Mentai squid butter udon, and uni udon. Kakiage is a traditional tempura dish where strips of vegetables like onion and carrots are mixed with squid and shrimp, then fried altogether in tempura batter. I've never had this before, but it was pretty good. I still prefer regular tempura with everything separate, though.The soft boiled egg tempura was just that: a fried soft boiled egg. It actually sounds better than it tastes. I was a bit underwhelmed. I prefer my egg a bit more runny, and I could have done without it. The beef don was like Yoshinoya but 10 times better. The beef was slightly more fatty than I'd like, but the sauce they put all over was amazing. It tasted like the oyakodon sauce. SO DELICIOUS.Now for the entrees: the uni udon was creamy and buttery. They were quite generous with the uni. For $15, I'd say it's a reasonable price. The flavor of the uni doesn't come off too overwhelming, either. It's a good balance between the cream and the fish. I didn't find the squid butter udon to be that special. It was also creamy, but the flavor didn't stand out too much. I regretted not getting the miso carbonara instead. I guess next time, Marugame Monza!"
7/2/2013,20130702,4,4.21,"My boyfriend and I went to Monzo on Friday after a recommendation from a friend (""The udon place RIGHT NEXT to daikokuya,"" she said). We waited for about 20-30 minutes and ordered the creamy uni udon ($15) and the shrimp tempura udon ($12). I ordered the shrimp tempura udon because you always have to try the original first! It was simple and delicious, and didn't get boring. Basically exactly what you would expect from a bowl of quality udon. Comes with two shrimps. Shrimp shrimp. The bowl was deeper than I expected, and the hand cut udon was great. The bf ordered the uni udon because of all the yelp recommendations. I'm not a huge fan of uni so I only tried a little bit. Uni in every bite. Totes worth it if you're into uni. Totally UNIque. Hahaha that's pretty good I just thought of that.FULLNESS RATING: I was satisfyingly full, but the bf was not! So it gets a... 7/10. Later, as we were walking around lil tokyo hunting for dessert, a bystander heard us talking about Monzo and felt sorry for us for not ordering the tempura soft boiled egg."
7/2/2013,20130702,5,4.22,"WONDERFUL cold handmade udon... BUT if you're a real lover of udon and uni, AVOID AVOID AVOID the much-touted *uni udon.* IGNORE THOSE REVIEWS! The uni udon here is disappointing and really meant only for giddy, cameraphone-wielding nincompoops who *think* they like sea urchin but really don't--first of all, the dish is served warm, which is detrimental to both the udon and the uni, and it is doused with garlic so that you can barely taste the uni (or enjoy its sweet brininess). AND the udon is simmered with a cream sauce, rather like Alfredo, which further covers up the taste of uni. So what's the point of this dish? Well, obviously, it's a good way to charge a little extra for an udon dish using uni dregs (it's $15.95, as opposed to $6.95-$8.95 for the far superior cold udon dishes) but really it's also to sucker in all these excitable unfortunates who want to think themselves uni-lovers but really aren't, and who should be banished en masse to ""sushi"" restaurants with names like Wokcano. Save your ""OMGs,"" you sad ladies. What this excellent restaurant is capable of (traditional handmade udon that's chewy-- or ""koshi"" in Japanese, smoky bonito flakes and exquisite dashi) is way TOO GOOD for you! Get thee to suburbia and stay there!"
7/2/2013,20130702,4,4.21,"If you're looking to have a nice hot sit down meal, this is the place to go. Little Tokyo has recently become a nice area to walk around with friends and also a place with great dining experiences. This place is known to have hand-made noodles and almost everything on the menu sounds great. My friend and I ordered the plain shrimp tempura udon and the curry udon. Both were delicious and the portions were HUGE. I recommend either sharing or coming with an empty stomach."
7/3/2013,20130703,5,4.22,"You must come here and eat the uni udon. Wonderfully chewy udon, perfectly creamy pasta sauce, and lots of uni on top. Not too heavy, not too light in uni flavor, so if you love uni, this is a must. The sides are also all very good. The beef tataki comes and is a lot larger than I thought it would be. Perfectly seared on the sides, and super tender. They probably thought we were nuts since we ordered one al dente fried egg each, what can we say, we love our eggs!! Unfortunately, some of them were a little medium and the yolk didn't run. But that's ok.........I love the udon so much I'm willing to look past this. It's small and cozy, sit at the noodle bar if you appreciate watching the udon chef make his noodles."
7/4/2013,20130704,3,4.21,didn't think it was that special. good thing we didn't have to wait that long.the mentai squid udon was not bad. the consistency of the udon didn't seem like it was made in-house. there was nothing special about it. i kinda like my udon on the chewier side. the uni cream udon was worse. there's a lot of bad looking uni in there. the beef tataki had too much sauce.three dishes for $50? especially udon??i think not.
7/4/2013,20130704,4,4.21,"4.5 stars, actually.So, my boyfriend and I were in Little Tokyo to go to Daikokuya. After signing the list at #34 and noticing the tiny-voiced hostess was only on #7, we decided to put our names in here at Monzo to see where we would get seated first.Well, Daikokuya, your review will have to wait for another visit.Monzo is a small, modern and intimate restaurant. We were seated fairly close to the bar, where we got to see a chef making our noodles.We both opted for more traditional Udon options:Beef Udon: Super tasty. The beef was nicely seasoned with sesame and ginger that blended smoothly into the broth. The noodles...yum! Chewy, soft and delicious.Wakame Udon: Very traditional and solid. Plenty of seaweed in a nicely salty broth. Toss in a Jidori Egg, and you've got heaven in a bowl. Again, the noodles were delicious.Jidori Egg: Soft boiled on the inside, lightly crispy tempura on the outside. The problem of overcooked eggs mentioned in previous reviews look to be a thing of the past. And thank goodness, the egg really made both of our meals.The only down side was that service seemed to be a little inconsistent. Don't get me wrong, EVERY server is polite and friendly. But, it gets a a little trying when you have to flag down someone every time something was needed (like, placing our order, ordering drinks and getting our check). Fortunately, my boyfriend isn't shy about holding his hand up like a student in order to get someone's attention. :)Will we be back? Absolutely. Although, I believe we will be sticking to the more traditional Udon options."
7/5/2013,20130705,4,4.21,I'm a huge noodle fan and I enjoyed this place very much! Noodles ate made to perfection. I recommend trying their flavored udon like the miso carbonara udon instead of the original ones.
7/8/2013,20130708,3,4.2,"When I saw pictures of Uni Udon, I just knew I had to have it! I came for dinner around 7:15 on a Thursday and surprisingly, barely any wait. Everyone in our group ordered the Uni Cream Udon except one girl ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and order beef tataki as an appetizer.Maybe I expected too much for the Uni Cream Udon. The udon was cooked perfectly and very chewy which I loved. But the Uni Cream part was just way too buttery for my taste. And I usually looooooove buttery. The Uni was cooked which i didn't like. If it's your first time, I'd say try it once so you know what it tastes like or make someone else order and just get a taste (*evil face*) hahahahI got a taste of my friend's Mentai Squid Butter and that was like jack pot. It was super duper yummy!!! I'm definitely getting that next time! Everyone was eyeing her dish. LOLBeef tataki was ok.The price is not cheap considering you are ordering udon. But you are definitely not getting ordinary dish, cuz how many places put udon or squid in your udon. And the portions are huge. Definitely going back for Mentai Squid Butter Udon."
7/9/2013,20130709,4,4.2,"*Fresh Handmade Udon*Request to sit at the bar so you can watch the chef make the udon. It was fun to watch! Ordered: Kitsune Udon, Beef Udon and Beef DonUdon = chewy and the broth was flavorful. Beef Don = Delicious!! The beef was so tender, juicy and tasty. The beef in the udon wasn't as tasty because it was soaked in broth/kinda bland. I wonder if we can ask for it on the side, hmmmm... I'm a fan and I'll be back to try their creamy udon =DRestaurant is located in the same block as Daikokuya!"
7/9/2013,20130709,4,4.2,"If you wanna get you're having a cheat day and you wanna get your carb on, definitely come here! Never have I ever enjoyed eating udon so much but the handmade noodles here won me over! Perfectly al dente with every bite! The bf and I shared the udon gratin, shrimp tempura udon and the scallop carpaccio. The carpaccio was tasty, light and a nice palate opener for the udon goodness to come.Warning: the udon gratin is freaking delicious and it doesn't taste too heavy going down but you feel it hit you like a ton of bricks an hour later. It comes out a little soupier than you expect but it's still really good! I'd definitely order this again on my cheat days. The shrimp tempura udon was a nice, light, soupy balance to the gratin. The shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly and the broth was very soothing."
7/9/2013,20130709,4,4.2,"Came here this past weekend to try their famous Uni Udon and for the most part it didn't disappoint. The Udon itself was definitely the best I've ever had with the consistency being perfectly chewy and not soft like other places I've had Udon. But the pieces of Uni that was placed on top, it would have been nice if they put raw pieces on top right before they serve it so that the Uni would not get cooked and maintain it's sweetness and texture. We also ordered the Crispy Chicken Skin, Deep Fried Soft Boiled Jidori Egg, and the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. The Crispy Chicken Skin was indeed very crispy but the sauce was too salty and should have been served on the side rather than in the same bowl causing the skin to soak up all the sauce. The egg sounded good and was a cool concept but was very bland. And the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, it was also just OK, but my Fiance' liked it alot. The four stars is primarily for the Udon itself but who knows, when I visit next time I may order another item or Udon dish that will blow me outta my seats...Either way I will definitely be back for the Udon, but will be trying it prepared in different ways."
7/11/2013,20130711,5,4.2,"A perfectly pleasant place to find respite for lunch... Must come back for dinner. Food was superb, the best Udon I have ever had. Service was friendly and very helpful. Would that I could eat here daily!"
7/12/2013,20130712,4,4.2,"Yummmm. I love udon, but most Japanese restaurants are more focused on the quality of their sushi than their udon so I was eager to try this place out. I ordered the kake udon and my friend the uni udon. The kake udon broth was very flavorful, not too salty, not too sweet. The uni was interesting. I am personally not a fan of uni and would never have made it through a whole bowl, but I enjoyed the couple bites I took of it. The uni flavor was present and definitely the star of the dish, but it wasn't overpowering.We also tried the deep fried soft-boiled egg, but that wasn't particularly interesting. It's just a battered egg. No dipping sauce either, so it was bland. Skip that and just get the udon."
7/13/2013,20130713,4,4.2,"thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here. but....they were out of their uni udon!!! i guess ill have to make another trip. beef udon: tender, moist strips of beef, and nice, simple broth. not too salty, not too overpowering, and with the beef soaked in the broth, and the chewy udon noodles, was a great, light lunch. the tempura soft boiled egg was perfection, just the right amount of oozy yolk. miso carbonara:with small chunks of bacon. creamy miso sauce. tried a little of my friends, and boy, it was pretty good, but i wouldnt have been able to take more than a few bites, it was pretty heavy."
7/14/2013,20130714,5,4.2,"Love it! The food is super fresh, delicious and surprisingly inexpensive. A very welcome addition to an overly ramen saturated Little Tokyo.The UNI CREAM UDON is everything it's hyped up to be. The noodles are made fresh in house and you can even see them making the udon behind the glass. A very nice touch. The sauce is creamy but not too heavy so that you can sip it like soup. Best part, they don't skimp on the uni which tastes fresh and oh so delicious. Portions are generous so sharing is a great option for people who don't want too heavy of a meal.I recommend adding a TEMPURA SOFT BOILED EGG to your udon. I've never seen that done before. The egg was perfectly cooked with a soft wet center and a semi-crispy tempura exterior. Really really good. Makes me wonder, why didn't I think of that?The BEEF TATAKI was a pretty good appetizer but nothing out of this world. I didn't care for the red peppercorns, but everything else was great.I will definitely be back to try the Miso Carbonara Udon and the Mentai Squid Butter Udon which are both highly recommended by my friends. For now, Marugame Monzo gets 4.5 Stars rounded up because I really can't name a better udon place."
7/14/2013,20130714,5,4.21,"Heard about this place from a friend. Floored to find out this is same guy who owns our favorute Vegas ""best of"" restaurant. Place immaculate and food amazing ..and price was as good as his Vegas Restaurants. This is now one of our regular places ..even though we live out of area.Way better than place next door"
7/15/2013,20130715,3,4.2,"Finally got to try this place after hearing so many mixed reviews about this place. In short, I was pretty underwhelmed by having a place that makes fresh udon. The noodles didn't taste like anything special (similar to any udon establishment - except the best udon I've ever had was in NY from Udon West.). Anyway, the bf and I ordered uni udon (I love my uni), and my friend ordered the shrimp tempura. Dishes are generous in portion, but again the udon itself was underwhelming. There was tonsss of uni in the dish (which I found to be a bit of a surprise for the cost of uni), but some pieces seemed to be over cooked.. which made them taste bitter. There was too much of it overcooked, and I felt bad to waste it, but couldn't stand to eat it. We ordered beef tataki and scallops as starters - nice plating and presentation. The beef had too much peppercorn on top, but overall nice balance of flavors. If I decide to go back, I'll try the squid udon or the tomato broth one that seems to be popular, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here if I was starving."
7/15/2013,20130715,5,4.21,"YESSSS to fresh noodles!!! We were lucky to get front row seats to watch the Chef make the delicious noodles. I'm sure anything you order will be wonderful. I really wanted to try the Uni Cream Udon, but they only serve that during dinner. So, I devoured the Menti Squid Butter Udon. It was really good! The boyfriend ordered the Beef Udon, which was yummy as well! I'm planning to go back to have some Uni Cream!!"
7/15/2013,20130715,5,4.21,"The tempura and the beef bowl rate 4 star. The green iced-tea was only 2 star. But the noodles, the soft egg, the tableware, the broth, and the fresh ginger each merit 5 stars, Noodles and broth were off -the-chart sublime. Struck me that tableware matters. More restaurants should care about and invest in table wear that is beautiful and feels good to the touch, as here."
7/16/2013,20130716,4,4.21,"Their udon is handmade in-house but it ain't no sanuki style. It's not as chewy as you'd expect and it's thinner than usual. There's pros and cons with this. Thinner noodles carry more sauce, so it seems that they are more confident with sauce rather than the noodle itself. Not that their noodles are terrible. It was good overall.I tried the squid mentai udon, and it was good. At first, the saltiness of mentai roe overwhelms but it gradually turns into more like umami when the rich flavor of butter cream starts to balance out. The squid was cooked to perfection giving you softer yet chewier texture than the noodles. It was a good 'fusion' udon overall, but the noodle itself was not impressive. If you were expecting the traditional sanuki style udon, you'd be disappointed. I also tried their combination tempura. It was good. Crispy outside and tender and moist inside. They have ginger and siso leaf tempura which I've never seen before. It's one of a kind but the ginger tempura needs some balance. It was too sour and the flavor of the picked ginger overwhelms too much. It makes you feel like you just bit a chunk of sushi gari."
7/16/2013,20130716,4,4.21,Quality ingredients with decent sized portions. A little pricey.
7/18/2013,20130718,5,4.21,"On No Reservations, Anthony Bourdain goes to Asian countries, has a bowl of soup noodles, claims that it is the best stuff on earth and then has some philosophical thought about just how darn good that bowl is. I didn't get that. I mean, I've had good bowls of noodles before but... come on it can't get THAT good, right? Wrong.Meet Marugame Monzo. Anyone who is going to put a big show window up in their restaurant so they can stand there and make noodles all day is going to be proud of their product and knows it can stand up to anything. And this does. The noodles are firm yet chewy. The broth isn't overly salty, it was perfect. I had the pork belly, which I guess was the first day they put it on the menu. Score one for the tourist! While not as melt-in-your mouth soft as some pork belly out there, the taste was amazing. Very rich, but compliments the very light bowl of noodles in front of you. This place should lose stars for making me lose respect for every bowl of noodles I will ever have again...and for being far away from home.Okay, enough sappy noodle writing for me. That was getting awkward."
7/20/2013,20130720,4,4.21,"I've been wanting to try this udon place and finally check it out. I know Little Tokyo very well but where the heck is this restaurant? I go to Fat Spoon many times before and always find it easily. I didn't have a problem seeing the sign when I was driving but I was a little lost because I walked from the parking lot. The sign was hard to find for pedestrian since we really had to look up. Ordered curry udon, beef udon and shrimp tempura.Curry udon ($9.50): the broth is kinda good and its pork belly is good. I really like the pork belly that I actually eat the fatty part too =PBeef udon ($11.95): this niku udon broth is light but yum.Shrimp tempura ($2.00): slightly sweet, crispy and not greasy at all. I wish I ordered more tempura. Next time I will get its vegetable tempura too.The freshly made udon is delicious. It has the perfect chewiness and it's slippery enough to slurp. Yes, Japanese people slurp their noodle =PI like this place better than Tsurumaru. I even like this place better than the famous Marukame udon in Honolulu...I think..QUICK TIP: PARK AT AISO PARKING LOT.4 stars!! I want to come back for its uni udon and more tempura of course.Marugame Monzo is yummylicious!!"
7/20/2013,20130720,4,4.21,"Hand-made Udon noodles?! DOWN!Came here for lunch around noon on a Thursday and it wasn't crowded. We wrote our names down and waited about 15 minutes before being seated. Like many Japanese restaurants, place is fairly small and tight. May I suggest sitting by the bar if you want to watch how they make their noodles!Upon reviewing their lunch menu, I didn't see Sea Urchin Udon on their list and was worried. I also read a couple of recent reviews stating how many people wish they came for dinner to order the Uni Udon. I was preparing myself for sadness and to order something else until I saw a nearby table receive their order of what appeared to be a yellow-ish cream based udon. I asked our waitress if they were serving Uni Udon and she happily replied, Yes. I asked her for an order of this along with a soft boiled egg (non-fried) and a jumbo shrimp tempura.Sea Urchin/Uni Cream Udon ($16) -- SUPER CREAMY and really good! It didn't taste as heavy as I would've imagined and was more like a creamy stock. Very delicious and flavorful. Good balance of saltiness with the richness from the sauce. The noodles were of course, tender and soft. The main problem I have with this dish is, as a person who loves eating uni nigiri/sashimi for the soft creamy texture, making uni udon destroys that for me. The few pieces of uni they added in were mostly overcooked and had no flavor but were instead grainy tasting and broke apart. I almost felt bothersome trying to eat all the Uni bits.Curry Udon ($12) -- This is a hot broth udon dish with curry flavorings. My bf ordered this with hopes of it being more of a curry sauce consistency but was disappointed. This wasn't that good and the broth tasted like they just threw in a bunch of spices to make it pop in your mouth.Overall, I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars. It is good and worth a try for their fresh noodles. Prices are a little high so be wise with what you order. If they didn't serve the Uni Udon, I would've opted for the Mentai Squid Butter which everyone else seems to love. I also gave it a low rating because their udon dishes don't automatically come with a heaping scoop of green onions and tempura flakes."
7/21/2013,20130721,5,4.22,I heard about this Udon place that hand makes their noodles from a coworker and I was not disappointed! Their menu varies from more traditional authentic Udon to crazy specialties. I decided to order the Udon Carbonara just cause it was different. It tasted amazing! There was too much for me to eat so I ended up taking some home and making another meal of it. The Carbonara was definitely a bit rich so I'd probably order something less so the next time I plan to go.
7/21/2013,20130721,3,4.21,"Good udon, but their special broth was a bit salty. Wasn't impressed with the tempura egg as it was soggy and lacked flavor."
7/22/2013,20130722,3,4.2,"Taste: 4Creativity/Authenticity: 3.5Atmosphere: 4Service: 1Bang for your buck: 3.5OK so the only reason why this place got an ok was the service was horrible and i think they are kinda racist but that was the vibe i got. The food here is good, mmm mmm good, italian fusion with japanese udon, just like i had in japan. Went with a couple of friends long wait about 1hr 20min not so bad, just like shabu shabu house; anyways we got the squid butter, uni and carbonara udon which was good, the squid udon was tender not chewy but the broth was kinda watered down, the uni udon was to die for, creamy very flavorful, we also got a few appetizers the fish sausage, bunch of skewers and fish crackers. Now the fish sausage was hit or miss for me one was good the other was bad, some were filled with mayo some had nothing. Now to the main event the whole ""racist"" thing now i'm am asian chinese to be exact and i felt that we might have been ignored, we were only given 1 glass of water the whole meal, it was very hard for us to get a waiter to ask for a spoon, but anyways it took them eh about 30-45 mins for everything but a japanese group sat next to us ordered the same amount of food and the staff literally went to the kitchen and back out with all their food in 5 mins??!! I don't know what was going on i just got that vibe but my friend ensured me he felt the same was and they were kinda acting weird. Overall the food is the only thing that will make me come back but they definitely need to work on their service especially if they are racist!!"
7/22/2013,20130722,4,4.2,"NIce, clean and simply, very flavored noodle and source, won't over full! love it! Good and effective services."
7/24/2013,20130724,5,4.2,"Handmade Udon noodles made to order. Delicious! You can even watch them make the noodles if you're lucky enough to sit at the bar.Expect a long wait, so don't arrive here starving.I personally like to order cold Udon noodles at this place because thats when you can really taste the freshness of the noodle. However, the dashi is light and mild in flavor, so in a hot broth you can still taste freshness."
7/24/2013,20130724,5,4.21,"Loved this place. My friend, Chris L. suggested this place and we came here for lunch and sat at the bar with a good view of the chef hand making the udon. It was such a treat to see the meticulous and elegant process.What was even better was tasting the udon. We ordered it two ways - udon in an uni cream sauce (prepared like pasta) and udon in a hot soup with seared duck. I preferred the uni cream pasta version because of how fulfilling it was with the huge amount of uni included. I've never seen so much uni in a dish and it was amazing. The soup preparation was good as well but I didn't care much for the duck as a pairing so I think I would go for something else next time.We also got a pork belly rice bowl which was so delicious. My friend also told me about the pork belly appetizer but they only served that at dinner so I'll have to make sure and go back for dinner next time I'm in town."
7/26/2013,20130726,4,4.21,"There's nothing like fresh noodles, any kind, all kinds. A little pricey, but you get a lot of noodles.The uni udon was disappointing because there was so much garlic!! I couldn't taste the uni, only garlic. What a shame.We also got a tempura shrimp udon, and that was good. We added a side of fishcakes, and to our surprise, that was deep fried too, which also is a little unfortunate."
7/28/2013,20130728,4,4.21,"I have been here about 7 times since the first day they opened for business on March 15. They have improved a lot compared to the first few times I visited in their first weeks of business. The menu has expanded quite a bit and service has gotten quicker and better.On my first visit, I tried the Kitsune Udon ($7.95) with a side of Kakiage (fried shrimp w/ thin strips of veggies - $2.50) and it was pretty good. My favorite was the Kakiage and dipping it in the soup with udon made it extra good.On my 2nd visit, and the past 5 times after that, I've been obsessed with their Cold Udon w/ Poached Egg ($8.25). I usually prefer my noodles in hot soup, but their cold udon is so light and flavorful with the cold broth they serve on the side. I specially love the tempura flakes & bonito flakes they add on top. It's so simple, yet so delicious that I often have cravings for it and find myself coming back to endure the long wait that they have now.I've had a few bites of their Signature udon dishes, such as the Miso Carbonara and the Mentai Squid Butter, but neither of those come close to my favorite Cold Udon. The cream sauces are a bit too rich to eat an entire bowl, for me at least, and they don't seem to have as much dimension in flavors. I'll still need to try the Uni Udon though, since that's a popular one as well.Service has improved quite a bit since the beginning stage. The wait for udon to be served used to be a solid 40 minutes to an hour, but now it is much faster. I'd say about 20 minutes. The servers are still sometimes forgetful of requests due to how busy it is, so you may need to ask at least 2 servers.The interior is elegant and simple, with the perfect lighting, not too dim and not too bright. The best part is the open kitchen where you can see them constantly making fresh udon by hand. When they are busy, it can get super crowded and loud inside. I wouldn't think this is a good place to eat for anyone who's claustrophobic, since everyone is sitting within 2 feet of each other. The bathrooms are SUPER NICE though!"
7/29/2013,20130729,4,4.21,"Freshly cut udon noodles all LIVE and done right in front of your presence, YES YES I AM A FAN!The wait on a Sunday night around 6pm was a little less than 30 minutes, which really isn't too bad. The sad part is, initially when passing by, we thought the line was for Daikokuya, but really, it was for Marugame Monzo. It looks like the game has shifted! Props to this new joint in town! It must be because of it's handmade and freshly cut noodles that creates such an amazing texture, sending every bite of perfection into your happy little mouths. Appetizer: Tuna Wrap - Highly recommend. Not sure why not many people order it but it was pretty friggin delicious. The plate is served DIY style, where you received raw mushed tuna chunks, shiso, cucumber, and condiments for you to wrap yourself. Personally I enjoyed the concept and liked the dish that much more because you get to add what you want to add. Main Course: Uni Creamy Udon: AMAZING! Although this dish definitely has more garlic taste than uni, I personally really enjoyed it. A little heavy due to the cream sauce, but highly enjoyable. They are also very generous with the uni and the udon portion enough for you to share.Kake Udon: Simple but scrumptious! Feeling a little plain, I wanted noodles and broth and this was exactly what I got. The soup was tempura soup based and the udons were incredibly chewy. It's sprinkled with tempura crumbs and I also added a tempura boiled egg to top it off. Honestly, if you are looking for just noodles and soup with no meat, this will do this trick. Overall, it was well worth the wait, and even if it was longer than 30 minutes, I would gladly wait again to try all the other awesome menu items they offer. I will probably opt for the curry udon and another specialty udon or rice bowl the nice time but this is definitely a must try!"
7/29/2013,20130729,4,4.2,"Totally wish this place wouldn't catch on, but now it's reaching Daikokuya level wait times. Le sigh. I wanted that tasty udon place for myself!Oroshi Soy Sauce Udon - It's your cold udon with bonito, some sort of fried tempura (can't really put my finger on what it is) and a sweet soy sauce. Overall a tasty dish but if you are hungry, you might want to opt for the double portion as it's not super filling.Mentai Squid butter - Holy crap this dish is rich! It's tasty but can be too rich for some people. If you're in the mood for a rich dish, this is a good bet. It has a great taste to it otherwise. Overall, the place is really clean, the servers are friendly and you do have a nice view of the people making the udon from scratch. We waited about 30-45 minutes on a Saturday night at around 8 PM. Well recommended if you can stomach the wait."
7/29/2013,20130729,5,4.21,"For some reason, I have a fascination with Japanese carbohydrates. Something about them sucks me in, whether its ramen noodles, sushi rice, dumpling skins or in this case udon noodles. The udon noodles at Marugame Monzo are, how do I say this, freaking bomb.The udon is made behind a glass in view of the restaurant diners and to the people who pass by outside. It's nice to see the work, effort and technique put into udon. As the food, Marugame has an extensive menu that includes udon in many ways; hot soup, cold soup, soupless and even the ever so popular italian fusion. They also have a good amount of appetizers and tempura options.For two, we started off with various tempura, which were really awesome, and then we ordered the oroshi soy sauce udon and the sea urchin cream udon. The oroshi udon is served with daikon, bonito and tempura bits with soy sauce, grated ginger and lemon juice on the side. We totally loved this dish, perfect for summer; it's refreshing, delicate and really highlights the house-made udon. The sea urchin cream udon caught me off guard. I'm not the biggest fan of cream sauces, but this dish worked for me. The sea urchin flavor was center stage and the udon itself was just perfect. The dish is a bit rich; it's not something I could eat every day. The restaurant fills up fast, especially on weekends, so either come early, or be prepared to wait (not as long as daikokuya though)Recommendation: Oroshi Soy Sauce Udon"
7/29/2013,20130729,5,4.21,"If you are going to eat Udon I can't imagine any better place to eat it than here at Marugame Monzo. They make the noodles fresh before your eyes. It's intriguing to watch the process from start to finish. I appreciate the texture of the fresh noodles. They taste clean, with a subtle almost unintelligible chew to them. The broths are delicate, but rich at the same time which showcases the masterful use of ingredients. You can have your choice of traditional broth style udon, cold udon or creamy fusion/pasta style. I was eyeing the creamy uni udon but i asked if this recipe was something they'd serve in japan and when the waitress said it isn't traditional i went with the duck udon. My girlfriend had the traditional japanese curry udon and we had the best of both worlds. I look forward to coming back and trying all the other fantastic flavors especially the uni."
7/30/2013,20130730,4,4.21,"We came this past Saturday night with a party of four and waited around 40-45 minutes. I think we sat down around 7:30 p.m. We decided with the sea urchin udon, the duck and grilled scallion udon, the beef udon, curry udon, tempura, and beef tataki. The sea urchin udon is very creamy and garlicky, and thus a little on the heavy side. They are really generous with the uni though. :) :) The broth in the duck udon is light and flavorful, and the grilled scallion is VERY good. The beef broth is similar to the duck, but I think the beef makes it sweeter. Finally, the broth in the curry is richer, stronger (much less subtle than the others). I personally liked the duck and curry the best. The tempura was fantastic as well, so the only downfall was the beef tataki. The beef was cut way too thick! It was also stringy, so that was really unpleasant to eat. I also didn't like biting into tiny peppercorn. I would not get it again. I don't know if this is possible (or even rude to ask!), but I also wish the noodles were cooked a little more al-dente. With all that said, I like this place as much as I liked Marukame in Hawaii."
7/31/2013,20130731,5,4.22,Holy shit.Dress light.It's hot as balls in this place.Best Udon in the city.Worst air conditioning.May have lines longer than Daikokuya and Lindsey Lohan soon.
7/31/2013,20130731,4,4.22,"If you feel like you need to warm your stomach with some awesome handmade noodles and great tasting broth, definitely check out this udon place.It has that japanese izakaya feel with bars in front of the kitchen where chefs openly shows the process of making the udon noodles. They have variety of udons to choose from - traditional udon to fusion style like creamy uni udon or mentai squid udon, which reminds me of creamy pasta with thicker noodle. Shrimp Udon - great and clean after-tasting broth with 2 shrimp tempuras on a sideUni Cream Udon - garlic cream butter broth (though thicker than broth, almost like a pasta sauce) with mixture of uni. Buta Kakuni (braised pork) - I didn't really like this one because each pork piece had about 80% of fat. Next time I wanna try Mentai Squid and Curry udon. They have great selection of alcoholic beverages as well as plenty of appetizers. Wait can be pretty long - 2 of us waited for about 40 min from 8pm on a weekday. I could picture how crowded this place can be on a weekend evening. Good thing is people eat and leave in a quick manner. Street parking is always a disaster at Little tokyo so plan to park in the public garage."
7/31/2013,20130731,5,4.22,Handmade udon noodles!!! Great stuff.Ordered the Shrimp tempura udon...can't say enough about it. Definitely worth the $11.95.You can actually watch them make the noodles right in front of you.
7/31/2013,20130731,4,4.22,"This new udon place is A-OK!! All of their udon is handmade fresh. The udon texture is chewy but not doughy. There are plenty of soup choices to go with your udon or you can have it served cold. I really my curry udon which comes with the pork belly. The rice that comes with the pork belly is delicious, light in flavor but very tasty. Also, their regular simple udon is also very nice and light if you don't want a heavy soup base. The prices are pretty reasonable. Definitely will be back."
8/1/2013,20130801,5,4.22,"I'm guilty--very guilty. I usually love to divulge my favorite spots here on Yelp; but I've been keeping this a personal secret of mine for as long as I could. Monzo is my drug provider, I was basically coming here on a weekly basis for a while. I guess the cat's out of the bag, because the wait almost rivals that of Daikokuya next door! I love the taste and texture of the udon noodle; and while occasionally I do appreciate the simplicity and purity of the broth typically found in a bowl of udon, where is the punch, pizzazz, and MEAT?? Monzo brings it, and it brings it oh so good. It's so good that I've barely been able to move away from my favorite dishes here. Here are the highlights of some of my favorite dishes:- Sliced Pork Belly Don. Yes, this isn't even a udon dish. It's a small side bowl of thinly sliced pork belly grilled over a smoky Japanese charcoal grill much like the kind you find at a good yakkitori place. It's served simply with over a small bowl of rice and served with this divine savory scallion-sesame-and some hidden magic sauce. I really wish they served a full sized bowl version of this. I cannot get enough of it!- Uni Cream Udon. Wow the sauce again shines here. Thick, creamy, and filled with generous chunks of udon. The udon speaks volume for itself, but the sauce is really what brings it home. Don't miss out on this. Here's my dirty little secret: Order an extra bowl of rice and pour all your extra sauce into the rice. Mash it up and extend that oh-so-dam-goodness just a bit longer. - Duck Nanban Udon. This is more of a traditional soup and udon dish. Lovely lovely balance on that soup. The classic udon broth is really heightened by that slightly gamey flavor of some duck broth. The slice of duck breasts are also smoked yakkitori style and adds a wonderful smoky flavor to the broth and the noodles itself. This is the perfect simple yet complex soup dish to have a cold rainy day. It really is. And very unlike anything else I've had around town."
8/1/2013,20130801,2,4.21,"Yes they make their own udon noodles, it was fresh I'll give them that. Ordered the off the menu Uni special udon. Was really disappointed, the uni honestly tasted better raw in my opinion. The first few bits were good but then the creaminess of the white sauce was way to overpowering of the uni taste. My other friend got the cold udon which looks really good so might try that next time and my sister's regular udon soup was pretty good. So I think I just ordered the wrong item. Server was kinda rushing us to order, didn't like that. Then she told our table we cant' share udons...umm how is it your business how we eat our udons..so that kind of ticked us off. It's not like we didnt order other stuff too so don't know what her problem was. Since the table next to us was sharing....Kind of effy if I would go back to try something else. Needs some convincing... The bathroom was gorgeous though...there was relaxing music in the bathroom, ac, very nice Japanese atmosphere, nice toliet haha, it was a one staler but very nicee!"
8/2/2013,20130802,4,4.21,"Came in right before lunch service ended, but still got seats.Had the Creamy Tomato Seafood udon and liked it very much. Friends had the creamy uni udon that's so popular, weren't that impressed by it.Pricey place for the udon, although it was good."
8/5/2013,20130805,5,4.21,"i love japanese food. so of course my review for marugame monzo will be good. They had make their own noodles btw. I came here for lunch and it was busy and packed but i was seated fairly quickly. Im thinking since everyones on their lunch breaks everyone has to eat quickly. i heard great things about their beef tataki, which i wanted to try but its unfortunately only on their dinner menu. I tried their beef don, pork don, squid roe udon, and uni udon. I personally liked the pork don way better than the beef don only because the beef tasted no different than the yoshinoya beef bowl haha..and as for the two specialty udons i got, they were very delicious. I am a slut for uni. It is one of my favorite things to eat so the uni udon was so good!! HOWEVER, i hate to admit.....after eating half of it i couldnt eat anymore. It was too creamy and started to get too heavy for me..if only they had a smaller size i couldve definitely finished it all and enjoyed it :) as for the squid roe udon.....wow so good!!! Especially when you get a spoon of the squid roe and mix it into your pork don and eat it!!! Haha The restaurants a small place right next to daikokuya. if you havent been here you must!!"
8/7/2013,20130807,4,4.21,"With ramen joints popping up everywhere in Little Tokyo, I wanted something different, so I decided that I would check out the new udon spot next to Daikokuya. Udon noodles are one of my favorite noodles, so I was pretty ecstatic to check out this new spot that makes their udon noodles in house. You can even see the cooks making the noodles through the glass windows separating the kitchen from the dining area.Food:1) We ordered the same Udon bowls, but with different meats: lamb, and pork. Both types of meat were surprisingly very tender. I was surprised because the meat in the udon I've tried at other spots were very overcooked. I'd have to say that this place was on the pricier side for udon, but I would say it's worth it for me because the udon noodles were hand made in house and the broth was solid.yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…2) Tempura Soft Boiled Egg was awesome! It was the first time trying it and it was surprisingly delicious. I love the tempura batter with the oozing yolk.yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…Service:Very efficient, respectful, and friendly."
8/7/2013,20130807,4,4.21,Great hand-made udon. It is just like some of the best udon places in Japan. The fried chicken is super succulent and the soft boiled egg tempura is perfectly done. The pork belly rice bowl is small but super good - our favorite of the place. Love the chewy texture of the udon. The Uni Udon is an usual twist of East meets West; but is super delicious.
8/7/2013,20130807,3,4.21,"So many ramen places in J-town now.Got the hot uni ramen and let's just say it's pretty heavy and maybe not worth the calories..made with lots of milk/cream and garlic (tons of it)...pretty tasty but not digging the creamy texture. It's like broth you get when you order mussels at a new american/italian restaurant, except it's creamy. I'm so used to eating fresh uni sushi style that it was a little weird for me to have it warm in noodles... (and I am totally one to try new things). Also there's nothing else in the noodles except for uni. The noodles itself are thicker than the usual thin ramen noodles and freshly made. The noodles are the redeeming factor in this dish.Tried the pork belly rice bowl as well. As simple as the dish looks, the pork belly with chopped green onions in a bowl of rice and clear sauce (flavored oil?) is pretty good. Pork belly is pretty overrated these days but Monzo's is thinly sliced, tender and not crazily soaked in some kind of dark sauce. If you don't want to opt for ramen, I'd recommend this dish. It is pretty small so don't expect a bigger donburi type bowl.Fried chicken- while perfectly fried and crispy, there isn't much flavor to it.Overall not bad, but maybe not my personal preference of ramen. I'll try ordering something else next time. I still like Daikokoya if you want to go all the way for the real deal. Shen sen gumi if you want something lighter."
8/8/2013,20130808,4,4.2,"Something about a restaurant with a bit open-ish kitchen to show you all their dirty secrets. Nothing dirty here, also not quite open since all the chefs worked from within a giant hamster cage. Ohh...I love hamsters...memoriess...Smack next to Daikokuya which is a 5 star ramen place in my book, Marugame Monzo actually packs many of their dishes with flavor as well. After 2 visits here, I've come to appreciate what a nice buttery dish does, and what a traditional bowl of udon does for you. It's all fresh, the udon being rolled and cut from within that hamster cage is the great beauty of this place.-=-Cabonara Udon-=- Super flavor, super cheese. Maybe a bit too distracting from the freshness of the udon. For every bite of this, I took the sauce apart in my head mentally trying to see where I've had this before and how I can make it at home. It was all familiar in my head. Cabonara Udon falls under the specialty menu which is kinda like the not-so-plain udon. If you like cheesey, go for it. Otherwise, share this plate so you can sample another.-=-Squid Butter Udon-=- This was one that was more unique and probably nothing I can replicate. The amount of butter in this dish is staggering and the squid component of this sauce (pink balls in there?) was where I drew the uniqueness. The pink color will also throw you off, because at first bite you will be screaming ""butter!""-=-Kake Udon-=- Specialness and uniqueness aside...this is what you should be getting. Add whatever you want on top like egg or crunchy tempura. I felt with the Kake Udon, I was able to taste and feel the udon in its natural habitat (seems that what they specialize in here, no?). Someone asked me what I felt the difference was between fresh udon and store-bought udon, and what I come up with was that with fresh udon, there's a bit of hardness in the middle of every noodle that when you bite into it, it will gush into flavor. There's a chewiness here that cannot be replicated with store-bought udon. Yep, that's me the texture snob...now you can't unremember it!"
8/9/2013,20130809,5,4.21,"Udon, originally Japanese, but it's become pretty standard in a lot of Korean food as well. Growing up, I didn't enjoy it very much. Just thought it was really bland.When I saw pictures of this place, I thought it looked good. Had dinner with two friends. The seared meat appetizer is very good. One of the better appetizers I've had in awhile. The relish or whatever on top is good, plus it has red peppercorn, gives it a nice kick.I got the Miso Carbonara. Really good, but a little rich. I don't mind rich, but it is difficult for some people to eat. I had some of my friend's Creamy Uni Udon, and it was pretty amazing too but, again, very rich. Shrimp tempura is good too. I wish they had a sauce for it or something though."
8/10/2013,20130810,4,4.21,"Wanted to go to Daikokuya initially, but too many people waiting out there (as usual) so decided to try out the new udon place right next to it instead ;)My friend and I peeked inside and we were immediately attracted by the huge glass window that shows the cooks rolling and making udon from scratch. I really like it as it shows that they made all their udon from fresh. Also don't worry if you are not sitting at the bar, as you can still see the cooks making noodles very clearly even from a distance. The lunch menu has a great variety of udon, both hot, cold and some special udon. We ordered the lunch special, which is any kind of udon with a small rice bowl. We ordered a double portion of curry udon and the pork belly rice bowl. The pork belly rice bowl came first and it was small, so expect it more to be a side than a regular-sized rice bowl. The pork belly slices were cut very thinly and slender, which I like because it's not too fatty. Also I like that they put black pepper and green onions to spice the pork belly, so just eating the rice is very flavorful and tastes delicious;) Curry Udon (with double portion): It was HUGE. Three people can probably share a double portion if you don't have a huge appetite. The curry udon also comes with pork belly and green onions. I didn't find it particularly special; the noodles are very fresh and chewy. However, the broth isn't particularly flavorful. I would recommend getting a cold udon (I saw the guy next to me ordering one and it looked a lot better than ours) or other udon to really bring out the flavor of the noodles. I did enjoy the noodles very much though :)Will definitely come back again and try out all the other udons that looked very attractive! Especially the cold udon ;)"
8/11/2013,20130811,5,4.21,"why stand in line at Daikokuya when you can go next door and have freshly made udon? it's not ramen for sure but the freshly made udon is so satisfying! what a lovely dark interior to dine in. we tried a variety from the clear broth with duck, to the creamy uni sauce that that everyone raves about. impressed with how much uni they actually put in this bowl! Yummy! my fav was the cod roe with squid butter."
8/12/2013,20130812,5,4.22,"Great place for udon in Little Tokyo! House-made udon noodles?!? I'm sold! :)GREAT alternative to the ridiculous line that you always see at Daikokuya next door.This place serves several types of udon noodles. You can get the traditional dishes, or something more creamy and rich. They also have appetizers (which I still have yet to try!).FOOD:*Shrimp Tempura Udon: Had to try a classic, traditional dish on my first visit here. I loved the noodles, the broth, and the tempura! Not too salty, texture of the noodle was just right, and loved the simpleness of this dish.Definitely coming back to try the other udon dishes!"
8/12/2013,20130812,2,4.2,"This place sucks, just seated other people before us after we were waiting for 45 minutes with 2 kids. Annoying"
8/13/2013,20130813,2,4.19,"Nice noodles. Boring soup. And what is with the dry 2x4s of pork belly? Sanuki No Sato, you have nothing to fear."
8/15/2013,20130815,4,4.19,I'm not normally a huge fan of udon noodles but I really enjoyed this place! I got the beef tataki and clams as appetizers and they were both really good. For udon I got the squid butter roe udon and I was afraid it was going to be too buttery but it wasn't at all! I think the best part of the udon is the perfect chewy texture of the udon noodles. Only thing that's unfortunate about this place is that it is so small! But I guess most restaurants in Little Tokyo are like this.
8/16/2013,20130816,5,4.2,"One of the newest establishments in the DTLA area. Ironically it's also right next to Daikokuya, a ramen establishment. Though don't get it twisted, ramen and udon are totally different!CURRY UDON ($9.50)- udon in a Japanese curry base with slices of pork belly- typical thick Japanese curry marinating the fresh udon- enjoyed every bite- LOTS of meat which made the dish even more enjoyable- quite satisfying!UNI UDON (~$15)- off the menu- very creamy from all the uni- bites of uni here and there but wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be- Udon cooked perfectly- definitely recommend for any uni loverTEMPURA FRIED EGG ($1.50)- looks beautiful but tastes mediocre- the egg was perfectly soft-boiled though- I wish the egg was a bit seasoned before it was fried in tempura to give it more flavor- probably not worth the $1.50; you can almost get a whole dozen of eggs with that priceSERVICE: Friendly waiters. They refill the water and clear the plates accordingly. The food is also ready is a reasonable amount of time. When my friends and I tried to eat the Frances Donut (Cronut) from Frances Bakery they came by and told us they don't allow you to eat any outside food or drink while dining inside. ENVIRONMENT: relatively small as is most Little Tokyo restaurants. The place has nice modern decor. There is a bar area to watch the chefs cut the udon and prepare the food. Otherwise there is regular tables which may be a little too close to one another. The place can get quite loud if it's packed but it definitely gets hot!Overall, great place to get Udon. I most definitely will be coming here more often during the winter time. The food is solid and there is a wide variety of food that something is bound to suit everyone. The only thing I would forewarn is that the udon is served really hot so you might start sweating as you eat. Hopefully though the natural sweat won't make your udon too salty. Come with an appetite and prepare yourself for one of the most softest and chewiest udon ever!"
8/16/2013,20130816,4,4.19,"Have returned several times for lunch. Really, only the udon noodles themselves are five star; so I have to lower my initial rating. The broth on the cold soups seems more special than the hot, but both are very fine. More than one of the servers seem disinterested and vibe job dissatisfaction. Service on the whole is somewhat subpar notwithstanding that the waitstaff takes orders on tablet computers."
8/17/2013,20130817,4,4.19,"When one door closes, another one opens. We were planning to eat at Daikokuya. It was an early lunch, borderline breakfast time, so I didn't expect there to be much of a wait. Of course Daikokuya already had hordes of people waiting outside. While regrouping to think of an alternative place to eat at, we noticed an unfamiliar sign where Fat Spoon once was. We were totally excited to see that it was a brand spanking new udon place, noodles made on the premises to boot!Ebi Ten Udon -- A rather large, piping hot bowl of freshly made udon in a simple, yet flavorful broth. Every sip of their house-made broth was so crisp and refreshing. The noodles, made from Japanese wheat, were very much cooked to perfection. Their noodles are chewy and slightly denser which can be attributed to all the love they put into making the noodles by hand. The broth is also topped with tempura crumbs and green onions which gives the soup a crunchy texture. You get two crispy ebi served on the side. The tempura batter was portioned perfectly where it wasn't overly done and you could still taste the flavor of sweet shrimp. Pork Belly Don -- Very simply done. Thin slices of salty pork belly sitting atop a bed of rice, garnished with a hearty portion of green onions. They torched the meat right then and served it immediately after. The pork belly wasn't anything spectacular in terms of flavor but the meat quality seemed to be top notch.They've kept the sleek decor of Fat Spoon and added glass walls to enclose a part of their kitchen where the noodles are made. Rightfully so. I wouldn't want a strand of past customer's hair in my noodles!Oishii!"
8/17/2013,20130817,5,4.2,"How come I've never heard of this place until recently? To start off with, I'd have to say this was by far the best udon place I've had in Los Angeles. It's located right next to the crazy busy Daikokuya and frankly I don't understand why this place is not the ones with the lines. I guess it's one of those hidden gems of Little Tokyo that hopefully will stay hidden.Okay, you might ask, what is so special about this place? It's their star, udon. They are made fresh from scratch right there in front of you and believe me, it makes a HUGE difference. I knew coming in that I had to try the star of the restaurant, the Creamy Sea Urchin (Uni) Udon. It was even better than what I had hoped. The idea of a creamy uni udon sounded like having waygu beef mixed with fatty toro, rich meets richer. All I can say is you have to taste it for yourself to know what I'm talking about. The cream sauce is rich, but not salty. There's enough uni here to fill maybe 2-3 orders full. My wife got the Duck Udon which was equally sophisticated and classic. You'd think duck and udon doesn't go together but I'd say it works very well in its own way. My only recommendation is if you are going to try a lighter clear broth soup from your family or friend, do it before you dig into your rich cream udon. Once you go creamy, you can't taste anything else.Overall, I'd give this place A+++++ for making the best udon in Los Angeles. I'll be back for sure."
8/17/2013,20130817,4,4.2,"After hearing much hype about this restaurant, I finally gave this new udon restaurant in Little Tokyo a try. I recently returned from an amazing culinary trip to Japan, so I was craving some traditional udon, so I went for the traditional udon soup. The texture and size of the handmade noodles were delicious, as was the broth! I hope to return sometime to try some of their more modern fusion dishes."
8/18/2013,20130818,5,4.2,"Saturday night, bit of a wait. No biggie. My date promised that it would be worth the wait, and oh boy. Was it EVER.He raved about the sea urchin udon, but wanted to try something different. However, the remembrance of aforesaid dish was, alas, far too strong. And so he ordered it again, as I followed suit. I added tempura pumpkin. I just knew it'd go well.The sea urchin udon had a creamy sauce, plus big gobs of... well, sea urchin guts, I guess. Something orange-y and delicious. And that delectably chewy udon... *swoon* It was the best bowl of udon I've ever had. YUM.Totally worth the wait. Yes."
8/18/2013,20130818,4,4.2,"I have been here twice I ll keep it simple , they make the udon on site and also have wonderful tapas in the dinner menu , I really liked the deep fried egg as a side dish really soft And golden yolk, udon cooked to perfection and simply great with whatever taste you chose, I really like the uni and mentakio Japanese pasta style udon, the scallop capriccio was so soft fresh and not fishy texture was butter . The portion is to excessive for one person so I always share one plate. The food has been constantly good."
8/19/2013,20130819,2,4.19,"Marugame Monzo is known for its hand cut udon noodles. It's also located next door to Daikokuya, so you'd think, ""Great! Maybe if I'm craving ramen, but Daikokuya's line is too long, I can just hop on over to Marugame for some udon instead!"" WRONG. Marugame Monzo's line is just as long and daunting. Freakin' L.A. hype. The udon is pretty good. It's fresh, smooth, and firm. Their popular uni udon is tasty, but a bit too buttery. Taking the noodles home and reheating them the next day is pure disaster. They don't keep well at all. If you're feeling extra hungry, try some of their appetizers, especially the braised pork belly.The set up of the restaurant needs work. It's narrow, crowded, poorly lit, and worst of all, HOT. I think the A.C. must be broken because it feels like it's 80 degrees in there. Not only that, but they let waiting customers stand inside the restaurant near where seated customers are eating. Talk about pressure! I'd hate to be one of those tables near where the crowd is hungrily eyeing your food...All this aside, the thing about Marugame that bugs me is that they have no sense of customer service! I brought four friends to dine here on a Sunday night. We put our reservation down at 6:45 PM and had about eight tables ahead of us. We went to the bar next door to grab a beer while waiting, checked back after an hour, and saw that there was only one more table ahead of us. We closed our bar tab and headed over to Marugame...only to see that our name been crossed off...I speak to one of the servers (who later said she was actually the manager?) and she said they had called our table, but we weren't there. So I tell her, ""Okay, but we're here now."" We couldn't have missed our table call by more than ten minutes. This lady would not budge. She kept telling us to put our names down again at the end of the list (at least 10 tables had put their reservation down after ours)! First of all, there was no sign nor anyone explaining to us that if you weren't present when your table is called, it would be given away. A little courtesy warning would have been nice? Not to mention, did they expect us to just idle inside/outside their restaurant for an entire hour? Since they seem to be raking in all this money from the crowd that lines up to eat there, they should at least invest in pagers or something? Or maybe that good old fashioned numbered ticket system... I think what insulted me the most was that although we stated we had already waited an hour, she kept telling us to put our names on the list again, like it wasn't a big deal to wait ANOTHER hour to dine there. You've got to be kidding me. From the bad taste in my mouth that they left, I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon. They need to invest in an A.C. and a hostess."
8/19/2013,20130819,5,4.19,"If I could give Monzo 6 stars, I would. With the hundreds of existing ramen houses, it's a breath of fresh air to see a Japanese noodle house that isn't ramen. Instead, hand tossed, hand pressed and hand cut udon. Monzo is still working out their growing pains, as this place is still quite new. The service staff are very attentive once you get seated, but as someone else has mentioned, the seating procedures could be more seamless. But once you do get your seat, the food makes up for it ten fold. The space is clean, tight and narrow - like most of the other places in this area. Towards the back, the kitchen is open view, through a big glass wall you can watch the chefs make fresh udon.I highly recommend the Duck Udon over the Uni Udon. It's a simple dish, with complex robust flavors. Meaty pieces of soft juicy duck, udon, and a delicious clear broth. It's delicious and easy to finish. The Uni Udon is much heavier, as it is a cream sauce. Delicious all the way through but way too heavy to stomach in one sitting. Pieces of uni on top, broth-like cream sauce with udon. This Pork Belly Don is like on other pork belly I've ever had. They hand sear the belly so you get the piping hot fired taste, over warm fragrant rice. Again, simple and savory. The Soft Boiled Egg also gets an honorable mention. The soft boiled eggs at Japanese places are pretty good as it is. Well Monzo does it just a little different and it's amazing. I think they deep fry it, as it comes cooked on the outside with a thin layer of batter and half runny on the inside. Their precision in craft, simple but delicious flavors and attention to detail earns them a solid 5 stars. I could eat here everyday."

The sauce is creamy and goes well with the udon. It's pretty much eating spaghetti dishes but substituting spaghetti with udon noodles+Handmade udon+Can watch the chefs make handmade udon through glass wall.-When you order the traditional udons, the udon noodles are a bit tough and not moist enough making it rather dry. Maybe that's how real handmade udon is supposed to taste like but I did not like it.-I tried my boyfriend's kakuni (braised pork belly udon) and I did not care for it. The broth is a bit on the weaker side for traditional udons. -Long wait. Especially when our stupid waiter overestimated the wait to us and told us an hour. We came back in 30 minutes and our table was already given away. Way to waste our time! Had to go back in line again -___- -Didn't really taste the uni in the uni cream sauce. Might as well order miso carbonara since it taste similar and cheaper!-Signature dishes like uni udon and miso carbonara is REALLY heavy. I mean it's good but you'll feel slightly overwhelmed at the end of the meal.I wouldn't go to Marugame Monzo again unless my friends want to go.

I ordered the Gratin de Udon which was baked in high heat and was rather watery for a gratin, but the cream & cheese infused into the chicken broth with slivered bulb onion was quite rich & flavourful. The onion was a good slightly acidic & funky offset to the rich dairy ingredients. Because the cream/cheese sauce is rather rich and cloying, I decided to order Sake (sah keh) although it was 11:30am. I decided on the Dassai 50 Daiginjo which has a rich Japanese pear flavour & light aroma, but does have a slightly creamy undertone with a light bitterness as a finish. It was a good palate cleanser in between bites so that I could finish the dairy rich Gratin. The handmade Udon certainly adds a fine touch by having more Koshi (which for pasta means elasticity, spring, flexibility) and Nebari (glutinousness in the pasta) as well as Hagotae (al dente). All hallmarks of high quality in Udon that can not be duplicated by machine. Buy machine-made Udon, and cook it at home, and you'll find out how superior Tezukuri (hand-made) can be. Tsurugame Monzo- is one of the very few Japanese restaurants in the Los Angeles area which creates handcrafted Udon. I deeply appreciate the energy, effort, & expertise in making these perfect noodles. Marugame may be introducing us to a new version of ""poverty food"" in that one can have something as exotic or sophisticated as alta cucina Italiana but not break the bank. My dish was $11.95, and it was so filling & satisfying that that was all that was needed. Many of us are still suffering from the Great Recession, and going to Drago Centro or Piccolo is not an option. Another wave of poverty food became a necessity in Japan during and in the years right after World War II. War time shortages of food made people very inventive to create tasty food that was extremely cheap to make: Yakisoba or chow mein style noodles flavoured with Japanese worchester sauce, cabbage, green onions, Beni Sho-ga (red pickled ginger), Ao Nori (powdered green seaweed) and sauteed.Okonomi Yaki was a savory pancake with cabbage, green onions, Ao Nori, Sakura Ebi (dried miniature shrimp), sometimes Beni Sho-ga or Katsuo Bushi (dried bonito flakes) and drizzled with Japanese Worcheshire. Now Marugame Monzo seems to be making an updated more avant-garde version of more humble foods and spinning them into something chic. Of course, one can order the more traditional style Udon with a light Sho-yu (soy sauce) broth with many permutations in added ingredients. There are side dishes that can be ordered such as mixed Tempura with vegetables & shrimp or Shishamo (smelt), many full of roe, fried in Tempura batter. However, the emphasis at Marugame Monzo is the Udon. The Tempura is acceptable, but their heart doesn't seem to be in it. I find the Tempura at Otomi~san on First Street east of Soto to be far more representative of fine Tempura technique.Finally we have a Udon restaurant that is a fine competitor to Ra-men, the other Japanese noodle universe. Perhaps if we are lucky, in a few more years we will witness the flowering of the third Japanese noodle universe: Soba (buckwheat noodles). You can sample handmade Soba in Gardena at Otafuku. The Kikouchi & Seiro- are both excellent doppelgaenger which find their origins in the same Soba grain."
8/20/2013,20130820,5,4.18,"Wow. A friend suggested this place and we went to try. The BEST udon noodles I have had in years. Went with the cold Ikura udon. Beautifully presented and was fantastic. Service was quick, from order to being served in just a few minutes. Next door to the overrated and overcrowded Daikokuya. Do yourself a favor and try here."
8/20/2013,20130820,4,4.18,"It's a nice dark setting. Typical small restaurant in LA. I've only had the Uni Udon and the Beef Tataki.Beef Tataki (4/5)- great presentation, tastes good, but definitely not the best. It had a parsley or parsley-like herb in it that I am not a fan of.Uni Udon - (4/5) I liked it. Though I am not a fan of rich and creamy things but this dish is very tasty. It's different than the regular soup udon. This is more of a pasta dish with a creamy flavorful sauce that is not too thick. Very subtle flavors of uni, so if you're not a huge fan then this might be tolerable for you. Noodles are just right, soft and a little chewy to my liking.If I am in the area, I will definitely go here again and try the other dishes. Not a type of place I'd go out of my way to eat."

8/21/2013,20130821,5,4.18,"so i went to marugame monzo again today..i ordered the mentai squid butter udon, miso carbonara udon, pork belly don, and the beef tataki..This place is NEVER a disappointment!!!The mentai squid butter was perfect once again. The pork belly was perfect as well, and even more delicious if you mix some of the mentai squid butter sauce and the chili pepper into the rice!! I tried the miso carbonara udon for the first time today. It basically tasted like pasta w bacon pieces in it but it was also so good!! Surprised that i didn't get the uni udon since i love uni so much? Yeah well, the uni udon IS delicious but after a few bites, it definitely gets a little too creamy and heavy..As for the beef tataki........UGH so BOMB..I sat in front of the chef and i saw them constantly make the beef tataki dish..its definitely a hit and no wonder it is!! You MUST try it!!"
8/22/2013,20130822,5,4.18,"Yummy Uni Udon Goodness!!! Try saying that a few times in succession. But you would as you plow through the bowl of Uni and Udon. It was a UNI with a side of noodles and buttery flavorful broth. I swear I thought it was a tiny portion, until the uni and udon never stopped even as my broth was dwindling. :( Maybe just an extra bowl of broth to go with my udon? I have to have the soup-uni-udon ratio with every bite!Did I mention HANDMADE UNI? There's a guy (I swear, he must feel like he's in a fishbowl). People watch him make udon noodles from scratch. He rolls out the dough, kneads it until it's pliant, winds it against a stick, then brings out the mandolin? No, that's not the word - It's the thingy-ma-bob that slices the noodles. Gaaaaaaaaaah words escape me. It's all because of the buttery-uni-madness they have here.My companion had the buttery squid udon - again, the name escapes me - AH,ha!!! It's the mentai squid butter. I should really start taking notes as I go. It was so delicious - squid goodness galore. If you're a squid lover - this is the bowl of Noodles for you. A friend of mine suggested next time, ordering a bowl of squid udon and combining it with the uni. We also shared the pork belly appetizer. HOLY BUTTERY (notice that's the theme) awesomeness. YOU MUST TRY IT. that's all I can say. Words cannot describe the awesomeness of the pork belly. The fat-to-meat ratio was perfect and it just dissolves in your mouth. Ok - so the greeting service kinda sucked. But it doesn't matter. I could careless, the food was so yummy! We had to flag a wait staff to let them know we were waiting for a table because there were plenty at 5:30 pm on a weekday. The people ahead of us were a table of seven and they weren't all here yet. They won't sit you here until your entire party has arrived. After being seated, it was pretty smooth sailing with awesome service. Some tips - parking can be a bit hectic, due to Daikokuya, Suehiro Cafe, Chop Suey just around the corner and the Little Toyko Plaza across the street.You can sit at a table - but be aware you'll get to know your neighbors really well. We had the cutest lil one sitting next to us. He did chastised by the waitress, who doesn't speak English well, that the spice jar was ""Not a TOY!"". eeps.Early evenings and weekdays seem to be calmer than weekends."
8/23/2013,20130823,2,4.17,"Hmm...totally overrated, don't y'all think???I was so excited to find a place that served the tempera soft-boiled egg with udon! Sadly, the tempera was a huge disappointment because the batter was overly thick on the shrimp, thin and too soft on the egg, and it came out cold! So inconsistent! Definitely not worth your money to get the egg or extra tempura.Don't fall for the extra large bowl option because you only get more noodles and not more stuff. The noodles are too thick and hard compared to udon served at other places. By the time I got through half of my regular sized bowl, I was tired of eating it. I also tried the uni udon since it seemed to be their specialty. This tasted just like pasta with alfredo sauce with some uni in it. It was good, but I didn't come here to eat alfredo pasta...sigh"
8/24/2013,20130824,2,4.16,"This isn't udon. A variation in which udon type noodles served in creamy, fatty sauce, making it closer to actual Italian Pasta? Yes. The old comfort food of Japan served with bonito broth with various toppings and what not? Not really. It's an odd fusion of cuisine that works sometimes, but doesn't really work all too well in the end. Not to mention the fact that the dishes here are overpriced by at least a buck or three. But the udon noodles never really worked well as pasta surrogate. The udon noodle (not here, but in general) is soft, slippery, and non absorbent when it comes to sauces. That's why it works quite well in broth, and in some yaki dishes, of which I'm not a big fan of either. Strike one.Oh, and stay the far away from their Onigiri. Dusting the onigiri with umeboshi powder is 100% NOT UMEBOSHI ONIGIRI. That's more of a ume flavored onigiri. Strike two.I may have to try other dishes later, but right now.... I'm not quite that hip into this place. Again, overpriced for a fusion cuisine that unfortunately mixes in weaknesses of the parts of the cuisine so it's never quite jives right, and misleading menu items.If memory serves me right, this place didn't have Nabe udon... Strike Three.Bah humbug."

8/24/2013,20130824,4,4.15,"I really like this place. Authentic as it gets here in the States. They have a craftsman making the noodles practically from scratch in the front of the kitchen, behind glass. You can truly appreciate the dedication to a quality meal and experience. I take my Japanese colleagues here for a taste of home."
8/25/2013,20130825,4,4.15,"The ramen craze is hopefully over. I didn't care for it too much anyways and was happy to see something close to Daikokuya open up since I got sick of that scene. Personally, I'd rather have udon or soba than ramen any day. Ramen tends to me heavy and way salty for my taste.Housemade noodles aren't as common too see. I was glad to see a place like Marugame Monzo open up in Little Tokyo. We had dinner here on a weekday and were seated right in front of the kitchen as they were making new batches of housemade noodles. Housemade noodles is entertaining to see and a skill hopefully passed on. I ordered a tempura udon. The udon was nice and chewy and the tempura broth is light and not overpowering. Along with the udon, I ordered tempura soft yolk egg which was delicious. I also had a beef don which was great too. Personally, I could eat this every day. Service here was okay. I'm looking forward to come back to try the udon pasta dishes."

8/25/2013,20130825,5,4.16,"Spectacular! I really can't vouch for the authenticity of this cuisine, proficient as I am with all sorts of sushi, curry, and traditional udon, but I can say that the flavor, service, and overall experience are exceptional. There were five of us this time and even though we arrived before the restaurant opened, there was already a line, and for good reason. It opened on the dot and we were promptly seated. Initial impression is of a minimalist yet cozy place. Being able to observe the udon being made is awesome, actually one of the coolest things I've experienced culinarily. The food is unlike anything I've tried before. I've had udon many times, but never in these renditions nor of this quality. The noodles were very thick and heavy and definitely chewier and firmer in the middle than udon I've had before. I absolutely enjoyed the texture, it's everything you can possibly love about a noodle. Luckily, I got to sample everyone's dish (except my husband's, that darn meat eater) and all were incredible. He was, however, in love with his miso carbonara udon and foolishly proclaimed that he can eat eight bowls of the stuff. The portions are big, so probably not. The squid mentai butter was insanely good in flavor and texture and if you love uni, then you'll go nuts for their uni udon. It's a secret menu item and very worth asking for. The serving of uni is generous, to say the least and the cream sauce is permeated with a sweet, salty, oceanic flavor so particular to uni. My friend had the tomato seafood udon which I found to be least exciting, but it was still delicious. I got the plum shiso bukkake cold udon and it was flavorful and refreshing. But that uni made its way around the table and was officially the favorite. Incidentally, I also found out today exactly what bukkake means, it's not a pretty thing to look at. So please try this place, but don't expect the typical udon with a fish ball and shrimp tempura on top. This food is different, but in a good way. Again, I have no clue if this is a new invention or if Japanese cuisine has been making babies with Italy for a while, but I do think that the fusion is very good. This has made it to my top 10, possibly even top 5 LA restaurants. To make things even better, it's a few doors away from fugetsu-do!"

It brings in the crowd. Thankfully our wait for a table of two was about 20 minutes or so. After a long work week, my friend and I decided to grab a drink at Far Bar just 4 stores down from Marugame, while we wait for our table.There's so many different ways to have your udon prepared here. The traditional noodle soup, cream sauce like Italian style, or dry. I decided to go with the Seafood Tomato base. It was AH-Mazing! It wasn't too salty, or heavy. There were scallops, crabs, and shrimp with noodles.Udon noodles fills you up fast, so I wasn't able to finish all of my food. My friend had the Uni noodles. It was also really good. Never had uni cooked, since it's such a delicate item to cook, it's usually fresh.Service was decent. ladies were very busy, but once we ordered the food came within 10 mins.

Also ordered fried egg n cod roe n but were good as well. Make sure u request to sit at the bar cuz u can see how they make  the udon from scratch.
8/28/2013,20130828,5,4.17,"Been too this place a few times for lunch and I absolutely love it! you can sit at the bar where you can see the master udon makers make what else? UDON! I love how they have a variety of choices you can choose from such as... Cold Udon, Hot Udon, Carbonara Udon, Bukkake Udon....thats not what you think! haha you can also have a combo with a donburi which is a rice bowl for $3-4 more. They also have Onigri there as a little appetizer.Services is friendly, no wait on weekdays and weekends the line is just as long as the neighbor Daikuya. One time i went with my boyfriend they open at 11am we got there at 11:15 we waited 30mins! Makes me wonder if there were people already waiting before they actually opened!The udon is hard and not mushy and the soup base is flavorful and not heavy or greasy.I love this place! Parking is a problem because it's little toyko there are lots you have to pay at and street parking."
8/29/2013,20130829,4,4.17,"Finally, there are more choices in Little Tokyo that represents authentic Japanese flavor. Not the typical Ramen/Teriyaki/Sushi.I was lucky that I came right before the rush so I seated quickly infront of the bar counter. Although it is hotter, but it is nice to see the owner making udon in action.Tried three items during my first visit.1. Fried Chicken Nugget (Chicken Karaage) - served with mayo and curry salt. Interesting flavor. Certainly a new twist to it and I did enjoy it. Unfortunately, the chicken itself was not juicy enough and too much power. While I was waiting I realized other people ordered the kushiage platter (assorted fried meats and veggies) and it seems like it was never been touched and the guest gave me a look while he saw I was observing that dish. I understand now. It was bad. Do not order their fried stuff until they improved.2. Uni Cream Udon - I often have Uni cream pasta at Japanese/Italian Restaurant such as Cafe Hiro in Cypress but I am very, very glad that the owner is very generous with the amount of uni that he placed in. It is like uni in every bite along with the chewy udon. Cream sauce is a bit weak, I prefer it be more salty to balance out with the flavor of the uni. Note: Lots garlic in the soup!3. Mentaiko Squid Udon - I actually like this more than Uni cream. It is full of flavors! Mentaiko added salty flavor to the soup base but not overly salty (at least for me). Squid was a bit disappointing, not chewy enough, too soft, but will try again.This is definitely worth a visit, hopefully the quality will improve overtime so I will return whenever I am in the area."
8/30/2013,20130830,5,4.17,"They make their own udon from scratch! Everything else was perfect as well. Soft boiled eggs (as is or fried), tempura, the pork belly don...etc. Will definitely come back for more!"
8/30/2013,20130830,2,4.16,"This is the very first time that I have to leave a review on yelp. As you might think how bad this experience was! First of all, their staff 's English deserve two thumbs down. They were not able to pronounce the names right when they called my boy friend's name. We've waited for almost an hour and saw people after us got a table. Then we asked them and the manager Ni said that she had called but no response. I could not believe that was her response becasue we have been waiting outside the door the entire time. Yes you are a new place that attracts people to try but dont forget that customer service is the first! She told us that if we wanted to eat there then we have to write our names down at the bottom of the waiting list, which was not reasonable and completely not fair when they messed up! If you don't want good service then go ahead and eat at this place! Wish you best of luck!"
9/1/2013,20130901,5,4.17,We went at opening for lunch and it wasn't too crowded but around 11:50am it was packed with people waiting. We had the chicken tempura udon (hot) and it was delicious. Watching the udon being made in the window was entertaining. Inside the restaurant is warm and the end chairs at the bar area is really hot. I would recommend adding a donburi bowl for $3 extra (with an order of udon). I will return.
9/2/2013,20130902,4,4.17,"I would have given this place 5 stars except that they had little to no ac on a hot summer day in Los Angeles and that's just not cool (haha get it?). One cannot fully enjoy the experience of their food when they are sweating into the food (and we are not in humid Japan people). We might as well as have been in the kitchen with the chefs. They also have an awkward entrance area or rather waiting area (or lack thereof). It was so too hot to wait outside (standing in complete sun because there was no shade) so people were jam packed right by the front door since there was no place else to stand without being next to someone's table. Sadly as I said before, it was probably equally as hot outside as it was inside, maybe a tad more humid inside. You cannot get seated unless everyone in your party is there. It also seemed easier for parties of 2 to get seated than anything larger. We put down our names and waited about 20-30 minutes to get seated. At first it seemed like a lot less but then all these 2 seaters showed up and since my mom had to park the car we couldn't get seated without her presence.When we did sit down, we had of course first requested some ice waters since we were parched from the heat. We didn't get the waters until after the first dish came out. Strange since the table next to us got their waters straight away. I wouldn't normally care about this except that it was REALLY HOT in their restaurant.My mom ordered the pork belly rice bowl (small portion- warned by the server) as well as the kake-udon. My dad ordered the chicken tempura udon, my sister the cold sliced pork noodles and I ordered the uni udon which was not on the menu, but available upon request. My mom's pork belly bowl came out first and it was pretty tasty. There was a small bowl of rice and atop thinly sliced pork with scallions and a tasty smoky sauce. After that our waters showed up...but only after we kept giving our servers the eye.Then our noodles showed up, first my oh so delicious uni udon. It came in a creamy broth piping hot (just the way I like it) with a delicate uni placed on top of my nightmare shiso (no worries, with a flick of a wrist that was gone). The creamy broth was garlicky and rich. There were plenty of uni as well, no skimping on that thank goodness (well I suppose if you charge $16 for it, you should be getting a decent amount!). The noodles were al dente and basically we all agreed at the table that my udon was the best choice.My sister's udon was okay, probably more noodles than necessary- it could have definitely had more meat, but that's how we always feel.All in all, I think I would have enjoyed this experience a lot more if they could have more air circulation in the place (even ceiling fans would have been nice). Their bathrooms were clean and the food was tasty but it's always difficult when people skimp on things like turning up the ac a bit when its toasty outside. I would definitely come back...perhaps in November when it's cooled down a bit, you just never know with the LA summers these days, it could stay hot until October!"
9/2/2013,20130902,4,4.16,"Holy crap.Let me start off by saying that this food establishment DOES NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONING, so think twice about going if it's a ridiculously hot and humid day, like the day that I chose to go. The food was delicious and snagging a spot at the bar is the best way to go because you get the best view of the kitchen and so you get to see them actually making the udon noodles. I didn't to try the tempura egg, but it's on my list for next time."
9/3/2013,20130903,5,4.17,"This new udon restaurant in Little Tokyo did not disappoint!! My new fave joint for sure. I can still taste the noodle and its delicious broth... Yes the AC isn't on (or I think it's not working well? I felt the nice breeze by the counter where we sat, so maybe it depends on where you sit), and yes the wait can be long, but it's all worth it if you are after authentic Japanese udon dishes!! We waited for about 30min to be seated (probably because we were a party of 4 and it was 6pm on Sunday) but dishes came quickly once we sat and ordered. We sat by the counter with 2 kids, and that was entertaining for all of us. We tried Ikura udon (cold), Uni udon (hot) and Beef udon (hot), and all ingredients are fresh and perfectly seasoned. The broth is delicious and the noodle is done just right, not too hard, not too soft. We tried appetizers, Kakuni and Kushiage, and they were both delicious also. Staff were pleasant and patient with my toddler who made a bit of mess. (Parents, they don't have high chairs or booster seats, so come prepared.)"
9/4/2013,20130904,5,4.17,"Wow wow wow. Udon gratin. That's all you need. Order it. Just do it. They know how to make one kick ass cream sauce! It was like an explosion of amazing flavors in my mouth. I got the miso carbonara and my husband got the udon gratin. Both are amazingly delicious. Both are savory, both are creamy and both are so fulfilling. My goodness. I just wanted to keep eating that sauce. Over and over and over. Creamy and silky with a hint of sweetness from the onions with oodles of noodles swimming in it. Omg, it was to die for. I must get this recipe!! It reminds me of this white cream sauce I had at an Omuraisu (omelet rice) restaurant in Osaka's train station. Spot on!!!Forget the traditional noodles, go for the unorthodox!! Udon gratin is my new fav!"
9/5/2013,20130905,5,4.18,"= GET YOUR UDON FIX IN LOS ANGELES =MARUGAME MONZO just saved me $500! I no longer have to buy a plane ticket and fly 4 hours to Waikiki for some delicious udon! (Yes, you won't believe my addiction and craving to Bukkake Udon since I discovered it a few years ago while vacationing in Hawaii!)MARUGAME MONZO is located on 1st street (next to Daikokuya). This restaurant specialize in udon, and they have people making them in the back of the restaurant. THE WAIT:The restaurant is small and they try to cramp people into the restaurant, so don't expect too much personal space. (Yes, you will definitely hear the entire conversation of the table next to you). I came here on a weeknight at 8pm and had to wait about 60 minutes for my table. But like I have stated previously, I don't mind standing in line as long as it is good!RESTAURANT & SERVICE:It is a small restaurant, so unless your friend is skinny, you will be rubbing thighs with him/her. Service is great, and you get your food fairly quickly.FOOD:1) SEA URCHIN (UNI) CREAM UDON: OMG! I think I am in heaven. While the udon is flavorless, the cream sauce is not too thick, and have a nice garlic aroma to it. I personally think it was done perfectly because the dish would be too heavy is they made the sauce any thicker. They have a good amount of large hefty chucks of sea urchin layered on top of my udon. This dish was so good that I literally licked the bowl clean.2) MENTAI SQUID BUTTER UDON: Highly recommend this dish to those that thinks sea urchin is too exotic for them. The squid were cooked just right, and udon is topped with roe. 3) EGG TEMPURA: This is my only disappointment of the night. Mine was a little overcooked, but oh well... it was only $1.50.Would definitely come back to MARUGAME MONZO to get my udon fix."
9/5/2013,20130905,4,4.17,"Uni udon, rich, garlicky, fulfilling-for a girl. I actually wish it was less garlicky but it was sill quite good, especially in the first bite. At the end of the meal it was a bit heavy."
9/5/2013,20130905,4,4.17,"Damn this place is good. Went for lunch, great menu, can watch them roll, cut Udon by hand, there was definitely a blowtorch for some pork, and everything was awesome. Only reason I'm not giving a 5th star was lack of a couple items that I had seen drool-worthy pictures"
9/6/2013,20130906,5,4.18,"Definitely the BEST UDON place in LA. I see a huge line in for of Daikokuya next door, but this place should be the one with the long wait. Monzo is about as close to UDON from Japan as you're going to get here. It's all made from scratch and all of the UDONs are flavorful and unique. I highly recommend a signature udon for your first time. The restaurant is really small so expect long wait on the weekend. I highly recommend you to try for dinner on weeknights and you won't need to wait. You get to sit next to the kitchen to see the chef hand making all of your noodles while you eat, but do expect to be pretty hot near the kitchen because I don't think they have central air cooling."
9/9/2013,20130909,5,4.18,"Went again, this time for dinner, and with more people. Started off with the fried chicken skin - crispy, flavorful with ponzu sauce - GREATAlso the assorted Japanese pickles - three vairieties and all very tasty and fresh.I tried the Butter squid Udon and it was fabulous. Rich, with the ika the softest I have ever had. Place is getting pretty crowded, lots of people waiting outside, just like the ramen place next door. They also cram table and chairs in there - tables to hold 30 and about 10 seats at the counter in the back.Gotta try the Uni next time."
9/9/2013,20130909,4,4.18,"The debate between ramen versus Udon has never been so heated.Situated next to Daikukoya, it challenges ramen diehards of their conviction that ramen is best...My husband ordered Kakuni Udon, large chunks of braised fatty pork belly in light miso broth atop a bowl of hand pulled udon made right in the restaurant. My husband asked for tempura fried poached egg...kind of like a fried Klondike bar...must order at $1.50I ordered Uni cream Udon, while I enjoyed the dish thoroughly, my husband suspect the creaminess of the sauce resemble soup of butter...this may be the not so secret ingredient that wins the udon versus ramen war...go in for a bowl and decide for yourself, make sure you take your Lipitor first(This entry was written by my husband)"
9/9/2013,20130909,4,4.18,"The udon is awesome. Freshly hand made right in front of you and the udon is super ""Q"". The crispy chicken skin was really really good too. You can get extra noodles for $2 with your order and I recommend it if you only order udon. Overall very good."
9/10/2013,20130910,5,4.18,"As a person who personally dislike udon, this place has definitely changed my opinion. My friends took me to this restaurant and insisted that I try the uni udon. After an hour wait, we finally got our table. The waiters were very patience and helpful when we asked about the different sauces. When I got my udon, it was not what I expected. It was creamy and delicious! The noodle was not chewy like many places, in fact, it was damn near perfect. The portion looked small, but damn it can fill you! Along with the uni, we also ordered the beef tataki. The beef was fresh, and the sauce was not overpowering. Even though this dish was good, I probably won't be getting it again. You get 13ish thin slices of beef for $12. A bit overpriced, in my opinion. As for the location and restaurant aesthetics, it's right in front of the Korean town village. Inside the seating was a bit cramped but I didn't mind. There's also seating where you can see the udon masters make udon! I didn't get a good view from where I was sitting so I can't say much about it. However, it's definitely interesting how they have that available to their customers."
9/10/2013,20130910,5,4.19,"Authentic Japanese hand-made udon noodle. Good taste, choices of topings, and great service."
9/11/2013,20130911,5,4.19,"Can I just say OMG? Yes, their udon was perfect!Came here with a friend and my sister last Sunday and we ordered the mentaiko w/ rice and also their secret menu uni undon.yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…Both were wonderful. I love uni and was really happy to see lots of uni in my bowl. Definitely will come back for more."
9/12/2013,20130912,4,4.19,"I really really do enjoy this place but I have mixed feelings. I've been coming here a lot since it first opened. I have to say, the first 5 times, it was amazing! The udon was obviously fresh and has that chew as it should. The last time I went about 3 weeks ago, the udon was offensively tough. WTH...Recent fail aside, here's my feelings on the dishes:+ cold udon with poached egg, dashi, green onion - love the simplicity of this and really perfect for a hot day. It's a ponzu-ish type of broth and has no meat but you don't notice. This dish truly lets you enjoy the greatness of fresh udon.+ soup udon with beancurd - one of your traditional udon dishes with no protein either. Soup is delicious, cleansing, and simple. Classic.+ uni udon - ahh! Sometimes they run out and it drives me crazy but this is truly worth trying if you like uni. They are definitely generous with the sea urchin. It's creamy but light in some magical way. It's still rich and I personally wouldn't be able to eat a whole one by myself. This one actually goes really well with the cold udon I mentioned above so you get a balanced meal. Just like what the FDA says you know...+ carbonara udon - pleasantly surprised by how ridiculously delicious this is! It's not super heavy like your traditional carbonara. If anything, it's more soupy but enough of the sauce latches onto the udon. They also use canadian bacon instead of bacon. I really like it but it's tough for me to deviant from the first one I mentioned. - mentai udon - squid or fish eggs. Whatever it is, it was ok. It's just as creamy as the uni I suppose but this was my back-up dish when uni ran out. I don't love it or found anything especially interesting about it.Take what you may from my critiques, I tend to like lighter dishes in bulk. Rich dishes as appetizers. Udon is pretty heavy already so I like the lighter sauces :)I'll come back one day. I really hope that disappointment was from a new trainee cook. Sigh."
9/13/2013,20130913,4,4.19,"As a big fan of udon, I was so excited when I found out this place opened! Expect there to be a wait. This is definitely not a place for large groups. We had a party of 2 and got seated within 30 minutes. I ordered the mentai squid butter udon. Their homemade udon was fresh and cooked perfectly! I expected the sauce to be more creamy but it was sort of liquidy. A little too salty for my taste. But the squid was very tender. Even though it doesn't look like much, I promise you that you will be sooo full by the end of the meal."
9/13/2013,20130913,3,4.18,"I tried to make noodles once, wasn't even udon noodles, just regular noodles for spaghetti and it turned out to be more like a long donut ravioli with more dough on the inside... so knowing that this place is successfully making fresh udon gives it an extra bonus. The portions are a bit on the smaller side, but they make up for it by putting it in a gigantic bowl.... oh, and it also tastes really good. The time I went the noodles were made and cooked perfectly. I like my food a little more on the salty side and more vs less sauce, and this place was like that but not too much (there is a very fine line here)... it was just right. I do wish the portion was a little bit bigger though. We went early so the place wasn't busy yet, but I hear it does get busy. Parking in Little Tokyo is always a bit of a pain. I'd definitely come back, but wouldn't go out of the way to wait in a long line or fight rush hour for it."
9/13/2013,20130913,3,4.18,"Went to Marugame Monzo tonight. We ordered Beef Tataki for appetizer, Sea Urchin Cream Udon, Mentaiko Squid Cream Udon, Chicken Udon Gratin, and a soft boiled egg. (Shared between 4 adult) Everything is not bad, can taste the freshness of handmade udon. I personally like the Mentaiko Udon the most (Normally I would definitely vote for Uni ... but yet this time, I can't taste the Uni and the Udon ..) The Mentaiko Udon's taste is stronger. The Chicken Udon Gratin basically can only taste the cheese .... the atmosphere is good, A/C is too weak with a full house. I wouldn't mind to go there again but definitely not a must go place for me. Price is reasonable, and normally during weekend parking is a bxtch over there .. so make sure you have majority of people there so they will sit you. Luckily I found street parking 2 blocks away that saved me $7 flat rate for structure."
9/14/2013,20130914,4,4.18,"The first time I passed by the hottest restaurant to open in Little Tokyo since Daikokuya was a few weeks ago on the way to Suehiro just a couple doors down. I made a mental note in my head to come try it out after seeing the huge crowd. Fortunately I got to go a few days ago (see Jennie W.'s review below). It was a pretty long wait (~30-40 mins) and unfortunately we were seated near the door instead of getting to see the chefs at work! We both ordered the tempura soft boiled egg and the mentai squid udon. The egg was perfectly cooked with a deliciously gooey orange center; the deep color and perfectly viscous texture confirmed that this is a place that cares about quality. The udon was really good..tbh I didn't see a huge difference between handmade udon and other udon I've had, but it was still good. Maybe I'm just not much of an udon connoisseur, heh. Anyways, the squid was really good and they used a ton of mentaiko. It was just a tad too salty for my taste but it was really flavorful. A bit pricey but I would come back to try the uni cream pasta and the ume shiso udon!"
9/16/2013,20130916,4,4.18,Never thought I was an udon lover until trying this place. The sauce of the cabonera udon was perfect as was the texture of the noodles. We got lucky and beat the lines. The broth udon we ordered was just ok which is why.only 4 stars.
9/17/2013,20130917,3,4.17,"The mentaiko udon was pretty good and flavorful, but I kinda felt it had too much sauce. As much as I wanted to eat up all those little cod roe, I didn't really feel like drinking a bowl of cream. The uni cream udon unfortunately didn't taste as flavorful as I had hoped. Maybe because it was cooked so it lost some of that its flavor. I think next time I should try some of their more traditional udon."
9/19/2013,20130919,4,4.17,"This is really close to a five-star review for me. Just a few things here and there knocked it down, but this place lives up to all the hype. Really liked just about everything I had.Food:Had the famous Uni Cream Udon & Miso Carbonara Udon. As well as the beef soup udon, beef tataki, Chicken Karaage, and the Tempura soft-boiled egg.The noodles were great in all three dishes. Like what other yelpers have said, the texture in a soup dish is a little firmer then the cream dishes. It makes sense since it has to withstand the heat of the soup. Miso Carbonara surprised me with how balanced the Miso flavor was. It didn't overpower the rest of the dish and complemented the sauce pretty well. Really liked it. The noodles had a good chew to it was well and good bacon flavor. Only problem I had was that I wish the bacon were a little crisper. Maybe they just get soft in the sauce, but I think it would've made the dish perfect.Uni Cream udon is for those who really love Uni flavor. It was very good and the cream sauce is a little thinner than the carbonara, which is nice since the sauce is pretty strongly flavored. You don't need a thick, heavy sauce and a super punch of Uni flavor. Again, the noodles had very good chew and texture.Beef Noodle was pretty understated compared to the previous two, but still very good. The broth is light, but still plenty beefy. It came piping hot, which is always a plus. The beef tataki had a beautiful presentation and I was surprised the slices were pretty thick. I expected thin slices of beef like most of the other beef tataki I've had. Chicken Karaage is good and crispy, but a little thin. The kewpie mayo and curry seasoning for dipping was nice.Service & Interior:Good service mostly. Prompt with ordering, food, and friendliness. Did get a little hectic when the place got crowded and had to flag them down a couple times for refills and the check, but that's expected when you have so many tables and only a couple of waitresses. inside is classic asian minimalism.Overall:I really liked the place and have no problems reccommending Marugame Monzo to friends and strangers. Great place looking for a classic bowl of udon or if you wanna try some different fusion takes on classic dishes."
9/20/2013,20130920,4,4.17,"I've tried their beef udon, champon udon, and the carbonara udon... ALL of them are delicious! Last time I went for dinner, my friends and I waited about 45 minutes; I went for lunch today, and my friend had put our names down for about 10 minutes before we were seated. Not bad!She got the udon with the HUGE pieces of pork belly in it (not sure what it's called), but that looked absolutely scrumptious, and she finished all of it. What I love most about their udon is the texture of the noodles. It feels really fresh and chewy and... pretty much heavenly. Save your time & ditch Daikokuya... Marugame is waiting for ya! :)"
9/20/2013,20130920,5,4.17,"I absolutely love their cold plum-ginger udon! It's perfect on a hot day. Their duck udon is super tasty and delicious. Also their tomato creamed based udon is amazing. AND their beef udon (it almost tastes like Yoshinoya beef bowl). Love this place, definitely coming back for more!"
9/21/2013,20130921,2,4.17,"This use to be my go to place for Udon. It is very good but this place is so much hassle to have a relaxing time. stressful. Long waiting list for seating . No validations for parking. If you miss your call while you stroll around waiting for your table, they dont put you next, they put you at the end of the line and that was the last time I will ever go to this place. Even though this place makes their Udon right, its Not a fun place to go. Good bye and never again.."
9/22/2013,20130922,5,4.17,"I absolutely adore Marugame! As far as I know, they are the only place in LA that makes their noodles by hand. Not only is the process to make udon wildly entertaining, the udon itself is delicious - you can really taste the quality of the noodle. My favorite dish here is the Duck Nanban Udon. The duck is perfectly cooked with a succulent amount of fat left on the meat. To me, this place is just as good as, if not better than, Daikokuya next door. The wait around 6pm isn't too bad either! This is a great place to eat a casual lunch or a romantic dinner :)"
9/23/2013,20130923,4,4.17,"You can't go wrong with handmade udon, right in front of you! I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and the udon guy was there both times. The udon is always cooked perfectly al dente and the broths are flavorful. I've tried the squid butter, curry, and pork belly. The squid butter udon is very squid-y. I don't mind that so I enjoyed it very much. The bf who doesn't like fishiness did not like it at all. The curry udon is good. It's not the same curry seasonings as other places when they just use the cubed powder. The pork belly udon came in their regular broth which is refreshing and not oily. There was a good amount of pork belly and it was just perfectly fatty.There was no wait for a weekday lunch and an easy 15 minute wait for dinner on a weekend."
9/23/2013,20130923,4,4.17,They have the traditional udon noodles and they also have their own contemporary take on noodles that seem almost pasta-ish.. they use a creamier sauce and you won't get a broth with the latter.. Both types are delicious.my recommendation is go for a traditional broth one and have someone else go for the creamy one and share.. meals are always most enjoyed when shared amongst friends.. if you can't decide which to order you can ask the waitress what's most popular and you won't be disappointed.
9/27/2013,20130927,3,4.16,"We visited this place yesterday upon a friend's recommendation. We used to frequent this location when it was Fat Spoon. The set up is exactly the same but a little more refined, and darker - they closed up the window in the front and put wooden slats over the window by the door. They also glassed off the kitchen space so you can watch them make the udon while sitting at the counter. The udon menu is split into three sections - hot udon, cold udon, and udon ""pasta"" dishes such as miso carbonara, uni with cream sauce, cod roe butter sauce with squid, etc. For those not into udon, they have about 6-8 rice bowl options.My BF ordered a rice bowl and I ordered a hot udon with kitsune (fried bean curd) and green onions. A couple points about the menu - you can add all sorts of unique toppings such as a tempura fried soft boiled egg (which was completely worth the $1.50 for the novelty of it), tempura baby octopus, tempura nori, etc. Pretty fun. BUT - they also charge for ordinary things like green onions, plum sauce and hot sauce - $0.25-$0.50!!! I think this is ridiculous. It comes across as cheap, honestly. The udon prices are already between $7-$16 and for that price you should get basics like green onions and whatever sauces for free. Mine came with green onions, as mentioned on the menu, but not everything does. The only thing you get for free is soy sauce and the ground pepper seasoning.Also, the shrimp tempura rice bowl that my BF ordered came in the tiniest bowl ever. Especially when compared to the gigantic udon bowl, it made it look even smaller. He wasn't that hungry so it ended up being the perfect size, but his bowl was the same price as mine and it was SO SMALL that it just looked disappointing. There were two shrimp tempura and a small amount of rice. The tempura was light and crispy, and the rice was well polished and cooked perfectly.My udon dish was delicious. The udon are not too thick and the perfect chewy texture. The broth is light and not too salty. We had no complaints about the food but the reason I'm docking them two stars is the service. When we first entered, there were plenty of tables available but they seated the guy in front of us and then didn't even inquire if we wanted to sit. We were looking at the menus but we needed to signal them to let them know we wanted to be seated. Then, they told us we could sit anywhere but when we picked a 4-top, they tried to split it into a two top and then asked us to move to the table right next to other people, when the restaurant had plenty of open tables! So we agreed and had to sit super close to another 3 customers (so close we had to MOVE our table so they could get out). It took forever to order our food so we eventually had to signal someone, and then again we had to signal someone to get the check, and then AGAIN no one came to pick up the check. Thankfully we were paying cash so we just left money and got up and walked out (no one said thank you as we left). The lame part is that there were tons of servers around, but they were just cleaning tables or in the back. I'm hoping this bad service thing is just because they're new and that eventually they'll get their act together."
9/29/2013,20130929,5,4.17,"OH MY, I definitely recommend the sea urchin cream udon! The noodles are amazing, perfectly textured. I've had udon before, but not as good as this. I've had sea urchin before, and it always tastes like avocado texture to me, but the sea urchin in this udon dish was perfect!The base is so creamy and delicious. I'm sure its a million calories, but calories don't count on weekends right? I am definitely coming back to try the other udons they offer! The wait is about 20 mins, which is not as bad.My friend also got the gratin and squid butter. But those two don't beat the sea urchin. The sea urchin is 15.95 and worth every penny!"
9/29/2013,20130929,4,4.17,"Fresh made to order udon in the heart of Little Tokyo, what is not to love?// LOCATION // Next door to Daikokuya and a few doors down from Far Bar// PARKING // Metered// SERVICE // The waiters and waitresses are all very sweet and accommodating considering the tiny restaurant and long wait. They turn over the tables fairly quickly though. Your order is taken on an iPad mini and comes out very quickly. The kitchen is in the middle of the bar behind a glass wall. You can see your entire order, including the fresh udon, made. // WAIT // 20 minutes for a party of 2 on a Sunday afternoon (~1:30 pm) // FOOD // All of the soup based udons have the same fish soup base except for the curry udon. The broth is flavorful, not fishy, and slightly sweet. The udon noodles are think, chewy, and perfectly firm.    + Beef udon: The meat is marinated and thinly sliced. It is slightly reminiscent of sukiyaki and very soft . A good choice for meat lovers.   + Kakuni (Pork belly) udon: Large chunks of super soft and flavorful pork belly. Be warned, it is pork belly and therefore it is very fatty and gelatinous!    + Jidori egg: A huge tempura soft-boiled egg. Crunchy tempura batter on the outside and a oozing runny yolk on the inside. SO good! Great place for authentic udon with fun fusion topping ideas. I definitely want to come back and try the squid or sea urchin udon. *tip: no reservations*tip: takes credit card"
9/29/2013,20130929,4,4.16,"Pricey udon!! But pretty good. We got lucky on Friday night and didn't wait too long for a seat (about 5-10 minutes). We scored great seats at the bar...right in front of the udon maker! The only thing is that the seating is really really cramped, you will definitely be rubbing elbows with your neighbors. We tried 2 udons: The duck one ($12) and the Champon ($12-ish?). Extra noodles for $2 more. The duck was SUPER good and tender. However, it wasn't a specialty udon so it was just basically duck and noodles. The soup base wasn't particularly good and the lack of toppings made it seem like you are just eating endless noodles. You can add on extras a la carte (tempura, veggies, etc...) but be careful because that would make your bowl of noodles extra $$$$. The Champon has a very sesame flavor and was much better seasoned vs the duck one. It was also very plentiful in toppings: veggies, scallops, shrimp and some other seafood stuff. Bf really liked it. The udon itself is very firm. We usually go to Kotohira in Gardena for our udon fix, but this place is a good alternative if we are in the area."
9/29/2013,20130929,5,4.17,"I love this place. I love udon. So far, my favorite dish is the vongole udon in a white wine sauce with clams. Absolutely delicious. The miso carbonara udon and the uni cream udon are also very good. Tonight we also tried the pork belly rice. I enjoyed the charcoal grill flavoring on the thin, delicate slices of pork belly. We eventually broke our tempura soft boiled egg over it once most of the meat was gone. Always happy to come here."
9/30/2013,20130930,4,4.17,"Went here because I saw a twitter post from Angela Sun (yahoo sports reporter) and she posted a video of this place.They handmake the noodles here, and its pretty cool to watch them make the noodles. The environment: the seating in here is very tight, and cramped, also there is bar seating too. We got seated at a small table.We order the beef appetizer, which was very tasty.I ordered the Duck Udon, and my friend ordered the Curry Udon.We both liked the taste and flavor of the broth.OVERALL: looking to take someone for some fresh udon noodles in LA? Take her here, its a must try. It won't wow you, but its a cool experience."
9/30/2013,20130930,4,4.17,"YUM!their off-the-menu uni udon is every bit as good as people say. paired with their squid butter udon, oh my, what a glorious heart attack in a bowl. i think both of those dishes are compiled mostly of butter and cream, which i have no complaint against. i also tried their champon udon, which i believe is a vegetable udon in a pork broth? it was great, too. it tasted very mushroomy. service was attentive, and the waitress was so cute and polite. i want to come back to try more of their ""regular"" udon dishes.sunday 1pm lunch had zero wait time (though daikokuya next door was poppin' as usual). the only thing that irked me was that it was stuffy inside on a warm summer day. there's no law against air conditioning, you know."
9/30/2013,20130930,4,4.17,Great choice of udon. Had the currey and pork belly... both were amazing.
10/3/2013,20131003,5,4.17,"Marugame Monzo is a great addition to the restaurant scene in Little Tokyo. You've got a lot of the same types of restaurants there, so with Monzo specializing in udon, it definitely offers us something different.Here's a rundown on the food I've tried so far. Can't wait to try more! (Still on the must try list: carbonara udon and seafood tomato cream udon...and the champon udon, again!)THE APPETIZERS- Beef tataki: Yums, perfectly seared.- Stewed pork: The meat was slightly overcooked and could've been more tender. The sauce was damn delicious though and I would happily dump it on a bowl of rice and have it as a meal in and of itself.- Seafood salad: Not worth it. Seafood seemed like the overcooked, frozen varietal.THE UDONAll the udon is handmade in house. You can see the guy making it in front of you. It's got a great bite and chewiness to it. Or as they say in Taiwan, they're so ""Q"".- Uni Udon: Hands down my favorite. Generous amounts of uni and for $15.95, it's great deal. The cream sauce is really flavorful and you can tell that there's uni all up in it too. All the cream can be a bit heavy for some people, though.- Mentai Squid Butter: I see this as the lighter alternative to the uni udon, without the uni obviously but just as flavorful and also yummy. (IMO, nothing beats the uni flavor but order this if you think the uni's too heavy.)- Champon Udon: This is my fave soup based udon dish there. The broth is really flavorful (much more so than other soups there - see below) and is filled with vegetables. I like having a lot of add-ons to my noodle soups, so this hit the spot.- Wakame Seaweed Udon: This was OK. The broth wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped, but was fine when I was feeling sick and wanted something light. It just includes the broth, seaweed and udon which was too simple for me so I'd say the dish calls for additional tempura sides.- Duck Nanban Udon: This was just OK too. I think they use the same broth that they use for the wakame seaweed udon; it was just too light for my tastes. The duck though was tender and flavorful.THE TEMPURA SIDES- Tempura Jidori (soft-boiled egg): I was expecting more for some reason. It was perfectly fried and the yolk was nice and runny, but flavor wise it fell flat. Would've been good with regular tempura sauce, but I had it as a side to the wakame seaweed udon and the broth there wasn't too flavorful to begin with. They may have provided tempura sauce (I don't remember as this was months ago), but my overall impression was just so so."
10/3/2013,20131003,5,4.17,"This place was AMAZING! Upon my return trip back to la for a quick visit, this was on the top of my list of places to try! I was so pleased! We tried the sea urchin udon, the squid udon and the carbonara udon!!!!! Every dish was delicious! So good that I want to go back every day that I am still in town! The fresh udon noodles are made in the restaurant. They have a glass cased room where you can watch the guys making them!! They were soft and chewy... Amazing! A must try!"
10/3/2013,20131003,3,4.17,"The place is definitely a little hyped up. Came here last night around 7pm ish? We did have to put our names down but the wait wasn't too long. Service is OK. Interior isn't bad. It's just my type. I like everything black. You can watch them make the noodles through the glass which was pretty cool. Lets get to the food!The udon itself here is pretty good. I like that they're not the fat round ones and they're kind of slimmer and flat. I do really enjoy the more chewy udon with the thin layer of transparent whatever it is though. This is what we ordered between 3 people.Appetizers:Scallop Carpaccio: Creamy slices of scallops topped with little fish eggs on top of tomatoes and garnished with cress. This was refreshing but lacked flavor. The scallop was fresh but I couldn't really taste anything in the creamy sauce.Tataki Beef: This was pretty good. The beef wasn't as rare as I would like, they were a bit of a thicker cut. I would say a lot of of the photos on yelp looked better than what we had served to us and the photos on yelp looks more of a bigger portion that what we got as well. )= whaat. The pickled garnish on the top reminded me a lot of the taiwanese pickled cabbage.Negitoro Handroll: Just OK. This was fun! The little plate came with seaweed, a scoop of tuna, cucumbers, cress, wasabi flavored sauce, and a cup of sesame flavored soy sauce? You get to make your own little mini tuna hand rolls. This was refreshing as well but if you skipped the soy sauce it would be really bland. The portion of the tuna could be a little bigger though.Grilled Soshi Chicken: This was alright. Grilled chicken topped with lots and lots of shredded ginger. I ate this as a left over and I think it tasted better today than yesterday. Chicken was a tad bit on the dry side but it wasn't too bad.THE DISHES!Uni Udon: I had high hopes for this but it just didn't cut it. The flavors of the uni wasn't really there. The piece of uni they put on the top of the garnish wasn't tasty either. It was small and kind of shriveled up. No Flavor. Not worth the money. I enjoyed a few bites and just got more disappointed. Duck Nanban Udon: The base tasted like water and light soy sauce. The duck was plain and chewy. Came with some green onion stems. I did finish this dish though! Only because every udon we got is all too heavy so this was a nice change.Menai Squid Butter: This was delicious! Super flavorful, the udon came in a creamy pink sauce with little fish eggs in it and some thin shredded seaweed. Perfect amount of serving. Gratin Udon: Wayyyyy too heavy of a dish. Alright in flavor but I think I can pass in the future. It came on this metal skillet looking thing with a tray. Toppings:Jumbo Shrimp: Mostly batter, shrimp was dry. PassTempura Egg: This was good! I'd get it again.Some type of fried veggies that arrived in a ball: PASS!Fried Fish Cake: PASS!Fried Squid: PASS!The pictures for sure look better than the taste of the food. Everything was just ok. Nothing wowing. Nothing worth coming back for.If I were to come back I would try their cold udon and some other stuff."
10/3/2013,20131003,3,4.16,"Just wasn't that impressed.The handmade fresh udon does make a difference but it just didn't blow me away. To start, I must disclaim that I'm not the biggest udon fan. If faced with the decision of udon or ramen, I will almost always go with ramen.We ordered the tempura basket to start. I ordered the tofu with udon and my boyfriend ordered the curry udon. I also ordered a boiled egg (which is really then coated and fried). The tempura was just ok. The pepper one was the most disappointing because all I could taste was the fried batter. I would have actually preferred a ""normal"" boiled egg rather than the fried boiled one. My udon was good but it's not something that I would find myself craving for again. My boyfriend liked his curry udon and got a double portion for a few extra dollars. Maybe it's my fault for not ordering the creamy uni udon dish but I just wasn't feeling something so heavy that day. I guess I'll give it another shot if anyone else wants to check this place out."
10/4/2013,20131004,5,4.17,"With all the amazing reviews and my frequent visits to little tokyo, it's surprising it took me so long to try out Marugame Monzo. A few weeks ago a friend brought it up and when some friends were in town, I decided to give it a shot. Hubby doesn't care for udon and I just think of it as something to eat at obon or the only thing in the back of my grandma's fridge!Anyway, I had to have the uni cream udon. It was rich and creamy, with so many pieces of melt in your mouth uni. The noodles were perfectly cooked and super fresh. The best word to describe it is as Taiwanese do-- Q!Will be back, but not often cuz that cream is rich! But delicious :)"
10/4/2013,20131004,3,4.16,"This place is pretty good, but would i go back....maybe..not reallyParking is pretty annoying, but then again parking in little toyko is always annoying! so be prepared to look around or wait to pull into a parking structure~the line was pretty long! this is a really small restaurant with limited seating, so the wait on a wed night for a party of 2 ended up being about 40 minutes :( plus everyone has heard about the hype and seem to be flocking over!they make udon from scratch here...and i guess thats the shining star of this restaurant! we ordered: beef tataki, uni udon and chicken tempura udon with extra noodles ($2 more)beef tataki (2/5)when we got our beef tataki..it was almost well done! so we sent it back. the second batch was better and cooked to a medium..but still did not look like the picture on the menu. the relish on top was pretty good, but overall dish just didnt work for me :( and i really wanted to enjoy it!uni udon (4/5)pretty good! and for 16...you get a good portion of uni! the flavoring was good but after 10 bites i was soon full and over the dish. it was good..but just really heavy for my taste. The udon was cooked perfectly though. also a little awkward to eat! make sure to be careful when eating! wooden chopsticks + udon + cream sauce = splash zone bigger than sea worldschicken tempura udon (4/5)udon was cooked well, broth was well seasoned..a tad salty. chicken tempura- pretty yummy! not oily yet very crispy and the chicken wasnt dried out-so my boyfriend and i saw on yelp that the portions are a bit small in a couple reviews...i guess we would like to differ because we ordered double portion of noodles and it was wayyy too much for us to handle. Overall, im not sure about going back. yeah the udon is made from scratch and you can taste it...but im not sure if it's good enough and worth the time to try more than once unless if youre a total udon fanatic. NOTE- not very kid friendly. saw a poor couple with two little girls that arrived the same time as us...but couldnt get seated (due to the small amount of large tables) and they ended up waiting longer than us and also ended up dining elsewhere :("
10/4/2013,20131004,3,4.16,"I have a gripe, and that's poor service. I have an even bigger gripe when service is poor and performed by people with poor attitudes. Firstly, I know you guys want details for the food. The food is actually quite good and you can tell everything is fresh and prepared well. The tempura is excellent, not too oily, crisp and delivered pipling hot. The udon is excellent, firm and depending on the broth/base, very flavorful. Now onto the juicy part. So they employ a few girls who maybe think it's above them to serve people. Maybe they think they're so beautiful people should bowdown to them and not look them directly in the eyes. Maybe they're just so clueless that they don't realize that they work in the service industry and that their attiitude reflects on the overall establishment. Anyhow, I won't get into details, but just know that I rarely complain about poor attitudes, but this time it's warranted. I feel like I should have said this to them: 1) You're ugly. (i got that one from Amanda Bynes) 2) Try to act like you actually want to be here. 3) Go get my daymnnn noodles.... beeeyatch!P.S for any single guys who may date one of these girls, please feel free to screw them over... they need a reality check."
10/5/2013,20131005,5,4.16,"Talk about a hidden gem! Hiding beneath the radar of it's popular ramen neighbor, I am a big fan of Marugame!!They make their own noodles and you can even watch them make it. I hear the squid butter & uni udon are amazing...however I wasn't feeling too great so I wanted clear broth. I got:duck udon+soft boiled eggpork belly rice bowl (lunch special)I have tried a variety of their udon and all have been yummy! I'm partial to clear broths so those have been my favDelicious!! No wait, tasty food, and great service. Talk about underrated...Marugame Monzo is legit!"
10/5/2013,20131005,5,4.16,"Why have I been deprived of eating such amazing food? The fresh cut udon is so good here. I like going with my family because we always order a lot of different dishes and try it all. The scallop carpaccio was so good. It tasted fresh and sweet. The uni udon was so rich and good. I try not to eat such creamy food, but this one was worth eating if you had to break your diet. The mentai squid butter udon was the best. It wasn't too heavy with cream, but I ended up mixing the uni sauce with that dish too. If you like hard boiled eggs with a soft yolk, try the tempura soft boiled egg. I love when the yolk is a little runny. It was just missing some salt and pepper. The service was great. We didn't have to wait that long for a table, and got to sit right in front of the guy making the fresh udon. The line next door for ramen was ridiculous. It's right across the street from the Japanese Village Mall, so you could take a walk around that area, get some dessert, and burn off that heavy meal after."
10/6/2013,20131006,4,4.16,"4 1/2 stars for now.I was told about this homemade udon place in Little Tokyo and personally I'm not a big fan of udon. But I heard it was real popular and as a foodie I had to try it out to just kill the curiosity.Got there around 8 and the wait was about 40 min! make sure if you ever go it's with a friend you can talk with or on a good date otherwise it will be the longest and most awkward wait of your lifetime haha. It's a bit small inside but still cozy. You can see them making the fresh udon so that was pretty cool.My gf and I did a bit of family style so we can taste a bit of everything._Beef Tataki, looked bigger on the menu but still good size as an appetizer. This is a must try! The Tataki was perfectly medium rare and real juicy. The pickle vegetable on top was refreshing and a nice balance to the beef. The red peppercorns added a nice little kick. _Uni (Sea Urchin) Cream Udon. This was quite a surprise. I love uni but I was a bit hesitant because the dish sounded and looked real heavy and I never had cooked uni. But because it was the most popular and quite unique my gf and I just had to try it. It was amazing! it tasted like a fettuccine with a nice and light aftertaste of uni. And even though it was cooked it tasted real fresh. The udon was cooked al dente which I've never seen before and it actually worked. I think I like udon al dente now rather than cooked. Sometimes they taste mushy or dough like but this was perfect, Great for a cold day or when your craving comfort food. I would share this because after a few bites it can be a bit rich._Cold Udon with poached egg. You can add anything you want in the udon so we got fried shrimp. It's one nice big size fried shrimp that comes on the side which is better because you get the nice crunch instead of it being soggy from sitting in the soup. Again the udon was cooked al dente and the broth/ponzu was so clean and refreshing. Came with diced onions, bonito flakes, 1 boiled egg, some crumbled goodies, and some type of ponzu sauce on the side to pour on top. Great for a hot day or any day! I would give 5 stars but I wanted to go back and try other things as well before I gave the whole 5 haha. But had to write the review because it was so good and sharing is caring. Was the 40 min wait worth it?! uh YES!"
10/6/2013,20131006,3,4.16,"This place is good..but it's nothing particulary special to me. The establishment is next to daikokuya and had a pretty long wait time on a Thursday night (approx. 30 minutes when we got there at 7:00 PM). I was pretty excited for the beef tataki appetizer and my gf told me about how the restaurant makes their own udon noodles.After getting seated, we first ordered the beef tataki...and wow, it was tough to chew! The tataki was well done and looked nothing like the seared beef in the pictures on the menu. We notified the server that the beef looked completed cooked and they offered to switch it (yay!) and they came back with a better plate of tataki. The second plate was more pink on the inside and more tender, but nothing exceptional.For the udon, we had chicken tempura udon and creamy uni udon. The chicken tempura was cooked perfectly! The chicken was moist and the tempura batter was crispy golden. The creamy uni udon had a lot of uni pieces and the creamy sauce was rich and flavorful. I got double portion udon for one of the bowls and it was worth the two bucks (if you can finish it).The udon was not bad but honestly didn't taste too far apart from the udon I get from the market. I'm glad I got to try this place and I'm sure udon fanatics would enjoy this joint, but it's just too pricey ($9 for chicken tempura udon +$2 for the double portion, $13 for uni udon). Try and get a seat at the area where the chefs are making udon to make the most of your experience!"
10/6/2013,20131006,4,4.16,"What a delicious place! Walking in, I immediately was captivated by watching a noodle master till, cut and spin noodles around! It was fun from the start!The food was delicious. Fried to perfection-although a little less oil could be used for me (I'm not super keen in fried) but delicious either way. My boyfriend got the squid butter udon and I the uni udon. Both were so well prepared, and timely. Most importantly...delicious!! The flavor was on spot! And I know where to go to get specialty udon from now on. Love the service, everyone was so friendly and again-the coolest part may have been sitting at the bar-it's where you can really see the noodle master at work. The prices are right for the type of udon you are eating, but the sides get a bit pricey-for the amount you get. But the $2.00 for extra noodles is super nice especially if you've got a big appetite. So amazing food and atmosphere aside, love this place and I will sure be back!"
10/6/2013,20131006,4,4.16,"The noodles here are artfully and skillfully crafted. If I'm on 1st street it's to eat Daikokuya and that fact that Marugame is literally right next door is very interesting... When we got there at 11am, both lines were starting to merge and when Daiko people realized the longer line was to go to Marugame, there was a bit of a head tilt in confusion. The tempura was perfectly fried. I had always underestimated tempura but this place makes it ideally. I ordered the beef udon, my husband ordered the cold udon with the egg, and our friend got the duck udon. The giant tub of perfectly chewy noodles were just what we wanted. We wanted to try the udon more traditionally before venturing in the Italian cream sauces. Also being able to watch the noodle making process was very interesting. I will definitely come back to try more from the menu!"
10/7/2013,20131007,5,4.16,"Oooo-la-la!This place is amazing. First off, I really want to thank the Chef for making this such an awesome experience. My coworkers and I were seated by the open kitchen so we were able to see everything being made, including the fresh udon. The Chef saw my interest in what was going on and took the time to explain what was what (love that), plus he was super friendly and cheery.There is nothing better than fresh udon. I love the texture and diversity of the dishes you can make with it. I tried the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon and boy was it good! I loved the fact that even though it was made with cream, it was not super heavy. The seafood was cooked really nicely and of course the udon was pure perfection. I will definitely be coming back to try the Uni Cream Udon!Service is excellent and super friendly. Parking can be a pain but it is well worth the hassle (try taking the Gold Line if you don't want to deal with parking)."
10/7/2013,20131007,2,4.15,"Udon is really good but the service is extremely lacking. They do not accommodate any requests if you want to share or add something extra to your dish. Been there a couple of times the first time we were there we asked for a table for 4 because we had a two year old and after waiting for an hour, they said they have a table for us but can only seat 3 of us?! Hence, no room for baby. Extremely offensive after waiting an hour.The second time they charged us for a plate and beer we didn't order so don't forget to check your bill here."
10/8/2013,20131008,5,4.16,I had the creamy tomato seafood udon. It was amazing. Super creamy and delicious sauce with perfectly chewy udon noodles. It was all of my favorite things combined. The shrimp and scallops were small but I actually prefer that because it's easier to eat with the noodles. I can't wait to try other menu items but it will be tough to not order this again!
10/9/2013,20131009,4,4.16,"It's so hard deciding whether to eat at Daikokuya or Monzo whenever I come to Little Tokyo, since I love both places so much. Ramen and udon are so similar in style but so different in taste. I do find myself craving the chewiness and the innovative dishes at Monzo pretty often though. I think it's a great concept to have a bar area with a glass window that you can see through while the chefs are hand making the udon noodles. It's like watching a sushi chef working his magic on fish.. except you're watching the fine artistry of making noodles in this case. Noodles are such a common food item that people eat but we don't exactly think about where it came from. A lot of noodles are machine made but there's something about handmade noodles that taste SO good and look more authentic. Judging from all the reviews, the uni udon is really popular and I can see why. Uni is known to be somewhat of a delicacy and when you mix a simple thing like udon with a delicacy like udon, it becomes a hot commodity instantly. I don't like raw uni but love uni pastas! I love that cooked uni becomes creamy and rich, like a thick enticing Alfredo sauce. The uni udon is basically uni pasta in my books and the udon noodles itself is perfection-- chewy without being too soft or too hard. I also like to order just plain udon in a plain broth as well. The broth they serve isn't bland nor salty. Perfection. They also offer a few appetizers that are tasty as well. The beef tataki is a popular choice and I feel like it's a smart choice to add some protein into the carb-filled meal. It also satiates your hunger more in my opinion. The service is okay. Same service I get anywhere in Little Tokyo. I have to wave servers down once in awhile but it's not really a problem. I wish it had been a colder winter! I would have went more often! Can't wait to go back and try their other udon varieties. The wait has gotten long for this place as well so I must pick a good time to go!"
10/10/2013,20131010,5,4.16,"I am not a fan of udon. But wow. This place is amazing. They hand make the noodles here and you can really taste it. We came here during lunch and got the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, the tempura egg and pumpkin tempura.The servings here are hearty, filling and they give you a generous portion. I always have leftovers. The Mentai Squid Butter Udon was amazing--they really give you a good helping of mentai and squid. I usually don't like heavy meals, but I found this to be rich but not onerously heavy. The tempura egg was amazing with a perfect soft boiled center. The breading on the pumpkin tempura was also good and not too oily.Overall, it was a bit of a wait on a Thursday during lunch, but way worth it. Their lunch menu is limited though--they didn't have beef tataki for lunch, which I was looking forward too. I came here again for dinner on a Tuesday and did not have to wait at all."
10/12/2013,20131012,4,4.16,"I came on a Saturday around 2pm or so. There was a few people waiting so it took about 15 minutes to get a table. The inside is pretty modern and sleek. There's seating around the kitchen and area where they make noodles which is where we got sat. It was pretty cool although, unfortunately, they didn't make any noodles while we were there.The Service ---The service was good. Servers were friendly. We were the last ones there when they closed after lunch and it didn't seem like they were rushing to get us out which was nice. They kept telling us to take our time.The Food ---Mmmm creamy goodness. The udon noodles were delicious. Great texture. I had the Miso Carbonara. It was super creamy and super bacony and super delicious. Portions are pretty big and it was very rich so I only ate about half. I wish I could have eaten more though! My date got the Uni one. He wasn't very find of it at first but the more he ate, the more it grew on him. We also had the Pork Belly and Beef Rice Bowls. I don't recommend them. The beef was pretty chewy and didn't have much flavor. The pork wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special. Save your room for the udon, it's more than enough!The Prices ---I believe the Miso Carbonara was $12.50 and the Uni $15.95. There's a lunch special where you can add a rice bowl for $3.I am definitely coming back to try more. I wish they took reservations, this would be the perfect place for special events."
10/13/2013,20131013,4,4.16,"Wear some comfortable shoes because there is usually a long wait! I would recommend coming just with another person since pairs are easier to seat in a small place like this. Last time i was there, there was a party of 12 .. uh. that's basically a third of the restaurant (0.o!).I would say the overall experience was quite delightful. Even though it was packed, the service was genuinely nice, the food was fresh, the dishes were well made well and the presentation was carefully thought out.I've been there twice now and i appreciate the consistency of quality that I've tasted for each of their dishes."
10/16/2013,20131016,4,4.16,"I am a Ramen person, but this is the only place I go to when I feel like having Udon, They are famous for their Uni Udon so no need to say much, IT'S VERY Good. The Squid Butter is my second favorite. Also had their cold Udon. The protion is small and it doesn't come with anything else... just cold Udon and dipping sauce, good for those who are on a diet. I'd also tried couple of the tempuras but it's very blend. Come here before (6pm) dinner hour and usually you'll get seated right away."
10/17/2013,20131017,4,4.16,"One of the more interesting spots I've been to lately!Super small place located next to Daikokuya. When I went, there was a longer wait at Marugame Monzo than Daikokuya. I was pretty surprised at how popular Marugame Monzo is.Waited about 20 minutes on a week night before seated. The place is not that big, thanks in part to the large open kitchen. You can see them handmaking the udon that would go into your udon dish. Pretty awesome.We started with the Clams with Miso Garlic, and if you like clams and garlic, then it is just straight up amazing. Tons of mashed garlic cooked with beer and miso, the clams are super addicting. It's sorta pricey for an appetizer but damn it's goes perfect with beer.I know everybody gets all giddy about the ""secret"" creamy Uni Udon (it's on the menu now), but I'm more of a traditional type of guy when it goes to udon, so I went for the Curry Udon. The curry udon's curry thickness is about in the middle compared to other spots. It's a pretty strong curry flavor too, but the star was definitely the udon. It's amazing how big of a difference fresh handmade udon makes. The udon also comes with these fatty pork belly slices. Not much else in the udon except for onions and some green onions, so I added a tempura soft boiled egg. Although the egg is not flavored too much, imagine a perfect soft boiled egg with a light crunchy outer tempura shell. Yea. Also tried a bit of the Creamy Seafood Tomato Udon. It's more like a pasta rather than an udon dish. It's a bit sweet and sour thanks to the tomato, and somehow it just works with the seafood. My friend said it's a lot lighter than their other creamy udon and it's one of those things that's good to try once cause it is interesting, but she probably wouldn't order it next time. Will try the Uni Udon next time or steal a bite of someone else's =P"
10/17/2013,20131017,5,4.16,"i love this udon restaurant. it was recommended by my Japanese friend. fresh, and traditional. i had uni udon. it was super good. but too be honest, i felt it was too creamy when i almost finished it. but still 5 star!"
10/19/2013,20131019,5,4.16,"Best udon that I've had...And I'm not even a huge fan of udon... don't get me wrong, I like udon, I cook it at home, I order it on occasion, I just don't usually have a OMG melt your face I like this stuff type of love towards it... --- which should speak volumes to how good this place is.The service is fantastic, I told the waiter it was my first time and he patiently went through the menu with me... the subtle differences along and did so with a smile. This type of service can't be trained, but rather it is something that happens from when you really like your job. When the employees like their job and it shows, it honestly makes the food taste that much better...I ended up trying the duck udon, and this dish was pretty much spot on. The duck was cooked to perfection (cliche... yes) the udon and broth blended so well together.Easily a 5/5 in my book, I would highly recommended this place.Tip: This place feels more like a lunch place to me however I am told by the waiter that the dinner menu is more expansive so there are a couple more choices.Tip2: Try to get seating in front kitchen, it's pretty awesome to see the udon you're about to eat made in front of your face."
10/21/2013,20131021,5,4.17,"I was super excited to come to Marugame Monzo after hearing Jonathan Gold talk about it. I took his advice and first thing ordered the tempura chicken skin, exactly at the same time we ordered beers. The tempura chicken skin was over indulgent, sinful, and made me feel so good about being so bad! OMG I so loved it. For my entree, I ordered the udon with duck, daikon, tempura egg, and tempura pickled ginger. I think the toppings were even more fun than slurping that udon. I love that they make their own udon noodles. I do believe that that is unusual for LA. Next time I would like a seat right in front of the guy making the udon. The staff was great, the music was fun. Now I have a hard decision when in that area Daikokuya or Monzo?"
10/21/2013,20131021,3,4.16,"We got seated right in front of the noodle master. It's super fun to watch, and he greets you when you seat and leave. The broth was great, flavorful yet light. Great body to the noodles, though I could have done with a few less noodles. The clams were also great, and incredibly boozy. I wish we had bread or something to go with the rest of the sauce. Will definitely be back."
10/22/2013,20131022,3,4.16,"Hallelujah! Finally! A noodle joint that specializes in fresh, handmade udon. At first I was a little nervous about finding this place, but once I saw people waiting outside, I knew I was I was in the right place. After all, it's udon we're talking about.Marugame Monzo is a small, intimate restaurant with a very fun concept: they make your udon noodles fresh and right in front of you. It's pretty awesome. They have an extensive menu of different soup bases/flavors. Some of which are pretty unique, like the creamy uni udon, or carbonara udon. I ordered the seafood soup udon. The soup base was white, with shrimp, muscles, and shredded cabbage. The soup base was oh so delicious! The noodles? Honestly, they were a bit too hard - I thought they were under-cooked. I like my udon chewy. Needless to say, i was a bit disappointed. The boyfriend ordered the cold udon, I thought mine was wayyy better. His noodles were also a bit too hard and the sauce that came with it didn't taste all that great. We also ordered the deep fried egg, and that was delicious! Prices here aren't cheap, but I'm willing to come back to give this place a second chance. There are so just so many items on the menu I want to try. Until next time!"
10/22/2013,20131022,4,4.16,"I really love the concept of the chewy, fresh made noodles and options of soup base to go along with them. The sake and beer options are pretty nice too."
10/24/2013,20131024,5,4.16,"Not sure why people line up for Daikokuya next door as the more exciting place to eat is Marugame Monzo. These day there are so many other better ramen options in the city, that Daikokuya is just worth the wait anymore. I've been wanting for such a long time to try the udon at Monzo. Lucky for me, I walked and scored a seat right at the noodle bar in front of all udon-making action. This is where I suggest you sit while dining at Monzo. Let me save the you guesswork and tell you what to order.The most popular dishes are those from the specialty section. Why go for just the simple udon dish, while you can go exotic!Get the uni udon I say!Get the squid cod roe udon I tell you!These are the most popular dishes at Monzo. I also ordered the chicken skin. Now that dish, I had very high expectations. Unfortunately, this particular was quite bland. I had to sprinkle this dish with some spice. It was unusual from the other types of chicken skin made at home (by me) or what I've had at other restaurant. It had a light popped quality, similar to what the store bought chicharron.If you're an adventurous eater (as I am), you will enjoy your Monzo experience. Eat here now people before the word the word gets out that udon, freshly udon, is the dish of the moment. Very now and very LA."
10/25/2013,20131025,5,4.16,"Amazing udon place! What's better on a cold night than hot soupy noodles? Came with the SO since I had to work late and was in the area. The wait was very short for a Friday night, no more than 10 minutes for a party of 2, and to my delight we were seated at the bar right where you can see all the noodle making action! See, they make their udon noodles all from scratch here and in front of all their customers. It's so much fun to watch them make it right in front of you, the slow, methodical kneading just calms you while you watch, and it's fun to see him cut up the dough and then shake out the strands into perfect noodles. Definitely a wonderful source for conversation!You can really tell that the noodles are fresh too when you get your yummy bowl of goodness. They just have a wonderful bite to them! The SO got the uni bowl and I the mentai and squid. And we both added a tempura soft boiled egg to our meals as well. The mentai had wonderful flavor and the squid was cooked perfectly, with a nice chew but not rubbery at all. The uni and cream was a bit on the heavy side but totally worth every calorie. It was creamy and decadent and there is such a generous serving of uni in there! We shared both dishes and I'm not ashamed to say I drank every last drop of that creamy uni soup at the end. The tempura egg is certainly interesting, and I love me a soft boiled egg any day, but the udon bowls were perfectly fine without it.Overall a wonderful restaruant and definitely will be returning!"
10/28/2013,20131028,4,4.16,Really really good Udon!!! It's fascinating watching them making it right in front of you. Fast service. Cool staff. I got the udon gratin and it was delicious. A little heavy if you're not used to eat cheese very often.
10/28/2013,20131028,5,4.16,"The perfect noodle. What more can you ask for? Even if it wasn't so chic, even if the service wasn't excellent, even if the tempura wasn't so good, I would probably give Marugame Monzo five stars because of their impeccable noodles. As many have mentioned, you can watch them make the udon from scratch in a glassed in kitchen from most seats on the restaurant. We ordered to cold udon preparations -- one with a tempura soft boiled egg and one with sour plum paste and shiso. I also got a tempura baby octopus and some tempura pickled ginger. Grated ginger to mix in and dashi broth to pour over came with our bowls of udon. The noodles themselves were chewy but not too chewy, slippery, thick but not too thick, and extremely slurpable. This is a great addition to Little Tokyo and I intend to come back many times. Strict vegetarians and vegans be warned though -- their menu indicates there is fish in everything, probably because there's dashi in everything and there's usually bonito in dashi."
10/29/2013,20131029,5,4.17,"On my first day of jury service, I wandered into this small restaurant next to Daikokuya and was surprised by how packed this place was! I waited about 10 min on a weekday for lunch which wasn't too bad of a wait. I ordered their Mentai Squid Udon as suggested by other reviews and absolutely loved the dish! For $12.95 (before tax and tip), it may seem a bit steep for udon but they put a good amount of squid and udon in it. The sauce was perfectly creamy without being too rich and the udon was delicious with the right amount of chewy texture. If you can, try to sit at the noodle bar because you get to watch them freshly make the noodles :) I can't wait to return to try some of their other noodle dishes!"
10/29/2013,20131029,3,4.16,"A friend of mine directed me to a list of the best uni dishes in LA, and as a lover of uni and an aspiring foodie, I was definitely intrigued at the thought of uni udon. Unfortunately, a friend was running late, but since we knew what she wanted to order, we asked if we could be seated. The hostess very reluctantly gave us a table. We waited for 30 minutes before we were able to flag a waitress down to give us water and menus. Her excuse was that we were only two people sitting at a table for four, although we knew what we wanted to order. I was not pleased with the service.As for the food..I had such high hopes for uni udon..but..it was too rich and creamy. There wasn't a lot of uni and the pieces of uni that I did have, tasted very unclean. Although my friend got the squid butter udon and that was delicious. Overall, I did love the udon noodles, but I definitely will not get the uni udon again."
10/31/2013,20131031,4,4.16,"I love all kind of noodles, but udon has always been one of those dishes that never impress me. I always feel like I can just make it at home with a packet from the Japanese market and it will all taste the same. The noodles here are PERFECT. Perfectly chewy and doesn't fall apart like most udon noodles. I dream about these noodles and crave it all the time! My dining companion came back three times in a row the week after because he loved it so much. Now with that being said of course every dish isn't perfectly conceived so that's where opinions will differ here. I loved the Mentai Squid Butter. LOVED. I can eat that any day. The Gratin was a bit too liquidy but still pretty tasty. I don't think that I'll ever order the uni udon since I think it's a crime to throw delicate uni into a pasta dish but that's just me. Still have lots of dishes to try here but I know I'll be frequenting this establishment, especially now with the colder weather seeping in!"
11/1/2013,20131101,5,4.17,fantasticmonzo is definitely my favorite place to eat udon in little tokyothat's all i have to say
11/1/2013,20131101,4,4.17,"This restaurant makes their own udon right in front of you! You should ask to sit at the bar to get the full experience with this restaurant. Their udon is delicious, as well as the soup base. I ordered the pork belly ramen and love love love my choice! Even though there are only 3 slices of pork belly, but these are 3 thick slices. They are so juicy and just melt right in your mouth. I love how the soup base is light and not too salty which suits just well with the fresh udon. Don't forget to add a soft boiled egg with your ramen. The egg is lightly fried so it's like a tempura egg. It's an interesting way to eat an egg. The wait is quite long so I suggest you get there early to get a seat. There is parking in the back of the restaurant, but if it's Sunday, you can park on the street for free. The service was great. I didn't have any problem at all. I would go back all the time if I live in that area."
11/2/2013,20131102,3,4.16,"I absolutely love uni; thus, this place was without a doubt on the top of my hit list! I have to say the uni udon is better than the mentai squid butter udon. With that said, is the uni udon the best I've ever had? Sadly, no. I would have loved it if there were more of a chewiness to the texture of the udon. The creamy sauce also did not have as rich enough of a uni flavor as I would have liked.  Also not a big fan of the clams with miso garlic nor the beef tataki (this was probably the worst of all the dishes, do not order this!). All in all, I'd still recommend this place to satisfy your uni/udon craving.Street parking is $3 an hour!"
11/3/2013,20131103,3,4.16,"I've been here twice now and can say that their udon is just okay. Their normal udon is pretty mediocre. The noodles are better than normal, but that's obviously because they make it in house. The soup is just okay. I feel like the place is a bit overhyped. On my second trip, we had a bit of trouble with the waitress. Whenever you have a large group, there's bound to be problems at any restaurant, but one particular waitress was pretty rude. She gave us attitude when we requested some stuff, and she totally gave us the cold shoulder. Aside from this one waitress, the others were pretty normal and the guy is nice. I would definitely recommend their signature dishes over their normal udon dishes. Their signature stuff is what I think makes them stand out. I like their udon gratin. My mum had the uni udon, which she said was good but a bit salty.A bit off topic, but their restrooms are nice. It was much more crowded on our second trip, and I blame that on the yelp effect. I can see a lot of people really liking this place, but I've had much better udon in Japan and at Oumi Sasaya in Lomita. I would wait an hour at Oumi Sasaya, but I wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes at Marugame Monzo."
11/4/2013,20131104,4,4.16,"I grew up travelling back and forth and always would have a stop over at osaka, japan and what I remember most of those travels is this small udon spot inside the airport and wow, just magic. Since then I've been chasing that taste, that would take me back to those times, a little kid so excited for a bowl of udon, watching two japanese women make them from scratch and everyone inside would be sipping from the bowl, no spoon ma. I was waiting in line for daikokuya as usual then realized there's this udon spot just beside it. Got excited, I was already hungry, anything at that point would already be amazing but this was udon! Very sacred to me, came in with fair expectations. Sat down, right at the bar where you can see they make noodles from scratch, win. Place looks fresh, great for date night. I should have went with a traditional plain udon dish but I went for the duck udon.Served on a big bowl, but dissappointed on the serving, not enough noodles, it was short lived and was told they dont have any narutomaki (fish cakes). Dude. I live for those. For $13, I was expecting that this could be it, but the search continues! Although I would come back to bring a date, and try more of their creamy udon for fun."
11/5/2013,20131105,4,4.16,"Came here on a Friday night with my friends and to no surprise there was a wait. Luckily the wait wasn't too bad. We only had to wait for about15 mins. We were seated at the counter so we were able to see the masters at work. Saw how they rolled and cut the fresh Udon. Seating area is limited so waiting is to be expected.I ordered the miso carbonara Udon, beef tataki, and the mixed tempura plate. The appetizers came first and was shortly followed by the main course. Mixed tempura came with a katsu sauce and a curry powder for dipping. This was pretty normal and you can get pretty much anywhere else.Beef tataki had a relish topping with some peppercorn. Flavor was unique but wasn't my favorite. Miso carbonara Udon was creamy and yummy. It wasn't heavy at all. Needs more bacon though.I had the chance to taste my friends order of mentai cream. The sauce for that was more rich and flavorful. Would definitely go back to order that dish. For fresh Udon with a pretty good variety of style it is made and sauces, this place is a must try. Come early to avoid the long wait. When we left the line was even longer than when we had arrived."
11/5/2013,20131105,3,4.15,"I did not try any of their cream pastas cause my friend only wanted soup but in general I found this place disappointing, considering its the most expensive bowl of udon I've ever had and not even close to the best.I ordered the beef udon since it should be a reliable standby. Although it is a large portion, I found the beef to be dry and gristly. My friend ordered the pork belly salad and the pork belly was thinly sliced pork that was dry and bland. Perhaps I need to try the pastas instead but beef udon should be a solid dish at an udon shop."
11/6/2013,20131106,5,4.16,The Uni Udon is so so delicious. They make the noodles fresh.
11/6/2013,20131106,4,4.16,"I Loved this place, the udon is fresh, and very delicious. However it's also a bit pricey, I work in the area so eating here all the time can be draining on my wallet. We tend to only eat here when it's a business lunch/meeting."
11/9/2013,20131109,5,4.16,"Amazing place for handmade udon. Pork belly, shrimp tempura, red ginger, duck udon.  Shared at the table.  Get the hot chili oil. I highly recommend this place."
11/10/2013,20131110,4,4.16,I ate here yesterday evening with a group of friends. A small spot located next to Daikokuya ramen in Little Tokyo. It was crowded inside but we were seated immediately. They had the chefs making fresh udon in front of the bar area. That itself shows you that your meal is about to be something amazing. The menu had all types of different udon and appetizers. The service was pretty quick and the servings are huge! I ordered the Uni udon and the crispy chicken skin. Uni Udon - It was a large bowl of udon with uni in a creamy sauce. The sauce wasn't overly done. It was good enough to be enjoyable. You can definitely share this dish. It's really big for one person.Crispy Chicken skin - A soy sauce based crispy chicken skin that was pretty addicting. A bit too much soy sauce but it was pretty good nonetheless.Recommendation: Uni udon and crispy chicken skin
11/10/2013,20131110,4,4.16,"I LOVE UDON. Yes, happy to admit, definitely more than I like ramen... This place does it right. Got the best seats in the house both times I've been here, right in front of where all the magic happens.I like that this place serves traditional and non-traditional udon. If you're looking for fusion twist on udon, def the place to go. My mum ordered the uni udon, and dang, it's creamy. I had a few bites, and that was enough for me. Monzo is not light-handed with that cream. If you can't handle it, I suggest sharing. Major uni flavour bomb in your mouth, but not sure if it's worth that $17 price tag. The vegetable tempura bowl that you can order as a side during lunch came out cold and soggy :( The first time I ordered tempura, it came out piping hot so i guess it's a matter of consistency.Make sure your whole group is present or you'll have to wait even longer!"
11/10/2013,20131110,4,4.16,"I have been here twice for dinner and sat both times at the bar.I have ordered the traditional udon with toppings of fish roe & fried egg. I've also ordered the creamy udon with uni.Both were wonderful. The udon noodles texture and consistency were spot on. Chewy throughtout the meal, and not a single noodle broke.The only downfall is the area of being J town, parking is hard to find.I will be back."
11/10/2013,20131110,4,4.16,"Best Udon I've ever tasted and I don't even like Udon much. Braised pork belly, squid ink, or braised pork belly Udon are all yummy! It's a Fun experience to watch the chefs making fresh Udon in the Kitchen. Be prepared to wait at peak meal times."
11/10/2013,20131110,5,4.16,"Awesome udon restaurant right next to Daikokuya! It is a pretty small restaurant and they don't have a sign so don't miss it. I wanted something lighter so I opted for one of their brother selections even though my friend highly recommended the squid butter.I really love their handmade udon noodles! They have so much texture to them and everything tastes really fresh. I had their chicken tempura udon, which had a very light broth with a side of chicken tempura, perfect for a cold day. I thought the chicken tempura could have a little more flavor to it, but overall great crunchy exterior. I'll definitely be returning to try their specials!"
11/11/2013,20131111,5,4.16,"It takes something special these days, to start a successful restaurant in Little Tokyo. It's hard to envision a restaurant with longer lines than Daikokayu, and even more surprising to find it located directly next door. If you're partial to waiting for your a table, this is as good a place as any to test that patience.The space has been nicely remodeled from whatever lackluster place resided here before, mostly backs and whites in a fairly modern aesthetic. It's vaguely cramped inside, but mostly due to the heavy crowds. The staff was surprisingly accommodating considering how hectic it was. If you're fortunate enough to be seated near the kitchen, you can watch them hand prepare the noodles. Anywhere else and you'll need to entertain yourself with listening into your neighbors conversations since they'll be close to sitting on your lap.  The principle reason we came was because my wife loves Uni, and they have a pretty famous Uni udon at this worldwide chain. It's thick and creamy, good flavor and quite rich. Topped with a nice amount of the ""good stuff"", it was a big hit with the wife. Not having the same love for sea urchin, they fortunately have other nice options. I opted for Champon, of which they serve a perfectly delightful version. One of the better versions I've tasted here. The appetizers were equally good. Scallop Carpaccio was divine, and the Beef Tatami was quite good. Overall, everything was pleasingly delicious which is the whole point of dining out. A great addition to Little Tokyo, bringing a fresh twist even with the formidable wait.Best Plates: Uni Udon, Champon, Beef Tartami, Scallop Carpaccio Palate : Moderately exoticFood - A-Ambience - B+Service - A-Value - A-"
11/11/2013,20131111,5,4.16,"The best udon place in the city. When I first discovered this place, it was overshadowed by it's crazy popular neighbor daikokuya ramen. However marugame monzo now has it's own reputation and people are finding out about the only place that makes made to order udon. The consistency of the udon noodle is perfectly al dente. The assortment of different udon is amazing but they are known for their uni cream udon and their mentai squid udon. I also love their cold udon with plum paste and shizo leaf. Their tempura is also perfectly fried. Don't forget to add a tempura fried egg!! I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves udon, but don't tell too many people about it....as this place is getting too popular!"
11/15/2013,20131115,5,4.17,"UNI UDON!My boyfriend and I came here for a Sunday lunch date. There was a wait, so we signed in and went to the Village to walk around. DON'T DO THIS. Marugame has a list of rules right next to sign-in sheet which we failed to see. One of these rules is don't leave because they will skip over you if you don't answer after they call your name 3 times. The wait actually goes by pretty quickly so we were surprised when we returned to see that we had been skipped over. After debating with girl about the rules, they gave us a table. Therefore, do not leave or you'll have to go to the bottom of the list and that's no fun. They also say your name 3 times in 5 seconds, so pay attention or you'll miss it.Now for the food. We ordered the lunch specials that were the udon + rice bowls. It is definitely worth it to come here during lunch because the specials are a pretty good deal. My boyfriend ordered the uni udon and the pork rice bowl and I ordered the squid butter udon and shrimp tempura rice bowl. SO GOOD. The uni udon is so creamy and delicious. They add a lot of uni so you'll def get uni wasted. The squid butter udon is also good. The two dishes are completely different so you'll get a good flavor variety between the two. The bowls are large so you will leave here feeling full. When I come back here, I will pass on the squid butter udon and just get the uni udon. With that said, I can't wait to come back!"
11/15/2013,20131115,4,4.17,"--------------------------UDON MADNESS-----------------------Creamy Uni Sauce + Fresh Udon = ?I'd rate it 3.5 stars if I could, but decided to round up. Fresh made udon was one of the first reasons I bookmarked this place. Then after inhaling my uni pasta at Maruhide, my friend highly recommended I get my chunky butt to Monzo. We strolled in on a late Sunday night. We were one of the last tables they seated. As soon as we sat down, they served the last beef tataki and we barely made their last call. Pheeew! Scallop Carpaccio: This was good. It lacked the scallop sweet ocean flavor I usually expect. Scallops stacked on sweet tomatoes and topped with a light creamy mix of tobiko and sprouts. I think a couple pieces of shiso leaf would have accompanied the fresh flavor very well. Negitoro Roll: Not what we expected but was very pleased! The DIY roll it yourself presentation was very fun. They serve the tuna in a ball of negitoro mix. Next to it is a several pieces of nori seaweed, some shiso leaf, pea sprouts, and a sweet shoyu sauce. Uni Udon: A little too much garlic? Sauce was creamy with chunks of uni, but I think the garlic overpowered the sweet uni flavor I was longing for. There's no easy way of eating this fat, chunky noodle. I got splatters all over my dress. I wish the sauce consistency was thicker and coated the noodles a bit more efficiently. Sadly, I was disappointed by the flavor..but the noodles made up for it. I added tempura chicken, tempura shiso leaf, and ume chili paste on the side. Kamaage Udon: Broth was very good. I had major food envy when I stole a couple bites from my date. He ordered a soft boiled egg and had to do a double take when our waitress said, ""fried egg"". I've got to give this place a second chance. Enough of my trusty foodie friends rave about this place that I'm sure it has 5 star potential. Just-a-Note: Iced green tea is UCC canned green tea. =("
11/15/2013,20131115,5,4.17,Handmade udon noodles that are so chewy and perfect in texture... I dream about this stuff. It's awesome. Just go there!
11/16/2013,20131116,4,4.17,"Was the udon good? Yes. Were the portions great? Yes. Were the prices fair? Yes. Overall, this is a great place if you want some good and unique udon in Little Tokyo. I do not recommend getting anything but the Mentai squid butter udon. The duck udon is OK - but you only get 5 pieces of meat :/"
11/16/2013,20131116,4,4.17,"3.5 stars. Came before 6 o clock and barely waited. Girls, before you order the uni udon, beware that you will get more cream flavor than uni flavor. It is very creamy, saucy and heavy. Definitely not a light experience. It's good so long as you get a piece of uni with every bite. Otherwise the sauce itself doesn't do it for me. Kitsune udon was good and as expected, with a nice broth and thinly sliced green onion. The noodles are good, as it should be for a place specializing in it.  I would come back for the simple udon like kitsune."
11/16/2013,20131116,5,4.17,"We were actually gonna go next door for the ramen, but when we saw the wait we decided to move on. We had also heard about Marugame Monzo's FRESH udon; and when we saw that there were tables available with no wait, well, clearly this was our chance to try this place!Tables are close together, but the staff that we encountered were all super nice to us. Being our first time, we took a little while to look over the menu.We ordered the Porcini Udon and the Udon Gratin. Both are were delicious!! But the Gratin was VERY rich. I guess just how it should be if you're ordering gratin! I loved it, but will probably get one that's a little lighter next time.When we mixed the two together--Amazing!Got to see the Chef making fresh noodles right behind the counter, super cool to see!The bowls were big and really delicious!Far better choice than Daikokuya. Even though they are different types of noodles, this place is far superior!(Maybe I shouldn't have said that; I like the shorter (or no) wait time at Marugame Monzo!)"
11/17/2013,20131117,4,4.17,"I can't believe how crowded this place has gotten since the first time I tried them about half a year ago!! I guess that's a good sign for the owners and they definitely have something to be proud of. The wait was pretty bad, like 25 mins at around 8pm, luckily the waitress was able to get to us fairly quickly. We started with the beef tataki which was pretty special but damn pricey, like $2 a piece of beef. My girlfriend ordered the mentai butter udon (squid butter) and OMG it was as delicious as I remembered. The udon cooked to perfectly, the fresh squid and the delicious squid butter was awesome. I remember it being a lot buttery the last time I had it but still definitely delicious. I got the champon which was the opposite spectrum of the mentai butter, this one was light, but still super delicious, the amount of vegetables and the flavor of the broth was amazingOverall an amazing experience just as I remembered my first time, definitely going to try the original udon with tempura next time.P.S. THEY DONT PROVIDE HOT WATER, what the heck is up with that? How do they manage to cook the udon then??"
11/17/2013,20131117,4,4.17,"Yum, just yum! Yes, the noodles are fresh and the taste....magical. I did try the uni udon-- it was a bit rich for my taste, but still good. If you want comfort food, this would be the dish for you. Otherwise, stick with some of the more traditional noodle bowls. Have fun slurping the night away!"
11/17/2013,20131117,2,4.16,"ok im going to start of ranting about this place. i know japanese people are extremely conservative when it comes to fine dining but this place needs to get rid of their attitude about their perceived fine dining experience because this is far from fine dining. they once told my girlfriend that they would not allow boba tea in their establishment and they would stow it away in their fridge(bad idea because it was a frozen tea) and on another occasion my friends wife brought some starbucks coffee and wouldnt allow it at the table, and on another occasion they wouldnt let me order food for someone who was parking their car and subsequently we were asked to leave because he came at 2:31 1 minute after they closed all though i was there for 30 min and i knew what he wanted to order. the service and their customs is hard to follow especially seeing that this is a 2$$ dining experience. now if this was ursawe i would understand and would like to enjoy this dining experience to the fullest but come on this place is a cheap lunch spot and that is all. now with that being said this place hand makes their udon noodles for your viewing pleasure which is good because whenever you eat hand made noodles you will get a more crsip noodle texture which in my book is good. their soup bases is just blehh while their miso and uni speical udon noodles is something different. i give them credit for being original but it taste like alfredo udon with a dash of miso or uni unlike what their menus which have it written the other way. they are good but if i really wanted italian food i think i would go to an italian restaurant. now with all that ranting going on i must admit that i visit this place almost 3 times a week. what i always order is the pork belly over rice and negitoro bowl. these two rice plates are ridiculously good. the pork belly rice is simply rice with pork belly covered with sesame oil and seared with a butane torch. just simply a plain dish that will knock your socks off~!! the negitoro bowl is rice covered with ground up raw toro and some mayo eel sauce and seaweed to top it off. i think i will be visiting this place less now that 50% of the reason that i came here should not be eaten(tuna radioation)"
11/18/2013,20131118,5,4.17,Wow. The noodles are incredible. Lovely atmosphere. Make sure to go early. It was packed by noon.
11/19/2013,20131119,5,4.17,"first of all, i recommend sitting at the bar if it's your first time. there's something about watching fresh udon being made that greatly enhances the experience. What i've tried here: mentai squid butter, uni udon, scallop carpaccio, fried soft boiled eggs, and shredded pork bowl, pork belly udon, and beef tataki-uni udon and mentail squid butter udon were both amazing. they're both very heavy dishes. i wish i didn't order so much food at the time but it was great to be able to sample a bit of everything. if i had to pick, i'd probably pick the mentai quid butter over the uni udon. i came back another time and tried their regular udon with pork. that was just as amazing. i love the freshness of the noodles and the complexity of their unique broths and sauces. it's probably best not to order 2 creamy ""specialty"" udons if you're planning to share and try different things-scallop carpaccio: not my favorite. it was fairly tasty but nothing mind blowing-beef tataki: this was sold out my first time here but i came back last week and finally    got to try it. i like the sauce. okay dish overall-shredded pork bowl: go next door to daikokuya if you're looking for a delicious pork  bowl-the eggs: this is really something special. you must try this. perfectly bowled on the inside (gooey and soft), yet crunchy on the outsideoverall, stick to the udon and the eggs. i don't think the appetizers are very special."
11/20/2013,20131120,4,4.17,"I love this place! There is always a line, but it goes by pretty quick. Make sure you are there when they call your name or else you'll have to start at the back of the line again :( This happened to us. They said our table will be ready in 15 minutes so we walked around but came back in and turns out our name was already called. We had to wait again but only had to wait for less than 10 minutes. On this visit, I tried the mentai squid butter udon and the beef tataki. SO FREAKING GOOD MAN! I love the beef tataki sooo mucheee! The smooth texture and the olive oil and pickles on top was just perfection. The mentai squid butter was tasty! I can't decide whether or not I prefer the mentai or the uni udon. Both are delish! I didn't get the pork belly don but instead got the karukage don this time. Meh. I would stick to the pork belly. Prices went up tho! It's $5 now where as before it was $3 (or was it bc it was lunch vs. dinner price?) Anywho, I'm def coming back again!"
11/20/2013,20131120,4,4.17,I went here for dinner and ordered the udon with uni however it tasted a bit too cheesy creamy than I expected. I also ordered a duck udon soup and it was delicious. The soup was very flavorful and the ambiance was great. I sat at the bar and watched the chefs make the udon fresh right in front of me!!!!! Also I would like to add that the hot green tea that they serve was so delicious I had to go out and buy some for myself to make at home! It's special because it's burnt green tea leaves give a very interesting taste to it.
11/21/2013,20131121,5,4.17,"This place is so good, I can't believe it's real. This restaurant really puts (almost) all of my other 5 star rated places to shame. After Marugame Monzo, I will not be giving out 5 stars as easily.I had the kake udon with one shrimp tempura and one egg tempura a la carte. I also had a taste of my friend's carbonara. Two completely different dishes, both equally amazing. The entire experience of being in the restaurant (being able to watch the chefs prepare the udon through the glass, the attentive and polite service, the cleanliness of the restaurant) was top notch."
11/21/2013,20131121,4,4.17,"When you ask anyone about Japanese noodles, their first thought it always Ramen, then maybe Udon. Marugame Monzo makes a case that it should be the other way around. The prize of Marugame Monzo is that they make the noodles by hand and FRESH! So fresh that you can watch them making it as you're waiting for your meal. The noodles are amazing. They have a great texture. Firm, yet chewy. It's the way I want almost all of my noodles to be. So lets get this straight from this point on. The noodles themselves are great... best udon i've ever had. Their broths and soups range from really good to just okay. Here's what we got: Mentaiko Squid Butter Udon - 2.5/5This Udon really missed the mark for most of us. It fell short from a lack of butter. The texture of the dish just didn't sit well with us. Felt a little thin and fishy because there wasn't anythere there to balance out the Mentaiko.Mentaiko cream Udon - 4.5/5As where the previous dish left us unsatisfied, the Mentaiko Cream udon really hit the spot. The cream balanced nicely with the mentaiko and provided just enough fat to round out the fishiness of the mentaiko but left enough of it's flavor in tact to be enjoyed. The person who ordered the bowl said that it was difficult to finish because it was salty and very heavy but that doesn't take away from how good a few spoonfuls were.Pork Belly Udon - 3/5I didn't have any of the pork belly but the broth seemed like a standard broth. Nothing great but also nothing to complain about. Duck Udon- 3/5Same as the pork belly udon. I'm pretty sure it's the same broth so that really makes sense. Mentaiko Shiso Cold Udon w/ Egg 5/5I thought this dish was phenomenal! I added an egg so it was a little pricier. The egg provided that extra cream and fat that I think this dish might have lacked otherwise. The mentaiko and shiso pair well. This is a much lighter dish than all the others since it doesn't come with a soup. I personally would have liked a little more shiso but I still think it's a great dish.Grilled Chicken w/ Grated Ginger 3.5/5The grated butter ginger on top of the grilled chicken was amazing. But our chicken was a little dry. I will give them another shot... or maybe just try ordering the topping at a dish for the fried chicken skin.Fried Chicken Skin 4/5I really enjoyed this dish. Make sure you dip the skin in the sauce that's served on top. They drizzle the sauce so some pieces get a lot more sauce than others. Marugame Monzo is a great place to eat. I will definitely be back. I think it's good to go and share with people because the soups themselves might become a little one note after a while. FYI they do double portions on the normal udon for just $2 more so order the double and have some lunch for the next day!"
11/24/2013,20131124,5,4.17,"This place rocks!! They make their own udon and you can see them make it right in front of you. Try the specialty Japanese Udon pastas..... they are flavorful and hearty. My favorites are the uni , the carbonara, and the mentaiko. I love the lighter flavors of Japanese spaghetti, but the unique thick texture of the udon is really a great idea. They also have great mini side bowls you can order with your udon. Don't forget to look on the back side of the menu for them!"
11/25/2013,20131125,5,4.17,"There aren't too many udon places that are memorable. Sanuki No Sato in Gardena and Oumi Sasaya in Lomita are probably my 2 go to places. Then came Marugame Monzo in Little Toyko to steal the spotlight. Mentai Squid Butter Udon - I had no idea what to expect but that's what everyone else was raving about. And they were right. They were not stingy with the mentaiko (marinated roe of pollock) and it flavors the udon with thick and buttery flavor. It may not be for everyone but if your taste buds are craving something savory, Mentai Squid Butter Udon is your dish!shrimp tempura udon ($11.95) is everything you want in a udon soup with shrimp tempura. The shrimp was sweet without any condiment but the tempura sauce hits the spot. The batter was perfect, not greasy nor crumbling. I know they have that huge display window inside so that you can see how the chefs make the udon... but I think they probably secretly make it with TLC (tender, love, and care) to dish out such excellent flavors. Here's to another noodle place to look forward to other than Daikokuya and Shin Sem Gumi! Oishii!"
11/25/2013,20131125,5,4.18,This was my first time getting udon from a restaurant specializing in it. I was not disappointed. I started off with the pork belly appetizer which was extremely fatty and soft as expected. I then got the squid butter udon which was so bomb. It had an interesting flavor and creaminess that I have never had before. The udon was handmade (you could see it being made) and it tasted like it was.
11/26/2013,20131126,3,4.17,"The freshly made noodles are quite good but not as good as the hand-pulled noodles in northern Chinese restaurants, it lacks the elasticity I expected. However, the creamed miso sauce was very tasty. My friend ordered the sea urchin noodles, I think it is too fishy for my taste, and the curry noodles was a bit too salty. The sashimi scallop appetizer was fresh, but I will probably not go back for this if I had to wait another 1.5 hours in line again."
11/26/2013,20131126,4,4.17,Had the porkbelly udon.  3pcs really tender. Bit pricy. You are paying for the show so it's OK.  Will come back with friends. Oh people lined up at 1130 when it opens.
11/27/2013,20131127,5,4.17,"great, freshly made udon.:food:I've had the uni cream udon, the kakuni udon (pork belly), and the duck udon.The uni cream udon was good, very heavy. The uni felt a bit overcooked (not fresh like on nigiri rolls). It was very hard to eat with chopsticks - use the forks. But the cream sauce was good.Loved the broth in the kakuni udon, but the pork belly felt very tough.The duck udon broth was good too, the medallions of duck tasted a bit tough as well.I've had the fish cake and the soft-boiled egg tempura. Both were good and tasty.For apps, I've had the karaage (fried chicken) and the braised pork belly. The karaage came with Qpie and some curry powder - tasty, needed a zest of lemon though. The braised pork belly was super delish- much better than its counterpart in the udon.:wait:the wait isn't too bad compared to Daikokuya next door. Definitely not long enough to wait and go grab a drink at a nearby barif you can, sit near the bar where you can watch them make the udon fresh."
11/29/2013,20131129,5,4.18,"Best Udon place ever!!!The udon is so chewy.... Love how they hand make their udon. You can see them spending several minutes making a batch of udon noodles... You kinda want to tell them to take a break from all their udon making hard work... I got their famous Uni Udon... AHHH so good... so creamy yet not too heavy... I can't explain it, it just pretty darn good. My friends got their other udon dishes and they all loved theirs... One of my friends got their Mentai Squid Butter Udon and she enjoyed it. I took a bite of it but I personally prefer the Uni... The Squid Butter is less heavier for sure... so if you are looking for something less creamier than the Uni, definitely give it a try.We were not too big fans of their Beef Tataki like most people... It was average at best...Marugame Monzo is definitely a nice addition to Little Tokyo! Can't wait to come back!!! :)"
11/30/2013,20131130,4,4.18,"Fresh, homemade udon noodles. Yum. The texture was so good, you could really taste the freshness.My bestie and I came here for a light dinner before the Justin concert (LOVE HIM), and I was excited because I've heard rave reviews for this place. I ordered the beef udon and my friend ordered the creamy uni one. We also ordered a side of fried chicken.The beef udon came in a pretty huge bowl. The beef was very tender, and the broth was delicious and light. The fried chicken wasn't bad, pretty good with the spicy mayo sauce. I tried a little of the uni one. I'm not an uni fan like some people are, but the cream sauce was pretty tasty. The portions were just right, and like I said before, you can't beat fresh udon noodles. We came pretty early on a Tuesday night, but by the time we left, the place was crowded."
11/30/2013,20131130,5,4.18,"My new all time favorite place to go. When you go at lunch time, you need to add the bowls to your udon for $3-4.My favorites are the Pork Belly Bowl and the Negitoro Bowl.I wish I could order HUGE bowls of them and just eat that haha.. yes they are that good.I tried the Miso Carbonara, Mentai Squid Udon, and the Uni Udon. I personally liked the Miso Carbonara and the Mentai Squid Udon the best. The Uni Udon was a little too creamy for me- yes it is really good but it gets to be a little too much by the middle of the meal. The Miso Carbonara is really good- I especially love pasta and Italian food so of course I would like this too. I couldn't really taste the miso though.. just tasted like a carbonara to me.The Mentai Squid Butter Udon was really good- the color is different.. it is pinkish haha and it has more of a soup than a pasta texture. It is great!If you like curry, get the curry udon! My bf chooses to only get that hahaa.It is a bit crammed.. one time I was seated next to another table and I could hear their entire conversation.. it was a little awkward because the tables were so close.. idk the place is a little small so I guess that is all they could do. But yes, good service and food. GOPark in the Office Depot parking lot and just buy a coffee at Starbucks for validation!"
12/3/2013,20131203,5,4.18,"Hot or cold, soupy or saucy, the best udon dishes start with the best udon noodles, and for those, be sure to stop by Marugame Monzo in the heart of Little Tokyo. We were seated at the counter with an excellent view of the Noodle Master at work, mesmerizing us with his noodle cutting and twirling.The Food:- Chicken Karaage (Fried Chicken): very crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside, and well seasoned. Served with sweet Kewpie mayo and curry salt (dip in a teeny bit of mayo first, then the curry salt will adhere better).- Mentai Squid Butter Udon: the sauce was tinted pale pink from the generous serving of mentaiko (Alaskan pollock roe) floating in a sea of butter. The shredded nori is a must to add a bit of crunch to the otherwise very rich sauce. The squid is impressively tender and plentiful.- Sea Urchin (Uni) Cream Sauce Udon: a balance of briny sacs of sea urchin roe swimming in an Alfredo-like cream sauce, this decadent dish was accentuated by the chewy texture that only comes with fresh, handmade udon noodles. There was a LOT of uni, so despite being the most expensive dish on the menu ($15.95), I really felt like it was a great deal. Be forewarned, however, that there may be a bit of diminishing return while eating this because it's just so rich (my cholesterol-laden heart was begging me not to take that last bite).The service was friendly even though we were almost the last customers to be seated that night. The food arrived promptly and our water glasses never sat empty. Parking is a pain and the waits can be long, but it's totally worth the visit. If you can get spots at the counter, grab them. Best seats in the house!"
12/3/2013,20131203,5,4.18,Been here twice now and both times were excellent. I got the creamy uni udon the first time. It's heavy but decadent. I went with a lighter version called zaru udon the second time. The udon came with a separate broth to dip. That was really refreshing and I was able to enjoy the texture of the noodles better. Served cold. The scallop carpaccio was succulent and a must!
12/3/2013,20131203,4,4.18,"Just try to find Japanese-Italian fusion elsewhere. I love L.A. for this, and such a restaurant in the heart of Little Tokyo is a delicious and fun treat! The homemade udon is the perfect consistency, the portions are the right size, and my Miso Carbonara was delicious! My friends enjoyed their Mential Squid Butter and Tomato Cream Udon. The waiter was so funny and charming, trying to get me to order a beer. I would have but we were short on time. Next time, though. But the tea I did order was the perfect temperature, and glasses stayed full. I will be back."
12/4/2013,20131204,5,4.19,"I must say that this is one of my favorite places in DTLA for udon. The udon is fresh and made to order right in front of you! I can leave here feeling full, but not in a deadly food coma. My favorite things to order here are the uni cream udon and the beef tataki. I was worried that the uni cream udon would be really heavy, but it is not that bad. Another thing that I love about it is that they are pretty generous with how much uni they put in there. I have also tried the pork belly udon and the scallop carpaccio, but I thought they were just okay. There is always a line when I come so prepare to wait awhile. If you're lucky, you can snag a parking spot on the street, but if not, there are parking lots across the street and around the area, Coming back (probably soon!) to try their mentai squid udon!"
12/4/2013,20131204,4,4.18,I liked the tempura soft boiled egg and uni udon !
12/6/2013,20131206,2,4.18,"Definitely not my cup of tea. The udon noodles themselves were good--fresh, high quality and al dente... However, the sauce, I had the carbonara, just didn't work. My friends and I all tried different signature udons, from the au gratin to the squid butter and none of us really liked any of them. Perhaps the more traditional udon would have been better. The tempura shrimp was dry and salty, the beef tataki was good, but the fried chicken appetizer and braised pork belly were gross. Probably some of the worst fried chicken and pork belly I've ever had. It's a small place, which is expected for J-Town, but man, I would not wait for a table here or return."
12/6/2013,20131206,4,4.18,"One of the biggest benefits of this restaurant being so popular is that it seems to be cutting into the wait for Ramen next door.I had the Metai Squid Butter Udon and I couldn't help but be reminded of my favorite dish at the Spoonhouse with pretty much the same ingredients, only without the broth and replace the spaghetti with udon. Only this one was probably better. The chunks of squid were much bigger (and actually maybe a tad less enjoyable than that of Spoonhouse) but there was soo much more roe in here and the broth was soo flavorful. Right on Marugame, i'm coming back for sure."
12/6/2013,20131206,5,4.18,"So if you know me at all, I tend to rant about the LA inflation on Yelp. That is, places that would otherwise be three stars in San Francisco would rate four-and-a-half stars here. This phenomenon often leads to very disappointing meals in overrated restaurants and me walking away with unfavorable views of the LA food scene.Enter Marugame Monzo. Four-star Yelp rating. LAist, LA Weekly buzz. Seemed like a recipe for disappointment. Until I had the uni cream udon. I had no idea udon could be elevated to such a pleasurable gastronomic experience. The broth was creamy, the saltiness was just right, and the flavors of the uni hit at just the right register. The noodles, cut right in front of you, were perfectly al dente. With the beef tataki, it was the perfect combination of richness and refreshment.A word, though. You don't need the egg if you're ordering the uni udon. It's rich enough without the perfectly runny yolk.LA, I might grow to love you yet."
12/6/2013,20131206,5,4.18,"Tried this place in the Summer and have gone back a few times since then. It's quite small, just like all the other restaurants in the area, so if you go at a bad time, there might be a slight wait. If you get a bar seat, you get front row to the chefs handmaking the udon noodles! It's amazing how they do it!I absolutely love the Mentai cream seafood udon. That's my favorite dish there. I've had a traditional one with broth, the Udon gratin, and the Mentai cream, but that Mentai cream is AMAZING! It's very rich and creamy with pieces of scallop and other types of seafood in it! I can eat it everyday! The quality of the udon noodles is also spectacular! But I may be biased because I'm a lover of all kinds of noodles!"
12/7/2013,20131207,4,4.18,"The udon here is great but the wait can be ridiculous especially if you have a large party. They also don't take reservations so prepare to die of hunger. My two favorite udon from here are the hentai squid butter and the Uni udon. Hentai squid butter- has a lot if roe (I love roe and fish eggs so this is perfect) it has a liquid soupy sauce so you can drink it and would be perfect for a cold day.Uni udon- this udon is very creamy an can be a little heavy but it is still very delicious. It also comes with a lot of Uni so it is worth your money. It is something you must try here.My friends came with me and many ordered the cheese gratin udon. It looks very delicious in the menu picture but it has mixed reviews according to my friends. Those who love cheese loved this dish but others thought it was way too heavy and cheesy.For appetizers, the scallop carpaccio and beef tataki is a must. Scallop carpaccio - extremely fresh and decent sized raw scallops topped with some roe and creamy sauce Beef tataki- it is worth your money and make sure you go early to order it because they sometimes run out! It is that popular!"
12/7/2013,20131207,5,4.18,"I came here with my girlfriends and luckily we can all chat till our mouths fall off because the wait was long. It was about a 45 minute wait until we were seated, but boy was it worth the wait!We all love uni so we ordered the sea urchin ramen! A girlfriend had been here previously and told us that it was absolutely amazing, so the three of us all ordered it and were very happy we didn't share. We didn't get to try the other things on the menu, but who cares? The uni ramen is absolutely spectacular!!!!!!!!! The ramen noodles are so fresh, you see them being made! How cool is that?!?!"
12/7/2013,20131207,4,4.18,"stopped in on a rare cold night in LA. LOVED this place. went in a little early so we beat the dinner rush. uni udon was SO GOOD! love how they have a window to show you how they make the noodles! Parking is a little tough. if you are lucky you'll find metered street parking, or else you have to park in a lot."
12/8/2013,20131208,5,4.19,"This restaurant is so popular there's a list of rules for being on the waiting list.It's half enthusiastic udon-shoveling patrons and half waiting, gawking, bar-adjacent patrons watching the guy in the open kitchen roll out and slice udon. He does this nonstop, never pausing once, not to wipe his brow or rest his arms from all the flour-slapping and firm rolling and paper-cutter manhandling.We were fifth on the waiting list and waited about 20 minutes. For L.A., it was cold (50 degrees) so we squished ourselves against the wall and tried not to obstruct the throngs coming in to sign their names on the list.Enough about all that, though. Their udon is amazing, well worth the $12+ price tag and served in wide-rimmed, deep platter-bowls. I thought I was coming for the sea urchin udon, but I saw it being devoured on various tables as I was waiting and knew it'd be too rich for me after three bites (I've had the same problem at Maruhide and Hiro). So I got the mentai squid butter udon, hoping it'd quell my rich seafood cravings without putting me into a cream coma.This it did. The squid was so tender it was practically whitefish in my mouth, with no hint at all of rubber band. The cod roe covered the whole bowl in tiny pinhead pops, lending just a tiny bit of back-of-the-throat spice when eaten in spoonfuls. They stuck well to the noodles, which themselves had a flavor, and a strong pleasant bite and texture for that matter - not wormy at all. I watched the guy make the udon too, and there is an insane amount of flour in it to keep it from sticking to the cutting contraption. I was expecting it to be unpleasantly floury, or starchy. It wasn't.My mom's duck nanban noodles were similarly excellent, with a clear broth that somehow also had a lot of depth. The duck slices were tender and the fat left on for gleeful chewing.Jonathan Gold, in his review, maintains their traditional udon (bukkake, zaru, kakiage, etc) is better than their creative udon (mentai squid butter, uni) but I think the best thing to do is order one of each and share with a friend. Both have their own strengths and sharing keeps either flavor from getting tiresome."
12/8/2013,20131208,5,4.19,"Is there much else I can add to what has already been written? No. But I am in love with this place. The mesmerizing and adroitness way they make the udon, the texture of the udon, creamy and generous portions of uni, the tempura - it's all good to me. Normally, I do not care for or like fushion-type dishes, and at first, I was skeptical at how a creamy white sauce would work with Japanese noodles. Somehow, it does, and it is amazinggg.Even though it's a pretty small restaurant, the wait is often much shorter than the over-hyped Daikokuya next door. Service is average with the servers staying busy.I rave about this place to everyone. Yes. Everyone."
12/8/2013,20131208,3,4.19,"I went to this place for the Saturday dinner. I tried the beef hot soup udon. Good point is the soup. The soup was well prepared and tasty. Bad point is the udon. They said this is the real udon but it was not... And the service was slow. There were 3 or 4 people working at that time and it was not that busy time, but it took more than 10 minutes to get our udon. One tip: if you couldn't find your favorite tempura or there were only old and cold tempura, you can ask to cook new tempura. It was the good point for us."
12/8/2013,20131208,4,4.18,"Signature noodles are the best! We got the miso carbonara, mentai squid butter and sea urchin creamy udon noodles and they were all delicious! Little pricey for udon, but well worth the experience :)"
12/8/2013,20131208,4,4.18,The uni udon is creamy and special and the beef udon has a lot of beef and the soup is not bad as well. Love their udon.
12/10/2013,20131210,4,4.18,"Who knew that this place was right next to Daikokuya? But anyways - I've been wanting to try this place for the LONGEST time and finally my well-awaited visit was worth it!!Our party of 4 came here for lunch and there was probably about a 20 min wait. We ordered the miso carbonara, mentai squid butter, and sea urchin udon!! I didn't get to try the miso carbonara, but the word from my friends is that it's delicious.Mentai squid butter: great presentation once it comes to your table! The broth is absolutely flavorful with the pink squid eggs. The udon noodles are absolutely delicious! Slurp slurp slurp! (4/5)Sea urchin udon: I am a huge fan of uni (sea urchin) and when I tried a bite, my stomach just wanted even more! Overall, the flavors are spot on with the perfect amount of creaminess. This is probably my favorite one. I will definitely get this one next time! (5/5)Also, I ordered the Jidori egg, which is basically a tempura soft-boiled egg. I heard great reviews about this one, however it just tasted like a normal soft-boiled egg. The tempura batter was a bit plain. I will probably skip this option next time.Overall, I love the signature udon noodles! There are other udon choices available if you're more interested in their classic broth. Service can be a bit slow because this small place is always packed with customers - so it's not really too much of a biggie. The prices can be a bit expensive, but it's well worth the experience to try these specialty udon noodles!TIP - depending on where you sit, you can watch one of their chefs make the handmade udon noodles. It's pretty neat!!"
12/10/2013,20131210,4,4.18,"So i get my soup cravings and then first to comes to mind is Daikakuya. Well good thing, Daikakuya always has the freaken longest waits or else I would of never discovered this awesome alternative for my soup cravings. This is the place is you want Udon, yes udon is in the soup family and their noodles are the bombdizzle. I've been to Japan before and had their handmade noodles of udon and I must say this place is just as good! The noodles are delish! I had the champon udon which was a mix of ramen style broth with seafood and udon noodles- totally fixed my Daikakuya fix. =D I was happy and satisfied. My boyfriend had the Kaage udon (check spelling I forget) and it was pretty good, very simple and authentic. It is when you have udon noodles in a hot big bowl well looking dish and grab noodles and mix with hot udon soy sauce with your personal customization of tempura flakes, daikon radish, chili powder, and scallions. It was basically eating handmade udon noodles with your own mix of flavors that you preferred. I will definitely go to this place again and try their curry udon and clams one."
12/11/2013,20131211,4,4.18,"I love udon and I love uni so you know exactly what I ordered here. To my surprise, more than enjoying that actual flavor of the uni udon, I fell in love with the freshly made noodles. They were truly the star of the dish despite the luxurious taste of the uni cream sauce. In fact, the reason they get four stars is because I was underwhelmed by the sauce. In addition, the sauce is very, very creamy which called for an order of ginger. For an extra 50 cents, it didn't seem all that worth it because it was extremely salty and not very palate cleansing as I had hoped. Regardless, the noodles at Marugame Monzo are memorable and definitely noteworthy."
12/12/2013,20131212,5,4.19,"The best udon ive had in america. The texture was perfect. ""Mochi mochi, koshi ga atta(for you japanese folks)""I got the lunch special so i had the ume shiso udon with kakiage don. The kakiage was perfectly done as well. Very crispy, big shrimps and other seafood. The udon maker bowed and thanked me through the window. So no problem with customer service either."
12/12/2013,20131212,4,4.18,Maragame Monzo is a worthy replacement to the old Fat Spoon. The udon noodles are delicious but I do prefer the fusion dishes over the traditional items as they are more unique and flavorful.
12/13/2013,20131213,5,4.19,"Everyone else has covered it, so I will just add 5 stars for giggles. someone at your table should get the gratin udon. Oh, my gatos! delicious (but not heart smart).The noodles are the best I've had, but then again, that's expected when they're hand made in front of you."
12/15/2013,20131215,4,4.19,"Looks like Daikokuya has a worthy adversary right next door...It was a Saturday night, my friend & I walked by the typical horde of Daikokuya sidewalk waitlisters & put our names on the Marugame Monzo's 5-minute waitlist. Unlike Daikokuya, Monzo handmakes their noodles in-house. Here, noodles are of the udon variety. We sat at the bar-style table facing the glass-encased kitchen where I was mesmerized more than half of the time by the marathon noodle-making process.Our starter was the scallop carpaccio, which had a heavy wasabi flavor. We both ordered the uni cream udon for our main...it was a large serving & VERY rich. Overall, very enjoyable...I'll definitely be back.Game plan for next time:1. Order family style to experience different flavors 2. Order tempura."
12/16/2013,20131216,5,4.19,"This may not be the authentic udon that you know of. But this is definitely authentic Japanese new age udon that I haven't found anywhere in LA yet. Don't come here if you are in a hurry. There is a wait here, but that didn't stop me from trying this udon place that I've heard so much about. We waited about 30 minutes which didn't seem that bad. The seats are very tight, sitting probably a foot or two away from the person sitting at the other table lol. That is typical Japanese noodle shop seating arrangement, the 5 red stars still stands.I decided to be adventurous and tried the Creamy Uni Udon. Wow~ this is definitely what they call a Udon Pasta~ very flavorful, and delicious! My friend warned me that it might be too creamy but it was just perfect for me. I must come back here to try their other Udon Pastas~ The wait outside may be long, but the service inside is very fast and efficient. In the midst of the busy crowd, our server did not fail to be consistently attentive throughout.If you haven't been to Little Tokyo, parking isn't the most convenient. They do have $5 parking lots across the street. If you are lucky, you may find street parking right in front of the restaurant~ which i did! ^_^V"
12/16/2013,20131216,5,4.19,"Finally made a second visit since I had friends in from out of town. Being that it was 80 degrees on this LA winter day, I decided to eat cold udon and I had the ikura oroshi. The presentation was beautiful with the delicate salmon roe atop a shiso leaf and a large heap of grated daikon on the side. The noodles were still nice, however I think you can appreciate the chewiness more when they are served in a hot broth."
12/16/2013,20131216,5,4.19,"Pros: The best udon noodles I've had.Cons: Parking will be hard to find and there may be a wait.Overall: The best udon noodles I've had. Oh my bad, I said that already."
12/20/2013,20131220,4,4.19,"Hand made udon noodles, what more can I say. A friend of mine came into town so we made the drive east to seek out Monzo, which is right across the street from Little Tokyo plaza and right next to Daikokuya. There was about 30 min of waiting time since it was about 8pm, but we got seated pretty promptly. The tea was complementary, which is so nice to see when so many japanese restaurants charge for tea. We ordered uni udon noodles, which were creamy and fantastic. In the end it may have been a little too creamy for me since I could not finish all of it, but overall a terrific experience!"
12/21/2013,20131221,5,4.19,"this place has been bookmarked for the longest time and i have never ever noticed it before. omg, its like right next to daikokuya!! i even went there this week and why did i not see this place then? i am seriously going to frequent this place from now on. forget daikokuya, i'm more of an udon person than ramen.the reason why I had this place bookmarked was all because of SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON. i love sea urchin (uni). i can eat it all day everyday if possible. oh em gee, their sea urchin cream udon was so delicious. it had A LOT of UNI i mean MORE than what you would imagine. i liked that. Cream sauce was rich in uni flavor and it was just so good. As i am writing this, i am craving it again. Also had pork belly udon(hot). The broth was awesome. Not too strong or bland, I really liked it. I usually always eat the noodles and never eat the broth but it had really flavorful broth. As we all know by now, theres a guy making udom noodles right by the kitchen area (open kitchen) and it is good to see that we get to eat what he made not those frozen udon noodles you see at Mitsuwa or Marukai. Only thing 'eh' was that the noodle was a little too long. i guess it really wouldnt matter that much if you are having your own bowl of udon but since i was sharing with 2 of my other friends, it was a little hard to cut the noodles or just getting the noodles to my own plate.Also tried beef tataki. Plating was absolutely pretty with a flower. It had some red pepper chunks and i can see some people might not like it. but I didnt care. it was some what drenched in olive oil but it was very good.Another appetizer was grilled chicken with soshi sauce. What is soshi sauce? Its grated ginger sauce. it was very unique. my friend thought the dish as a whole was way too bland but she likes strong flavors and sauces. On the other hand, I dont enjoy eating too salty or strong food. Not to mention I dont like sauces. I dont eat any sauces when eating stuff. Weird? Its true.Service was quick and the waiter/waitresses were super polite and nice. The bill came out to $56 ish and it was worth every penny!If you dont want to be waitlisted, it is best to go right when they open for dinner which is 5:00 PM. My friends and I were seated right away and as we were eating, all the tables and bar seats were full and saw people waiting. Though, I think its worth waiting. I want to come back and try my other favorite, Mentaiko udon and some tempura!"
12/22/2013,20131222,5,4.2,"So creamy. So delicious. So GOODD!!Many people had suggested for me to try Marugame. So of course, can't pass an opportunity to try something new. Besides... I love UDON!!!It's nestled in Little Tokyo and if it wasn't for Daikokuya, probably even hard to find. When we were searching for the joint, the only way I found it was the massive crowd all waiting outside of Daikokuya. I almost accidentally walked into Daikokuya on bc of all the people waiting but it's a couple doors down and compared to the wait, it was not bad at all even on a Saturday.It's a lot bigger inside than it looks. But all screams typical Japanese. I loved every part of it. The decor, the waiter staff, even the clear window to watch the chefs hand make all the noodles. I of course tried the sea urchin udon while the BF ordered the carbonara. The sea urchin was so delicious and creamy! OMG I couldn't get enough. The sea urchin had the perfect saltiness to balance out the heavy savory cream. The only thing I wished was for more UNI!! For those who aren't seafood lovers, the carbonara is the way to go! The creamy broth tastes just like bacon!! Who doesn't like bacon?!This place is so different and so good compared to the typical udon that I've tried. It's a definite must try in the LT area!!"
12/22/2013,20131222,3,4.19,"I really wanted to like this place more because I love noodles and soup (together or separate), but I just thought it was ok. We went on a weeknight and the place was pretty busy. We ordered a couple appetizers to start - the fried chicken and the tuna tar tar (?). The fried chicken was bland and needed a lot of salt or something, even with the dipping items that came with the dish. The tuna tar tar was good, but it was work having to put it together, haha. I ordered the pork belly udon with the eggplant and chilly oil add-ons. Your meal adds up cuz of the add-ons and therefore gets pricey for a bowl of udon. The pork belly in my dish was really good though, but not sure I want to pay $15 and up for a bowl of udon."
12/22/2013,20131222,4,4.19,"I ordered the Uni and I loved it. It wasn't too seafood-y. We also ordered a dish consisting of tuna, seaweed, and cucumbers. You get to build your own mini hand roll. That was my favorite!"
12/24/2013,20131224,4,4.19,"Had uni pasta for the first time. It was so good and my coworker had some squid ink pasta. Really good too. the squid was tender.Had a pork belly bowl which was really good but little saltySecond time had the same uni pasta (maybe because it was the second time, it wasnt as good as the first)Friend had beef udon. But wasnt anything special"
12/27/2013,20131227,5,4.19,"I'm a sucker for handmade noodles and pasta, so when I discovered Marugame Monzo it was a no-brainer that I had to visit this joint. We ordered to mentai squid butter udon and the uni cream udon based on the recommendations of our server. Both dishes were very rich and creamy. The uni cream udon was good, but I liked the mentai squid butter better to be quite honest. I can't say that I would order these dishes again, as they were almost too rich to finish, but I can't wait to come back to try some of their other udon offerings."
12/27/2013,20131227,5,4.2,"Be still my heart! Chef is making fresh udon noodles right in front your eyes!Mentai Squid Butter UdonMiso garlic clamsCold mug of AsahiDELICIOUS!!I've had their Uni Udon too which is awesome, but I've been craving the mental squid butter ever since!Get there before 6:30 if you can to avoid a wait for dinner.Enjoy!"
12/27/2013,20131227,5,4.2,The food we is amazing. I love the Creamy Uni Udon and the Monzo Capresse. This food is seriously close to deathrow last meal good. The preices are reasonable and they make the udon noodles in house in front of you. I recommend trying the unfiltered saki that looks like it has snow in the bottom of the bottle. The service is always good.
12/28/2013,20131228,1,4.19,"I was really disappointed in my experience here. Our group of 6 had to wait for 1 hour and 30 minutes to be seated, which, on a Saturday night is understandable. The fried chicken that we ordered tasted strongly of ginger. The soft boiled tempura egg was actually very delicious with the chili powder/soy sauce combo included with the chicken. However, I was very disappointed with the creamy sea urchin udon. It was extremely creamy - like pasta alfredo. I couldn't even eat three bites before I regretted it. I asked the waitress if I could get something else since to me, it was inedible. She said that since they already served it, there was nothing they could do. So I was out $16 (not including the 18% gratuity added for a group of 6) with a barely touched bowl of udon and I was still very hungry. I haven't been this disappointed in a restaurant in a LONG time. I should've gone next door to Daikokuya for a $9 bowl of amazing ramen.EDIT: Both my sister and my boyfriend got sick after eating the creamy sea urchin udon. I dodged a bullet by not finishing mine."
12/29/2013,20131229,5,4.19,"There are few unique dining experiences in this city. This is definitely one of them. Lots of people know and love ramen but UDON is really the way to go!  Soft, fat noodles in a delicate broth. And this udon is made fresh before your eyes. Just go with the basic udon and order all the sides of tempura they offer, especially the red ginger. And be sure you sit at the counter!"
12/30/2013,20131230,5,4.19,"There are lots of pho and ramen houses, but I can't say I've heard of an udon house, until now. They serve udon freshly made in-house, putting on a show for everyone to see!They have a lot of different udon dishes on their menu, but seriously just order the Uni Udon ($16)... Fresh, creamy, tasty. Add a tempura soft-boiled egg ($1.50) and some chili oil ($0.25).It's a really small restaurant. We waited an hour for a table for 4. Metered parking or nearby parking structures. Credit cards accepted."
12/30/2013,20131230,5,4.2,Best udon spot I've had! Their signature dishes are amazing and the side of tempura choices they have... WOW. Tempura soft boiled egg? YUM! Even the more simple dishes are great because the quality of their udon noodles are perfect. Just the right amount of soft and chewy.Definitely coming back.
12/30/2013,20131230,4,4.2,"Handmade udon at the spot makes the restaurant worth going with such a long line everyday! The udon texture was awesome! I tried the famous uni udon. However, the cream sauce was a little overpowering. It would be perfect if it was not too creamy to taste the uni and the udon. I will prob come back and try the clear soup or cold udon. And the fried boiled egg was not as a expected (overrated)."
12/30/2013,20131230,4,4.2,"I've been here 2 times. Location: little tokyo. street parking or look for a nearby parking garage/lot.Ambiance: noisy. It's a small shop yet loud! I would recommend going with a party of 4 or less. LONG (1 hr+) wait times. I try to get there right before they open.Service: Average. They are so busy that they don't really take the time to check up on you. If you need something, speak up.Prices: On the pricier side...I love it, but noodles really shouldn't cost this much. $12-$16.Food:Handmade udon is a plus! Try their specialties over the traditional broth. - Duck udon: The duck was a little chewy and there was minimal toppings. Broth was savory though!- pork belly udon: Pork belly is so good, but they give you an extremely fatty cut so I felt a little gross eating it.- Uni cream udon: SO GOOD. The uni is not *super* fresh but my stomach was fine. the dish really captured the ""essence of uni""...in terms of smell and taste. I feel like they started skimping on the uni though.- Mentai squid butter udon: ALSO SO DELICIOUS. Very, very rich.- Spicy tuna-don: Way too much mayo. ugh. and a bit salty.Overall: Share/split your dishes with a broth udon and a creamy udon because it takes way too much willpower to finish one type on your own. This place isn't my favorite udon place but I like that they have unique menu options."
1/1/2014,20140101,3,4.19,There's something hearty and comforting about a bowl of udon that ramen just can't capture. Though the uni cream is an eye grabber and begs ordering it really is a bit too heavy for a main course dish and should only be ordered to be shared. Try the other lighter broths and grab a couple inventive tempura bites as sides.
1/1/2014,20140101,5,4.19,best udon ever!!! but i did wait for a really long time to get a table!!
1/2/2014,20140102,5,4.2,"Can't believe I haven't wrote a review for this place!Located next to Daikokuya, this place is slightly bigger but the line is always longer, simply because of these 3 words: freshly made udonVongole-I am obsessed with clams, especially when the place is generous about them. Bathed in their white buttery broth, these clams were extra delicious! The broth is flavorful (a little too salty for my taste, but I don't mind having to drink more water for it) and the udon is chewy and cooked perfectly.The wait is usually at least 30 minutes, but definitely worth it. Try to grab the counter seats, those udon-making masters are so amazing that it's a show of its own."
1/3/2014,20140103,4,4.2,"Four plus.We waited about 40? minutes to get in, but that was because our party was huge and they had to clear out the whole bar area for us.The udon here is pretty firm, and the portion is generous.I got the wakame (seaweed), though I kind of wished for an egg, but I think that's a ramen topping.The whole time, I kept watching the guy rolling/cutting udon behind the glass.A touch pricey, but the servers actually speak Japanese, so it made me feel nostalgic since I had just returned from Japan."
1/3/2014,20140103,4,4.2,"Yum, hand made udon noodles can't be beat. Awesome texture and good broth. You gotta be careful though, all of the add-ons are very tempting (extra noodles, rice, sides, etc), but at $2-4 a pop, we got stuck with a $120+ bill for 4 adults, 2 kids at the end of the meal.Nice atmosphere and good service, but get there as early as possible, because the lunch line is a beast.We'll be back."
1/3/2014,20140103,3,4.19,Decent overpriced udon shop. Can't stand the long lines either. I'll pass and stick to my goto spots.
1/5/2014,20140105,4,4.19,"Tiny restaurant, freshly made udon, Japanese-speaking servers. Doesn't get more authentic than that!I've heard of this place via YouTube vloggers and a friend I was having dinner with had been and recommended it so we decided to go. It was a Saturday night at 7:30pm so we expected it to be crowded. It was definitely busy, but we got lucky and were seated immediately at the bar area. Their menu contains different styles of udon: hot, cold, and even fusion/gourmet ones. I ended up trying their Kakuni Udon which comes with green onions and fatty pork belly chunks. UM they weren't kidding when they said fatty - these were some of the fattiest and chunkiest pieces of pork belly I've ever had. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but since they were so generous with it (mine came with 3.5 pieces) it started to get to be too fatty and exhausting to eat all of them, lol.Now I'm not sure if I was just biased about the noodles since I was watching the chef hand roll and cut the noodles himself, but they were really good. I'm used to only eating udon from the packaged ones at Japanese markets, so it was nice to experience the real taste and texture of handmade ones. The texture was on point - light, bouncy, and the perfect amount of chewiness. The broth was just right, not too salty or flavorful to take away the taste of the pork belly. They serve it in a pretty big bowl, but trust me, you're not getting gypped! The serving size was just enough to make me feel satisfied and only a hint of discomfort of eating too much aka the best feeling after eating a good meal. Prices are actually pretty normal which surprised me since I thought they would charge more since they make the udon fresh. My pork belly udon was ~$13 and that's the price I would expect to pay at any other Japanese restaurant.Overall, a great udon spot with a fun experience to see your noodles being made fresh right in front of you (if you sit at the bar) without paying an arm and a leg. A definite win in Little Tokyo :)"
1/6/2014,20140106,3,4.19,"I came here on a Sunday at around 6 pm and there were a grip of people waiting outside already. I think it opens up at 5pm... We had to put our name down and wait 20 mins approximately. This place is mainly a udon place. They do serve other Japanese appetizers, but come here if you're craving udon. Everyone talks about the uni udon served at this place, and I'm a sucker for hype. People told me it was not going to be cheap, but I didn't know it was going to be 20 bucks a pop. Yeah, its about 16 bucks, but after you factor in the tip and tax, it comes out to about 20 bucks per bowl. And the kicker is that it doesn't even fill you up... I had to go across the street and get additional food.The uni udon is good though...but I don't think I'd get it again. It has a creamy/milky texture. And I don't know if the uni used in this dish is at all fresh. I don't know if it is because you won't be able to tell since its mixed in with milky broth... Apparently, if you sit at the bar area, you can see the people making your noodles. So its kinda cool to incorporate the idea of an open kitchen at an udon place. parking is hard to come by at this place. So I guess if you can't find street parking, you can always park right across the street and pay 8 bucks for parking."
1/6/2014,20140106,4,4.19,"Went to meet a friend for a double date and she wanted to eat ramen at Daikokuya. When we arrived there however there were about 40 people ahead of us. Is that a surprise? No of course it isn't but I wasn't willing to wait that long either. So I pulled up my trusty yelp app, looked at my bookmarks and realized that Marugame was only 2 store fronts down! The wait there was only 5 minutes so we went ahead and traded the ramen for the udon. They specialize in udon noodles and the menu is categorized into three different types of udon: hot, cold, and signature. I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. I have to say the Mentai Squid Butter Udon was extraordinary. The noodle was cooked perfectly al dente, the squid pieces were nicely buttered, and the mentaiko (marinated roe of pollock or cod) was well-flavored. I can't remember what my companions ordered although I tried a bit of each of theirs. I can tell you what we all agreed on was that mine was the best by far. That's not to say the others weren't good, but the food is very authentic and the taste of the traditional udons are light while I enjoy myself a nice punch in the face of flavor which the Squid Butter provided. I'll definitely come here again as I still have to taste what the Uni Udon has to offer. Highly recommend the place."
1/6/2014,20140106,4,4.19,"Quality udon made on the spot. I've only had the cream sauces so far but they are pretty awesome. The carbonara and must get uni udon is top notch. Add on a pork belly (thin sliced) rice bowl for $3 more.There will probably be a line, but it moves pretty quickly.Tip: the meters in front of the apartment buidlings off of Alameda are cheaper."
1/6/2014,20140106,4,4.19,"Since last December, I have visited Marugame Monzo (MM) more than 3 times and have enjoyed it every time. With the odd weather we are experiencing in LA, a nice hot bowl of udon makes the cold nights seem warmer. During peak dinner hours, you will notice there is a good amount of people standing in front of the store. Although it may seem like a long wait, the list moves quickly. Especially for pairs! This store is small, so coming with a group of 4 or more will have a longer wait. If you are driving by you can often confuse the wait out front with patrons for Daikoukuya as it is next door.Marugame offers a variety of ways to eat their fresh udon whether it is hot/cold or a specialty concoction. A regular bowl of hot udon (Kake Udon) is $6.95 and includes just the udon, broth, tempura flakes, and green onions. Additional toppings and tempura begin at $1 and up. Therefore, the prices for each bowl can get relatively expensive. You can get a double portion of udon for an additional $2.Overall, Marugame Monzo serves up a great simple bowl of udon. The udon noodles are fresh and has a great chewiness to it. But the fancier you make your bowl the more expensive it is going to be. Try it out,, if you're willing to shell out ~$10 - 12 bucks for a bowl of udon.Parking in Little Tokyo is never fun. If you're up for the challenge meter parking are available and there are lots in the area."
1/6/2014,20140106,5,4.19,"Here at Monzo, be prepared for a wait. Especially is there is party of more than 4. It can be as long as an hour and a half. But once you settle down and get to order, everything changes. Like good comfort food, get the specialty udons. I'd recommend Mentai cream (not squid). Or for a little more money, get the uni udon. All good and all addicting. If you want something more traditional, go for the Kage.Extra toppings can be added, and not overpriced. I came in with 4 people, spent 60 bucks, which isn't bad.Come on the weekend, if you don't want to wait. Remember to come with the FULL PARTY or you will lose your spot."
1/7/2014,20140107,5,4.19,"I had to do it! 5 stars!The night started out with my lady saying ""Let's meet my friend in Little Tokyo for dinner."" Cool.... I love Little Tokyo!She then sends me a link to Marugame... and I see a few pics. Ok... looks promising. The pictures alone look delicious. I am game.So we get there just after they opened and there was no wait. We opted to sit at the counter (not sure why, but hey I'm no sucker... let the women lead the way ;))We sat in front of a glass cage! NO JOKE :) Well in that cage was a very skilled noodle maker. Yep... they cut their own noodles! I posted some pictures.Here is what we ordered:(2) Mentai Squid Butter Udon(1) Uni Cream Udon (me)The bowls were placed in front of us and I could not wait to dig in! OH BOY! The Uni cream udon was as creamy and delicious as it looks in the pictures. It was so good that I was reluctant to share... but hey, sharing is caring, right?! Besides, this meant I also got to taste the Mentai Squid :PBoth were delicious, but the Uni was hands down my favorite! I finished it COMPLETELY! If you like Uni... make sure you try this dish. Thank you Marugame and thanks to my lady who chose the perfect spot! I WILL BE BACK!"
1/7/2014,20140107,4,4.19,"Beef Udon = It was very tasty. The broth was very clear, yet hardy. The udon was awesome! Perfect texture = Udon Classic soup-based udon done competently! The noodles weren't overcooked and the broth wasn't heavy!Uni Cream Udon = most expensive item on the menu. I had a taste of it. The textures of the Uni and cream sauce worked, but the flavor of the sauce sort of overpowered the uni. It was still tasty and made for a delectable swallow.Beef Tataki = Love the presentation and the pickled veggies/ red peppercorns, but it was okay. I thought the beef was too thick, but it was decent.Porkbelly bowl = It was surprisingly good! The pork LOOKED flavorless, but it was full of flavor and the rice was cooked to perfection. Usually... the rice is softer at other Japanese restaurants, but I love the perfect rice!OVERALL = GO FOR THE UDON! I will definitely return to try the cold udon next time because I'm a fan of cold noodles. Service is great and efficient! There is a wait so be prepared for it. :)It's not a big place, so seating for a big party can get difficult because they will have to wait for adjacent small tables to be ready in order to seat one large party."

1/8/2014,20140108,3,4.19,"Marugame Monzo. Uni Udon. I'm not even a fan of uni, but since it's what this place is supposedly famous for, I thought I'd give it a shot. Not bad..but not great. The texture is literally EXACTLY like fettuccini alfredo. You will agree with me on this one, trust. The uni flavor isn't very distinct unless you're actually eating the uni in it, which I appreciated. While eating with Jeff K., another Yelp Elite, we both concluded that one addition to the dish that would go perfectly with it is some sort of bread. Not garlic bread, because this isn't pasta, but if they made a bread lightly seasoned with furikake it would go PERFECTLY with this dish. Seriously, Marugame Monzo, get on that ish.Not much else to say otherwise, and trust me, I would say more if there was more. Although the udon was good, this place didn't necessarily blow me away."
1/8/2014,20140108,3,4.19,"I went here on a Saturday night, around 8pm. The line wasn't too bad, but we still had to put our name on the waiting list. There was about 5 names before ours, so my boyfriend and I decided to go on a short walk while we waited ... DON'T DO THAT! Turns out the line goes by pretty fast, so our name had to be put on the bottom of the list again.The place is very tiny, so it might not be good for big parties. There's also a guy there who makes fresh udon, and he's there protected inside a glass wall, so it felt like he was inside a fish tank, haha. If you want to watch him make fresh udon, make sure to ask that you be seated by the bar.My boyfriend got udon with Kakuni (fatty pork). He liked it. Contents= about 3-4 pork pieces, udon noodles, green onions. Pork was indeed fatty and juicy. Noodles were mighty tasty and fresh. It was his first time having real udon and he was quite satisfied. I got udon with duck. Aesthetically, it looks very plain. It was just udon, duck, and 4 green onions swimming in the broth. I was disappointed because I prefer my plate to be more of a party. But it was alright. If you want more party taste, then you can add more meats and veggies! (but will cost more)Parking- park in the nearby Little Tokyo mall, and you could walk to the restaurant. It's only a block away and $4 on the weekends. As for payment, about $30 should be fine for a dinner for two. I don't think they take AMEX (booo), so just bring a Visa or Mastercard.Overall, it's good. But I'll only go back if I was in the area. For me, udon is a good alternative for noodle soup. But, I'd still rank ramen and pho above it."
1/8/2014,20140108,5,4.19,"if you love uni as much as i do or just the clean taste of sweet seafood flavor broths. YOu must, MUST get the uni-cream udon, you will not regret it. Do not share, if you care for the person that you are eating with order your own, this bowl is one thing that is best be eaten by you and you only. The Uni-Cream is rich but not overpowering, the sweet seafood hit your tongue first then finishes off with a uni-sweetness we all love and sought after. Like the first high or first sushi experience. $15-$16 kinda pricy but you are paying for quality and experience, well worth it. Remember to not slip the bowl, do yourself a favor and just order one. Appetizer: Beef Tataki - 2.5 out of 5, the beef is well cooked but lack in flavor, the pickled veggies and pepper corners carried the dish. Fried Chicken Skin - 4.5 out of 5, what else do you need, of course is good and well priced $4.50. Cheaper compare to the rest, for fried skin it isn't bad. P.S. save some and add it into the udon, it gives a nice crispy texture.Side:Tempura soft boil Egg; 3 out of 5, cool concept does not add any flavor to your dish, the egg lacks seasoning. Its just very awesome to look at while eating your udon. price is $1.50"
1/9/2014,20140109,5,4.19,Be prepared to wait for this place is popular! The specialty about Marugame Monzo is that they hand make their udon. You can watch them making it behind the the counter seating.I had lunch here with two cousins on a warm summer's day. It was pretty warm inside as their A/C was broken. They had one oscillating fan for the whole restaurant. But the warm weathe was not noticeable over the amazing food. Mushroom salad (5 stars) This salad my cousin ordered initially sounded simple and boring but it was actually very good. There was a medley of mushrooms in the salad which were slightly warm. The dressing was very flavorful. It shows that Margume Monzo can do more than just udon.Uni udon (5 stars) The creme de la cream. How could anything with uni not be amazin?! The uni udon is served in a cream sauce with uni pieces mixed in and a few whole uni placed on top. This I will come back for over and over again!Duck udon (3-4 stars) Next to the explosions of flavors in the mushroom salad and uni udon this fared in as okay. This bowl was a clear soup broth with a few sprigs of green onion and medallions of duck floating on top. Udon noodles on the bottom of the bowl. This is the choice I would go with if i were in the mood for something light.
1/9/2014,20140109,4,4.19,Came here for lunch for some udon and it was pretty good. We were able to get a table for four with a short wait. Nice you get to watch them make their own homemade noodles. Bowls are fairly large and filling as well.
1/10/2014,20140110,5,4.19,"Many people overlook this gem when they go to Daikokuya, but their hand made udon noodles are hard to beat. The prices are very reasonable and the portions sizable. I was very pleased with the fast service and did not have to wait long to be seated or for our order. It was also a treat to watch them making more noodles in the process. All around great experience will definitely be back!"
1/10/2014,20140110,5,4.2,"Hidden gem on 1st street in Little Tokyo. There's a glass window inside the restaurant, and you can see the guy making the noodles right there. Order the homemade uni cream special udon. AMAZING!!!! Buttery, creamy, rich, with a slight hint of uni flavor. I normally don't like uni, but that didn't stop me! They aren't stingy with their uni portions either ;) My friend ordered the beef udon (he isn't as experimental with foods) and enjoyed his soup as well. I thought the beef udon was a little plain for my taste. We added the egg and order the fried chicken as an appetizer. I wish I could teleport there now for more of that uni cream udon..P.s. this place is TINY! It can fit about 30 people max and if you need some dinner entertainment, just tune into your neighbor's conversation."
1/11/2014,20140111,4,4.19,"I was never udon's biggest fan,But sea urchin pasta was the plan.The creamy sauce was rich,It hit my pasta itch, The meal felt like a slice of Japan.Other recommended dishes: mentai squid pasta ($12.95); appetizer: pork belly Overrated: beef tataki (pricey, good serving size but not that special flavor-wise)Parking: street or nearby pay lots ($5-7)Payment: Cash or Credit CardWait time: 20-40 minutesNearby alternatives: Mr. Pizza, Daikokuya (next door neighbor)"
1/11/2014,20140111,4,4.19,"They hold their reputation on daily hand rolled and cut udon freshly prepared and made to order. The line quickly escalates after 5pm and the wait time is on average an hour so be prepared to get here around 4:45 or sooner to put your name down. The restaurant isn't big and can only sit maybe a dozen tables of 4. We came here after 5pm and already the wait was over an hour. Still, we had to try and see what the fuzz was all about. When I got my bowl of shrimp and tempura udon, I loved the crispy and lightly battered texture that tasted similar to the ones I've had in Japan. I can eat their tempura all day! It was very delicious and highly recommended. The udon was also very good but the broth was extremely bland. I was not a fan of the broth whatsoever.  I saw a lot of people ordering their Uni udon but since I don't like Uni, I opted to get a simple udon this time. I'll be back to try their seafood cream pasta. That might have more favor and taste. Overall, except for the broth, I loved everything else about Monzo!"
1/11/2014,20140111,5,4.2,"I'm definitely a fan! As if the crowd outside of Daikokuya next door wasn't bad enough, now there are even more people waiting around. I've been by twice so far. My first visit was in the middle of the weekend dinner rush.  That's just crazy-making.  The second time, I wisely arrived as the restaurant opened for lunch. If possible, sit at the counter so you can watch the noodle-making.Both times I opted for hot udon and I wanted to enjoy it as simply as possible. It doesn't get more basic than the KAKE UDON, hot udon in their special Sanuki-style broth with green onions and tempura flakes. I love the texture of the noodles and the broth is so clean yet flavorful. I thought the regular portion was enough, but you can double-down for $2 extra. The SHRIMP TEMPURA UDON is the other one I've tried, which is the same as the kake but with two large pieces of shrimp tempura on the side. If you like tempura, you have to get this. Both times I added their SOFT-BOILED EGG which also comes tempura battered."
1/12/2014,20140112,4,4.2,"In my second visit, I ordered the following Items1) Beef Tataki was exceptional. I didn't expect it to be a cold appetizer. I loved how the beef was slightly seared on the edges and marinated well. I even liked the toppings. I don't exactly know what they are, but the entire appetizer was delicious.2) Scallop appetizer - I thought that there wasn't much flavor. I won't be ordering this again.3) Curry Udon was dee-licious. This would be the first time I've ever tried curry with udon. As you can probably guess, it tastes just like Japanese curry. The consistency was a little lighter than your average curry. It was flavorful and wasn't overly salty."
1/12/2014,20140112,5,4.2,"I initially reviewed this place only a month ago but after my second visit, I had to mention one thing.CHAMPON UDON. Having had some form of a creamy pasta the night before, I wasn't feeling the uni udon again and wanted something more on the light and refreshing side. After carefully reading through the menu, it came down to a cold udon or the Champon Udon. I asked the waitress which one she preferred and she said Champon. Thank you lady, you changed my life.Maybe it's because I had no expectations whatsoever about this dish but the first sip of the hot champon soup was unbelievable. My friends, who I immediately made them try as well, were blown away. It's definitely a seafood broth because it had a very clean taste but it also had so much depth to it! I loved that it had a bunch of vegetables in the soup and the baby octopuses were so tender. I am not kidding when I say this may be one of my favorite dishes ever. It seems like everyone who goes here usually goes for the pastas or the more familiar types of udon but trying the Champon Udon reminded me of how rewarding it can be to explore the unknown! But don't trust the hype, go in with no expectations and see for yourself."
1/12/2014,20140112,4,4.2,"Came here upon many many recommendations. I f*king LOVE noodles, but tbh udon is not on my top list of faves. I used to love eating udon when I was younger (like in middle school), and I would order tempura udon whenever we eat at a Japanese place. But here we are years later, I'm not sure what happened - but I think I was introduced to ramen which became one of my favorite noodles ever. So I don't eat udon as much anymore, except when I eat shabu or something.But anyway, enough about my history with udon. I think I just wanted to say that I'm not regularly an udon person, but this place is definitely worth a visit (or ten). I ordered the uni cream udon, and a side of tempura egg as well as the beef tataki for app. My bf ordered the carbonara udon, which was also really good - super bacon-y.Beef tataki was good, although I didn't like the red peppercorn they sprinkled on. That's just my personal pref, but my bf didn't mind it. I just picked them off. Otherwise, the beef was perfectly tender and flavorful.The uni cream udon was delicious. I was debating between a soupy dish or a fusion dish, and I guess I chose uni because it seemed like a very popular choice. It had the perfect sea-creamy flavor of uni, but I do agree with a lot of people who say it's too heavy/rich. I knew the first moment I tasted it that I could not finish a whole bowl in one sitting lol.And on top of that I ordered the tempura egg, which I thought would be a contrast to the creamy uni (because it's crispy? lol), but it was an added creaminess because the yolk was like a cream waterfall. LOL nothing wrong with that, just noob of me to pair the two. But that egg was bomb, I would order it with a dish that's not as rich.NOTE: I re-heated the uni udon the next day, and while the noodles were softer (still good though), it was more tasty?? I thought it would be not-so-good, but for some reason I thought it was better lol. Anyway, will be back to try more of their other flavors!!"
1/13/2014,20140113,5,4.2,"Marugame Monzo is one of my most favorite restaurants ever in life. I don't even know how I could have not written a review about MM yet since I had it for the first time in the summer.Appetizers and rice bowls are spot on. Tuna Negitoro Rice Bowl. Please get it. A perfect ball of raw tuna on top of rice with seaweed strips and some kind of mayonnaise and sweet soy sauce blends perfectly in your mouth. I could eat a bowl of this by myself. Other appetizers worth mentioning are the garlic miso clams (can be soldout some days, on the salty side), steak tartare, scallop carpaccio. The porkbelly appetizer is meh.The fusion udon pastas here are to die for! I strongly recommend the Uni Cream Udon. It's not heavy at all and it comes with a good amount of uni. The Squid Mentai Butter udon is good too. It had a bit of a spicy kick to it with small fish roe cooked into the sauce.***The Udon Gratin is a baked cheese udon dish. It was too heavy for my liking but some people might like it.***The Curry Udon has a thick curry based soup. It's pretty salty and not one of my favorites.The traditional hot udons are very good with any of the add-ons (shrimp tempura, pork belly). And the udon noodles are made in the restaurant! It's pretty fun to watch the man making the udon while enjoying your meal! The soft-boiled egg tempura is also delicious as well!"
1/13/2014,20140113,3,4.2,"I ordered a uni udon for $15.99. I was sat at the counter which would see how to make the freshly cut udon through window. It's fun and nice to see the udon making process. However, I think the dish is a little bit over price. So little uni. Plus, the sauce is very stuffy. I feel like I am eating pasta instead of udon. Maybe I just like the traditional udon more. Service was so so too. I need to wave the waiter to place an order. Overall experience was ok."
1/14/2014,20140114,5,4.2,"My love for noodles...especially fresh noodles....I wish I had more than one stomach so I could eat multiple udon dishes at once. I couldn't decide between the uni cream udon and the mentai squid butter for the longest time. I secretly hoped that my bud Fattypie would order one of the two so I could be a fatty and have both.. But he went with the duck nanban udon DAMN YOU!I settled for the uni cream udon. We both ordered a jidori egg (tempura egg). The jidori eggs are disappointing. They are aesthetically pleasing but that's about it. They fall short in flavor. Perhaps the batter could use some seasoning? That would help. It's super bland and plain . Slop them up in your cream sauce or in your broth. The concept is still great though! The uni cream udon was amazing. Rich yet not overbearing. I couldn't stomach the entire dish because they give you SO MUCH. It's also hard to eat the uni cream udon gracefully because even a slow eater such as myself kept somehow flinging the uni cream everywhere.The duck nanban udon was also tasty. Some people have said that the duck is too tough, but I felt it was perfectly fine. Sliced duck breast sitting in hot broth, of course it is going to cook. If you don't eat it fast enough it will get tough! Eat faster! Or be smart and take it out of your bowl and dip it back in when you're ready to take a bite. Just a suggestion there.Still, Marugame Monzo is some top notch eats for noodle lovers like myself!"
1/14/2014,20140114,5,4.2,"Was recommended to check this place out after I mentioned that I liked carbonara at cheesecake factory. Had the Miso Carbonara and it was perfect. Came out exactly as I pictured it. A little more creamier than at cheesecake, which was a plus. Got the bill while my friend was still eating, found it a bit odd, but still took our time. Looking forward to another trip here."
1/14/2014,20140114,4,4.2,"It was great, fresh udon. I only give it four stars though because I have had better. The atmosphere is gorgeous and the wait is way less than the place next door. But don't wait too long to go because eventually it will be as crowded. I would recommend they give you more options of things to add to your soup and spice level."
1/14/2014,20140114,3,4.2,"I tried the uni udon after hearing great things about it, because I'm a big fan of uni, and a big fan of udon - what could go wrong?It wasn't an awful dish, but it was below average. The creamy, carbonara-like sauce just doesn't work with udon noodles. It was overly heavy and masked the fresh flavors of the uni, making the entire meal very one-note.On the plus side, I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles themselves. I'll come back to give their more traditional fare, which I've heard is much better, a try."

1/17/2014,20140117,5,4.2,"If you've never watched a silent Japanese man hand-making udon on loop, I strongly suggest you pay a visit to Marugame Monzo. Sit at the counter and stare to your heart's content as a man with the air of an artisan kneads and rolls out dough before cutting it into countless long noodles of udon. The process is mesmerizing, with an assured, soothing rhythm, and the noodle man doesn't make eye contact. He works behind glass, in full view but partitioned from the crowd in the restaurant, like an old sea turtle or whale shark in an aquarium. I've eaten here twice, both times with my mother, and I've made a point of sitting at that counter. Marugame is a very popular lunch spot, but though the restaurant seems consistently busy, getting seated has not been an issue. Be warned, though, that if you beat your lunch date, you'll have to wait to sit down even with plenty of tables available. Service is fast and polite if not exactly warm.The food is excellent, with a menu that splits between very traditional and very L.A. The focus is obviously on udon, and the fresh noodles are the restaurant's draw, delicious and lovely and seriously made. They're cooked just right, with a little firmness and bounce, and I've loved every bowl I've been given.If you want straight, pure udon, the zaru udon is a great choice - a portion of cold noodles served with dipping sauce on the side. You can mix in daikon, scallion, and ginger to taste, and top off with crispy little tempura flakes. This is a great way to taste the noodles, and the coolness is pretty refreshing. In general, I prefer hot udon, and there are a number of traditional options at Marugame. I've only tried the kitsune, but I expect it's representative, served in a warming umami-rich dashi broth. The kitsune comes with scallions and two rectangles of fried tofu on top. I love this fried tofu - on top of its wonderful inherent texture, it soaks up the broth so that every bite is heavy and leaking with flavor.The non-traditional bowls are at least as good, and I'd guess Marugame attracts more customers with squid butter than fried tofu. The mentai squid butter udon seems to be something of a signature dish, and it is kind of phenomenal. It's a hot bowl of udon in a buttered broth enriched with an ice cream scoop of mentaiko, a fine-grained, salty, marinated roe. The noodles come topped with dried seaweed and tender, supple hunks of cooked squid. A mouthful of Marugame udon with some squid and roe-studded broth - perfect. The uni cream is, incredibly, just as good. It's closer to a pasta, with a loose creamy sauce instead of a broth. The sauce is spectacular, flavorful, briny, and more or less saturated with sea urchin. It's lighter than you'd think, but never light on the uni. You have to slurp every bit of sauce to get every hunk of urchin. The udon comes topped with a shiso leaf (with a gratuitous lobe of uni nestled in the middle), and there's a subtle but effective taste of shiso in the sauce.If you want to supplement your udon, Marugame's kitchen offers some stellar non-noodle options. The assorted tempura is very good - a basket of shrimp, sweet potato, squash, eggplant, and shiso leaf, all tempura-fried to a shattering, satisfying crunch. At lunch, you can also add mini rice bowl to your order for $3, and I highly recommend this option. The negitoro-don is ridiculously tasty, a small bowl of rice topped with a mound of toro scallion tartare and a thick, sweet and salty, soy-based sauce. Some dried seaweed and a drizzle of mayonnaise finish the bowl, and though the latter looks somewhat unappetizing, I guarantee it is delicious.I work far enough from Little Tokyo that lunch at Marugame is a trip. I hope to make that trip as often as possible. The beautiful udon is worth a lot of hassle."
1/17/2014,20140117,2,4.19,"Went here for dinner last night. Ordered the following:Crispy chicken skin Shrimp tempura udon with a soft boiled egg on the sideCurry udon with shitake mushrooms and chili oil on the sideThe crispy chicken skin was great, the shrimp tempura udon was standard and my friend got the curry udon and she said it was good. My issue here isn't the food - it's the service. Our waitress brought over the check while we were still eating, which I consider to be very rude. After our plates were cleared, we lingered for about 10 minutes, TOPS, and were asked 5 times if our check was ready to be picked up. It seemed as if someone would ask us, walk away when we said no, and then send another waitress over to ask again not even 2 minutes later. There was no wait, and we were about to pay, but sheesh, would it be too much to ask to have a few minutes to decompress after the meal without being rushed out? OH! On top of that they charged us for 2 items we did not order and gave us attitude when we corrected them.Personally, I like the beef udon over at Taihei in Monterey Park a lot more than this place's udon. I hope they get their service together so I can come back and try some of their specialty items."
1/17/2014,20140117,5,4.2,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! My obsession for noodles continues and this place is always on point. My favorite udon so far has been the beef udon. The noodles are perfectly cooked and a heaping mound of shabu beef is placed on top. They have all kinds from the hot soupy or creamy to cold salad type noodles. I also would recommend the pork belly udon under the hot udon section. I know most people drool over the creamy, uni udon however it's a little too heavy for my liking. I would recommend sharing this one with another lighter udon if you are dining with a companion. Right next to Daikokuya so there will be a mob of people Friday-Sunday. I would suggest coming in smaller parties and before 6:30pm if possible. I like to sit at the bar so I can watch the udon noodles being made! Great addition to Little Tokyo. ---Parking: Meters on 1st street but good luck finding an open spot. Try parking in the lot on the corner of 1st and San Pedro/Judge John Aiso. They have the most reasonable hourly rates."

The kitsune comes with scallions and two rectangles of fried tofu on top. I love this fried tofu - on top of its wonderful inherent texture, it soaks up the broth so that every bite is heavy and leaking with flavor.The non-traditional bowls are at least as good, and I'd guess Marugame attracts more customers with squid butter than fried tofu. The mentai squid butter udon seems to be something of a signature dish, and it is kind of phenomenal. It's a hot bowl of udon in a buttered broth enriched with an ice cream scoop of mentaiko, a fine-grained, salty, marinated roe. The noodles come topped with dried seaweed and tender, supple hunks of cooked squid. A mouthful of Marugame udon with some squid and roe-studded broth - perfect. The uni cream is, incredibly, just as good. It's closer to a pasta, with a loose creamy sauce instead of a broth. The sauce is spectacular, flavorful, briny, and more or less saturated with sea urchin. It's lighter than you'd think, but never light on the uni. You have to slurp every bit of sauce to get every hunk of urchin. The udon comes topped with a shiso leaf (with a gratuitous lobe of uni nestled in the middle), and there's a subtle but effective taste of shiso in the sauce.If you want to supplement your udon, Marugame's kitchen offers some stellar non-noodle options. The assorted tempura is very good - a basket of shrimp, sweet potato, squash, eggplant, and shiso leaf, all tempura-fried to a shattering, satisfying crunch. At lunch, you can also add mini rice bowl to your order for $3, and I highly recommend this option. The negitoro-don is ridiculously tasty, a small bowl of rice topped with a mound of toro scallion tartare and a thick, sweet and salty, soy-based sauce. Some dried seaweed and a drizzle of mayonnaise finish the bowl, and though the latter looks somewhat unappetizing, I guarantee it is delicious.I work far enough from Little Tokyo that lunch at Marugame is a trip. I hope to make that trip as often as possible. The beautiful udon is worth a lot of hassle."
1/17/2014,20140117,5,4.19,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! My obsession for noodles continues and this place is always on point. My favorite udon so far has been the beef udon. The noodles are perfectly cooked and a heaping mound of shabu beef is placed on top. They have all kinds from the hot soupy or creamy to cold salad type noodles. I also would recommend the pork belly udon under the hot udon section. I know most people drool over the creamy, uni udon however it's a little too heavy for my liking. I would recommend sharing this one with another lighter udon if you are dining with a companion. Right next to Daikokuya so there will be a mob of people Friday-Sunday. I would suggest coming in smaller parties and before 6:30pm if possible. I like to sit at the bar so I can watch the udon noodles being made! Great addition to Little Tokyo. ---Parking: Meters on 1st street but good luck finding an open spot. Try parking in the lot on the corner of 1st and San Pedro/Judge John Aiso. They have the most reasonable hourly rates."
1/19/2014,20140119,4,4.19,"Came here today for the first time. I ordered the Kitsune Ramen. Turns out I'm actually not a big fan of aburage, but that didn't make this dish any less delicious. The broth itself was exceptional. Not too much saltiness, not too much sweetness... it was a perfect balance. Not only that, but the soup was light and simple. Not oily at all! The noodles, of course, were the main attraction. You can really taste that these noodles are fresh and they're cooked perfectly. What I liked most was that the noodles were so long! It made the meal not only tasty, but fun too!I tried a bite of the Mentai Squid Butter. I could definitely taste the mentai and the butter! It was good, but I think if I had ordered it I probably wouldn't have liked it after a few bites. Not my style, but to each his own."
1/19/2014,20140119,3,4.19,"Came here last night with the bf and a couple other people since Daikokuya was too crowded. We got there around 7:30 PM and didn't get seated until about an hour later but I was so hungry I didn't care. We were seated right in front of the window where the guy was making the udon and it was the coolest thing ever! Ordered the miso carbonara since my fellow yelpers recommended it. It was really good but for some reason my portion turned out waaaay smaller than the rest of the people in my party and I was kinda sad, so I finished my bowl early while looking at everyone elses bowls and kicking myself in the ass for not ordering something else... and for $12.50 i was expecting a lot more, so docking two stars for that. Service was good and attentive, but I don't think I'll be back unless I'm in the area."

And this place has some freaking good Udon.My go to order is the seaweed Udon with a side of plum paste to mix in and a rice ball with pork and miso. The noodles are perfect. So supple and firm. And it's fun to watch them being made in the window that the counter faces. I always leave happy and sated. Filled up with noodle goodness. I must admit, that I would LOVE to try the Uni version everyone raves about, but it is laden with cream sauce and being that I'm lactose intolerant, I can't partake...but I've seen it, and it looked glorious.Next time you're waiting an hour to get some Ramen a next door, give this spot a try instead. It's different, but amazing."
1/20/2014,20140120,4,4.19,"My friends and I were visiting LA n def wanted to try Daikokuya. The wait was 2 pages long so we decided to try their next door neighbor, Marugame Monzo, and thank God we did! We all ordered different udon dishes: uni, carbonara, shrimp tempura, curry and the pork belly one. Got to sample each and every single dish tasted amazing! I love that you can see the kitchen through the window, and right in front is the man himself making the udon noddles fron scratch! Makes it taste even better ;) Though we probably should have gotten this for an appetizer, we ordered the pork belly rice bowl towarss the end of our meal and we were BLOWN AWAY. It's such a simple dish- thinly sliced steamed pork belly over white rice- but for some reason it melted in our mouth and left us wanting more. A week after our trip and we are still talking about how good it was! I'd say def try it bc its only $5 and you will not be disappointed. I'll def be back next time I am in LA!! :)"

The restaurant is fairly small and they have some bar seating in the back where you can watch your udon being made.I didn't think that anything compared to Marukame Udon in Honolulu, but Marugame Monzo is just as great. I ordered the mentai squid butter udon and my friend orders the carbonara udon. Both were creamy, seasoned well, and very flavorful. I'd definitely recommend either choices. Service here was extremely fast. I had went to the restroom to wash my hands and our food was already at the table when I came back.Parking is typical for Little Tokyo, but I feel like there is always parking on 3rd st. if your'e ok with walking a few blocks over.

The place was still full at 8:30PM on a Monday, super popular.It didn't take us long to decide what to get because most people wrote about these two items in the review: uni cream and squid butter. Both were delicious, and the portion was perfect -- I was able to finish my noodle this time for a change. Highly recommended both. I will return and try different types next time, they've got so many to choose from, it will be fun!"

It comes with a side of mayonnaise and curry powder in which you can dip the chicken.Still despite the good food, I just hate waiting outside on a curb for a place unless the food is going to blow my mind. If you do decide to go, I recommend going right when it opens. I mean, maybe some people may LOVE udon, but this place was just average. I also feel a little crammed every time I go here. The last time I was here, my wife and I were sitting so close to a couple next to us that we could hear every little detail about their fight, about how the first thing the idiot boyfriend said to his condescending girlfriend when he picked her up was, ""You look tired,"" or some nonsense like that. She kept telling him how inconsiderate he was, and she was crying, in tears about 12 inches away from us. AWKWARD! And I know what you're thinking. What the eff does this have to do with a review for the restaurant? Well, as inappropriate as this may be for this review, it was that much more inappropriate for the couple to be having this argument in such a public place. And I would have avoided it all if only the place didn't feel so crammed!Anyway, if you want good udon, check this place out.

It was extremely bizarre to wait about 45minutes for a table for excellent udon while delicious ramen waited for customers to consume heaping bowls of the stuff.However, I waited it out and ended up with a 2-top close to the space of glass that showed off the excellent skill of making udon, a performance!I have only been once, and I tried the jidori egg, the duck udon, and the pork belly appetizer. All three were absolutely delicious, and my friend and I were excessively stuffed at meal's end. Now, I'm not udon expert - this was my first foray, and I must say that I am looking forward to a return for a chance to try more. My duck udon was flavorful, plentiful, and suited exactly what I was hoping for after spending a while trying to figure out which dish would best introduce me to udon.The service, I will say, was a bit brusque, but it did not distract from the quality or pleasure of the meal itself. The place is clearly popular, and the energy can be quite high and rambunctious in the evening.Have a little patience, have a little fun, and have a little udon."

1/28/2014,20140128,4,4.18,"Marugame Monzo! It's right next to Daikokuya, and if you can believe it, the line might be longer!My friend told me about this place and their Uni Udon and I was intrigued. I am a huge fan of Japanese style pasta, and it's even more intriguing that they use udon noodles instead of pasta. Between 6 people, we got:Appetizers- Beef Tataki: This comes with pink peppercorns, which I'm guessing is for the color. It was a bit overwhelming and i prefer to eat the beef without the peppercorns. The meat was a bit chewy as well. Not my favorite. - Chicken Karaage: standard Karaage but the inside is pretty tender compared to others. The flavor is a big bland, but it comes with mayo for dipping and curry powder. The curry powder is a good touch.-Pork belly don: Absolutely amazing. The flavors in the pork belly is so rich and delectable. Even the flavor was the rice is good. Possibly the best thing of the night, even over the Uni Udon.Entrees:- Sea Urchin Creamy Udon: Absolutely LOVED it. There is enough uni so you can get a small piece with every bite. Some people are saying there isn't enough uni flavor, but I absolutely tasted it. It's subtle but it's good that way because uni is very rich, and it could get to be too much very quickly. My friends who tried it said this was the best one of the night. - Curry Udon: I'm not used to seeing so much curry (like a curry soup) in curry udon, so it was a bit overwhelming. I prefer it to be more like a ""sauce"". However, the flavor was very good. - Kake Udon - Two of my friends got regular udon with a bunch of add-ons. The flavor of the broth was deep and once again, the hand cut noodles were nice and chewy in the broth. - Add ons: Karikage (fried veggie/shrimp/scallops) is huge and worth the money. The taste is great and the texture and nice and crisp. I did not get to try the fried egg, but two people that tried it said it was just meh. Apparently it does not have any flavor. Also according to the same people, the fish cake add on is very good.I can't wait to come back and try all the signature udon dishes. The mentai-squid butter and udon gratin is at the top of my list!"

The only down side is you have to pay for parking in the structure, but you can also walk around the area (everything is walk-able distance). I ordered the CURRY UDON and it was delicious! It's the perfect blend of udon and curry: not cheap water down flavor. My friend ordered the duck meat flavor, and the soup base is sweet and light. They have lunch menus, and we get to order the $4 special (with one udon order/limit one per person): negitoro on rice (pretty much mayonnaise on slice toro with rice).

But make sure to come hungry as the portions are for baby giants.And yes, just beware that the restaurant is super tiny and you're likely to bump or be bumped into while you noisily slurp your noodles."
1/30/2014,20140130,4,4.19,It's surprisingly good. Not like anything I had before. I tried the famous squid butter udon. It was really good. Both the sauce and the noodle are outstanding. Highly recommend.

It's free if you get it validated at Starbucks or Yogurtland. But don't spread this around because that means everyone is going to flock over there. FOODI say this in almost every restaurant review: Food tastes best when you're hungry. There are a lot of different dishes you can order, but since it was my first time here, I decided to stick with their Specialties. My friend and I ordered two dishes for both of us and just asked for two small plates on the side. This worked wonderfully.* Mentai Squid Butter (4/5) I was scared to try this because I've never tried cod roe before and just the name scared me. But HOLY MOLY. The soup was sooooo delicious, and there was so much cod roe in there! I know I definitely got my money's worth. The only downside of this was that it was suuuper salty. It was good for a whlie but towards the end (when I got full) it just got way too salty to bear. I was dying for water about 2 hours after eating this.* Uni Udon (4/5) This was super delicious as well. Less flavorful than the Mentai because it's a creamy sauce. But this pasta tastes like what the beach smells like. Which isn't a bad thing if you're a fan of seafood. I would recommend this for anyone who likes uni pasta!*NOTE: The beef tataki is only available at dinner time. :(I would definitely want to come back here, but ONLY when it's not at lunch time or dinner time. The parking was just traumatizing!"
2/3/2014,20140203,4,4.19,"Expect a semi long wait sometimes. I waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday afternoon, and there was already 8 parties ahead of me. We ordered kitsune udon and sea urchin cream udon. The kitsune udon was good, but it's not that special and unique compare to sea urchin cream udon. You taste the uni richness in every bite of the dish. The creaminess of the sauce was delicious and comforting, like eating creamy mac and cheese almost. I'd only come back for this dish, and I would try sitting at the bar next time. I missed out on the udon making action since I chose table seat."
2/3/2014,20140203,5,4.19,"Remarkable. Best, freshest noodles I ever had. And a great bargain, too. Order the additional bowl of rice with beef or tempura topping for $3.For an additional treat, sit by the kitchen and see the noodles hand cut."
2/4/2014,20140204,5,4.19,THE BEST UDON I'VE EVER HAD.... udon is freshly rolled continuously throughout the day. Most udon or shabu places serve packaged udon. You will be able to tell the difference and it is absolutely amazing!Uni cream udon... (ALL UNI & CREAMY PASTA FANS MUST TRY)Squid Ink udon was just as good :)) Tempura soft boiled egg is plain but perfectly cooked.Will be back many many many times!
2/4/2014,20140204,3,4.19,"Hand pulled udon. The noodle consistency is great. It's plump, soft, yet bouncy. The broth and the fixens were not as expected. I had the pork belly udon and the pork was old pork. It smelled like it's been in the fridge for 2 weeks and it wasn't tender at all. (It was supposed to be braised.) The broth was your run of the mill but the appetizers, the tuna on seaweed and the tempura were both very good. I would recommend this place in Little Tokyo. It's always refreshing to have something that's freshly made and not stale. LA doesn't do well with stale and neither should all of us."
2/4/2014,20140204,3,4.19,Came here last night with a group of my girlfriends. I was excited to try it out but it wasn't as good as I thought ! I got the beef carpaccio dish it was not good at all. It has a very strong beef taste to it and it's not a pleasant taste. And my friend has the miso cream sauce udon it was not good at all ! It has a very strong taste of bacon in it ! I rather have the regular soup base instead. They're trying to be different and make it into cream sauce pasta undo and it just taste weird ! I got the seafood tomato cream udon it was okay but I felt like for the price I'm paying there should be more seafood in it. But instead it was just all noodles and only 3 to 4 pieces of seafood. The only thing that I thought it was good is the clams appetizer. It's way better than the beef Carpaccio !! If I ever come back here again I'll probably will just get the regular soup broth udon .
2/5/2014,20140205,5,4.19,I can't get enough of this place... Always craving the uni udon!! Always have to stop by when I come to la! Yummy yummy yummy!! Must have!
2/6/2014,20140206,4,4.19,"Sure, you can find plenty of ramen places here and most of them are quite delicious. If you're in the mood for noodles but want to try something new. I suggest you check out this little mom and pop udon joint.We got here early enough to be seated right away with the restaurant nearly full. Like many of the previous reviews, we too ended up ordering the sea urchin udon and the squid udon.The udon has this nice chewiness to it and the broth was very rich. Oh so good. And holding true to the japanese restaurant tradition, this place too is very small. Another Tuesday night date and another fantastic restaurant in Little Tokyo. Can't wait to come back to try the other udon dishes."
2/6/2014,20140206,4,4.19,"One door down from the perennially-crowded Daikokuya, this hand-crafted udon restaurant is definitely an overshadowed gem along 1st street. It's visually arresting to walk in and immediately see an older Japanese man twirling and spinning fistfuls of soft flour and pliable noodles. I've had plenty of Chinese-style hand shaved/stretched noodles, but handmade udon is first. I ordered it w/ the kake broth - simple dashi - and the pristinely pure flavor of the broth w/ the earnest chew of the noodles really made for a reflective and delicious meal. I had the tempura egg and pickled ginger as accompaniments, which provided some interesting acidity and savory to the meal. Others at my table ordered the uni and the mentai, both of which were too heavy for me, but enjoyed by the others."
2/8/2014,20140208,4,4.19,"Came here with my friends yesterday for lunch. I got the beef udon with the fatty tuna + mayo bowl + fried egg. My bowl came before my udon, so I was about 1/2 by the time my noodles came. There was so much gooey, yummy mayo (Japanese sweet mayo not the American mayo) that pairs perfectly with the tuna. The tuna was fresh and delicious, but definitely need to eat the rice with the tuna to get that perfect bite. If you're a no rice kinda girl (like me), then this is probably not the kinda mini bowl you want to pair your udon with. The beef udon is as delicious as last time. The noodles were chewy and the texture was perfect. There was a lot of beef it in, so there's no skimming on ingredients. The soup base was light and not overly salted, which means no need to drink gallons of water after you drink the soup. Tip: Wait is on average 20 minutes during weekday and 40 minutes on weekends."
2/8/2014,20140208,3,4.19,"So I came here with an old friend of mine to try out this restaurant that has replaced Fat Spoon. The dining area is simple but neat. Black-wood accents on white walls, plus a black wooded ceiling with overhead lights that are typically used in theaters and auditoriums. It makes for a pretty bright environment. Depending on what sort of crowd is around, the owners seem to dim the lights lower to add a ""romantic atmosphere."" All of this replaced the ugly office room decor from Fat Spoon's tenancy which was just plain vulgar. Marugame Monzo, however, pulled it off superbly. Granted, it's not quite ""super"" high-class but definitely a step or two above your typical Japanese restaurant. In the background, they were playing light jazz music. Not overtly loud but not overwhelming low either. Just right. I would say that it has a nice, ""light"" ambiance. Not too loud, not too quiet. It's definitely a spot you would want to come by for lunch or dinner to wind down from a hard day's work. There is a ""bar"" at the end of the restaurant where you get to be seated in front of chefs who make food for you with a see-through glass where you get to see everything from start to finish. They have a restroom and, might I add, it is really clean. YES, I KNOW RIGHT?!?! Clean restrooms??? Unheard of!!! Food. I ordered the Curry Udon ($9.50) with double portions ($2 more on top) plus two toppings: a soft-boiled egg ($1.50) and green onions ($0.25). YES! I'm Chinese. Every soup I eat or drink must have EXTRA green onions. It enhances the flavor. Trust me on this one. My friend ordered the Beef Udon, regular size with the same toppings. The wait time for the food was probably 30 minutes or so? Not bad. Servers were excellent. Friendly, quick, attentive, and not pushy. A+ there. What can I say about the food? It didn't taste like curry. It tasted more like pasta for some reason. It's mild tasting. There's hardly any peppery spice to it. It's not spicy. It has a slightly salty flavoring. Not by much. It leans more on the bland side. The soup was thick though. Think gravy thick. They give you this giant wooden spoon to drink the soup with but I can't even use it because the soup was so thick. This, by the way, is not a bad thing in itself. If anything, if it was meant to be thick, it adds to the plus side BUT the problem was that the soup tasted like pasta but it looked nothing like it. I don't know. Maybe because I'm American-born and I'm used to bolder flavors but the flavor wasn't there. It's barely noticeable. It has a clean taste though despite its gravy thick texture. You don't come away with this icky feeling in your mouth. The soft-boiled egg? SUPERB! It's lightly battered tempura-style soft boiled egg. So think tempura but the egg itself was fried. The egg. OH. MY. GOD. It melts in your mouth. The gooey egg yolk just flows naturally and combined with the flaky tempura shell??? MMMM~~ Yummy!!!!!!! The udon noodles had the right amount of springiness. A+ there. The beef slices. Wow. Amazing. Tender, juicy, and so easy to chew. It is such a joy to be eating such good beef in soup of all places! There were other things in my soup but I can't remember what they are. Mostly veggies. I had no gripes with them. They tasted as they should. Filling. Yes, this double portions definitely filled me up. It's too bad that their ""signature udons"" don't have the option for double portions but looking at the ingredients, I figured that there's no way for them to replicate double portion sizes without losing money on it so oh well~ The regular size, I figured, won't be filling, judging from how much my friend got. It's like a snack-size. If you can order double portions, do it, IF you're a guy. If you're a gal, just stick with the regular size.We didn't order anything else. We figured we'd stick with what they are good at. We were, however, contemplating about getting their signature udons but none of their offerings really interested either of us. I guess, for lack of a better word, it lacks variety. It seems like the 7-8 signature dishes were widely aimed at Americans and Europeans (think Caucasian). Unfortunately, Little Tokyo is a spot where a lot of Asians: usually Japanese couples, Korean couples, and Chinese couples frequent. The Gold Line Station bring in a bunch of White folks from the Pasadena area but it's still predominantly an Asian spot and the clientele that night were predominantly Asian as well (surprise, surprise). But at least they did have a section of udons where they catered to a more Asian audience. So why 3-stars? The curry udon was underwhelming. Nothing really stuck out about it save for the beef and the toppings. And while it did fill me with double portions, I don't think the regular size would have. I would, however, come back again to try out their other dishes. I'd recommend trying it out. Your mileage may be better than mine."
2/8/2014,20140208,5,4.19,"Best udon noodles I've ever had! Yes, they are handmade in the back of the restaurant. If you want to check the quality of ingredients, you can see the bags of flour in the back corridor on the way to the restrooms (the restrooms, btw are modern and clean. I do judge restaurants on restrooms).Fried chicken appetizer was moist. I'm not a fan of the mayonnaise condiment that came with it, but I guess that's how they eat it in Japan. The broth on the beef udon was clean and well flavored. If you decide to add a topping of seaweed, be warned that it is exactly 1 piece of seaweed that is tempura battered and fried (for $1 extra). I thought it would be more. Service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is simple and not fancy. Decorations aren't needed when the food is the centerpiece. I will definitely try to eat here again."
2/8/2014,20140208,4,4.19,"Came here on a whim with some friends for dinner and was excited to score a table almost immediately. We tried the uni udon and the vongole udon. Both were good. But then again, I like all things uni. The uni udon was super rich and being the good asian that I am, I dutifully took the rest of the sauce home and used it for an uni spaghetti the next day at home that was quite excellent if I do say so myself. Note that the eggs comes fried which I didn't really dig. Glad that there is a restaurant in little tokyo that focuses solely on udon as it is one of my favorite comfort foods. Will be back to try some of their more traditional udon offerings.P.S. no high chairs or booster seats available for kids."
2/9/2014,20140209,5,4.19,Get my vote for the best udon in Southern CA. Generous portions but prepare to line up on weekends. Mentai squid udon and jidori egg are some of my favorites.
2/10/2014,20140210,5,4.19,"Love love love this place. Located right next door to Daikokuya, it still produces a long line of its own. They specialize in handmade udon and even have workers make the noodles in a station surrounded by glass. So sit by the bar and enjoy (if you're a party of two)!I've had the following on different occasions: Miso Carbonara - amazing flavor, very creamy.Mentai Squid Butter - interesting to try, tasted great, but would not order it again. Duck Nanban Udon - slices of duck are so tender!!! Def come during off-peak hours, you won't regret it. Best udon in LA!"
2/10/2014,20140210,5,4.19,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!I tried this place for the first time 2 month ago and immediately fell in love with it! I ordered the Udon Gratin, it is very cheesy! I love it because I really like cheese. I came back for the second time within a month and ordered the same thing, it is still absolutely amazing, I will definitely go back again and again until I get tired of the cheese. Awesome food, but It is not that easy to find parking. :("
2/10/2014,20140210,5,4.2,"Clean restaurant with fast service and excellent food!! I went here with coworkers and got a rice bowl that was delicious!! I can't remember the exact name of my dish but it was rice topped with seafood. The seafood consisted of lightly breaded shrimp and scallops. The portion wasn't enormous but it was very filling. Some of my coworkers got the udon noodles and bragged about loving their dishes as well. Now their portions were enormous!! This restaurant doesn't have a parking lot. There is only metered street parking. The Gold Line is a 5-minute walk. I will definitely visit this restaurant again, and get that same rice dish. At some point though, I do plan to try the udon noodles."
2/11/2014,20140211,5,4.2,"Best udon I've ever eaten. Their udon is hand made, making for the perfect chew. There's not much else I can say other than you have to try this place if you're in Little Tokyo! There's a shorter wait than Daikokuya, which is next door, and its still traditional Japanese noodles.Items to try:Mentai Squid ButterPlum ShisoDuck NanbanI'm sad that word got out about this place, because I never used to have to wait for a table when it first opened, and now there's always a line because word is out about how delicious it is!"
2/11/2014,20140211,4,4.2,"soft delicate home-made noodlesthe uni udon was delicate and creamy, the scallop carpaccio was even better, sweet and succulenti thought the beef tatami was just okbut yea, definitely worth trying!"
2/11/2014,20140211,4,4.2,"Bf and I finally tried this place after reading about it online and also hearing good things from friends. We arrived at 4:55pm and got seated prompted at 5pm. There was no line (only one other person in front of us) but perhaps because it's Monday. We share the scallop carpaccio and both ordered the sea urchin udon. The scallop was tender but was light in flavor (bf also thought it should have been sliced thinner, after all it's suppose to be carpaccio?!?) The sea urchin udon was yummy but both of us thought it was too creamy for our liking. Maybe half a serving of it would have been fine but after eating a whole bowl, it just felt too heavy. My stomach can still feel the ""cream"" 2 hours after dinner. I did like the texture/chewiness of the noodle and will likely return (but try something else.)"
2/13/2014,20140213,4,4.2,Very creative udon with mentaiko and uni cream :Das a huge fan of mentaiko and uni have to say i'm impressed
2/14/2014,20140214,5,4.2,"Had myself the double potion-sized curry udon with beef tataki and the gf got the pork belly udon.Feels like everyone just automatically says the udon is good solely because it's handmade which it is - you can see them make it behind the glass partition at the counter. It's springy, fresh, and definitely good. The beef tataki is one of the better ones I've had - most places give small pieces that you could feed a puppy with but the slices here are nice and hearty.I saw the pictures and thought the regular-sized udon bowls are small but the double portion is huge....filled me up for sure. Asahi on draft; they don't have Asahi Black.P.S. For the guy who spelled it beef tatami, fail. Tatami is a mat made out of rice straw (beef mat?)Also, they don't have gyoza or takoyaki here :|"
2/14/2014,20140214,4,4.2,"We ended up here while waiting in queue at Daikokuya next door. There was 21 parties ahead of us at Daikokuya as opposed to 8 parties ahead of us at Monzo. I'm actually glad we ended up here because their udon is great. You're even able to watch them make it which is always cool in my book. The place is a little small and 5 of us were crowded into a table meant for 4 but that's fine because we all enjoyed our food. Since I had a late lunch I didn't want to overdo it for dinner and I really just wanted to try the udon by it self. I've never seen so many different ways to serve udon at one place. After seeing everyone's order at my table I had wished I had ordered something a little more. I tried some of RL Mentai squid butter udon and it was really tasty, with just enough seafood taste without it being too over powering. And although it looked like a cream base it wasn't overwhelming or heavy either. One person at our table ordered double noodles and boy do they pile it on, there was more noodles than broth in his bowl and it was a big bowl. The bowls of udon here are pretty generous. Be sure to get the fried soft boiled egg. It's cooked perfectly with the creamy yolk oozing out when it's broken open. It's like breaking open an egg of happiness.The only thing that was disappointing was that the portion of the beef tataki that I ordered was much smaller than the images shown on yelp. It was practically half the portion but was still $12.95. I would have rather had one of their udon dishes instead which is about the same price.If you go here definitely try one of their signature dishes which is something I should have done."
2/15/2014,20140215,5,4.2,"I cannot believe I waited so long to try this place. I never even noticed it and I am always in Jtown for happy hour. My friend had recommended it for us to try and once we got there, the entire place was filled. I took it as a good sign. For starters we had their MUSHROOM SALAD that had various types of mushrooms on a bed of salad and their in-house dressing. As our main dishes we went with the BEEF TATAKI and of course the UNI CREAM UDON. Holy mother...... AMAZING. If you like your meat a bit on the under cooked side you would really appreciate how they made this dish. Flavors went really well together. The UNI UDON, sold me. After the first couple bites I was hooked. That creamy texture and the udon was not soggy..... I have to say it again AMAZING. If you love udon and uni I highly recommend coming here. ENJOY!"
2/15/2014,20140215,5,4.2,This place is worth the wait. I has the miso carbonara and I loved it the fried chicken was awesome as well definitely worth the wait.
2/16/2014,20140216,5,4.2,"Forget ramen, I'm all about udon now! I've never been a fan of udon, but their udon gratin had me mind blown! love love love it! it was cheesy and creamy and the noodles were fresh. I enjoyed watching the guy make the noodles threw the window, just made the experience more real haha. I tried there shrimp tempura udon soup which was also good, but im in LOVE with the cream sauce based udon. I need to go back and try the carbonara one. Must try!"
2/16/2014,20140216,5,4.2,"Came in on a Saturday for lunch. I'm not sure if it was because we came on the earlier end of lunch (12 PM ) but there was only 3 people ahead of us and we were seated within 10 minutes.After drooling over photos, our table ordered the uni udon, mentai squid butter udon, and a side order of pork belly rice bowl. All of which were delish! The udon noodles were incredibly tasty. It's quite a treat when you get to see them being hand made, fresh right in front of you! uni udon - creamy and rich with lots of little chunks of uni. it was almost like a pastasquid butter udon - incredibly buttery broth with soft squid and tons of roe. i preferred the uni udon a little more but this one was still a solid contenderpork belly rice bowl - thinly sliced pork belly. i mean, who doesn't like pork belly?definite try if you're in the area and not in the mood to wait for daikokuya. I was shuddering looking at the crowd of people waiting outside for the restaurant next door!"
2/16/2014,20140216,3,4.2,I'll come back ... But only because I think I made the wrong choice the first time. I think it's just because I don't like hot uni. Uni and udon I think it's a weird combo... I mean I love uni but when cooked? A flavor I really can't handle in my mouth unfortunately. :( I really wanted to like it!!!The next thing I got was the kakiage don probably the reason why I want to come back. Love love love. So crispy and crunchy yum!Maybe when I come back I'll get some regular udon combo with tempura :T
2/17/2014,20140217,3,4.2,"I came here for dinner about two and a half weeks ago with a few friends since we heard that the udon here was amazing. As usual, street parking in Little Tokyo can be a bit challenging, but luckily I managed to find an open spot on 3rd after circling a couple of times. Another friend had arrived earlier and put her name on the list so we were seated as soon as I got there ;)This place is really cool because you can see the chefs making the udon by hand. I was too distracted with catching up with my friends to really observe him, but it seemed really cool. We ordered the following:(CK and SK) SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON:-- This seems to be the most popular udon dish here. It looks amazingly delicious, especially if you are a big fan of sea urchin. I sampled some of the sauce and it was yummy. Both CK and SK really liked this dish.(BH) MENTAI SQUID BUTTER UDON: Seasoned Cod Roe Butter Sauce with Squid and Onions-- They definitely put a lot of roe into this one! Not something I would personally pick for myself, but I think BH liked it. Also one of the signature udon dishes here.(Esther) PORK BELLY RICE BOWL:-- Sadly I have been placed on a no-wheat diet by my doctor (for the time being) so I was unable to partake of the delicious udon. I opted instead for the pork belly rice bowl. The pork belly was not as flavourful as I had hoped, but it was still well seasoned and tender. A plain and simple dish, it's a decent option for those who are not ordering udon.There's not too much in terms of service because it's always so busy here, but we were able to flag a server down whenever we needed anything. I would probably have rated this place higher if I ate their udon, but based on the pork belly rice bowl I can only give this place three stars. I will have to come back and try their udon once I get my doctor's OK!"
2/17/2014,20140217,3,4.2,"Spontaneous dinner adventure! Good alternative if that line for Daikokuya is just too long haha. This place is apparently known for their house-made udon - you can see them makin' it too! I tried one of their popular dish - the mentai squid butter udon. It's a buttery broth that wasn't too overly powered with seafood. I was a little freaked out a first by the millions of tiny squid balls lol but got over it once I took that first bite haha. Definitely interesting to try cuz it's nothing I've ever had before. Really good and high quality udon, but I probably wouldn't order this specific dish again cuz it's a bit too creamy for my liking. It's on the pricier end, so I would definitely go for their signature udon dishes cuz the other one's have smaller portions and are the same price."
2/17/2014,20140217,5,4.2,This is my favorite restaurant in Little Tokyo. The staff is fabulous and the food is to die for. My Favorites are the Beef Tataki and the Shrimp Tempura Udon.
2/20/2014,20140220,2,4.19,"The quick summary: I will not ever come back here, nor recommend it to anyone due to the terrible treatment my group and I received from the staff. I would not even call it ""service"", because the only thing remotely close to ""service"" was the act of bringing out our food. Now onto the details...First, the staff were unaccommodating with my group. When we were told by a waiter that there were only seats for some in our party, several of us left to explore the area. When seats opened up a few minutes later, the staff was unwilling to hold the seats, even for 5 minutes. Our party was thus, split into several places in terms of seating.Second, the attitude of the staff was completely unprofessional and rude. Being familiar with Japanese culture, I was appalled because I have never received such bad treatment from a Japanese restaurant. They did not smile, were not friendly, and I had to verbally tell them that we were ready to order, otherwise they would not have come to take our order. Furthermore, we ordered waters but they never came, and I had to flag one waiter down to remind him to bring our water. Third, the staff had the audacity to give themselves an 18% gratuity on our receipt. I understand that working in the food industry is a tough job, but the staff did nothing to earn it, between the rude behavior to forgetting to bring out drinks. It was not too difficult to serve my group if they only did half of the work. One thing I could not help but notice was that my party was the only one that was majority non-Asian. Almost everyone else in the restaurant was Asian, and it seemed like they were receiving decent service because it appeared they were not complaining about the staff. Aside from the terrible staff, the food quality is great here. The food quality was the only thing that prevented me from giving this restaurant 1 star."
2/21/2014,20140221,5,4.2,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place! Sooo good! Been here at least 3 times.I've tried 4 of their specialty udons, which are essentially a fusion blend of japanaese udon with italian pasta. They're all delicious (uni pasta and squid butter are my favorites). Flavors are very rich and it goes without saying that the base is heavy. If creamy pasta isn't your thing though, they also have the traditional Udon in soup. I've tried the pork belly udon and although good, I still like the specialty udon more. As for appetizers, you can't go wrong with the beef tataki!Noodles are all hand made and the making of it is visible through a worker glass. It's pretty neat. It can get cozy in there so be prepared to hear how shitty some other dude's work is. There is often times a wait, but I've never waited more than 15 minutes on a weekday. I also park across from the japenese museum and it's $7. Will be back for more...soon."
2/21/2014,20140221,4,4.2,"This place is quite amazing. After eating here, I won't be surprised to see more udon joints popping up as the new noodle trend. Obviously, discovered this place thanks to my fellow Yelpers. I had been wanting to try this and another udon place for awhile, and I finally did! Came on a Thurs night and it was busy, but got a table immediately.Here's what we ordered:TEMPURA:Solid tempura with shrimp, eggplant, yam, and mushroomFRIED CHICKEN SKIN:Mmmmm. So delicious and crispy. I could eat a whole thing by myself, but opted not to because this definitely will be sending me to the hospital for heart surgery.BEEF UDON:Pretty standard. Nothing special, but it's solidCURRY UDON:Tastes like udon with curry, but the curry for some reason tasted slightly better than traditional boxed curryTAKANA BACONThis was what I mostly ate. Absolutely savory with the bacon, seaweed and daikon with a smokey flavor to the broth. Definitely my favorite.MENTAI SQUID BUTTER:For all the seafood eaters at the table, this was their favorite. I can't speak much to it, but if you eat seafood, definitely must tryMust make a trip back to try some of the other dishes here! Service was friendly, space was cool, and thought watching the udon being handmade was pretty interesting to watch them make and the process of doing so."
2/21/2014,20140221,5,4.2,"Came for dinner and was seated almost immediately, the servers are really friendly and helpful when it comes to asking them questions. The space is really limited but it has a cozy feeling to it. You can also see when the udon is being made which is awesome! I tried the uni udon and it was delicious, the creamy texture was just right not too creamy and not too watery. The flavors in this dish was excellent! The tempura tasted like traditional tempura. Beef udon also tasted like the traditional but it definitely hit the spot. All in all I believe I found myself a new favorite spot."
2/21/2014,20140221,5,4.2,"Best udon I've ever had. I highly recommend checking out this place if you're a fan of soft, fresh udon! :)"
2/22/2014,20140222,5,4.2,"There is a good amount of seating considering how big the restaurant is. The udon is fresh and the broth is not too heavy. The tempura soft boiled egg was great! It is exactly what it sounds like- a soft boiled egg with a tempura shell.  Looking forward to trying their specialty udons. The staff was very friendly and the service was great. We went on a Saturday thirty minutes before opening and were lucky to get the window seat by the kitchen. The restaurant was busy shortly after opening, so it would be a good idea to plan accordingly."
2/23/2014,20140223,5,4.2,Hands down best udon I've ever had! My friend took me here one night and I've been back time and time again since. I was hesitant because I wasn't a huge udon fan but these noodles are so fresh and the broth is so flavorful. The soft tempura fried egg is a must get for me every time. The creamy udon option are delicious but decadent. My favorite is by far the duck udon. The broth is layered with flavors and the yuzo adds the spice and citrus I crave. I come early to avoid the wait but it is always good go to when I am craving soup.
2/23/2014,20140223,4,4.2,"This place was really really good when I first came when it just opened. The quality somehow slipped a little. When I ordered the uni udon the first time. My whole udon was literally swimming with uni and the color of the broth was orange. Now, there were only 2 pathetic pieces of uni with a not that dense broth. Apart from the uni udon. I still adore the chicken salad udon. It's a good and light rendition to the regular udon. The udon texture is wonderful. I hope the quality of udon would remain as it is and not drop any further."
2/24/2014,20140224,4,4.2,"My love for udon exceeds the love for ramen which is why I opted to try Monzo instead of going next store to Daikokuya. I came here with the bf after a lakers game and it was around 9pm. There was still a wait, and we waited around 20 mins. I was excited to eat here because there are hardly any restaurants that specialize in just udon. I had to go for the Uni Carbonara. It is really different from your usual udon. There is no broth, and it cooked like a creamy pasta. It was really garlic-y and rich and quite heavy. There was a good amount of uni, and I was so full, I could barely breathe after finishing the whole bowl. Monzo makes their udon right in front of you which is fun to see. The texture of my udon was firmer than I usually like, but the flavors of the carbonara was just too good to even care. Service was a bit slow when I went, but Monzo is definitely a restaurant I recommend if you're in the downtown LA area!"
2/25/2014,20140225,5,4.2,"Wowzers, two words: ""Fresh Udon."" Not only was it fresh, but it was good! The noodles had the perfect bite and chew.We had the Uni Cream and the Mentai Squid Butter. The Uni Cream was rich with cream, flavorful with a touch of garlic, and uni. The Mentai Squid Butter was lighter without the cream, but still rich with the butter. The squid was tender, the way it should be served. Both broths was the perfect accompaniment for the delicious udon.Service was fast and friendly. However, be warned, there is usually a long wait. The prices are a bit high, but I would come back in a heart beat - it was that yummy."
2/25/2014,20140225,4,4.2,"What sets this apart from other udon places that I have tried is, its ITALIAN-Japanese fusion done right!! My boyfriend and I were lucky to get seated @ the bar in front of the guy making all the udon noodles and from the start we knew it would be an amazing experienceMentai Squid Butter: $12.95 If you want to try something worth your money on udon this should be it! Dont let the squid egg sauce deter your tastebuds because believe me, it doesn't at all taste fishy!!! It was a sauce that I did not expect, the longer it sat on my plate, the more the udon noodles soaked up its delicious flavor! They were not stingy with giving fresh cut, tender squid on the plate! It was not overcooked at all! Duck Nanban Udon: $12.95 It was not worth it. Reading other yelp reviews, they recommended to try a broth and cream udon because their sauces are too creamy and overpowering, *sigh* I should have not listened and got both creamy udons, because from the looks on the other table, the chef doesn't over-do it with the sauce! I mean, get this if you really like duck cause it does have a rich flavor. Sad part, it only comes with 2 pieces of duck meat.Assorted Tempura: $6.95 will buy you 1 piece of shrimp, 1 shitacke mushroom, 1 squash slice, 1 eggplant slice, and a random leaf. (I'd rather buy just pure tempura goodness)I will come back and this time I will try more of their creamy udon fusions *drool*"
2/25/2014,20140225,5,4.2,Really enjoyed the udon! I tried the sea urchin and the vongole one. Two completely different flavors. The sea urchin is very creamy and definitely an acquired taste. The sea urchin taste isn't as strong as the uni at sushi places so don't worry about that. The vongole came with a lot of clams so that's good. Flavor wasn't creamy but more liquid. Friends preferred the vongole more than the sea urchin.Will definitely go back to try the fried stuff!
2/27/2014,20140227,5,4.21,"Oodles and oodles of fresh udon noodles handmade in front of your very eyes! I will tell you, this is hands down the best udon I've had, by far! I had doubts walking in here thinking maybe it's over-hyped but they delivered 100% and beyond my expectations. Now, the noodles, imagine soft and silky texture with a good bounce, chewy yet delicate in the mouth. The quality is impeccable! What really drew me here was the SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON ($15.95). I love uni so much so that however way it is prepared, I would make it a point to try it even if it means driving 50 miles on a whim and taking the whole fam with me. The bowl was presented so beautifully with the accent of subtle but vibrant color of the uni. Expect the bowl to be filled with thick-like cream sauce, nothing soupy but rather plenty. I like how the uni does not disrupt the flavor entirety of this bowl. It has depth and each bite makes you taste the udon, the cream, and best of all, the uni. It's almost like a teaser making you want more. Fantastic! I'm still debating which one I like better, the latter or their MENTAI SQUID BUTTER ($12.95). They are both different as the broth for this is clear but completely seasoned with cod roe. My palate was pleasantly shocked with how potent the soup tasted. It's quite the contrary to the Uni Cream where the flavors creep up on you slowly. This one's on-point but definitely not one-note. The perfectly cooked squid is a nice added texture to the soft udon noodles and I appreciate the generous serving on each bowl. I strongly recommend! KAKUNI UDON ($12.50) is hot udon soup served with braised pork belly. The hubby had this as he wanted something with meat. The broth was toothsome. The meat was not overly tender which I prefer. Fantastic dish. He also added a rice bowl with this on the side for $4 more. The NEGITORO BOWL jumped out to him out of all the choices. It's chopped fatty tuna with green onions, sweet sauce, and drizzled with mayo over rice. I don't know about you but that sounds delicious. It tasted so good he almost didn't want to share.It doesn't stop with how everything tasted great. Service plays a big role for me and I couldn't complain. Servers were friendly and efficient. Almost ninja-like when they serve your water right before asking. Food came out fast, too which explains why the turnover is pretty quick. So, what to do when you get there? Write your name on the clipboard and make sure you wait nearby. They will only call your name 3 times and move on if you're not there complete with your party. We waited about 20 minutes for a table on a Saturday around 1pm. The less people you have in your group, the better. You'll have the option to sit at the bar in full view of the udon making process, otherwise a table will be the next obvious choice especially if you're a group of 4 or more. This, by the way, is located right next to Daikokuya in Little Tokyo. Can you guys open a branch in OC? Pretty please??? Arigatou gozaimasu!"
2/27/2014,20140227,4,4.2,"Oh course Daikokuya's line was out the door, so nine of us Low Ladies snuck in the door here just as they were taking the last lunch orders. We'd arrived in J-town an hour and a half prior to a bridal shower at Chado Tea Room for the latest Low-to-be; this eating time-cushion was built in because, being Lows, we all distrusted that an afternoon tea would satisfy our needs. I think the udon bowls at Marugame Monzo are the perfect light snack, and if you pair it with a beef bowl for $3 more, it makes an excellent meal... and with the $1.50 salad, a bounteous feast. But enough about quantity, the quality here is really remarkable. The mini salad is simply described as greens and mushrooms, but those delicate slivers of meaty, chewy, oily mushrooms, with a restrained complement of dressing easily make for the best Japanese salad I've ever tried. With a hurried glance through the Yelp reviews, it was clear that I had to order the udon with Mentai Squid Butter - I think roe figures into the name - it definitely dominated the look of the dish, but turned out to be delicious, almost cheesy, and not fishy. I was enjoying that and the fresh noodles when tender slices of squid rose to the surface. Social Gourmand kept lifting noodles from my bowl, splattering my party dress, but she had only ordered the less filling, liverish tasting duck udon. Butcher Shop Gal let me taste her Miso Carbonara with BACON, and that one's a must-have too. Some of the nieces liked the beef bowls because it reminded them of Yoshinoya (in a good way), and the shrimp tempura in the udon was extra large. I would have liked to watch the udon dough being worked, but I had to concentrate... those Lows are fast eaters!Can't wait to bring Hostage Gastronome who may have created himself a gastrointestinal problem by over spicing his pho. Oh, they added a tip the bill."
2/27/2014,20140227,5,4.21,"This place is A M A Z I N G. I ate ALL of my uni pasta. I, of course, regretted it the minute I slurped down my last udon noodle but it was SO worth it. My goal is to try ALL their dishes :)"
2/28/2014,20140228,4,4.21,"This place has gotten a lot of accolades from both press and eaters. I think it's great that there are more noodle houses opening up in Little Tokyo, as I'm getting kinda bored of tonkotsu ramen places (gasp! yes, I said it! when I was younger I liked the fattiness of tonkotsu broth but as I've gotten older I seem to prefer less heavy flavors.. but I digress).Udon has always been my least favorite type of Japanese noodle (the order being soba, ramen, udon) but the creative menu choices at Monzo have made me rethink my stance. If you are interested in enjoying udon for the sake of the noodle, I'd recommend you try one of the classic styles. If you're interested in trying something new and uncommon, try one of their signature udons.Others have already reviewed the heck out of the Uni Cream Udon (whenever I say this out loud I always say ""uni cream pasta"" instead of ""udon""!), but I will add my two cents and say it's worth trying at least once, especially if you like uni. The dishes with ""cream"" in the name really are very, very rich, so you might want to walk it off after you eat, like I did... walked all the way over to Cafe Dulce to buy a donut. Ahem.I've also tried some of the rice bowl dishes and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty they are. The Negitoro Bowl is quite delicious (but heavy on the mayo), and the pork used in the Pork Belly Bowl and Pork Belly Salad is flavorful, if a bit on the salty side. Parking kind of sucks in this area, especially on weekends, but if you get here early enough you can usually find street parking. And if not, there are several nearby lots that'll run you about $5 or so."
2/28/2014,20140228,5,4.21,This place is worth the wait. You will probably see someone you know also waiting in line since it's a popular joint. It's in the heart of Little Tokyo and there are places to go for dessert after (Four Leaf!). We came on a Sunday night and the wait was about 20-30 minutes. They are really efficient with taking your order and are fast with preparing the food. I had the mentai squid butter udon and it was delicious. It had a generous amount of roe. It was a heavy dish but worth it! The beef tataki was also good. I would definitely come back!
2/28/2014,20140228,5,4.21,"On reconsideration, after maybe five more visits, the broth has gone up in my estimation. The noodles remain the obvious five-star ingredient. The broth , however, is highly worthy, with balance and adult umami- present but restrained. The rice seasoning in some of the bowls is exceptional, as if the rice is cooked in a stock, although I don't believe it actually is. Green iced tea in a can is not worthy. Small detail, the tea, but they should brew in-house."
3/1/2014,20140301,4,4.21,"Just tried this place with my friend and was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty small restaurant but they have these cool bar seats where you can watch them make hand made udon noodles right on front of your eyes! The process is much more complicated than I could've imagined and it sure pays off!We ordered the beef tataki, seafood cream udon and the plum shiso udon. All three were pretty delicious. The beef tataki was a little tough for me but the flavored went nicely. The seafood cream was so delicious!! The udon noodles had a perfect amount of chewiness and the sauce was really yummy. The plum shiso was a bit more traditional and wasn't really my favorite but you could really appreciate the udon in this preparation. Overall it was a great experience. Good food, good company, good times!"
3/1/2014,20140301,5,4.21,"I almost never give fives, but there is nothing but excellent service and amazing Udon. And yes, I'm an Udon addict. I've tried the Uni butter, the squid & roe and the mixed seafood & veggie. They are all amazing. I keep finding excuses to go to Little Tokyo so I can eat there again. Perfection!"
3/2/2014,20140302,5,4.21,"I love Monzo for a couple things, but recently I have acquired a taste for their Shiso Mentai Udon. It's amazing if you get it with a soft-boiled egg and kakiage and eat them together. I got this combination 3 times straight so far, and this combination is what made this restaurant my #1 udon restaurant in the greater Los Angeles area.Whenever I order this peculiar combo, I feel that everything on my table is prepared just the way I like. It's like they read my mind."
3/3/2014,20140303,5,4.21,"I don't think I've ever had a better bowl of udon--it was perfection. If you sit at the back you can watch them as the make the noodles by hand. I ordered the champon udon and the broth was so tasty and also got a little side order of fish cake ($1.25). Excellent.  It's an attractive little place inside and the servers were friendly, too.  There may be a line out front but it is worth the wait."
3/5/2014,20140305,2,4.21,"*Biased review - I don't like udon*For as long as I can remember, I've never liked udon noodles. Almost every other permutation of noodle, from Italy to Vietnam, I can enjoy except these. I think it reminds me too much of mochi or tteok, neither of which I enjoy. But I do like Japanese food, and I'm a sucker for carbonara, so I came and ate the foods. First up was some terrible fried chicken skin. Not sure how they pulled it off, but they managed to make the skin taste almost solely of batter, all while muting the crispness with a bounty of sauce. yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…The carbonara udon was what I expected; thick chewy noodles with a rich and heavy sauce. The sauce was on the runny side when it came out, but thickened up as it cooled down.yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…So, since I don't really care for udon and the one appetizer I was excited about fell flat, meh."
3/5/2014,20140305,4,4.21,"Not knowing what to eat on Chinese New Years, we came here after I called in and asked how long the wait was. I was told there was no wait, so we came here for dinner. By then, the wait was only about 5 minutes long. Located next to Daikokuya, Marugame Monzo is a small restaurant with eight tables or so, and counter bar seating. We weren't able to sit at the counter but from our table, we still had a clear view of kitchen staff hand-making long strands of fresh udon from scratch.We started off with Scallop Carpaccio ($9.25), which I didn't get a taste of but my parents really enjoyed the thin slices of Hokkaido scallop with original creamy carpaccio sauce. For my main, I got the Miso Carbonara ($12.50) and my parents went with Curry Udon ($9.50) and Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($15.95). Expecting something more traditionally Japanese, I was surprised by the fusion of bacon, cream, and udon. The hand-made udon was delicious: soft and delicate, yet chewy. I wasn't really a fan of the sauce, but the noodles were great. My parents enjoyed their bowls, but my mom was slightly disappointed by how little uni was actually served in her sea urchin udon -- it was about a size of a nickel. Although I wasn't a fan of the carbonara, I'm excited to come back and try other dishes for the fresh udon alone."
3/7/2014,20140307,4,4.21,i love the UNI pasta!! Beef Tataki was pretty good too!
3/8/2014,20140308,4,4.21,"HANDMADE UDON. Please get here early unless you want to wait in line. The line can get pretty long. The last time I waited for about 30 mins for a table of four. The interior is quite small. Not a lot of seating options. There is a bar area where you can look at the chefs making the udon. Marugame is known for their specialty udons. Specialty as in uni udon, squid butter, etc. I have to say that it is true. I haven't tried their other udons but my friends have and they liked it. They also serve alcohol for those who drink. Either street parking or park in the garages nearby. I would most definitely come back for my udon fix."
3/8/2014,20140308,1,4.2,"The food is great. No questions asked on that. But when I was waiting in line, I asked for a glass of water because I need to take my medication on time. However, after explaining how important it was for me to take the medication, the waiters and waitresses still refused to offer me a small glass of water just because I was not seated yet. That was the most unfriendly service I have ever encountered in a restaurant. No matter how good the food is, I'm not going back."
3/10/2014,20140310,3,4.2,"I love udon and had high hopes after seeing all the smashing reviews on Marugame. Maybe it was the fact that I was blown out of the water by Morimoto Napa's carbonara of udon and sea urchin, the sea urchin noodle at Monzo missed the mark for me. It was a bit too creamy, heavy and filling. The noodles were thick and it was not until much later that I learned that you can ask for 'thinner' noodles. I hope to return and order this dish again with thinner noodles and hopefully it will be more enjoyable. I also tried the curry udon which was flavorful, but again I think I would enjoy this more with thinner noodles. Beef tataki was outstanding. I do plan to return to try the tempura which looks amazing in pics! Get here early or the lines can get long, not crazy daikokuya long though which I don't get."
3/14/2014,20140314,5,4.2,"Food/Cost: (4.5/5) I came here wanting to try the Uni Cream Udon ($16) and that's what I got and it was so DELICIOUS. It was unctuous, rich, decadent, and totally worth every bite. While eating it, I was thinking: I'm going to crave this again one day. The cream was flavorful, the Uni added a special granual texture to each bite and the undon's texture was unparalleled in elasticity. My friend got the Squid Butter Udon ($13) and it was also pretty good. But by that point I was too in love with my Uni Cream Udon to be diverted. Ambiance: (5/5) The exterior is non-descript, if not a little run down, but the interior is actually very updated and relatively sleek looking. I came here around 1:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon and the restaurant was only about 35% full. They can seat a decent amount of small to mid-sized groups (2-4 people would be easiest here) but during peak lunch or dinner times on weekends, you might face a small wait as the space just isn't that large. Still, turnaround is pretty quick here so the wait will likely be managable. I'd recommend sitting at the counter because you can watch as the chefs make the udon -- so cool! Location: (4/5) Located right in the heart of Little Tokyo, Marugame Monzo is right by the Japanese Plaza. It's a nice, convenient location if you want to shop or get dessert after your meal. However, parking is annoying. As usual, very little street parking is available -- depends on your luck. The outdoor lot across the street is $5 flat rate or there's a garage structure for even more $. Service: (4/5) Fast service for weekday lunch from the time we sat down to order taking to food arrival. I didn't like how they bought us the bill so quickly after the food came but at least they didn't put explicit pressure on us to leave. Overall: (5/5) Handmade udon with pizzazz. I think I may have to go again soon. Go try!"
3/15/2014,20140315,5,4.2,"This has to be my favorite udon shops ever! I found marugame on a whim (6pm one Monday night). Read Marissa S.'s review and thought to myself ""why not go to la just for dinner on a Monday night?"" So I called up my friends and convinced them to drive up to LA with me two hours before it closed. We arrived at Marugame at 9PM and there was a 15 min wait. You write your name on the clipboard and wait outside. The store is filled with japanese servers and cooks but the customers are very diverse in culture so word must of gotten around. We were lucky to sit at the bar, right in front of the guys rolling out the udon. We each ordered a draft beer, udon, and jidori egg. appetizers to share: braised pork belly: melt in your mouth goodnesspork belly rice bowl: salted pork belly, thinly sliced on top of fragrant ricesea urchin cream udon: For a cream based sauce, it wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be and the dish did not lack uni which I love. mentai squid butter udon: the broth is to die for! So much mentai and by far my favorite udon on the menu mentai cream udon: my friend who's visiting from west virginia said she likes this better than fettuccini alfredo. Huge compliments since it's her all time fav. clam (forgot the japanese term) udon: didn't get to try this one but my friend said he loves it. jidori egg: everyone raves about this so I knew we each had to order one. It's a soft boiled egg that's tempura fried. I thought that the tempura batter could use a bit more flavor or some type of dipping sauce on the side. I tried sticking it into my udon soup but that did not do the job. This has so much potential but it just seems like something is lacking For a busy place, the service was amazing. The servers were very attentive and the food came out fast. Bonus Points: The restrooms are ""hotel fancy"", a pleasant surprise to make my hour trek from OC more than worthwhile."
3/15/2014,20140315,5,4.2,Great place. Stumbled here with a friend and it was a great find. The Chicken Tempura udon is great and The Champon Udon that my friend had looked amazing. This is a great joint for a casual dinner before a night out. I definitely recommend it!
3/16/2014,20140316,4,4.2,"I had the sea urchin creamy udon, and I almost died. The udon and soup were delicious and VERY creamy. I'm not an expert in udon, but honestly, the super heavy creamy soup base masked the freshness of the udon although they were both tasty. I felt bad about not slurping the whole thing down, which is what I would usually do EXCEPT I was on a very cute date. Hence, I had the fear of getting soup all over my clothing, looking like a pig, and suffering the unfortunate consequences of what might happen after I eat a lot of creamy stuff because I'm somewhat lactose intolerant. We also split the braised pork belly, which was great but not memorable.The udon maker has a nice little window glass set-up where you can watch him make the udon. This is a nice distraction and something to talk about if you happen to come here for a date. Fortunately, I was on an interesting date, and I actually forgot to watch the udon maker make his first batch while I was there."
3/17/2014,20140317,4,4.2,If you're ever craving for some udon noddles made from scratch!! This is definitely a spot to visit!Tucked away in little Tokyo parking might be difficult to find if you don't feel like paying for a structure but definitely a busy area.When we arrived there was a group of people waiting outside but it didn't take long til we were seatedThe restaurants small perfect for a small get together of a couple friends or a date! You can also watch them roll out the udon noodles from scratch through a glass window! I ordered the pork belly udon which was delicious! We also got the crispy fried chicken as an appetizer and the dipping sauce with it was amazing!!Service was good and they seem to know exactly when to approach you and leave you to enjoy your meal! Definitely a spot to visit
3/17/2014,20140317,5,4.2,The uni cream udon was soooo good!! Price is reasonable for what you get. Lots of uni and you can taste the quality of the fresh udon. Friends got the a cold udon and carbonara which were also pretty good. Definitely will be making a trip back here. Just wish parking was a little easier. I would suggest parking at the structure one block down.
3/18/2014,20140318,4,4.2,"Although Daikokuya may be the more famed of the locales on this street, that isn't to say that it's next-door neighbors can't compete in taste. One example is Marugame Monzo - a Japanese udon restaurant that has some solid choices. Sitting down, you'll notice a selection of appetizers, regular udon (cold/hot), signature udon and a few other dishes. Prices will range from $9-$20 depending on your selection. Our party got the beef tataki and I got the sea urchin cream udon. My friend got the mentai squid butter udon. The beef tataki wasn't too bad - a little mild on flavor. The mentai squid butter udon was a very tasty dish from the tiny bite I got to try with a solid broth. The sea urchin cream udon was interesting - a fettucini alfredo-like dish with a very creamy broth. I was a little surprised to find such a strong broth and I really liked the idea. The sea urchin too was delicious. I have to admit, though, the broth was a bit too strong for my tastes although still overall pretty good! Much like all the restaurants around Little Tokyo, there is no RSVPing here. Put your name in at the front and make sure all of your party is pretty much present. Waiting on a Thursday night took about 45 minutes although your waiting time may vary on the day/time. The decor is fairly nice inside with a slightly more modern take on a Japanese ramen/udon restaurant and isn't too crowded. There is both table seating and seating at the udon bar where you can see the udon being made in front of you which is pretty cool. Parking-wise, expect to try and find parking in nearby lots or parking structures (or in the rare cases, some street parking). I'd like to come back and focus on the regular udon dishes to see how the base dishes fare as well. But all-in-all, Japanese udon fans should be fairly happy with the selection here. Just make sure to park early/get here soon to get a spot in the long line!"
3/19/2014,20140319,4,4.2,"Quite literally for about 2 weeks before I came here and for about 2 weeks after I ate here all I did at home was yell to my wife and kids....MARRUHGAHMAY MAHNNZOOOH!!!Why?Cuz it is fun to yell and cuz I enjoy annoying the sh!t out of my family and cuz I am an idiot.GINGA KOGENyelp.com/biz_photos/maru…Also almost as fun to yell at people.

3/19/2014,20140319,5,4.21,"Handmade chewy udon bathing in your choice of delectable broth. Omigawwwwd. This is may-jah! Stick to more traditional options like the Kake Udon or go crazy and give their modern takes a shot. Marugame Monzo has so many options to choose from! Huz and I ordered the much-photographed and talked-about Sea Urchin Cream Udon, Vongole Udon and Kake Udon. I enjoyed them all, but preferred the Vongole because it showcased their noodles better. Stuff is like crack. Husband and I couldn't stop stealing our daughters udon. We also ordered a rice ball for the kid (in case she wasn't into udon, but she so obviously was), and it was delicious as well. Came on a Sunday at 6pm. Group of 4 adults and 2 babies. We waited 20 minutes, but the wait was worth it. Be forewarned, this place is full of kids. It clearly wasn't the intention of the owners for this place to become this way (the place is pretty tiny and doesn't have high-chairs), but foodie parents clearly can't resist a solid bowl of carbs, and what kind of kid doesn't love udon? A FREAKY ONE.Super satisfying meal. Really looking forward to returning to consume more udon and try some appetizers!"
3/20/2014,20140320,5,4.21,"For the squid butter udon, yum!! My friend ordered the sea urchin cream udon, man wasnt it creamy. Although the portion was small, you can feel full and heavy right after finishing that bowl of udon. If you are a first timer, I would recommend the squid butter udon, so good."
3/21/2014,20140321,4,4.21,"Cheap and very tasty! What I don't see mentioned in other reviews is that they have many Italian/Japanese fusion dishes. And no, dear, Fusion is not a bad word!"
3/22/2014,20140322,4,4.21,"Blah blah blah blah blah UNI UDON blah blah blah blah blah. You know, just trying to squeeze UNI UDON into the highlights. Blah blah blah blah blah blah AMAZING."
3/23/2014,20140323,4,4.21,"I might be in the minority because I much prefer udon over ramen. So you might think I'm crazy for passing up Daikokuya for Marugame Monzo. Luckily, I had no regrets and loved the uni udon. It is definitely on the rich side, but I was still able to finish all of it with no problem, haha. I tried my friends mentai squid butter udon, and though it's probably the other most popular item to order, I much preferred the uni udon. I wish I could have tried the carbonara udon, but that will have to wait until the next visit. I also tried the soft boiled tempura and did not care for it at all. It tasted like a big ball of oil.The restaurant is rather small, and I guess you could label it kid friendly, but I think it's better to take older kids here. Because it's small the noise level isn't that high and they don't have any high chairs."
3/23/2014,20140323,5,4.21,"I bookmarked this place a while ago and finally got to try it! It's freakin amazing!!!! Come early because this place get super pack! Me and the boyfriend came right at 11:30AM when they just open and already a group was inside like whoa, after about 15 minutes this place was so pack people have to wait! FYI this place is kind of small so I suggest you come early to avoid a wait. If you have a group of 2 people it's easier bigger group may wait longer. Anyways for the food...we came at lunch so if you do lunch they have a special where you can get a rice bowl for $3 extra yummy got the spicy tuna bowl and it was so good! Best spicy tuna bowl ever this one was $4 extra and I share this with the bf. Ordered separated udon bowls I got the UNI and it taste sooooo good!!! It was creamy and the noodle was freshly made! My bf got the pork belly one and he said it was really good you get chunks of pork belly!! We got got two tempura eggs mmmm. Everything cost us about $40 not bad especially for uni. HANDMADE UDON NOODLES MADE FRESHY IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES."
3/24/2014,20140324,5,4.21,What's cooler than to see your food being prepared? We got front row seats to see the handsome guy make fresh udon from scratch:)My BF ordered the mentai butter squid udon and fell in love. He was hesitant when it first came out because there was so many eggs floating in his bowl. Boy oh boy were those eggs flavorful and a perfect combination to the soup. I ordered the uni udon. If you don't like the creamy and rich texture then uni udon isn't for you. I loved how the udon soaks up all that creamy uni sauce. (I added a couple spoons of the chili powder and a splash of soy sauce in to my bowl.) Nom! nom! $16 for fresh udon was worth it. You are definitely paying for the quality and the taste:)
3/24/2014,20140324,4,4.21,"Awesome udon!!! I love fresh udon and it doesn't get any fresher than noodles formed from dough right in front of you! Price reflects the quality but you get a lot of food. There was a long wait at lunch time but i was still seated in under 20 min.Great food, but the quality of service diminishes the closer you are to closing time. It's understandable but I just paid $20 for a single meal and i didnt even get my empty water cup refilled despite requesting it multiple times. I'm really thirsty especially after eating the salty meal. It was very savory and good but it's like when you eat ramen or pho- you're going to get very thirsty. Salty squid udon was salty :/Definitely coming back again to try the other udon! Hopefully the service can be as good as shinsengumi's the next time i visit :/"
3/25/2014,20140325,4,4.21,"Located in Little Toyko. Street parking and many paid parking lots around ranging from $7-$10. Came here on a Saturday morning around noon, no wait but the restaurant seemed pretty filled up already. (There were a couple of parties waiting when we left).- Uni (sea urchin) udon - delicious and they gave you a generous amount of uni! Recommend sharing this though because it was so rich and too creamy almost like pasta, hard to finish it all by one person, at least we couldn't. - Mentai squid butter udon - again, super generous with mentai (cod roe), the whole bowl was covered with it! In comparison with the uni udon, this one definitely grows on you while you make your way through it, we ended up liking this more than the uni one.- Pork belly rice bowl - We decided to add this to our order because everyone around us ordered this haha and it turned out to be our favorite dish! The pork was flavorful with just enough fat, get this!- Jumbo shrimp tempura - $2 per, pretty much like your standard shrimp tempura but bigger and meatier, hence ""jumbo"".Big portions, will definitely fill you up.Udon was made fresh in front of you and you can really taste the difference, lighter and more chewy, big difference/upgrade from those instant packaged udons you get at Asian markets. Service was just mediocre, kind of hard to flag down a server even though the restaurant was pretty small. I never crave for udon, but I can see myself coming back here if I were ever around the area, and for their pork belly rice!"
3/25/2014,20140325,4,4.21,"We happened in because one of our friends is a server here, and she's worked in so many of our favorite places, it was meant to be that night to hit the one place in LA serving Sanuki-style hand-made (to order almost, it goes that fast...) udon and an Itameshi (Italian fusion) menu.Ika (squid) cream udon - yes, and actually a little lighter than the other cream sauces, with lots of mentaiko scattered all over the bowl. They're serving the heavy 8-12 oz portions, so be prepared, split if necessary, and be forewarned, hand-made udon dishes don't really reheat all that well - the noodles tend to absorb every last bit of moisture overnight and you end up with a savory shredded mochi-like mass.Mixed seafood cream udon - yes+ (that's shrimp and scallops, with the mentaiko). This one uses the heavier cream, similar to the famed Uni cream version.Karage (fried chicken nuggets) - yes, and that's what I was craving this particular evening, though we weren't drinking as would be the usual pre-requisite for such Izakaya type appetizers. But their triple-filtered ice water is like glasses of Fiji's best.And just to be excessive, the Tempura Fried Chicken Skin - yes, it's like Filipino Chicken Chiccharones, except with ponzu and cilantro. They're using Jidori chickens, so the skin isn't as heavy on the chicken intensity as the Filipino places.The inside track from our friend was that all the Itameshi was fine, but their real treasure is their Sansai udon with their hand-crafted 20-hour dashi stock, which is refined in a style much more delicate and balanced than the rest of the menu.It's amusing to overhear the waiting comments like, ""Well it's an hour next door at Daikokuya, I think it's only 45 minutes here, so we'll stick with this one."" So put the name on the clipboard and have a blast."
3/26/2014,20140326,5,4.21,"I like this Japanese restaurant very much. This is my first time coming and I am pretty sure that I will visit it agin and again when I wanna have the authentic udon. I ordered Mentai cold udon today. The udon is at the appropriate chewy status and their mentai is so fresh which is the best one that I have ever had. I came from east Asia so I have many chances to try mentai, the conclusion I made of this great mentai can be trusted. I would like to try the mentai bowl and hot udon next time. Their lunch special is very cheap, you order your entree and just add 4 bucks to have extra small bowl, one of my male friends ordered it today and he said he is so full but satisfied!"
3/28/2014,20140328,5,4.21,Authentic Japanese udon located at Tokyo town in LA. This is the best udon we've ever had but it's definitely the most expensive udon ever. $22 after tax and tips for 1 bowl. The wait is long because the place is really tiny. It feels like you're in Japan.
3/29/2014,20140329,4,4.21,"Good food. If the wait time is close to an hour, I would say go somewhere else. Not worth the wait. Came here Friday night for dinner with my fiancé. There are always a lot of people in little Tokyo. Every good restaurant whether it be for ramen, sushi, shabu, or yakitori will have a wait. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait too long here. We probably waited for 15-20mins. I guess for a party of 2, it was less of a wait. There were parties of 4 or 8 who came before us but waited longer. With that said, let's move on to the food. To start we had the beef tayaki (seared beef). I'd say it was pretty good, tasted like chewy sashimi chewy. We had the signature udon sea urchin cream udon and mentai squid butter udon. Their udon is handmade and it's quite good. I felt like it needed more uni. Don't get me wrong, it had a good amount to have you taste the uni, but I'd like more. (Haha). Both were super tasty. The creamy udon was creamy but not to the point where it was heavy. The squid was tender and the soup had plenty of squid roe butter. Another customer who sat next to me ordered the curry udon, looked good too."
3/29/2014,20140329,4,4.21,"Reasonable price for the portion. Marugame Monzo always leaves me full.Went twice. The only thing is that the wait is long, even on a weekday.I like the Uni cream pasta. Very rich and creamy.The curry udon is good. The portion was too big for me to finish."
3/29/2014,20140329,4,4.21,"Maruagme Monzo offers dishes for udon traditionalists and modernists alike. The udon is clearly the star; seats at the bar offer you a front-seat view of the udon noodle-making process, which is made fresh in house. The noodles themselves are silky and toothsome and perfectly hearty. For a more traditional take, the pork belly udon is served with a umami-rich broth, though the pork belly was a bit dry. The sea urchin udon is a unique combination of udon with a creamy and rich sauce that wouldn't be out of place at an Italian restaurant; the uni, though, makes it unquestionably Japanese. The dish is incredibly rich but delicious. You can order tempura-battered sides with any of your udon dishes. I would pass, though, based on my experience with the boiled egg; the tempura was too thick, and the egg was overcooked.The crispy chicken skin appetizer has a great airy texture, but its accompanying sauce is a bit salty. Service is extremely efficient yet still manages to be polite."
3/29/2014,20140329,3,4.21,"Food was decently good, but nothing spectacular. The highlight of this meal as the pork belly rice bowl with was flavored with salt and pepper and not sauced up like usual rice bowls are. The udon was nothing special to write home about, unless If you order their specialty the uni udon which is very heavy and if you are a uni love you may enjoy this. Wait was about 30-45 minutes on a Friday night for a party of 4. It's located right next door to daikokuya and the lines outside kind of mix together, so don't be deceive by the huge mob."
3/30/2014,20140330,5,4.21,"Their sea urchin cream udon is what is die for! Today was my second visit and I decided to write a review for them because it was too good. When I heard about this place from my friend, I knew that I HAVE TO come here, since I'm a super big fan of sea urchin/uni. When I first tried their uni udon, I love it immediately, but I couldn't finish it the first time, not because of the portion, it was because it was too creamy so I got sick of it. However, after a little while I was craving for it again. Today when I went their I still ordered the sea urchin cream udon and it was still amazing. This is a place where sea urchin lovers have to come, I was amazed by how generous the portion they give for the sea urchin in one serving. And I also heard that their clam udon is good too(dinner only) As for the wait, the waiting time is pretty long but not too bad (compare to the ramen store next to them..)"
3/30/2014,20140330,4,4.21,"Forgot the name of udon I ordered (served with clams on top of udon), but it was really good, the taste of clams seem to get into every signal strain of noodle. Good and enough amount of udon for me, the soup seems little salty. But it's definitely a good place to go if you are a big fan of udon!"
3/31/2014,20140331,4,4.21,Good udon. Beef tatake is good. Atmosphere is good. They also make the udon noodles behind this glass window so you can see. I always like when I can see them preparing food from scratch.
3/31/2014,20140331,5,4.21,"So I've been wanting to eat here for a long time!! And honestly the hype lives up to everything!! The pork belly rice bowl and the uni udon are a must have!! The udon serving is pretty filling. I was so full, but I just wanted to eat every last piece of uni!! That cream and uni together is just indescribable!! You have to try it! My next mission will be the squid ink udon... I can't wait to go back!"
3/31/2014,20140331,5,4.21,"New favorite. Vongole udon. So yummy. I couldn't stop eating it! It had loads of clams and garlic, the white wine broth was the tastiest thing ever. I was still eating and super full. I'm adding this to the list of deliciousness to marugame monzo"
3/31/2014,20140331,5,4.21,"One of the BEST Udon Ever! Located in Little Toyko. I was never a huge fan of udon, til I went here. I got to try the sea urchin creamy udon. The texture of the udon was delicate along with the creaminess of the sea urchan sauce. The two compliment well each other!"
4/1/2014,20140401,4,4.21,"After seeing so many of my friends come here on Instagram, I had to give it a try for myself! I finally made it out here with the boy Monday night. We were seated right away- however the space is quite small so keep in mind that seating is cramped.Our waitress was super sweet and took the time to go through the menu with us, given that it was our first time. We decided to start off with the tempura appetizer, and I went with the signature Mentai Squid Butter Udon while the boy had the regular Beef Udon. The squid butter udon was great- tons of pollock roe and some pieces of tender squid and nori on top of their handmade udon. I thought the sauce would be more creamy and buttery, but I didn't mind the more soupy base. The boy also enjoyed his beef udon, which came with a large quantity of beef and a very clean tasting broth. The tempura was also crispy and spot on- I only wish they gave us two of each type of tempura, because it was quite a struggle sharing the one shrimp tempura and each vegetable haha.Overall a really great place that serves both traditional and signature udon dishes with handmade noodles! One star off for the disproportional tempura serving and cramped seating, but they attentive service definitely makes up for it(: Can't wait to come back and try their Uni Cream Udon next!"
4/1/2014,20140401,4,4.21,"Came across this fine establishment a few weeks ago when we were heading out of a Cold Tofu Improv show. OMG! Freshly made udon. I am in love. I ordered the beef carpaccio and it was pretty good considering I had no expectation since I normally have it was capers and arugula.I ordered the traditional pork belly udon (large to share) and JIDORI EGG (poached fried egg). The broth was very good and the udon was aldente. So gonna come back for the cream udon, etc.The only thing that I did not like is the long line and wait... but hey... a long only means it's that good... worth it? Maybe if it's only 15-20 mins... an hour's worth? Probably not.Lost 1/2 star because the staff was not as attentive. I did not take any star for long wait... so, definitely coming back."

4/2/2014,20140402,5,4.21,"On my first visit (weekday dinner) my friend and I were seated immediately. We picked the table in the front to have a little privacy. Big mistake - we should've sat at the counter to watch the making of the noodles. We ordered the sea urchin udon and pork belly rice bowl. The udon was good! But the pork belly was mostly fat. I added the broth from the udon onto the pork and rice and viola - 100% better. Others have said they liked the pork belly so I'm wondering if we just got a bad batch. We were also slightly disappointed with the tempura egg because it lacked seasoning.On my second visit, I came on a weekend for lunch and after waiting about 30 min, got seated right in front of the noodle maker. I was so excited!! This is definitely where you want to sit! Plus (or minus) we made friends with the adjacent party who turned me onto the lunch special - for slightly less than the regular cost, you get your choice of rice donburi added to any udon. Be warned, this is a lot of food. I ordered the negitoro bowl to go with the salmon egg udon and OMG was the negitoro good. I just wish they offered a larger size.On my third and fourth visits I basically ordered the same two dishes - negitoro bowl and salmon egg udon because once you eat something here, you just have to go back to get over that feeling of not having enough. I think I'm finally ready to move down the menu."

4/4/2014,20140404,5,4.21,"My fiancé and I went here last night for our dating monthiversary because I was craving udon. Holy crap was this place good!!! It reminded me of marukame in Waikiki because the udon is freshly made in house. I got the shrimp tempura udon with a fish cake and he got the beef tempura and a roe rice bowl.The rice bowl came out first. The row was delicious with a nice, salty bite when you bit into it. It also came with some shredded seaweed on top.The shrimp tempura udon came with 2 huge pieces of shrimp. The tempura batter was definitely thicker and denser than most batter but it was delicious!!! The base for my soup was so yummy and definitely hit the spot on a freezing LA night. It was also a huge portion!! For some reason, I thought the fish cake was boiled and added to the soup but it was also fried in tempura batter. So delicious anyway. I never ever finish ramen or pho when I go out to eat, but I inhaled all of the udon, shrimp tempura, and fish cake.My fiancé's beef udon was pretty good. The beef was like the beef from yoshinoya (except more fresh). He really liked the broth. I thought it was pretty good but it was nothing like the shrimp tempura udon I got. There were a ton of other udon dishes including a carbonara sauce but I was craving a nice traditional soup base. I can't wait to go back and try more!!!"

I love that they make the noodles right there in the restaurant and you can see them kneading it and putting all the love into it! The broth was flavorful and the pork belly was soft and thick! I was surprised to get 3 good sized chunks of pork belly. The pork belly was seasoned slightly and tasted really good.I also got to try a bit of my friend's carbonara and it was also very delicious.I want to definitely come back to try some of their appetizers and the uni pasta!Came on a Sunday around 6 and we waited for about ~15mins!
4/8/2014,20140408,4,4.22,great place for creative takes on udon. it's even suprisingly kid friendly. so if you're tired of waiting in line at daikokuya downtown just walk a couple stores down to marugame monzo!
4/8/2014,20140408,3,4.21,Great place for simple eating with Udon varieties. Heard that there are crazy lines here so went early. Did not think its worth waiting over an hour but a great place to check out at least once for the udon making experience!

I ordered the creamy sea urchin udon, and it tasted pretty good without being overly creamy. If you are a fan of sea urchin, then definitely try this out. We also had the caprese salad, which I'm a big fan of. It was light in flavors and fresh, perfect way to start off my meal. I could not pass the tempura egg, because everyone has been talking so highly of these eggs. It was good and cooked to perfection, still runny, now that's a perfect egg. It was lacking salt though, so I put the chilli powder that they provided on the table. It tasted much better after that. Overall, good authentic udon place.

My boyfriend and I are a fan of this place and the wide array of udon dishes that you can choose from, from hot to cold, curry to creamy, seafood to meat, it's a great alternative for you regular ramen eaters. For ""foodie first timers"", I recommend sitting at the bar. It's a fun experience to watch them make the udon noodles, if you're into what goes into your food.The appetizers are yummy as well. I love the appetizer with the mozzarella cheese, yuzu, and tomatoes. It's a good introduction to what you're about to experience for your entree. The sakes are also good but they don't serve any of them hot, just by the bottle.The most important thing you should keep in mind is the wait. If you are going for dinner, expect an average 20-40 minute wait. It is a tight space, so make sure you are okay with walking around Little Tokyo to explore for a bit or do not come starving or you will be disappointed. There's a smaller wait time for lunch when I went on a Friday but if you get there early enough, you should have no problem. I've found the service here to also be good.Street parking or you can park in the lot on Judge John Aiso and First Street and walk over. Udon/Japanese foodies alike must put Marugame Monzo on your list of yelp bookmarked places ""to try""."
4/14/2014,20140414,5,4.21,"Ever since this place opened, I've been meaning to come here and after months of waiting for the perfect time, I finally made it to Marugame Monzo.The reason for my reluctant procrastination had to do with the fact that this place is always crowded and the wait was ridiculous. I generally head over to Little Tokyo on busy weekend evenings and as someone with the patience level of a kid, I couldn't seem to get myself to wait. It's right by Daikokuya, which is also very busy all the time, and I generally avoid at all costs.Before I digress, I luckily came on a Monday evening for a friend's dinner and we made sure to come close to the opening time so we could sit right away. We came at around 5:30 PM and sat down right away. Monzo has an extensive menu and what's cool is that they make the noodles right in front of you in the restaurant. The restaurant is tiny, yet it still has a sense of class, compared to Daikokuya, which always feels stuffy and unpleasant. Food came out extremely fast and portion size was huge! I ordered the Tomato Cream Seafood Udon and it was excellent! The udon noodles were perfection and they filled the sauce with plenty of seafood. I also ordered a shitake mushroom tempura, which was fantastic.Price was reasonable, service was excellent, and best of all, the food was very good!The only downside is that parking is a hassle. On busy evenings, one would have to be lucky to find street parking, or pay to park in a public garage. Monzo, I will be back! Thank you for a great udon experience!"
4/17/2014,20140417,5,4.21,"Never a wait, the most delicious udon I've had in LA! It's fun to watch the chefs prepare the noodles in the kitchen as well :) would definitely recommend!Update: jk, always a wait now! Haha :("
4/18/2014,20140418,4,4.21,"This place has always always been the place where I stand to wait for daikokuya but today I actually got a chance to try this place and I do not regret ! I love udon because it is fat and chewy! (: These udon noodles are made fresh and you can see the udon master making it when you eat! The menu is fairly simple and you are offered an array of hot and cold udon! I've heard so much about their specialties so me and my boyfriend ordered their specialities: uni cream and miso carbonara. With the two jidori eggs! The uni was very unique and it was both our first time tasting it! These kinds of dishes are very very heavy and the portions are juuust right! Anymore, we would've felt sick haha. I had the miso carbonara and it was DELICIOUS!! The thick and creamy sauce coated each udon strand perfectly and the bacon made it have so much depth. But. The tempura soft boiled eggs were on point! The tempura batter is a bit sweet and the egg really helped us not get so tired with the cream sauce. This place is pricey but I think it is pretty worth it for freshly made udon too! Parking sucks but that is a given."
4/18/2014,20140418,3,4.21,"I've been here to Marugame Monzo a couple of times and have mixed feelings about this place. It came highly recommended to me and everyone raves about the uni udon, but I'm always wary of mixing uni with other things, especially saucy/creamy dishes, because then you lose the original flavor and texture of the uni, which is what you're paying for anyway!The restaurant is small so not the best for big groups, at least during peak hours, due to the wait, but otherwise it's fine. It's located right next to Daikokuya and is small and elegant. The service is friendly, the food comes out super fast, and it's very clean. Even the bathroom is clean and nice and upscale, sort of like something you'd find at a nice hotel lobby. The coolest part (of the restaurant, not the bathroom) is that the hand made noodles are made right in front of you so you can see how it's done.-Sea Urchin Cream Udon: As I mentioned before, I love uni but they don't give you very much and it loses all the flavor and texture when mixed in. The uni is all small and broken up. Otherwise, the noodles are fabulous, you can definitely tell they're hand-made. It's very creamy, and while I was able to finish it, it didn't really sit well with me right after.-Miso Carbonara Udon: I didn't order this on the same day I had the Uni Udon, but I think it was even creamier!! So it was way too rich for me. But I did like the bacon, can't go wrong with that.-Mentai Squid Butter: soup is full of small eggs, it's light and buttery, and not as rich as the other noodle dishes I had, I loved it. Squid can be overly chewy sometimes but this one was great.-Negitoro rice bowl: I love rice, even more than noodles, so I had to order this. The Japanese mayo was pretty strong but the flavors blend well once you mix everything. The negitoro melts in your mouth and goes amazing with the rice. At less than $6, it's the dish that provides the best value.I give it 3.5 stars. The noodles were fantastic, and I'm generally not a fan of udon or thick noodles, but they were delicious. On the other hand, some of the dishes I tried were way too creamy for me and didn't settle well, and a lot of the items are pricey. Some of the innovative fusion dishes taste great but others fall flat, so it definitely depends on what you order!"
4/18/2014,20140418,5,4.21,"I really don't know anywhere else where they have udon freshly made on site except at Marugame Monzo. If you're lucky, you might get to have a seat right in front of the action and see the udon made in front of your very eyes!Marugame Monzo is really as hidden as it can be, especially for the fact that it is situated next to the immensely popular Daikokuya. Not to say that this place is better than Daikokuya, they are both very good in their own ways and you can not really compare the two since they're different (Daikokuya's my go-to place for ramen).What makes this place so unique is that they have both Western and Eastern ways of preparation for their main attraction - the udon! Of the half dozen dishes I've tried at this place (including the uni udon), the two stands out the most was the Udon Gratin and the Curry Udon for me. For the Uni lovers out there, the Uni Udon is definitely a must-order! The Duck Udon definitely wasn't that memorable.If you like cheese and can handle something really rich, the dish to try is Udon Gratin. The udon is baked under a layer of cheese and smothered in rich creamy sauce. Coupled with the chewiness of the udon, I don't even want to think about how many calories I am scarfing down with each bite of infectious deliciousness.The Curry Udon has slices of fatty pork that complemented very well with the aroma of the curry and the chewiness of the udon. The sauce was not too soupy and had just the right consistency. If you're looking for a good appetizer, the Beef Tataki is a great choice. The beef was very tender and it had good flavor.There's a lot of restaurants in Little Tokyo. However, there's only a few restaurants that go back again and again - Marugame Monzo is one of them."
4/19/2014,20140419,4,4.21,"Been there twice now. Both time had to wait about 30-45 minutes, but we just take a quick stroll around little Tokyo, so the wait isn't so bad. First time, ordered the creamy squid udon. Squid was good, but the creamy sauce was really rich. Second time, ordered the shrimp tempura udon. It came with 2 shrimps, but I also ordered an extra shrimp and a shiitake mushroom. The tempura is good but has a lot of batter on it. I've decided I like the more traditional udon."
4/20/2014,20140420,3,4.21,"Pleasant interior, fine visual presentation, taste is ok. There's a confusing part on the menu where you can buy extra toppings for additional charge, but beware, these all come out fried! I had the duck udon. it was just ok. The duck was kind of dry. The broth was flavorful without being oily."
4/22/2014,20140422,4,4.21,"Solid noodles at a good price, plus the added benefit of the noodle maker if you're bringing friends.It isn't the best I've had and some of the fusion dishes leave a bit to be desired, but one of the best udon shops in Los Angeles I've found, and I've been known to eat udon noodles on a daily basis in Japan."
4/23/2014,20140423,4,4.21,"The Mentai Squid Butter Udon is a very special dish and I cannot recommend it enough. You must like salt. We also had many of the tempura side dishes which were very well prepared; the eggplant and pumpkin were the most surprising of these. The layout and furnishings are also quite nice, inclusive of the bathroom."

The clear broth wasn't particularly special but the shrimp tempura was quite fresh and crunchy! Both the creamy udons were unique and tasty so I can't really say which one I liked better. The mentai squid butter udon had a distinct seafood flavor while the uni cream udon was rather light in the taste of uni (but then again I'd never had cooked uni before...I guess I just prefer my uni raw!)"

5/3/2014,20140503,2,4.21,"Whatever my girlfriend wants, she gets. As part of Mel's birthday weekend, she told me she was really wanting to check this place out. We came some rainy Sunday afternoon so udon was fitting for the weather. There was unsurprisingly a line, but we were seated within 15 minutes which was nice. The staff was friendly and attentive. People come here for the Sea Urchin Udon and I honestly think that's your best bet.I ordered the seafood udon with an ikura rice bowl and was pretty disappointed. The ikura rice bowl was a lot smaller than I would've hoped and was acceptable at best. The seafood udon felt like it had no identity. The broth was like based with animal fat, but it had seafood and random vegetables or something in it. The flavor profile was sort of savory, really hot temperature-wise, but ultimately not memorable. I was just cramming food into my mouth and drinking the broth trying to figure if there was any particular theme. There wasn't one.Mel ordered the Sea Urchin Udon and it was so creamy. The broth was creamy, the noodles were creamy, everything about it was just so creamy. This made the dish very rich and it tasted good because of the high fat content. The sea urchin was key, its essence in everything really made the dish be distinct. Unlike myself, Mel was very satisfied.In terms of Japanese noodle places, this Marugame Monzo doesn't do it for me. I could get ramen or udon closer and I don't feel this was worth the trip. Check out Foo Foo Tei in Hacienda Heights (yelp.com/biz/foo-foo-tei…) or dare I say even Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi in Rosemead (yelp.com/biz/hakata-rame…). They offer delicious Japanese noodle dishes that are comparable if you aren't specifically looking for sea urchin.The good news is that Mel was happy, so mission accomplished."

5/4/2014,20140504,2,4.21,Kind of a mixed review for this place.We were seated at the counter and service was great and we had a birds eye view of the udon chef at work. My friend and I shared the beef udon soup and the chicken breast salad with cold udon noodles. Both were delicious.Hours later we both had stomach issues. It made us sick and its a shame as I wont be returning here again.
5/5/2014,20140505,2,4.2,"35%Okay Duck udon. ***Came here for dinner May '15.Marugame Monzo seems to be a restaurant that specializes in making Udon. What that seems popular is their more traditional udon soup noodle bowls. There are also some Japanese influenced pasta dishes. Instead of using conventional pasta, udon is used.Overall, I thought my food was so-so. It wasn't bad. The dish I tried had some notable positives, which I'll elaborate further on. Nonetheless, I did not find myself enjoying the dish and found myself feel a tad disappointed as I left. I did have a prior bias. I have never found myself drawn to udon noodles. I don't hate it. It doesn't do much for me either way.  However, I like to give things another try and see if I can appreciate something I didn't care for in an earlier stage of my life. Although I'm not familiar with what makes a good udon from a not so great version, I can be mindful about what I like or not.I ordered just the hot udon with a light broth and duck slices, which was close to $15 after tax and before tip.Things I liked about the dish:-The duck used was the best part. I liked how you could taste the flavor in the meat. It had a more notable metallic finish or gaminess that I enjoyed. This was despite it being cooked a bit more than I'd like, and it having barely any skin or fat. I know I would have enjoyed duck over white rice instead of udon, and I say that without any embarrassment. -The texture of the meat was relatively tender as well. I do wish there was more fat and duck skin on the slices of meat, but it worked well enough.-The sweeter green onions that went well with the duck and offered a bit of crunchy texture.Qualities that I thought were okay or not so great:- The broth was okay. It was a light broth that tended to be sweet and bright. I liked how it seemed to carry the flavor of the green onions somewhat, but I found it a tad simple and not particularly engaging. Although by no means unpleasant, there was nothing I found that made it stand out.- The temperature of the broth wasn't as hot as I'd like. It was not off to the extent where it was lukewarm, but it drops to that without having to wait too long.- I was not a fan of the noodles themselves. Initially there was some chewiness and bounciness in the starch, but I realized it got softer to the extent where it almost became a bit mushy relatively soon. With Udon being a heavy starch, the sensation became tedious relatively quick. I ate about half the noodles and had no interest to take anything home.Because I did not care for the texture of the noodles so much, I think it would be unlikely that I would enjoy the pastas. I also think it may be overkill to use such a dense starch with heavier cream sauces that are so common at Monzo. However, I haven't tried them, so its merely hypothetical on my part.Value seems okay. $15 seems reasonable. The quality of the duck was good, even though I was they may have been more generous with the protein. Although I wasn't a fan of the udon, its hard to deny Monzo takes pride in hand making their noodles. Even though I was not entirely thrilled about my dinner, it would be unfair to not recognize the work and quality put into it.Service was so-so. The attention of the staff seemed scattered at times, but it wasn't unpleasant. The quality of service is what you might expect at comparable restaurants, and actually a step above the aloofness at Daikokuya next door. To be fair, they were busier on the night I visited.Ambiance seems a bit generic. The one perk is that you get to see a person hand make udon close up at the counter, but otherwise the decor is a little generic. Acoustics are not as loud as I anticipated, given how busy they were.In most respects, it was a fairly average experience. I would not return, but its not a bad place to try given that it's not too expensive or time consuming of an affair."
5/5/2014,20140505,5,4.21,"Brought my date here on a Sunday evening at about 630pm. To our surprise, we only have to wait like 10 minutes to get our table for 2. awesome!Ordered the scallop appetizer. Scallop was so fresh. Just make sure you know you like raw scallop if you get this dish.Both my date and I got the uni udon because we both love uni. If you've never had fresh uni, you've got to try it here. The udon is handmade so it had the perfect consistency. The cream sauce that comes along with the udon is so creamy and complements the dish perfectly!Server was very friendly and helpful to my date and I :)"
5/6/2014,20140506,2,4.2,"I was so, so, SO excited for this :( I heard such great things, but everything was just okay. I thought since the udon was freshly made, the texture or taste would be different or unique or there would be something special about it.. Sadly, I could not tell the difference between this udon vs any other udon I've had. I came with my mom and my aunt. We had the beef udon, the mentai butter udon, and the beef tataki. The broth for the udon was okay. I can't remember anything too great about it. Beef was cooked well and was yummy. The mentai butter udon was interesting. Squid was very soft, but I found myself wishing for a bit more texture in the dish. Beef tataki was very bland and super oily. Peppercorns added a bit of flavor, but not much. I had asked if the beef tataki could be more well cooked since my mom doesn't like to eat her meat so rare, but my server and I couldn't understand each other. I had also ordered a tempura soft boiled egg, but it never came out. At that point, I was so underwhelmed by everything, I just wanted to finish eating and leave. I guess I'd come back once more to try the uni udon, but I don't see myself rushing back anytime soon."
5/7/2014,20140507,4,4.2,"Food: AService: A Food: I came here on a whim because my friend recommended it to me. I ordered the sea urchin cream udon and my friend ordered the kakuni udon noodle soup w/ a side order of hard boiled egg. In order to get the most out of the experience we decided to share everything, the noodle soup came first. Dish consisted of the udon noodles with about 6 pieces of pork belly meat. The pork belly meat was soft and moist but lacked some flavor. As for the udon noodles it was love at first bite! Reason why it is so delicious? It is because it is made fresh in house ! As for the broth it was nice and not too salty. If you can handle a little spice I recommened adding a little of their chili powder which will make it taste even BETTER! Soft boiled eggs!!!! You cannot forget these, because for me at least this is the first time I have ever seen a tempura covered soft boiled egg! It was oh so yummy. Lastly, the main event, the sea urchin cream udon. Although the portion looked small, don't underestimate it because the dish is pretty heavy due to the cream sauce. Overall, the dish was delicious and the sea urchin was fresh. Service: Servers were on top of things, came to our table multiple times to ask if we were ready to order, refilled our waters and brought us dinnerware promptly. They even brought us the check without asking which I found to be pretty awesome! Best service I had in a while.So after reading my review, you are probably wondering why I only gave this place 4 stars. Reason is because I had to pay $8 for parking to dine at this fine establishment. If there was free parking, I would definitely come back more often. Two thumbs up for FOOD & SERVICE! :)"
5/7/2014,20140507,5,4.2,Came here many times with friends. Just need to wait about 10mins and we get the seats. Creamy udon and it was pretty good. It's very different taste from other udon place. This place always having fresh udon and Everytime is delicious.
5/9/2014,20140509,5,4.2,"This place is AMAZING! Who would have ever thought to cook and eat udon in any other way than just with shoyu broth?! Not only do they have udon served in it's classic and traditional way, there are signature udon dishes that they are known for! Udon cooked in sauces or thick sauces and in an extremely flavorful tasteUdon is hand made and hand rolled. If you sit at the bar you can enjoy your meal while watching the cooks hang roll the udon noodles from scratch! At least this way you also know their udon is hand made Come in for lunch specials where you can add a type of meat rice bowl to your udon for $3-4!! Sea Urchin Cream Udon: udon served in an extremely creamy uni sauce that is both rich and flavorful of the sea. Topped with a solid piece of sea urchin in the middle. The creamy thick sauce is also filled with sea urchin bits and pieces throughout in the creamy bowl of sauce. Delicious. Delicious! Best sea urchin cream sauce I have tasted so far! Udon so soft and velvety! A bit pricey at $15.95 but hey! It's seafood! It's expensive Miso Carbonara: this udon is drenched in a bowl of creamy sauce that is even creamier and thicker than the sea urchin cream sauce! This dish tasted almost exactly like pasta carbonara Italian dish except with udon! So more of an Asian feel to it! Thick large and cut pieces of bacon in this dish! Yummy and flavorful! $12.50Mentai Squid Butter: this udon dish wasn't cooked in a creamy thick sauce like the precious two but resembled more like a traditional udon noodle soup! The broth is shoyu flavor with many little cod roe fish eggs in the butter broth sauce and topped with seaweed and white onions!!! Lots of cut squid pieces! Yummy! Delicious to drink!! $12.95Pros: -quick service-delicious udon signature dishes-yummy udon in general-udon is hand made!!! -lunch specials! Add a bowl of rice and whatever protein for $3-4 with your order of udon! Although I must warn you you'll prolly already be content to full with your udon alone! But it's nice to have leftovers! Cons:-parking is hard to find!! Try to find meter parking along the streets surrounding the area!! Or I suggest parking in a structure a few blocks away and buy something fat a market to get validation! Just walk over! -a bit more pricey for their signature udon dishes but prices are reasonably at $7-9 for traditional udon broth soups!"
5/10/2014,20140510,4,4.2,"Fresh made, chewy udon made to order...yes please! My second visit to Marugame Monzo and I am still impressed with the food here. Last night I came here with my husband for an early birthday / mother's day dinner celebration. We arrived at 5:45 and were seated promptly. Ordered the Udon Gratin, soft boiled egg, and curry udon. Udon Gratin was uber cheesy and creamy , perfect for a cheese lover like myself. It came out in the iron skillet. Reminded me of fancy mac n cheese..yum.My husband ordered the double portion of curry udon. The curry was perfectly thick, not too watery, right amount of spice. You pay 2 dollars more for a double portion of noodles...it was well worth in in our opinion. Soft boiled egg- was battered, fried tempura style with a slightly runny egg yoke...yummy.  Last time I ordered the Sea Urchin Cream udon. It was creamy..but in my opinon I couldn't really taste the uni and I love uni!We both left the restaurant happy and satisfiedn glad that we came early because the line of people was starting to pile up outside the door.*tips- no reservations accepted. All members of the party must be present they will not seat you until everyone has arrived.No take out"
5/11/2014,20140511,4,4.2,"Parking: very hard to find cause it's lite Tokyo. Service: we got to the restaurant at 7pm on a Saturday night. We had about 7 people ahead of us and the wait was about 20 minutes. Food: Delicious Japanese udon! This place makes their own udon and serves it in a variety of ways. I ordered the squid cod roe and butter style, it was extremely delicious with seafood flavors. The best part was the squid, it's cooked just right so it wasn't rubbery. My brother got the hot tempura shrimp with udon, the shrimp was good. Fried like normal shrimp tempura. We also got the tempura soft boiled egg, which seemed really interesting to me but I was not blown away. Probably wouldn't get the egg again."
5/12/2014,20140512,4,4.2,"Park anywhere you can.the udon place... yes, a please I cant seem to forget. the udon was yummie, the place was super packed, but the service was... alight... could be better... but i give it good one for the yummieness, plus my friend and i had a blast!"
5/12/2014,20140512,5,4.2,"Really good handmade udon here. Texture and taste really good. We sat at the counter, so had a view of the meticulous preparation of the udon. I had the kakuni udon. Broth really tasty, pork nicely fatty and tasty. Also had a single shrimp tempura. Excellent batter, crispy but not oily. If you come here early on a Sunday (we were head of the line at 11:05am for their 11:30 opening) there is decent street parking availability."
5/12/2014,20140512,5,4.21,"This is the best Udon in town. I had tempura Udon and it was fabulous. This is the only place that I've had tempura udon, where you get the entire shrimp. The broth was delicious and the noodles are made there in front of you. I Highly recommend Monzo. A must try."
5/14/2014,20140514,1,4.2,"I've been here many times and the food has always been great. However, they have the worst waiting rule. Today I walked in - the entire restaurant only had two tables full but they refused to seat me because I was waiting for my friend to join me. It was 100 degrees outside so needless to say it was not pleasant to wait. While waiting only two other tables came in so they could have easily sat me down."
5/14/2014,20140514,5,4.2,"It was a long line but we only waited 15 minutes on Mother's Day for dinner so I applaud their fast service! Very friendly staff, nice dim and busy atmosphere with chefs making udon and broth in view. Best part was the food. I had the creamy tomato udon and left wanting more. I love pasta and udon so this is a great place for both! Also had the seated steaks, YUM!"
5/14/2014,20140514,4,4.2,"Finally tried it Monday night. Everyone was telling me that I need to go early or else there would be a long wait. Luckily when I arrived at 7:30pm, they seated us right away. We ordered the appetizer clam and grilled chicken breast. Clam was very tasty and yummy, but the chicken was dry. I also ordered the cream mushroom udon, that was excellent!"
5/15/2014,20140515,5,4.2,"Best udon in LA. Period. Broth udon are good but the all the specialty ones are amazing! (Squid mentai butter is my #1 :) also, crispy chicken skin a an app is a must! Longs waits but it's to be expected when waiting for the best of anything."
5/16/2014,20140516,3,4.2,ambiance//***maybe it's the dark wood interior that gives it an inherent intimate vibeit helps you overlook how small the place actually isbar seating if you want to see them make everyone's noodlesservice//*****quick . efficient . trademark politely japanesesomehow they accomplish rushing you through your mealw/o actually verbally or physically doing itwhat a feat!food//***hands down best udon i've had in LAsignature unidon? =9mentai squid udon? yummy as welludon au gratin is delightfully cheesy!so why only 3? given that it's the best udon i've had in LAsorrie but the first two things i listed are regulars in my kitchenso only the au gratin is special to me~*~a good choice if you in lil' tokyo and want a quick bite w/ good service!
5/17/2014,20140517,4,4.2,"Fresh hand made udon. We were seated at the counter where they were making he udon so it was fun to watch while we waited and are. We tried the sea urchin cream udon ($15.50) and the curry udon ($9.50). The sea urchin was too fishy for me and very rich. The curry broth was also very strong. However, the udon was very yummy. There is a lot of sauce so it might be worth it to add extra udon. I would probably stick with a clear broth type udon next time."
5/18/2014,20140518,5,4.2,"NOODLES!! More specifically udon!! If not for the heat wave baking my sorry ass, I would have gone for the uni udon. But I went with a cold bukkake udon with mentai and plum to cool down. Simple, healthy noodles with great texture. Well, healthy because I had the more traditional noodles. But if they can get that down, then I must for sure try their creamy udon inventions next time!! That was the whole reason I wanted to come here - to load up on uni and fatty, creamy heaven. My stomach is growling to go back..."
5/19/2014,20140519,3,4.2,"This place is set up almost exactly like Daikokuya next door which means it's going to get crowded because of the tiny interior so be prepared to wait on a busy night. If it's not busy, ask to be seated at the bar because you can watch the udon being made by hand while you eat which is a pretty cool experience!The udon noodles itself is probably the best I've ever had. It's so thick, and chewy and amazing I can't describe it. This is a must-try place for noodle lovers. We tried: - Bukkake Udon from the cold udon portion of the menu. I was so happy I tried this as my first experience here. There were so many options I just had to pick one and I""m glad it was this! This comes with broth on the side which you can pour and eat it with each bite or into the noodles. Either or, it was light, refreshing for the hot day, and the noodles...ommmgg can't explain. -Sea urchin udon with uni sauce. This was good..BUT as the more expensive udon choice (15$) it wasn't worth it at all. It was more on the heavier side, the uni sauce wasn't anything special: it tasted similar to the sauce in fettucini alfredos, and the sea urchin wasn't tasted at all here. It was definitely overpowered by everything else which was a disappointment.-Chicken tempura, mushroom tempura. and onion tempura, and their famous egg tempura- all were such a disappointment! There was NO flavor here at all... like NONE. It was basically all fried oil and dried insides. Would not order any of the tempuras next time. Don't order these!I definitely have to give them credit for their amazing noodles and the quality, time put into making them. However, on this specific trip we were only pleased with 1 dish. Will definitely come back to try other dishes."
5/19/2014,20140519,5,4.2,"Holy sh!t! I haven't had udon this amazing... ever. I love how the noodles are made on site for all to see. it's mesmerizing. I can't wait 'til i'm hungry again so that I can go back. I love this place,"
5/19/2014,20140519,4,4.2,"One of the best udon I have had. I got the one signature udon - Mentai Squid Butter, which was a bit rich but definably very flavorful. I also added the additional beef rice bowl (beef don) on the side and it was good, but not as great as the udon.  The restaurant has an open kitchen where we can see the chef making the fresh udon from scratch!  The wait is a bit long, but it was for sure worth it!"
5/20/2014,20140520,4,4.2,"My friend insisted I give this place another chance, saying that I ordered wrong. Well I am rounding this 3.5 up to 4 because that kakuni was pretty amazing BUT the first time I came my friend's pork belly salad was really dry so order the pork belly appetizer and definitely not the weird salad version. It's actually some of the best kakuni I've had in LA - meltingly tender served in a nice fatty broth. The tempura egg with the perfectly runny yolk was also pretty good. My friend loves the uni pasta - I prefer my uni pasta with more uni flavor and a thicker sauce - the broth was very watery here, so it wasnt until towards the end, in the creamy soup, that we discovered all of the uni. We also tried the carbonara, which combined with the uni cream pasta was a bit too heavy in retrospect. The carbonara was ok, but I'd rather just get the Italian version. I love Japanese wafu pasta but I think I prefer ones with more japanese flair like mentaiko."
5/21/2014,20140521,4,4.2,"Really good udon that's made fresh right in front of you.They have three broad categories of udon - hot traditional udon, cold udon, and specialty udon. The specialty udon is essentially Japanese-Italian fusion, most of them made with a cream sauce. The uni udon is really excellent - hot, rich, and intense. My only gripe is that the uni used wasn't the best quality, being rather small, but it's not the best season for uni at the moment so I'll reserve judgment for now. I went for lunch and they apparently have a large selection of appetizers that appear only on the dinner menu, so I'll probably go back to try some of those."
5/23/2014,20140523,3,4.2,"Overall, the noodles aren't bad...but not amazing. The soup was good, but for the price I'd rather eat at Daikokuya or Shinsengumi. To put things in perspective, my best udon experience was at Marukame Udon in Honolulu, HI. $3 for kake udon without the added items/tempura?? It was an unbeatable deal for price and taste."
5/26/2014,20140526,5,4.2,"The uni udon was absolutely delicious. I order this every time! I also like the chicken skin. It's not overly oily and has great flavor.I sat by the window pane and watched the chef prepare fresh udon noodles. It was great to watch the process. Parking can be tough, but if you arrive after 8 pm, you can usually find street parking for free around the block."
5/27/2014,20140527,5,4.2,"Udon understand how much I love Marugame Monzo. In the past two weeks I've been here three times AND I'm going again tonight. I'm addicted. Let me tell you why .. My first time here I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter udon after reading some reviews. It has a really interesting flavor, but it's good! I would recommend it if you're looking to try something new. The udon here is effing AMAZING. It's freshly made and cut in front of you so you know this place's noodles are always on point. They're so tender and perfect. Truly the best udon I've ever had. There's one thing I always order every time and it's the Pork Belly Bowl with Flavored Rice. It's a side dish order and it's a good amount so you can split with someone else, but trust me, once you taste it, you won't want to share. I hadn't tried it yet and my friend was like, ""Brittney try this. It will straight up change your life."" IT DID. It's melt-in-your-mouth good. (and I'm salivating just thinking about it.) You have to try this - you won't regret it. It's an amazing combination that's packed with flavor and it blows my mind every single time.Other udons I've tried - Uni Pasta Udon - Not a huge fan of uni so this wasn't that great for me. I could see how some people could like it, but uni is an acquired taste and I just can't eat a whole bowl of it. The sauce is pretty creamy and heavy so that's why halfway into it I gave up hahaha. Pork Belly Udon - flavorful, nice chunks of pork belly in there but I don't think I would order again. Shrimp Tempura Udon - delicious. Probably my favorite here! and the shrimp tempura is fried to perfection. Beef Udon - the broth is a little sweeter than the shrimp tempura udon's. It's really good as well and they give you a good amount of beef : )(*edit - 8/13/14) Miso Carbonara - My new favorite, especially if you want something with a creamy sauce. It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be. Definitely give this a try! Oh God, my stomach just growled as I was typing this.Overall this place is soooo underrated. It's right next to the overrated Daikokuya and there are so many times where I just walked by Marugame Monzo without even looking inside. And there's always a huge ass wait for Daikokuya and I'm like, ""Why?!"" Little did I know, I was walking by the BEST udon restaurant in Los Angeles. So glad I finally tried it because I am officially hooked. : )"
5/27/2014,20140527,4,4.2,"I heard a lot about this place. They're known for their Uni Udon. I came here on a Saturday night, around 7:30ish. I got lucky and didn't have to wait long (maybe 10-15 mins for a group of 4). The Uni Udon was good, but not as great as I imagined it will be. The first couple bites, you can taste the uni, but after that, you can only taste the heavily creamed broth. Still good in my opinion, but if I wanted to eat uni, I would rather go somewhere else where they give more. Either way, it was a good experience, and it's definitely something different. Their plum wine was also really good too.I would come back again to try out their other dishes."
5/28/2014,20140528,3,4.2,"Don't be fooled by the long line outside the restaurant, at least half the people waiting are for the Daikokuya next door! It's a really small place, and they seat the parties of two A LOT quicker than any larger parties, even if they arrived first. The lunch menu is missing many items that are on dinner menu, so in order to see all the dishes, I suggest going for dinner! They also don't do any take out for the udon, only the rice dishes.I've tried their sea urchin udon, and the seafood udon, both are pretty good. I think if you're in the mood for some hearty udon, this is the place to go! A group seated next to us during my last visit ordered cold udon along with all these toppings, I couldn't help but stare and drool at what they were eating. I'm not that adept at ordering Japanese food, but I think next time I'll give the cold udon dishes a try!It's always fun going to Little Tokyo, but the parking is a pain! If you go after 6pm, it's free parking in the yellow loading zone areas. Otherwise, expect to pay a couple bucks for parking!"
5/28/2014,20140528,5,4.2,"Having only recently discovered the joy of Udon, I did unfortunately discover this at Marukame in Oahu - an unparalleled experience you simply must try. Monzo fortunately is the next best thing. Delicious in its simplicity. Friendly to your wallet. Fresh made in front if your eyes. A festival on your tongue. Try the Kamaage style (in hot water with hot dipping sauce). Tempuras are nice add-ons. I like the Pumpkin and the Chicken (but be sure to dip them in your hot dipping sauce)."
5/28/2014,20140528,5,4.2,"Must try the creamy Uni Udon!! Although it is not the traditional Japanese udon, I like it mixing the Western and Japanese. Definitely worth to try!"
5/29/2014,20140529,4,4.2,Don't come to an udon place and order a rice bowl like I did. It was nothing spectacular and I felt a little sad as I ate my tiny vegetable tempura bowl as my friends slurped up freshly made udon. The price is fair considering the home made touch and effort that goes into each and every bowl. Service was good and fast - much appreciated when you're a big party on a weekend night. I will probably return on a weekday night when I don't have to fight for a table.
5/31/2014,20140531,5,4.2,"Marugame Monzo is breaking out of the shadow of its next door neighbor Daikokuya and has been gathering sizable lines of its own. And for very good reason - this place features the BEST udon you can get in Southern California (as far as my personal experience tells me).For me, what makes a great oodle of noodle great is the little bounce back you get from the noodle when you chew on it - it's a subtle gesture how freshly made the noodle is, but creates a distinctiveness that is hard to let go."
6/1/2014,20140601,5,4.2,Great place. Stumbled here with a friend and it was a great find. The Chicken Tempura udon is great and The Champon Udon that my friend had looked good. This is a great place for a casual dinner before a night out. I definitely recommend it! Great service but I would highly recommend getting here before they open at 5pm or you'll have to wait in line.
6/2/2014,20140602,4,4.2,"Stumbled upon this restaurant after reading an LA Times article and also after seeing a long that was way too long at Daikokuya. The waiter was super attentive & great service! Watching the chefs roll out the fresh udon was a fun experience. I tried the beef soup udon- which tasted very similarly to Chinese beef noodle soup. The noodles were so fresh and tasty. Lots of green onions which were to my liking.The perfect chewy texture for udon. My favorite thing I tried was actually my friends curry udon. It was so tasty and different for an udon. I can't wait to have a whole bowl of this to myself. I can't wait to come back here on a crisp cool night, perfect for udon."
6/2/2014,20140602,5,4.2,"My boyfriend and I were craving Japanese food after watching this show on Youtube. Well, the show mainly showed us sushi but I guess anything Japanese will do for us. Thanks you Yelp, I found this little restaurant and Im going to say, that this is my favorite udon place now.Parking always sucks in downtown. On the weekends, you can park on the street but thats hard to find. I usually just park in the parking structure for $5 by the Japanese Village Plaza. The place is located right next to Daikokuya. If you can't find the place, just look for a long line of people waiting for Daikokuya. Im surprised that there's no line for this place, because I would so wait for 45 minutes to eat here. The place is quite crowded inside, from people to tables and chairs. The space between the tables are extremely tight! The restaurant can get pretty darn loud where the staffs would scream out hello/ goodbye in japanese. We were seated prompty when we got there which was awesome. We came 2 minutes earlier before the crowd started to form :) We were seated in a tight spot and were given water and our menus. Of course, we were recommended by our Yelpers to get the Squid Butter Udon with the Tempura Boiled Eggs and the Uni Udon as well. That was exactly what we got.The squid butter udon sounded a bit scary because it has the word butter in it but turns out, the udon was extremely light. The broth was extremely flavorful and it wasnt too heavy. The bowl was filled with tiny fish eggs and that was good too. The uni udon is my favorite! The udon was so creamy and the uni doesnt make my bowl stink! Ive had cooked uni before and I didnt like it one bit. But this! It was so delicious!! Flavorful and it was very filling. I didnt even get to finish it but I really wanted to. I will definitely return...shoot might even come back next Saturday!"

I didnt even get to finish it but I really wanted to. I will definitely return...shoot might even come back next Saturday!"
6/4/2014,20140604,2,4.2,Bad service and regular food. Not worth it. I rather wait in a long line at daikokuya just right next door. Super rude to the costumer.
6/7/2014,20140607,2,4.2,"I was excited to try this place because of the novelty of being able to watch the chef actually knead and cut the udon in front of you. No table was available, and it wasn't even 6:00 yet. So I was even more excited when we had to sit at the bar because of the lack of open tables. After watching for 2 minutes, that was when the novelty started to wear off. The appetizer of beef tataki was okay, but I've had way better at other places. The udon soup was bland and tasted very regular. I was expecting to be blown away by the texture of the udon since it was freshly-made. However, disappointingly, the udon did not taste any different than the udon I've tasted anywhere else. None of the food wowed me here, but the decor and vibe of the restaurant were modern and appealing."

6/8/2014,20140608,3,4.19,"Came here with one of my girlfriends the other night for dinner and was really excited to try this place. Seems like a pretty popular restaurant looking at all the people waiting to be seated outside. Being that it was a Saturday night the wait was pretty long, but probably not as long as others. I think because we had only two people. The place was very small and was very cramped inside. Everyone sits very close together. For my meal, I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and my friend ordered the Uni Udon. I was pretty pleased with my dish but it's nothing I would crave to get again. The service was pretty non-existent. I saw our waitress when taking our orders but that was it besides paying for the bill. Overall, I think the food was good but the service and ambiance was just okay. I don't think I would wait that long to go again."

6/9/2014,20140609,5,4.19,This have to be the best udon place I've tried in LA and my friends have been raving about.The texture of the udon is different from the rest I've tried and it's so good. They have traditional udon for you guys who wants to play safe and then they have the fancy udons for those who wants to be adventurous.The appetizer was pretty good too. The chicken skin and the braised pork was delish.
6/9/2014,20140609,3,4.19,"I went tonight; I had heard good things about this place. Nice simple decor, we sat at the counter and watched the guy make and cut the udon noodles from scratch. Kinda fun. The rice is excellent, the service good, although they made a mistake on my beer, nama (draft) is not in a bottle, and the udon broth is superb. The noodles, being homemade of course were superb, BUT it was kinda sad, my friend had cold sansai udon and the noodles were perfect, firm and a little chewy, but I had warm udon and the the noodles were soft, almost mush. Why do they cook them so long especially given the superb quality of the noodle? Or did I just have bad luck? I'll try again one day... I was kinda sad after watching the guy make them by hand..."

6/10/2014,20140610,5,4.19,"The BEST udon place ever. Hand made udon noodles. I've tried the curry udon and beef udon. In my opinion, the beef udon is better- coming from the carnivore side of me. The best spot to grab a bite to eat in Little Tokyo in my opinion. Yes, better than Daikokuya (few doors down). There is always usually a wait. But definitely worth it. The noodles are fresh, and they are extremely generous in their servings. Do NOT get their tempura ( around 5 pieces) and I kid you not, they battered a piece of leaf! I've never seen that in my life before.. But hey, it's an udon spot so I wouldn't expect much in that area. Anywho, the next time I return, I plan to order their specialty udon- basically udon noodles in cooked like pasta!Mmm, can't wait to return."
6/10/2014,20140610,5,4.19,"I finally tried this place after reading and hearing about how bomb this place was! Got here at 520pm on a Sunday and guess what?... The place was already packed and had to wait about 20 minutes before getting seated!! About 10min into our waiting time, the waitlist was LONG.We got seated near the bar, which was very nice as you can see the people behind the glass wall hand make the Udon noodles. We ordered:Pork Belly Salad: Thinly sliced pork belly on top of some greens. Nothing special, but a decent appetizer.Mentai Squid Butter: Super rich and Squidy flavor. The sauce was full of fish roe and had some good pieces of squid in it. I definitely would recommend this and get this again.Creamy Uni Udon: I love uni and this dish was perfect for me. The uni sauce wasn't too heavy and thick... it had the perfect consistency. You could see bits and pieces of uni as well.Udon here is freshly made. It is a little chewy and cooked to perfection. Pair that with the Uni Sauce or Squid Butter sauce and you get this amazing bowl of deliciousness. I cannot wait to come back!5 stars for food 5 stars for service."

6/11/2014,20140611,5,4.2,"Perfection. I didn't eat any of the creamy udon. I'm a purist, so I decided to order the plain broth with pork belly. Up until the first time I tried this place, my only exposure to udon was the refrigerator aisle at a Chinese supermarket. I had extremely low expectations of this place. But when I ordered my soup, I was shocked at how simple it was. This was a case of perfected simplicity. I could not find a single flaw in my soup. The umami, the light and roundness of the stock, the bounce of the udon after every chew, the perfectly marbled fat on the pork belly was in complete harmony. I was at loss of words. I cried a little bit too. I especially know how painstakingly hard it is to spend hours, finding the right point to balance stock. Absolute perfection."

6/14/2014,20140614,5,4.2,"I'm gonna come right out and say an outrageous thing: the creamy uni udon is the best thing I've eaten in YEARS. That sounds like a bold statement, but I'm standing by it. This dish was amazing. I am speechless. I love noodles of any kind, and I love creamy pastas, and this was the best of both worlds. Creamy and flavorful sauce, chewy noodles, hearty pieces of uni. Just SO delicious. I was shocked when eating it. I'm going to go back and try every other creamy udon on the menu. Out of the 300+ Yelp reviews/restaurants that I've written about, this place is easily in the top 5."
6/16/2014,20140616,5,4.2,"PARTY IN YOUR MOUTH! ORGY IN YOUR MOUTH!Went to LA with my boyfriend a few months ago and this was one of the places on my list. My boyfriend and I wanted to go back before we went home. LOL Uni Udon: I seriously cannot find the words to describe the Uni Udon. It was LIFE CHANGING! I am probably the biggest udon lover. The uni udon came in a cream sauce. Almost like Udon meats alfredo, but not as heavy. Uni usually has a very strong seafood taste, but the way they prepared it camouflaged out the fishiness. Curry udon: It was good, but nothing compared to the uni udon. The curry soup/sauce was light. I would of liked it more if the curry taste was a little more powerful. But that's just me.Vongole (clam) udon: Probably my least favorite dish, but because I was going gaga over the uni udon. hahahaWe also had the scallop carppaccio and beef tataki for appetizers . Both were good. The noodles are handmade and the texture was perfect. Stretchy, chewy, yummy.The wait might be long, but it is worth it. Price isn't so bad either. We got 3 udons, 2 appetizer, 2 beers, and 2 house sake all for around $140, if i remember correctly."
6/16/2014,20140616,4,4.2,"Came here during lunch and had to wait about 20 minutes or maybe less (a few groups ahead of us were not present when their names were called). Place is pretty small so I can see this place being a complete mess at dinner but my experience wasn't too bad for lunch. I ordered the uni udon which came in a cream sauce. The dish was pretty heavy and flavorful but it wasn't anything mind blowing although the udon noodles are good. Not too hard or chewy, done just right. I'd rather get uni pasta somewhere else though for that price. Also tried the kake udon and kamaage udon which is just udon in broth. Both of them were pretty good for the price. The kamaage udon came in a seafood broth that was tasty but not too salty or overwhelming.I can't comment on any of the bad service or wait times for dinner but if I come back it definitely would be for lunch. This place is good but not one hour wait good."
6/16/2014,20140616,4,4.2,I like this kind of udon.Stretchy and chewy. Creamy uni is too creamy though.Tempura is very very good.We tried fried egg because a lot of people said it is a must try.It was just ok. It is not a must try for me.
6/16/2014,20140616,2,4.2,"Uni udon. I remember having uni on a leaf but now they put salmon roe? I hate salmon roe. They shouldve mentioned they will be replacing it with salmon roe when I was ordering.Anyway I tried to ask the waitress about this but couldnt communicate with her. Didnt speak English... She mentioned they change to salmon roe now a while back but I saw the guy next to me who got his uni udon before mine (although I ordered first) and I swear his has uni, not salmon roe!Maybe communication barrier. Not sure whats going on"
6/17/2014,20140617,4,4.2,"Well it certainly lived up to my expectations, which were kind of high, considering the hype. When my friend Hannah E gets excited about a place, I definitely pay attention. We met up for an early dinner (6pm) and there was absolutely no wait. We sat at the bar by the big noodle-making display window and got to see some of the work in action, which was fun, but apparently a majority of the work gets done during the day. I had to order the uni cream udon, of course, and Hannah got her fave, the Mentai squid butter udon. From reading the other reviews I knew to expect the sauce to be on the runnier side, and it was exactly so. It's definitely different from the uni cream pasta you might get at Maruhide Uni Club or Cafe Hiro, so don't go in expecting that; this is its own animal, and as such, very satisfying. The noodles were indeed perfect, and I loved every bite. I also tried their scallop carpaccio, which was good but not super-stellar in my book. Also got to try a bit of Hannah's Mentai squid butter udon and while interesting, not really my cup of tea--I'll stick to the uni cream. It's also a little spendy, but definitely worth the visit. I will be trying the more traditional dish next time."
6/17/2014,20140617,5,4.2,"4.5 stars (from a gal who doesn't even like udon)I'll admit, I first stumbled into Marugame Monzo because the wait at Daikokuya next door was too long. But it must have been an act of divine intervention, to show this udon nonbeliever that fat noodles can be delicious too. With a sweeping variety of flavors to satisfy any craving, from traditional Japanese broths to creamy Italian concoctions, Monzo is a veritable Little Tokyo treasure. There is nothing in Los Angeles quite like it.My personal favorite is the curry udon: its fragrant and flavorful, with just enough spice to tickle the palate, but not so much that it is overwhelming. I also like the traditional beef Shoyu, the seafood campon and, of course, the miso carbonara. WOW. The cream based pasta/udon is very rich and heavy, certainly not something you could eat everyday. Serving sizes are quite generous, but those with bigger appetites can upgrade to a large bowl or add a side of tempura. Also, a must is the beef tataki appetizer: rare on the inside, seared on outside with a delicious green onion, citrus and olive oil dressing--a great dish for the whole table to share.The ambiance is modern and clean and the real allure at Monzo is getting to watch the udon chef make the noodles behind a glass window. They roll and cut the noodles by hand with such care and skill, it's a true spectacle to behold. I must say, hand made udon noodles have a far superior texture and chewiness--perhaps this is why Monzo is the only udon I can enjoy."
6/17/2014,20140617,5,4.2,"I ordered Mentai cream udon and my cousin ordered Uni cream udon. When they are put in front of us, I though--oh boy this is rich! We both tried a bit of the other's udon and decided we like the other one's better. So we switched.I had the uni cream udon now, yay! I don't know how they made the uni cream, but it definitely still has the uni flavor. A hint of sweetness and very smooth."
6/19/2014,20140619,3,4.2,"Good hand-made udon. Though portion sizes are rather small, Marugame Monzo offers a LARGE selection of udon. Some are very interesting innovations, such as creamy uni udon and the mentai squid butter udon.Do note that if you get a non-signature udon, then you'll likely want to add toppings and extra ingredients to it. These dishes are really simple and come with just the one topping and the udon. The classics, such as shrimp tempura and curry udon, however, might not need extras."
6/19/2014,20140619,4,4.2,"Not a huge udon fan, but for udon, this place is legit. The broth was fantastic and the noodles are made fresh right in front of you. My wife got the special uni udon, which was basically like a big bowl of saucy pasta. She liked it but was definitely jealous that she couldn't slurp up any sauce at the end. Plan to wait a bit because it's really small and popular, but worth the wait, especially if you like udon. They have one beer on tap and a few others in bottles, and lots of sake options."
6/19/2014,20140619,4,4.2,"love the fresh made udon! so tasty! even pork over rice(I don't know the exact name of that, it's the rice at the bottom and pork on top) is more delicious than I expected!"
6/20/2014,20140620,5,4.2,"The best Udon in LA hands down. They have a dude making the noodles right in front of you! The udon comes in big bowls with a spoon and chopsticks, the broth is perfect and the noodles are amazing. The tempura here is craaaaazy good. Try the tempura shrimp, pumpkin, and chicken. Its a small restaurant and if you come here during lunch time you will have to wait. But its so worth the wait. After you eat here theres a mochi place in the little tokyo plaza that would be a perfect dessert."
6/21/2014,20140621,5,4.2,"For now, I will let my pictures speak for themselves. Miso carbonara, beef udon, beef tataki all highly recommended. The texture of the noodles is one of the major highlights. Seat at the counter? Enjoy the show. Flavorwise very impressed. Qualitywise likewise impressed. Applause. Applause."
6/21/2014,20140621,5,4.2,Uni udon.... What else's I you need to say? Came to eat before seeing Milk Carton Kids @ Jacc. Walked in at 5:45 pm and sat down at the counter 2 minutes later with front row seats for the noodle maker!! Small place with parking at a structure 2 blocks away. Started with the miso clams... Fantastic broth that I had to drink after downing the tender clams. Then came the Uni Udon- OMG!!! The broth looks like it would be heavy and rich like Alfredo but was very light and delicious. Best Udon noodles I've ever had and I usually don't go for Udon(more of a ramen guy)!! Wifey had beef Udon which was outstanding too! Got to go again soon cuz it made me happy slurping those noodles
6/21/2014,20140621,5,4.2,"Monzo is legit! I'm not a fan of udon but this place converted me. I'd have to say it's hands down the BEST udon I 've ever tasted. I ordered the uni and cream and oh my it's soooo amazing! The handmade noodles are chewy and perfect while the fresh uni and cream sauce elevates the dish to a whole new level. I look forward to eating here again the next time I'm in LA. A must try if you want the 'real Japanese' Udon experience, you won't be disappointed."
6/22/2014,20140622,5,4.2,"Holy cow, this is some seriously decadent udon.Located nearby the ever-popular Daikokuya, the entrance has little to no signage. However, I think it's worth it to skip the wait at Daikokuya and try out the crazy delicious dishes here. Sea Urchin Cream Uni- RIDICULOUSLY creamy and savory. The udon noodles are a perfect amount of chewy, and soak up plenty of the delicious cream sauce. And this cream sauce is no joke. It's heavy, hearty, and super rich, with plenty of uni chunks floating throughout. I wanted to drink that sauce, it was so good. (but also probably the fattiest, calorie-laden sauce in the world, so it was for the best that I didn't)Mentai Squid Butter- generously drowned in roe, this doesn't look like it would be as hearty as the former dish, but don't be fooled. The SO thought it had TOO much roe, and not enough squid. However, the flavor was on point. When the dishes come out, they look fairly small. However, given how heavy the dishes are, I was pleasantly full by the end. If you're a big eater, you might need more. Eating here is like eating at Boiling Crab- you have no regrets about eating it, but if you do it too regularly, your body might hate you. Come here for the occasional decadent treat, but maybe try out the less calorie-laden offerings when doing this on the regular."
6/23/2014,20140623,5,4.2,Hand cut udon goodness. The place has an assortment of Japanese and Italian sauces to choose from to mix into your udon experience.  You'll have an option to add more udon to prolong your sauce experience. Even if you're watching your carbohydrate intake you'll voluntarily make this meal an exception and add a second serving.Be prepared to eat early as a line forms outside fast. You'll get a table faster if you're in pairs vs. a party +4.The seating inside is tight.
6/24/2014,20140624,5,4.2,This place is the bomb.comThe hot soup udons and the specialty udons are both on point.The wait was a bit long but that doesn't matter in the end.Not even that pricey too #worth
6/25/2014,20140625,5,4.21,"I really like Marugame Monzo but can't seem to pronounce the name correctly. I'm torn between rating this place a 4 or a 5, but I'll give it 5 stars because I had a great experience. After hearing so many great things about the Mentai Squid Butter noodles, I HAD to try it. I ordered them with a side of the soft-boiled egg. My party wanted to split the beef tataki as an appetizer, but it was sold out! We ended up ordering something else instead...I don't really remember it, but I don't think it was bad...Anyways, my noodles were AMAZEBALLS. I looooved it. It was so rich and creamy...not too salty but plenty of flavor. Not to mention I love the texture of that broth because of the Squid Butter?? I don't know, whatever the broth is mixed in looks like fish eggs to me...but regardless, I wouldn't hesitate to come back for more.Another good thing about this place is the glass window surrounding the kitchen. If you sit at the bar, you get to watch as the chef makes noodles from scratch while you're waiting for your food. It's pretty darn cool if you ask me.All this talk about noodles and udon is making me want to eat here again tonight!!"
6/26/2014,20140626,3,4.2,"Thought it was OK. I didn't have a chance to try the regular udon as I opted for the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and my date had the Uni Cream Udon. The flavor was EH... Wasn't blown away but wasn't disappointed either. The Uni Cream is very creamy so be very aware of this! I will need to try some other dishes next time when I get back but for now, you get an a OK from me."
6/28/2014,20140628,4,4.2,"Street parking. Waited 15mins early saturday evening for 2. I was overwhelmed by the choices of cold and hot udon. handmade udon was good, but the duck was ok. My friend agreed. Expected duck slices but they were like chunks of chicken, but still flavorful. I wish there were more variety of toppings ins their udon including veggies. Good service."
6/29/2014,20140629,5,4.2,Love love love their Uni udon. If you guys are UNI pasta lovers than this is a must try place! The sauce in the uni udon is very creamy so beware. They're udon is freshly made everyday and you can actually see them making the udon noodles! The portions here are pretty fulfilling. The service here is fast and the waiter & waitresses are very nice. I would definitely come here again! (:
6/29/2014,20140629,4,4.2,"Really chewy/delicious udon noodles! I got the chicken salad udon which tasted nice and light/fresh. My friend got the curry udon which was on the salty side, but still yummy!"
6/30/2014,20140630,5,4.21,Amazing handmade udon soup! The noodles are so soft and taste of perfection. I had the duck udon soup and the soup base was delicious. I also tried the seafood and vegetable udon soup and that was a sweeter taste. I prefer the duck. Must go back and try their beef!
7/2/2014,20140702,5,4.21,"Absolutely delicious! We ordered the Uni Carbonara udon pasta, shrimp tempura udon, pork belly rice bowl, and tuna rice bowl. Split between 3 people, we were absolutely stuffed! This was my first time trying a Japanese fusion dish--the Uni gave the pasta an extra kick and I loved how creamy the sauce was. I'm glad we shared the dish because it can be heavy so I wouldn't recommend getting this dish all to yourself. The shrimp udon was excellent as well, and the pork belly rice bowl was better than the tuna one in my opinion. I highly recommend checking this place out next time you are in little Tokyo for an extremely satisfying meal!"
7/3/2014,20140703,5,4.21,"This place serves the best handmade udon I've ever had. My boyfriend and I always go to ramen shops when we visit Little Tokyo and this time we decided on something we don't normally order..udon. We got to Marugame Monzo right at noon on a Friday and we're luckily seated right when we signed in due to a party leaving. We were seated right next to the window where you can watch the chef preparing the noodles from scratch. I ordered the Chicken Tempura Udon and my boyfriend had the Miso Carbonara.The udon tasted incredible! It's chewy, tender and the broth was flavourful too. The entree does not come with toppings (eggs, corn, etc.) so you will need to specify what you want when you order. It was served with two chicken tempura on the side for you preference of wanting with/without the broth. The Miso Carbonara consisted of a heavy-creamy sauce with strips of bacon on the top. I liked it, but you're not into the Asian-cheese sauce..you might want to try something else. Monzo gives generous portions; I barely finished my entree. Definitely give ramen a break for once and give udons a chance!! For our next visit at Monzo, I'd love to try the Mentai Squid Butter noodles everyone is raving about."
7/3/2014,20140703,5,4.21,Excellent food and variety. Both the traditional udon and the fusion type of udon are delicious. The portions are also generous and the service is pretty good even if they are packed and busy. I would highly recommend this place. Probably the best udon in Little Tokyo.
7/5/2014,20140705,3,4.21,"Don't believe the hype. It's okay, but over priced. Ordered Udon with Soft Boil Egg, and it came with a hard boiled egg. We showed the waitress and she said ""That's wrong."" and brought us new eggs... which were also hard boiled... Not an awful place though, just not worth the wait or price."
7/7/2014,20140707,4,4.21,Yay finally got to try this place out. Came right when it opened for lunch service and the place quickly filled up within about 20 minutes.I got the cold udon with radish. The flavors were okay but I did enjoy the udon a lot. I sat at the bar so I could see how they made the udon and it was pretty cool. The udon was fresh and I liked how it had a bite to it. Really really really good udon. I also got the negitoro rice bowl. I forgot to day no mayo but after mixing everything with the rice... It was delicious. Good portion sizes.. Friendly staff.. Next time I'll try a hot udon or one of the specialty ones.
7/7/2014,20140707,5,4.21,"The udon here is as life-changing as everyone says it is.What I wanted to know when I was yelping: what to get?! I had the beef udon because I knew I wanted something lighter than the creamy sauces and something hot and soupy. It didn't disappoint. The beef is the kind you find on gyu-don (nice and thin), and the flavor worked its way nicely into the broth. The portion looked medium-ish on sight, but turned out to be massive in practice...Would definitely order that again, but next time I'd like to try the bukkake (udon).And just like everyone else on this page, I recommend the jidori egg. It is truly sublime."
7/7/2014,20140707,5,4.21,"The texture of the udon noodles. The creamy golden liquid of umami. The intimate ambiance as you watch the guy make udon noodles right in front of you. The restaurant is small but once you step in, you feel like you've stepped into a secret place with wonderful possibilities of deliciousness ready for you to taste! Alright, daydream is over: let's get to the review. Yes the place is really small; large groups might be an issue. Wait can be ridiculously long; my party of 3 waited an hour and a half before getting seated and we signed the party name in about 6 pm on a Saturday night during AX weekend. But man, the wait was worth it! I got the uni udon, my friend the carbonara and the other friend, the beef udon. Oh man that creamy sauce was delicious! And paired with a tempura soft boiled egg and eggplant.... I have been dreaming about that dish for nights now. I read the reviews beforehand, being worried about the ""small"" portions but their sauce can get pretty heavy. I have no complaints about the portion size; in fact I think it was perfect! [And I was starving for like 5 hours beforehand walking around AX]Really friendly staff, great ambiance and wonderful handmade udon.  Ahh, my heart has been stolen..."
7/7/2014,20140707,5,4.21,"Marugame Monzo is by far my favorite place to go to for some real delicious udon.First, this place isn't that big. If you've been to Daikokuya next door, it's about the same size. But the wait doesn't get too bad as opposed to Daikokuya. Of course, it's a completely different menu, but both are equally delicious.If you're lucky, grab a seat at the bar. It's amazing to watch the chefs roll out the flour and cut them into strands of udon so meticulously. It's like a show with your dinner! The servers here are a delight and are attentive to refilling your water and asking if you'd like anything else.Their speciality udon include uni udon, miso carbonara udon, and a few other fusion udons. I found the speciality udons, to be too creamy for my taste. Frankly, I preferred the hot udon. Simple and authentic yet flavorful. The shrimp tempura udon and the pork belly udon were great. Light miso broth soaking into the freshly sliced noodles. The noodles are cooked to an amazing texture.I'd also recommend just eating a bunch of appetizers and sharing an udon. A single order of udon did become slightly overwhelming after a while. The fried chicken and the pork belly as an appetizer are heavenly.Overall prices here are decently priced. I think for the amount of food and the quality of the food you get is well justified. Parking as usual in Little Tokyo is a hassle, but there is a lot across from the small shopping center that charges a $4 flat rate."
7/8/2014,20140708,4,4.21,"This place is definitely a MUST! I love udon, and this place is a charming little udon restaurant with various styles! I have tried the beef udon (classic), the uni (creamy) udon, the cold udon with ume, and the tomato udon.  My first visit, I needed to try the classic beef udon since I wanted to compare it to other classic udon soups. I was actually very disappointed with the broth, however the noodles you can definitely tell are fresh and delicious. I thought it lacked that 'homemade' taste.  My next visit, I tried the uni (creamy) udon--I forgot what it was called, but boy was that delish! I was a little underwhelmed with the amount of noodles they give you, so I always ask for double noodles (for only an additional $2) ---SO totally worth it! Especially since you know they are made there, since you can see them making it right in front of you!  The dish that I tried there (and will probably still keep on getting) is the cold udon with ume. So delicious and tasty--the sauce that you put on the cold noodles is very tasteful, and is not too salty, or too bland. Getting double noodles makes it even more delicious!I also tried the tomato udon, and I was HIGHLY disappointed by this dish. I feel like most of their other dishes are like 'specialty dishes', and this one is definitely out of place. It seems to be missing something... I can't quite place it, but I think if they modified the recipe, it could be an amazing dish. So, needles to say, I will be sticking with the cold udon!"
7/8/2014,20140708,4,4.21,"Great place for udon! They make the noodles right there in front of you! I got to sit directly in front of the udon master so that was pretty fun to watch while eating my delicious bowl of udon.The texture is chewy and perfect, actually tastes handmade. They have traditional Japanese udon and more fusion-style cream-based noodles. I couldn't decide cause they both look so good! I ended up getting the seafood tomato cream udon, which was super creamy (some people might think too heavy), but I really liked it. My friend got the traditional udon, which I tried and was yummy as well. We both added a side rice bowl (tempura and negitoro bowl). The tempura was so-so, the negitoro was good!We didn't have to wait long for seats during lunch, but the place seems to get crowded. I def want to go back to try some of their other udon dishes!"
7/9/2014,20140709,4,4.21,"if you love uni, this is the place. portion is big. the only thing i didn't like was the long wait."
7/10/2014,20140710,5,4.21,I absolutely love this place!They make their udon noodles fresh daily. You can watch the guy make them through the windows. I have tried their sea urchin cream udon and their squid mentaiko udon. They were both good but I personally liked the sea urchin one better. My friend had the udon gratin which was super yummy. I want to try every item on the menu! Their tempura side dishes are yummy too.
7/10/2014,20140710,5,4.21,"Udon lovers paradise, in the middle of Little Tokyo. This place is known for making their udon noodles on site. Make sure you get there early because this place gets packed."
7/12/2014,20140712,4,4.21,This place has the best udon noodle ever. Plus the presentation is amazing. The flavor is a bit strong but I ordered the mentai squid butter flavor. But I'm a huge fan of salty foods. My gf got the UNi udon which was amazing as well. They are always busy so try to come early in the evening. Good eats!
7/13/2014,20140713,4,4.21,"ALWAYS on the safe side, I encouraged my grumpy cat to get here before it opened. Lots of free street parking around 10:40 am. :) We were standing outside behind 2 groups of patron. I was literally playing with my phone for a few minutes and as I turned my head to the back, the lines WERE LOOOOOOOG. I felt so lucky to be the early birds~~~~ early birds get the worms!! Cheerful ladies greeted us offering either tables or bar. Grumpy cat thought table would be nice, I decided to sit at the bar. So fun to be in the middle of the actions. When I said ""actions"", the noise level was robust and I like it like THAT!! Later when I took an afternoon nap, the noise was still inside my head. LOLBesides watching the udon craftsman dusting the noodle, cutting and pulling it lightly; I learned that they use the hot broth to heat up the bowls before placing the cooked udon. Every plates, bowls that came out from the kitchen, I scanned them all with my jumping eyes. Come early! P.S. I know it is impolite not to slur up the udon bowl at the spot, but grumpy cat HAD TO GO. I packed up the rest of my uni udon and guess what? The next morning I reheated it in the microwave and Voila`------------------- I served it with SkyFlakes!! I could die with no regrets."
7/17/2014,20140717,4,4.21,"If you want to have delicious udon, this is the place to go. Don't be intimidated by the line, come a little earlier or later than normal peak times and you should be good.Marugame Monzo has some funky udon soups/flavors, but the one thing that I appreciate are the fresh made udon noodles by the cool guy behind the glass. I've sat at the bar and watched him make the noodles, so fun!Back to the food, I've ordered the Mentai Squid Butter, Sea Urchin (Uni) Cream Udon, Chicken Udon, Beef Tataki, Deep Fried Egg, and Crispy Chicken Skin.Okay, seriously. If there's any appetizer to get, it's the chicken skin. The ponzo sauce that is served with the chicken skin is just perfection. The breading on the chicken skin had so much flavor in it, I was very impressed by this dish.For a more basic approach on udon, I'd go for the Chicken. It was yummy and the soup had all the right udon tastes in it.However, if you wanna try something different, my choice is the Mentai Squid Butter. The Sea Urchin is good, but not close to the happiness I got from eating the Mentai Squid Butter. There are little bits of masago swimming in the creamy soup. The texture of the noodles is absolutely amazing and the squid is the proper consistency--not too chewy/hard and not too soft.I will definitely be back for the Mentai Squid Butter Udon & the Crispy Chicken Skin!"
7/17/2014,20140717,5,4.21,"I've been wanting to check out this place for a while and was so happy that I finally did. It's right next to Daikokuya, so it's a great alternative. We got there early, so we were seated right away; however, when we left, it was packed and there were a few people waiting outside. The mentaike bowl (fish roe) was a nice start to the meal - salty and the rice was perfect. The tempura egg was cooked perfectly - runny on the inside! We also got the fried chicken skin to share, and it was awesome! I could've probably eaten the whole bowl by myself. It was fun to see them making the noodles right there. The udon portions were huge! You could probably share a bowl and share a side/app or something. The curry udon was awesome - the curry was nice and thick and was smokey. The vongole udon was in a nice light, flavorful broth. The uni udon was tasty and they didn't skimp out on the uni, but it was way too rich. I couldn't finish it. Verdict - I would definitely go again! Nom nom."
7/18/2014,20140718,4,4.21,"I had the opportunity to finally check this place out last weekend. I've been to a similar place in Oahu but never had fresh udon on the mainland before. As expected, it was quite interesting to watch the noodles being made right in front of you while sitting at the bar area. For those wondering, if you have had good udon before, the freshly made ones tasted pretty similar actually so IMHO don't be expecting anything mind-blowing. That said, they tasted pretty good and what they do nicely is offer a selection of classic preparations of the udon as well as more unique versions along with a selection of tempura options and side dishes. The prices were reasonable and quite enjoyed it so will be back."
7/19/2014,20140719,5,4.21,"I always wanted to try this place so I decided to go today with my girlfriend to give it a try. And the verdict is that it blew my freaking mind! We ordered the Uni Udon and Shrimp Tempura Udon and it was freaking amazeballs!!Not too Uni-ish flavor so it doesn't over power the entire meal and the shrimp tempura was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Soup was great and tasteful. Definitely coming back to try the other fine items on the menu!Word of advice: it might look like a lot of people are outside, but they're just the overflow of lines from Daikokuya next door."
7/21/2014,20140721,5,4.21,"Don't even have to say much because you will find out soon enough. This place is bomb bomb bomb. Went hungover on a weekend and while there was a wait, it wasn't too crazy. Ordered the miso carbonara and it was crazy good. My girl ordered a plain soupy one which I told her not to, but hey stubborn is as stubborn does. Mines was off the hook. Hers was .... Aight. But kinda plain but you could already tell that from the description. The udon noodles were of course made fresh. Perfect amount of chew. Just bomb. I don't even have to tell you. Enjoy."
7/22/2014,20140722,5,4.22,"Marugame Monzo never disappoints! I've been craving creamt udon ever since I had it for the first time, but everytime I go, there was always a long line. My friends and I stopped by on a Wednesday night and THERE WERE NO LINES!! You don't even know how excited I was when I drove by to see tables available... I was literally jumping up and down.... haha well that may be a little exaggerated, but I was so happy to be able to satisfy my long awaited cravings! I ordered the creamy udon with mushrooms (don't remember the specific name of it). It was so good. The seasoninf is perfect. The udon is chewy. There weren't stingy with the mushrooms. Also, if I recall correctly, I think the portions got bigger from the first time I had it.... YAY!!! Big thumbs up for Monzo!!"
7/22/2014,20140722,5,4.22,"Not a huge udon fan, but for udon, this place is legit. The broth was fantastic and the noodles are made fresh right in front of you. My girlfriend and I shared: Uni creamy pasta - amazing!!! Best dish of the night. We kept slurping the creamy sauceBeef Tataki - Good, but not that great.Sake - Love it, especially when chilledSeaweed udon with tempura egg - Really goodWe came here a on a Friday night and surprising there was no wait, we sat right in front of the chefs. They have one beer on tap and a few others in bottles, and lots of sake options. The waiter was super attentive & great service! Watching the chefs roll out the fresh udon was a fun experience.Love this place, loving the ambiance.... Both the traditional udon and the fusion type of udon are delicious. The portions are also generous and the service is pretty good even if they are packed and busy. I would highly recommend this place. Probably the best udon in Little Tokyo.Next time we are ordering the Mentai Squid Butter!"
7/22/2014,20140722,4,4.22,"I don't even like udon and I bookmarked this place AND will come back for more! Skip the crazy line at Daikokuya next door and wait here!! The Japanese chef behind the glass bar makes the udon fresh right before your eyes. If your lucky you can get bar setting. Most of their seating is two tops so if you have a larger party you might have to wait a little longer.. but its worth it! We ordered the uni pasta, super rich and creamy topped with a small spoon full of ikura for the added salty flavor. Small bites of uni scattered throughout the dish with the soft chew of the udon, perfect. Mentai squid butter udon was also great, lots of mentai they do not skimp thats for sure. I was so focused on my uni pasta I only took a bite of it but seeing we had no left overs I think my brother was very satisfied with his choice. Since my mom is more traditional, she went with the kakuni udon.Huge chunks of fatty pork in a nicely flavored broth, it was rich but light at the same time. With a side of soft boiled egg tempura, AWESOME!We also go the fried kawa... eat it quick before the ponzu sauce makes the skin soggy. It was a good side gave the whole meal a different texture. The inside was very cool and modern, wouldn't expect that standing outside. Staff was friendly and quick. Quick because there is usually a wait and they would like to turn the table but not in a rude way. Be considerate of the people waiting to, eat enjoy and let them have their turn!"
7/24/2014,20140724,5,4.22,"In general, I'm a ""Ramen is better than Udon"" type of guy, but the handmade udon noodles are revolutionary: the perfect thickness, chewiness, and salted just right. The noodle dishes are divided into traditional and contemporary udon bowls. Traditional includes standard broths, curry udon, as well as a large selection of cold noodles.The newer dishes have a distinct italian influence with a heavy emphasis on uni, umami flavors, and cream. The mentaiko-squid-butter udon is definitely the star; it has a buttery but clear, light broth infused with a sweet seafood tang. The uni cream udon lived up to its name: an almost too-rich cream sauce, orange with uni puree, with even sizeable uni chunks to eat with your udon. Seating is limited, getting there early is key, otherwise expect a wait. No reservations, has the tried and true ""show up, sign up, and wait"" policy."
7/24/2014,20140724,4,4.22,"I am a big noodle person, but I am definitely picky about my noodles. I need them chewy and not hard, soft but not mushy... and this place gets it just right every single time. I've been here several times already, twice in the winter and once this past month. I ordered the hot soupy udons during the colder months, the squid and the uni ones were both good. They came with thicker creamier broth, but hit the spot when it was cold out. Last month I came here for lunch and ordered the cold udon, it was perfectly chewy and the dipping sauce was flavorful. I also didn't feel heavy and sleepy in the afternoon. I used to think cold noodle is only good when it is soba noodle, but this udon place changed my mind. I see myself coming back many more times!"
7/24/2014,20140724,5,4.22,"Udon is definitely my favorite type of simple carbohydrate. And fresh in-house made udon... you can't really get better than that! I've been here a few too many times considered I've just moved to LA, but I've come with different friends and my parents and everyone's loved it. I've tried almost a different dish every time I've been. I think my favorite is definitely between the uni cream udon (not as heavy as you'd think it be), the squid butter, or the cold dipping udon (great on a hot day!). I also think this place is 50x better than Daikokuya next door!"
7/25/2014,20140725,4,4.22,"Yes, this place is hyped up but, it really does live up to it! You just have to know what to order. I hated the Sea Urchin Cream Udon the first time I had it here. I don't know if it was just my dish or I was just off that day. Good thing I wanted to give Marugame Monzo another try. I loved it the second time around!I came here a few days ago again with a friend.What We Ordered:- Mentai Squid Butter Udon- Miso Carbonara Udon- Curry UdonThe Mentai Squid Butter was meh....I would never order it again. It just wasn't flavorful. The Miso Carbonara was good but not amazing. It definitely did not taste good the next day either. It was super oily. I do not recommend taking any of these dishes home. My friend loved her Curry Udon! I tried it and liked it as well! My favorite will still be the Sea Urchin Cream Udon though. I will be back!Parking sucks! You have to find street parking or pay at parking lots or structures."
7/25/2014,20140725,5,4.22,I am a sucker for handmade noodles!Parking in Little Tokyo sucks. Service was really good.Came for lunch at noon and it was not busy at all.You know the noodles are fresh and handmade because you see the guy making it right in front of you! The noodles had great bite and chew.Mentai Squid Butter - $12.95 - The squid was so fresh and cooked perfectly. You get a ton of squid pieces. The broth was not buttery at all. The tiny mentai are mixed in the broth and give it a nice sea flavor. Added the chili powder to give it a little heat.Uni Cream - $15.95 - Uni everywhere! You get a ton of uni chunks. The broth is so rich and creamy. You taste uni with every bite of noodle and broth. The chili powder gives it a nice kick. Tampura Soft Boiled Egg - $1.50 - HOLY YOLKGASM! I think this might have been the best egg I have every eaten. First bite you get an explosion of yolk in your mouth! And the fried egg white part just tops it all off. SOO DAMN GOOD!!!Ten Don - $4.00 - 2 huge shrimp tampuras over soy sticky rice. Great deal.Negitoro Don - $4.00 - A scoop of minced fatty tuna with mayo and sweet soy sauce over sticky rice. Need I say more.Marugame Monzo gives any ramen place a run for there money!!
7/25/2014,20140725,4,4.22,"Came here on a Wednesday evening with my cousin and we were lucky to score a table right away with no wait! Of course, being the uni lover I am, I tried the uni udon. Udon is not one of my favorite noodles, but I do have to say that this was the first udon dish that I really liked. The fresh and hand-made udon was cooked perfectly. The sauce didn't really scream ""uni"" but it was good nonetheless with little pieces of uni scattered throughout. I tried my cousin's mentai squid butter udon and I think I would have liked that dish more. It had the most tender squid i've ever tasted, and I do prefer the sauce to the creamy uni one. Overall, Marugame Monzo made me rethink my feelings about udon, and whenever I eat it again it will probably be here.P.S. Order the soft boiled egg tempura as a side to go with your udon. Just do it!"
7/25/2014,20140725,4,4.22,"I'm actually not a fan of udon, but the reviews were good so I decided to check out the place. I got to the restaurant around 7:30 on a Thursday night and we were seated right away. The bar was full, but we made it right before the dinner rush which was great since I was starving. I went with the Mentai Squid Butter and a soft-boiled egg. I thought the broth was going to be creamy like the uni udon, but it was just broth with roe floating everywhere. This was perfect for me because I didn't want anything too creamy.The noodles are amazing. I love the texture and the chewiness in the noodles and the squid pieces was cooked so well... It had just enough bite, but soft enough which paired perfectly with the noodles. One bowl of udon was more than enough! I ordered the soft-boiled egg as well, but it was nothing special. It tasted as if it was soaking in water prior to being deep fried in tempura batter."
7/26/2014,20140726,3,4.22,"Not sure I taste the difference between the freshly made udon from the already packaged ones but to me this place is just a regular udon place with an open kitchen.Ordered the uni udon and the curry udon, neither were extra impressive. The uni udon had a very creamy texture and tasted kind of cheesy. Also had a very think texture combined with the udon noodles seemed more like pasta.Curry udon on the other hand had a lot of msg. Did not think that the combination was good. Perhaps I am not a big fan of curry or udon. Excellent service--waitresses were very attentive and the food came out fairly quickly. Also, thought the meal was very affordable even for the uni udon, and thought that the ambiance was nice and modern. Would be back again if I suddenly have an udon craving."
7/27/2014,20140727,4,4.22,The best udon around town! I came here on a Saturday around noon and it took about 15 minutes to be seated for 2 people. Staffs were very attentive and food arrived fast. We got the gratin and squid udon. Both tasted so fresh and delicious. The soft boiled egg was a plus. My boyfriend also had the uni udon before and he said it was amazing. I definitely recommend this place.
7/27/2014,20140727,3,4.21,Uni udon tastes really good but the restaurant is so small & packed which made me felt like I was back in Asia. .. Unfortunately ppl here are much bigger than in Japan!!! Plus it's time for the restaurant to fix up the AC. It was Hot inside indeed!!!
7/29/2014,20140729,4,4.21,Noodles were delicious. You can see the chef rolling out the noodles in the back. I have tried a few of the different udons. My favorite is the sea urchin cream udon and must-have beef bowl. Homer Simpson drool!!
7/30/2014,20140730,5,4.21,Udon is usually not something that I crave like Ramen or any other noodle soup. It's hard for me to really order udon at a restaurant since I have not had much luck and some time it can lack flavor. I was somewhat excited but also skeptical about a place specializing in udon. Anyway Marugame Monzo changed everything and now I find myself wanting to come back and have udon cravings.Marugame Monzo is in Little Tokyo and parking can be a challenge. Udon is handmade right in the restaurant and therefore the best seat is at the bar to watch fresh udon being made from flour to the cutting.Mentai Squid Butter was amazing. Definitely one of the dishes that has a bit of Italian influence like some of their other dishes that use cream and Uni. Squid pieces with a light creamy broth and lots little fish eggs/roe. Traditional broth with shrimp tempura was just amazing. Flavorful and just awesome. One thing I would say is a minus is the tempura egg. I was super excited about the tempura egg but since the egg white is smooth so the outside fall right off and then you just have boiled egg and tempura flour. The egg was not seasoned and oily. This would be the only negative thing so far from Marugame Monzo
7/31/2014,20140731,5,4.22,"Oh my, I think I had an orgasm in my mouth. This place is the bomb. The Sea Urchin Cream Udon is very tasty and it's not that heavy considering it's a creamy udon. Shrimp and Soft Boiled Egg Tempura are cooked in perfection, lightly battered and very crispy. Udon is the best I've ever had. Service is very attentive. Definitely, my favorite place in Little Tokyo!"
7/31/2014,20140731,5,4.22,"Best Udon I have ever eat! Except when you ask for an egg, they give you fried egg with no taste! hmmmm. But is good!"
8/1/2014,20140801,4,4.22,"3.5 stars.I had been wanting to come here for the longest time, to try their uni udon and tempura soft-boiled egg, and I finally got the chance to last week. I would say it lived up to my expectations, and maybe just slightly underwhelmed me (I did have high expectations, though).The uni udon was extremely thick and creamy - almost like an alfredo sauce, but not cheesy. It's actually a larger serving than I was expecting, and I ended up taking about half of it home with me (still good the next day!). Lots of pieces of uni in there, and the udon was nice and chewy. It's a little TOO creamy for me, though, which is partly why I took half home. Very indulgent, and I shudder to think how many calories were in that one bowl.The tempura egg definitely underwhelmed me. I'm not sure what I was expecting, because the outside was crispy and the inside was perfectly cooked, so in theory, it should've been great. Maybe it wasn't hot enough? Whatever it is, I wouldn't order this again, nor would I say you have to try it.What brings this otherwise 3-star review up to a 3.5 is the regular udon. My boyfriend had the beef udon, and this was one of the better bowls of udon we had both ever had. The soup was hot and flavorful (without tasting like it was full of MSG), the noodles were well cooked, and there was a good amount of beef. If we were in the area again, and in the mood for udon, I would definitely try another bowl of their traditional udon."
8/1/2014,20140801,4,4.22,I went on a mission to find the best udon in Los Angeles so I figured I'd start at Little Tokyo. Came across Marugame Monzo through Yelp and now it could possibly be one of my most favorite Japanese places.I was seated at the bar which I think is the best seat of the house. I was able to watch them make fresh egg noodles in front of me.Ordered the shrimp and squid tempura udon w/ a side of the pork belly rice bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The service was quick and the portions are huge! Check this place out!
8/2/2014,20140802,3,4.21,While I thoroughly enjoyed my sea urchin udon... I'm oddly leaning towards a mediocre experience here at maragume monzo.This small udon joint in the heart of little Tokyo is obviously a favorite for many. And there's no mistake why.I think the best part of maragume's udon is the unique flavors that have been created to flow with the traditionally simple udon dish.I ordered the sea urchin udon while my gf ordered the carbonara! Both flavors we each enjoy ... Usually not paired with udon. But I liked both flavors. My sea urchin dish wasn't exploding with flavors nor did it have a bunch of sea urchin (though wasn't really expecting much since the price wasn't astronomical). But the flavor was subtle and the texture was super creamy almost like an Alfredo sauce (which I love).My gf's was almost all the way like your traditional Alfredo. Creamy and with the traditional bacon and carbonara flavors... I half expected linguine in the bowl.And while this is unique and was overall satisfying ... I cannot consider it a stand out. And though maybe their udon is made fresh which I commend... I felt like the fresh texture was masked by the creamy sauce. Maybe next time I'll go for a more traditional flavoring. Like I said... It's no question why this place is popular. They have great flavors!! But come in with an open mind and palette of course.
8/2/2014,20140802,4,4.21,"400th review! Yay! :-)Beef tataki- yummy with red capers, but wish it had been sliced more thinly as it was slightly chewyUni cream udon was delicious and the highlight of the meal, creamy without being too overpowering Miso carbonara udon was pretty good too, very rich and creamyTempura soft boiled egg with a runny center was deliciousKawacho sake was smooth and cold, complementing the creaminess of the udonWaited only a couple minutes Service was good but not exceptional"
8/2/2014,20140802,5,4.22,"Super super delicious... my gf is a foodie and her sister suggested to try out fresh hand made udon noodle on a hot summer LA weather. We ordered squid with fish roe, uni creamy sauce and clam udon... all of them were delicious.... if u r a foodie like me, this is the place for u..."
8/4/2014,20140804,5,4.22,"Udon is a special noodle delicacy that most people frown upon because 1) they are huge pieces, and 2) it can leave a big mess when it drops back into the broth. What's more interesting is that most think of udon as simply a Japanese soup dish. Well...what happens when it fused with an influence from Italy?!! That's what I thought when I read about reviews for the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. I went for lunch Monday afternoon, hoping I can get a spot at the bar. Luckily, there was an empty spot...so I was able to watch the udon being made first hand. It was amazing (explained later below)! Knowing that I had a growing interest with the Sea Urchin...I instantly ordered it on the spot with an additional negitoro (chopped fatty tuna) rice bowl. I was a bit worried how this cream sauce would taste like. Would it be like an Alfredo sauce...or some droopy milk broth?! The dishes arrived quickly...and they were a sight to behold. The Sea Urchin Udon had the noodles hidden beneath the orange-colored cream sauce, topped with a mint and salmon roe. My first bite...was like eating a piece of the sea. The lightly saltiness of the cream sauce compliments the freshly made udon that was made in front of me. The udon itself was tender and easy to bit into. Uni (sea urchin) was cleverly intact and delectable, despite being bathed in a warm cream sauce. It was so good that I was surprised that I ate it in less than 10 minutes!!The negitoro rice bowl was small...but it makes it with a big scoop of negitoro, sprinkled with chopped seaweed, tonkatsu (?) sauce, and mayonnaise. Just like the udon, it tasted fresh with memories of the ocean popping into my mind. I got through half when I realized I still have a lot of cream sauce left in the other bowl. I grabbed my rice bowl...and transferred it to the udon bowl. The result: awesomeness!! Mixing the rice and negitoro with the uni sauce made the taste a lot much richer and flavorful. But unlike the udon, I took my time to finish the bowl until all the rice, negitoro, and sauce were consumed.I really had a great time at this restaurant. Even thought the restaurant is small and can only accommodate a certain quantity of people at a time...it's worth the wait! Going to take my fiancee here next week!!Two notes:Last Saturday, I was hungry after a few hours of playing video games...so after reading the reviews for the Sea Urchin Cream Udon...I wanted to give this place a try. It's really convenient because it's just a block away from the Metro Gold Line station on 1st and Alameda!! Unfortunately...at 8 PM...a lot of people were waiting outside for at least 30 minutes just to get in. I realized that that night was not a good time (tip: don't go with a group at night unless you plan on socializing outside for a long while).The udon creation process is something you have to see up close. The chef takes this big piece of dough (no idea of contents) and starts flatting it with a roller. Once flatten, he takes the whole piece and winds it around the roller. He repeats this 3-4 times before it starts thickening up. After flatting it out for the last time, he takes out this wooden contraption (let's call it an udon cutting board) and lays out the udon dough. The dough is layered like a lasagna, with flour coated on each layer. He then takes a sharp tool attach to the udon cutting board that looks like a huge, rectangular butcher knife and starts cutting the dough in small lines. The cutting process is so fast that sometimes I wonder if a finger would be cut off. Once that process is complete, he places the freshly made udon in a pot or something (could not see) which would be later be prepared for various dishes."
8/5/2014,20140805,5,4.22,"Hands down one of the best Udon place I've ever had! The fact that you can see them making your noodles is pretty legit. The wait can be pretty long depending on what time you go.I freaking love their sea urchin udon! It was so creamy and delicious, but it is pretty heavy so you might wanna share that. You seriously can't go wrong with other udon dishes, because everything here is amazing."
8/6/2014,20140806,4,4.22,"Marugame Monzo has been bookmarked on Yelp for such a long time! I'm so happy I finally got to try out the fresh handmade udon noodles! It was a friday night around 6pm, but we got lucky and were seated right away. Our seats were right in front of the window where we could see the man make our fresh noodles.We started with the beef takaki, which was delicious. The beef melted in your mouth and was just awesome. The curry udon hit the spot! The broth was the consistency of curry that you put over rice and not really soup like, but I enjoyed it that way. The portion was huge.Next time I would like the try to uni pasta."
8/6/2014,20140806,4,4.22,"Randomly stumbled into this udon shop and was delighted to find the best udon i've ever had in LA. I just ordered the regular hot shrimp tempura udon (though I was tempted by the the crazy specialty dishes which i will certainly sample next time i'm back there) and it had rich deep flavors in the broth and the noodles were the perfect chewiness and consistency. the shrimp and tempura batter were perfect as well. the restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly, and the price was reasonable. Absolutely nothing to complain about."
8/7/2014,20140807,4,4.22,"Dude. This place is too legit. Worth the wait. (Approx 20 minutes on a Tuesday Night!) Ordered the Sea Urchin Creme Udon. Holy mother eff, that thing was expensive but SO DAMN GOOOOOD. Creamy urchin bits swirling in your rich, flavorful broth. One spoonful and I was in heaven. I kinda wished we got to sit in front of the chef to see him make his masterpieces, which is an option if you're lucky. But I guess you can't be too picky for dinner. Great service, always on top of their game with waters and greeted us with smiles all around(: Minus a star for portion size though):"
8/7/2014,20140807,5,4.22,"Updated review after having the mentai squid butter udon. Last time I had the Uni Cream Udon it was just too much and since then I have gone back twice for the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and I'm like obsessed with this dish. So good. I also had the tempura and it was okay for $7. I think it goes pretty well with the Udon. The noodles are always perfection- chewy, just the right of slipperiness. :) I finished the whole bowl by myself to the bottom! I'm dreaming of the day I eat this again."
8/7/2014,20140807,3,4.22,"Had the creamy uni udon. Reminded me a lot of alfredo sauce mixed with clam sauce but replace the clams with uni. Except they were very stingy with the uni. Hardly any uni pieces (counted only 1 total). The udon was perfectly cooked. For the price, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of uni ($12.95), but c'mon, 1 piece? Only two stars for the meal. 1 star for the prompt service. Parking can be a challenge around Little Tokyo, but what's new?"
8/8/2014,20140808,4,4.22,"Super long wait! We came before closing time and waited about 45 minutes for the patrons to hurry up and finish eating. The quality of the noodles is amazing and worth the wait!We've tried the Mentai Squid Butter, Sea Urchin Cream Udon, Beef Udon and the Curry Udon. The first two are very creamy and savory, as if they were the Japanese version of alfredo sauce. They don't skimp on the roe, which is nice. The beef udon is like pho, which you can get anywhere else, and the curry is way too salty, so I would not get these two again.It's a great experience and the food comes out quickly, but the restaurant is a bit fast paced; you feel the pressure to eat quickly as there are so many people waiting and the staff is busy hustling about! Can't wait for my Mentai Squid Butter and Sea Urchin Cream Udon on my next visit!"
8/10/2014,20140810,5,4.22,"I love the uni cream udon and the miso carbonara udon, both are so rich and creamy! I also love udon gratin, but I would get it without chicken.I don't normally like udon, but I love these cream base sauces!"
8/10/2014,20140810,5,4.22,"SO SO SO SO GOOOOD. If it was closer to Orange County, you can probably find me here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My table started off with the beef tataki. I'm not sure if y'all can trust my judgment since it was my first time trying it, but I did like it a lot. As for the udon, we got both the mentai squid butter and sea urchin cream udon with soft boiled eggs. The udon noodle itself was just perfect. Perfect texture, perfect chewiness, PERFECT IN ALL ASPECTS. The mentai squid butter was on the salty side for me, but my two friends liked it a lot. I REALLY LOVED THE SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON. I still dream about it. As for the soft boiled egg, it is a MUST when you come to Marugame Monzo."
8/11/2014,20140811,4,4.22,"Wow, some of the best udon I've had! They make the noodles fresh here, which is pretty interesting to watch. We ordered the curry udon with tempura shrimp, the udon gratin with a tempura soft boiled egg and the sea urchin (uni) cream udon.The curry was really good, probably one of my favorite, and the tempura shrimp was the perfect complement. The udon gratin is baked with cheese, this is a wonderful option if you love cheese, I sure know I do! The uni udon was really good as well, a lot of my friends don't like the taste of uni, but this udon they still love! Can't wait to go back to try some other things, but it will be hard to not order the things I've already tried because I already know they are all sssssoooooooooooooo good!"
8/11/2014,20140811,4,4.22,"Sea urchin noodles were delicious but very rich. I came for lunch but I would recommend coming for dinner with a cold beer. Cold udon was fantastic. The noodles were super long and I made a mess all over the table and my shirt collar. I'm far from an expert noodle slurper, so if you are, you would probably focus more on the food than the embarrassing mess you are making. Fresh handmade udon is the best. We watched the noodles being hand made right in front of us. So impressive watching him make the perfect udon with such care and simplicity. We ordered the fried tempura egg which didn't impress, but it is was very pretty. Came at noon on a Monday and there wasn't a wait. Yes, I would come back."
8/11/2014,20140811,4,4.22,"So good!! I normally don't like uni. But I tried my friend's uni udon and it was pretty good. I got the udon gratin which was awesomely cheesey (still stringy mid-meal) and a soft boiled egg on the side. I didn't know you could have a tempura soft boiled egg! Also tried the curry udon. Everything was great. You can see them making the udon noodles from scratch, too. The service was a little weird. I don't have any real complaints but our server seemed like he was having trouble understanding us when we asked for udon and sake recommendations, and seemed to just go down the list skipping every other one. He just had a blank face when we told him we were there for a birthday. It's not a big deal for restaurants to not do anything for birthdays, but it was a bit awkward for the blank stare at notification. All this aside, not a deterrence. Bathroom was clean and private, one boy and one girl. It was a bit warm inside, even with the AC on (I think?). Well, it looked like it was on, but I felt a cooler breeze when other people walked by."
8/11/2014,20140811,4,4.22,"Hand made udon!!! I ordered the champon udon, not bad but maybe they put MSG in it. After this feel so thirsty . The uni one is sooo good"
8/11/2014,20140811,1,4.21,They won't seat you till everyone is here! Attitude were so bad. We were 7 people and 6 of us got here already and one was just on the street waiting for the spot and they came to us said you guys can't be seated like this. Coz one was missing then I asked are you telling us to go out?? Then she said next time dun be like this. Their attitude are so bad and rude. Dunno why we ended up here. Coz we have a hungry kid so we stayed here. But no more for their attitude!! I am so surprised for Japanese restaurant to be this kind of attitude!!
8/11/2014,20140811,5,4.21,Finally made it out to this place. I had their chicken tempura udon. I love the simple broth! I highly recommend getting the simple udon that isn't a signature one. They even show the chefs making the udon from scratch. The noodles are so fresh and tasty. This place is definitely worth it!
8/13/2014,20140813,5,4.21,"Best Udon restaurant in Little Tokyo, hands down. Noodles are made fresh every hour (!!!) and how do I know? Because there is a gigantic window that allows diners to see the chef working like crazy preparing the noodles. My friends and I joke that the reason the udon tastes so good is because of the amount of sweat the chef drips when he's rolling the dough. Anyways, there's two kinds of udon; cold udon and the hot udon. A lot of the hot udon dishes are western eastern fusion type of dishes. Their mentain butter udon is so good and the tomato seafood udon is just as good. I have never had their cold udon dishes but I have seen it on other people's tables. It looked appetizing.There is usually long lines for this tiny restaurant. If you have a group of 4 or more, be prepared to wait like 15-20 minutes longer than the average. It's okay, their stuffed Totoro can keep you company. The restaurant can get pretty hot/stuffy as well so don't bring too thick of a jacket with you. The waiters are on top of their game and the udon is delivered withing 10-15 minutes after ordering, which is a saving grace for all us starving customers. Either way, Monzo is great for grabbing a fancy meal with friends or for an interesting first date."
8/13/2014,20140813,4,4.21,"The best thing about this place is that they make the noodles fresh. (That's why they get a star added to my three star review) You could see the master making it! Other than that I thought this place was alright. The service was decent. The soup for the Hot Noodles section was bland also, I could totally taste the chicken broth. Next time I'll try their specialty noodles I guess. I was kind of disappointed."
8/13/2014,20140813,4,4.21,3.5 Stars!I loved the udon! You can really taste the freshness of the udon noodles and it was pretty much my favorite thing about the Carbonara Miso that I ordered. My friends got the Sea Urchin Cream and that was equally fantastic. I think that Monzo is worth the wait and I hope to go back!Apparently it's the crème de la crème: laweekly.com/squidink/20…
8/14/2014,20140814,5,4.22,Whoa... I've been sleeping on this place! I'm usually a Ramen dude and rarely do I ever go for Udon when it comes to Japanese Noodles but this place might have changed that. Marugame Monzo is amazing. Their Udon is hand made in house. Doesn't get fresher than that. The dishes are more on the fusion side taking some Italian inspiration but delicious none the less. They also have your traditional Udon dishes if that's what you crave for.I ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon and was very glad I did. It was delicious!!! I also did a side of Egg Tempura and Shrimp Tempura. The egg tempura has a creamy center and oozes out when you take your first bite. So good. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.
8/14/2014,20140814,5,4.22,"The udon in this place is off the charts, and it's all because the past is freshly made in house. I know it's not your traditional udon with new and creative recipes that mirror more Italian food, than Japanese, however, they have the traditional dishes as well.All of the udon i have here, have been amazing. The carbonara, the traditional, the seaweed, the tempura udon are all good. Their apps are great as well. Tempura is not greasy at all, and my favorite in town. Their rice bowls are simple, but delicious.The wait can sometimes be long, but it's totally worth it! The only downfall is that you and your clothes will smell like the restaurant thereafter. It's inevitable, because the place is tiny and not ventilated that well. You will smell like tempura. However, I wouldn't say that the smell is that strong when you're eating there.This is one of my favorite places to eat in Little Tokyo, if not the favorite!"
8/14/2014,20140814,5,4.22,Best udon I've ever had by far. I ordered the mental squid butter udon. Its definitely unique and I don't think other udon places really offer this. It's Freshly made in front of you and the broth that they use is so creamy and rich and it's filled with roe! Loveee it. Go early though cause the place is small and there may be a wait.
8/16/2014,20140816,3,4.22,"I was especially excited to try this place-- we came after closing once because my friend was so sure they closed at 11 -_- Stupid him. But you know, you always want what you can't have. So I had to come back (the next day) We were dining for a party of 5, but one of our friends dropped us off while he went to find parking. The first waitress seated us right away, but I guess she hadn't noticed we were missing a person. Upon being seated, another waitress, Rie (I specifically wanted to find out her name) came to our table and stated that we could not be seated unless our entire party was present. Does she want us to get up and go stand outside?? We told her that he was parking and we would be able to order to him. She seemed extremely reluctant but said ""Okok fine."" Really?? Is it that big of a deal that we're missing one person? We would still occupy the same table even if he weren't there! Anywayssssss.....We ordered the beef tataki and pork belly as appetizers, which were both ok. One of my friends claims it's one of the best pork belly he's ever tasted, but I beg to differ. The beef tataki tastes exactly how it looks. Me and another friend ordered the sea urchin cream udon, which was disappointing. Both bowls had no uni like everyone else's Yelp photos :( It just tasted like a heavy creamy fettuccine sauce w udon. Mehhh, just like their service."
8/17/2014,20140817,5,4.22,"Delicious udon with contemporary style. We were lucky enough to get seats at the bar in front of the master udon maker on the last day of Nisei Week. I had the miso carbonara, which was the BEST carbonara I have ever had in my life! Maybe I was taken with the ambiance, but the udon noodles were such a treat. I didn't even care about what my poor daughter and husband were doing - all I cared about was slurping up these mouthwatering noodles. My husband ordered the mentaiko squid udon, which caused him to just say, ""Oh my God... Velvety... Rich,"" as he rubbed his well-fed tummy. Even better, the staff was so good to our 5-year-old daughter. They brought out a kid's bowl and kid's utensils, and a plastic cup for her Calpico. We had a 15-minute wait to get into the restaurant, but it was well worth it. Definitely returning!"
8/17/2014,20140817,5,4.22,"The beef takati was amazing! I ordered the uni udon which was so delicious! However, my friend got the curry udon and it was salty."
8/18/2014,20140818,5,4.22,"I love Little Tokyo and this place makes it that much better. You can have udon anywhere but this specialty store really seals the deal for udon in the area. First thing is first, you can't get validation if you park in the village so you gotta pay for your parking if you plan to just spend money here. The second thing is that this place is packed and you will be waiting for about 20 minutes after you put down your name.Great now that's out of the way, let's get to the food. They have several selection for you from traditional clear broth udon to creamy udon and cold udon. I had the curry udon because I feel like curry that day and it was bomb. I suggest you don't add anything to your udon if you have the curry udon except maybe ginger because it is already good on its own. They have the uni creamy udon and tomato cream udon which all looks so good and very rich. I would like to eat the traditional udon next time because sometimes original udon is the best. I haven't had cold udon but I would imagine they would taste like somen. They also have tempura you can get for appetizer which I recommend while you wait and get you going for the main dish, There're some stuff you can add with your udon like soft boiled egg and etc. if you'd like but it might make it harder to finish your food if you're not super hungry.Another tip, on a very hot day dress lightly because it gets hot inside with their one AC powered establishment. The heat is real!"
8/18/2014,20140818,2,4.22,"This place was really MEDIOCRE. Perhaps because LA has never experienced a specialty udon place before. Mentai butter udon....bland, mentai was tasteless, and sauce was more soup than sauce. Uni noodles, literally sucked because had no flavor but plenty of soupy, watery goop. Bukkake, flavorless and smelled really bad, beef bowl, was so bad could not get past two bites. Its only worth it to see that high ratings sometimes only reflect how crowds get sucked in by gimmicks like a guy cutting noodles behind a big glass window, and then lose sight of the fact that the food really is mediocre, and some food really bad."
8/19/2014,20140819,4,4.22,"I usually don't like udon because I'm not a fan of fat noodles but I like the udon here. It is made fresh in the shop, you can even watch the chefs making them! I've been here a few times and I can never stray from the Cream Uni Udon. I personally prefer it over Uni Pasta at places like the ones at EMC (although those are sill fantastic!). I highly recommend this place for all udon and noodle lovers!"
8/19/2014,20140819,4,4.22,"I'm a hugeeeeeee udon fan. In fact, I really only enjoy udon vs. pho, ramen and other soup noodle dishes, so I was really excited to try this spot. I had the pleasure of visiting on Sunday evening around 8ish. Yes, there was a line but it was worth it and not really that bad (20 min or so).Between two of us, we had the beef tataki which was delicious and the perfect amount for two. We decided to share a traditional and signature: the shrimp tempura udon and the uni creme udon. I was quite pleased at our selections; the perfect balance. I'm not even a fan of uni and I loved it.The service was prompt, the food was delish, great vibes. I look forward to dining again to try the rest of the options."
8/21/2014,20140821,4,4.22,"I NEED to go back. Fresh udon that is hand cut can be seen from the huge window in front of the bar seating. We came here unknowingly during the nisei festival at around 5, so the wait wasn't long. Apparently, if you get there any later, you'll end up waiting forever (like an hour). Things we ordered:-pork belly -beef tataki-garlic clams-fried chicken skin -mushroom salad -uni cream udon-squid butter udon-carbonara miso udonThe beef tataki was a bit of a let down. It was good, but since everyone raves about it, it didn't live up to the bold flavors I expected. Instead, it had a milder olive oil flavor. Also didn't like the clams too much... not sure why. Definitely order the CRISPY CHICKEN SKIN. It's like pork rinds but BETTER! I also enjoyed the mushroom salad. It was the only vegetable dish of the night haha. Pork belly was also good-- cooked tender and full of soy flavor. The best is the uni cram udon. I would come back for that but not the other two udon dishes. The squid was tender and a good dish to try, but I wouldn't recommend the carbonara. Maybe it just wasn't suited to my tastes. I would definitely come back for the uni cream and crispy chicken skins!"
8/22/2014,20140822,5,4.22,"MARUGAME MONZO IS AMAZING. We decided to take a break from ramen (and the long line at Daikokuya) and try this place out. The inside is really nice and they have a small bar area where you can watch them make the udon. We were lucky enough to sit there our first visit and it's really so much fun.I've tried the curry and the miso carbonara. They were both really good, but I'd suggest the miso carbonara or another one of their specialties if it's your first time because they're so unique! The servers were pretty friendly, but somewhat inattentive. It does seem to get busy, but I've been here during lunch and dinner on weekends during Little Tokyo festivals and I've never had to wait. Oh and the bathrooms are really nice!"
8/22/2014,20140822,5,4.22,Great Udon house. They make and cut the noodles right in front of you. Very fresh and fast friendly service everything on the menu is excellent. One of my favorites is the Uni noodle. Many times it is very busy so be prepared to wait or if you're lucky you can get a seat quickly at the bar.
8/23/2014,20140823,4,4.22,Decent udon shop with chefs crafting the noodles right in front of you. I enjoy the basic udon- soups that warm you up from the inside. Would def. return and recommended !
8/23/2014,20140823,5,4.22,The beef udon was amazing. The beef melted in my mouth and the noodles were so delicious. I got a side of tempura shrimp and it was a huge shrimp. I don't like sushi very much so this was the perfect place for me in Little Tokyo. I can't wait to come back here next time
8/24/2014,20140824,5,4.22,"We decided to try out this Japanese spot in Little Tokyo. It's seems pretty new. First things first - get there early! Depending on the time, you can either wait 30 minutes to an hour. It's quite small but well worth the wait and the food. We got the beef tataki - must try! The combination in the dish was fantastic! Seared beef with EVOO and covered with diced onions and pepper. Meat was very tender and good! We also ordered the seared pork belly. The soup in the dish was very flavorful and the pork belly was very tender. Lastly, we got the specialty udon - miso carbonara with bacon with jumbo shrimp tempura and soft boiled egg. The udon was by far fantastic! The sauce was creamy with lots of flavor. The best part about this place is that the udon noodles are made right in front of you (if you're sitting at the bar), so you know that the noodles are fresh when you order your meal! I'm definitely coming back here to try the other dishes. I'm sure my friends in San Diego would want to try this place out!Be sure you come here with an appetite!"
8/25/2014,20140825,5,4.22,"Best. Udon. Ever. And the long, hungry line at Daikokuya during Saturday lunchtime did not even know that the best udon shop was only steps away, right next door! When I got arrived in LA, my friends we worried that there would be a long line outside of Marugame Monzo, but we were pleasantly surprised at being immediately seated upon arrival!After poring and drooling over the menu, I decided to order the Mentai Squid Butter udon with the special combo ($4 ikura bowl) per my friends' recommendations. We knew we were going to explode from the portions, but we honestly could not have cared less.The ikura bowl was standard and decent with a good amount of salmon roe. Yum! However, the star of the meal was definitely the udon, which you can see them making by hand at the bar seating area. The udon tasted fresh and had that nice, chewy texture. They gave a decent amount of squid, which was sweet and soft, and basically a whole soup bowl full of squid roe! Everything went together perfectly and made a super satisfying meal. With tax and tip, each person paid around $20, which is reasonable for the extraordinary quality food they serve."
8/25/2014,20140825,4,4.22,"been here three times and all those times the udon was the bomb. i got the ika mental, duck nanban, and chicken salad udon. THEY WERE ALL GREAT !!! don't let the bowl size and price fool you, you will leave feeling satisfied and full. I'm japanese so i eat udon on the regular but man never had udon noodles as good and chewy as this one. with appetizers beef tataki is a must try :)the reason it go 4 starts instead of 5 is the service.... when i went during nissei week my server was a young guy with a eyebrow piercing and he was rude and dismissive."
8/26/2014,20140826,5,4.22,"I thought I have done a review for Monzo long ago, but I wouldn't mind doing another review, since each time I go is better than the previous.They are famous for their signature udons, and I can tell you right now, they are worth the price and wait, and all that DTLA traffic and parking...Some of my favorite ones are:Mentai Cream Udon - Very flavorful and creamy, with seafood and mentai (fish roe).Mentai Squid Butter - Slightly similar to Mentai Cream, but less creamy, and with squid instead of seafood.The Udon with clams (I forgot the name) - The soup is amazing with a taste of wine.Sea Urchin Udon - Must try at least once in your lifetime!!!Plus a soft boiled egg (tempura egg) on the side for only $1.50My ultimate favorite thing to order is actually their Pork Belly rice. They are a bit small but REALLY REALLY delicious. Perfectly salted and favored pork belly, just amazing!! Perfect for a side dish to your udon.Note: They require your whole party to be there in order for you to be seated. Also, make sure you stay around the area because if they call your name 3 times and no one is there, they will cross off your name."
8/27/2014,20140827,5,4.22,"Best Udon place I have EVER been to, and I don't even like udon normally! I feel that the typical udon dish is too plain for my taste buds, but Marugame Monzo features a TON of udon dishes to choose from. Their udon noodles are freshly made, as you can see them making it through the see-through glass window near the back tables. Also, they use a distinct sauce for each udon dish, all of which taste amazing. When the udon bowls came out, they all pretty much looked like pasta, but they weren't! A lot of the sauces are creamy, but they know how to make it just right.We ate pretty late, like 8/9PMish and the wait was pretty long, but definitely worth the experience of eating here. The reviews aren't wrong; you have to try this place out!"
8/27/2014,20140827,4,4.22,"I'm going to bump this spot up to 4 stars because you get to see them making the udon!!!!! haha. I got the beef udon and it was pretty standard, but that's probably because I got the most boring item on their menu (though our server did say that it was a popular dish!!).Anyways-I tried a bit of my friend's sea urchin noodle, which was creamy indeed. I don't eat seafood so I just had a tiny taste.It gets packed here, btw! It was full when we got here 5 minutes after they opened, and when we left a little line was already formed during lunch time!"
8/27/2014,20140827,5,4.22,"LOVE IT!!! a friend brought me here, and I must say I cant wait to go back!!! the food is fresh and delicious. We were there once it opened so didn't experience any sort of wait. The waitress was very friendly. Ahhh I loved it!! =)"
8/28/2014,20140828,5,4.22,"It's hard to find good udon in L.A., and this place does it right. Love the curry udon and pork belly bowl. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu. It's fun sitting at the counter watching the guys make the noodles. Great food and customer service!"
8/29/2014,20140829,5,4.22,"I'll simply repeat what everyone is saying. Best Udon I have ever had!!! Freshly made every day here! Right before your eyes even!! Loved the Curry Udon, just enough curry spice that my GF can eat it. My GF hates Udon BTW, but she ate the hell out of a bowl of Asari Vongole Udon!!! The Toro Rice is a must have, so much good rich flavor!!! I will defiantly come again! If your here with your GF or a good friend, ask to be seated in the back on the bar for a masterful show! And enjoy a Fantastic Meal!Everybody needs to stop going next door like sheep... OMG that place really sucks.. If you must have that brand to be ""Hip/Cool"" go to the Montery Park one PLEASE!!! Get some good Ramen for a change..."
8/29/2014,20140829,4,4.22,"Definitely a must try if you're in downtown LA. The place can get very busy, but it's worth the wait! Try the creamy style udon, you won't regret it (uni and squid)!!"
8/29/2014,20140829,5,4.23,"This place was heaven on earth! A long line greeted us upon arrival but we decided to stick around and wait anyway. My friend came over from New York so how often are we going to have a chance to savor this?The staff was very friendly and accommodating, which made up for the wait and the crowded interior. I ordered mentai squid butter, my mom got the beef udon, and my friend ordered the uni cream pasta. The squid is so tender! Although I was not expecting broth (I thought I would see some semblance to a butter pasta), it was still very good nonetheless. My mom's beef udon had a slightly sweet taste to it. The uni cream pasta was spectacular. Rich, creamy, and full of uni chunks. The only reason I was hesitant to order it was that it would get too heavy towards the end. The noodles had great texture. Even my mom, who usually doesn't like udon and HATES long lines with a passion, was pleased by this meal. And let me tell you, she is not pleased by many things. Thumbs up marugame! I'll definitely be back in the future."
8/31/2014,20140831,4,4.22,"Been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally got the chance.Went 8pm on a Saturday. From the outside the wait looked ridiculously long but it actually goes a lot quicker than you think. We put our name down got some tea from across the street and came back and the table was ready.Ordered the ikura rice bowl and the sea urchin udon. The ikura bowl was pretty standard, But I wish they put more ikura. The sea urchin udon was good but a little too rich for me. Initially I could taste the sea urchin but after a while it slowly faded into a creamy aftertaste that took over every bite. The texture of the noodles stood up to the sauce but the overall creaminess and my want for more sea urchin would put my meal at a 3/5.I'm bumping my overall rating up to a 4 because watching them make the noodles is pretty damn cool. Definitely a fun date option. In retrospect I'd probably get a more traditional udon next time as I tried my friends beef udon which was pretty good."
9/1/2014,20140901,5,4.23,Not a huge udon fan but I somehow stumbled upon here.. And I also glad I did. Their Sea Urchin udon was absolutely amazing and left me so stuffed and ecstatic. This is by far the best udon I've had.
9/1/2014,20140901,5,4.23,"I'm so glad I decided to deal with the parking situation and long line to try this place.I tried a couple of the udon dishes, but my favorite is the miso carbonara. Whoever came up with that concoction is a genius. I thought the miso added a nice subtle something to the taste of the sauce. And I love the chewiness of the noodles.I've also tried the pork belly and negitoro bowls. The pork belly wasn't bad, just rice and some nicely seasoned pork belly. But the negitoro, man, that was the best fish mix I ever had, and it was at an udon place. I don't how to describe it, but there was so much awesomeness to the flavor in the mix, I didn't want to stop eating.If you want to try avoiding a huge crowd, I'd suggest trying them during lunch hours. It stills gets kind of packed, but I think it's a better bet than dinner time."

I consider it a big part of the eating experience.So enough said, what wifey wants wifey gets. So long story short she convinced me to try out Monzo & cancelled our reservation with Osteria (not mentioning the full name). But it's good Italian. Anyways, we left Monzo very impressed. Udon noodles are hand made fresh every day, if not by the hour.¤ Mentai Squid Butter (5*). Squid Butter? What? How? Don't know. Don't care. It's Delicious. The broth is to die for. It has Cod Roe & Squid. I LOVE Roe of all kinds. From shrimp roe to crab roe to fish roe & every other roe in between...Yum. This broth was the perfect balance of flavors. You can taste the cod roe but it wasn't overpowering so other flavors can also stand out. Soo good.¤ Uni Cream (4*). A creamy uni broth. Very good stuff. You can definitely taste the Uni as the top ingredient but not overpowering. Again, a great balance in flavors.One thing we both wished was for protein, as in pork or chicken. Chicken was an option as an add-on but not pork. We ordered basic with a soft boiled egg tempura & baby octopus tempura. Which was ok. Wish they had pork slices, now that would have been nice. Definitely do some add-ons to get a little extra out of your dish. But not knocking points off for my preference."
9/2/2014,20140902,4,4.23,"Yumm ! We originally wanted to go next door since I was craving ramen but the line was ridiculous. So we went to Munzo instead and were pleasantly surprised. We had a 15 minute wait which was amazing because I know this place is super popular. The noodle masters at the bar were entertaining to watch as they were hand pulling and making the udon I was soon to devour. Kinda wish we sat there so we could've watched them closer in action but thats for next time. Pork and Rice Ball - I always feel like the pork and rice portion are always off but I think it was almost perfect. The pork was flavorful and the rice perfectly cooked. Uni Udon - Of course I had to order the most popular dish. This dish is different as in something you've never tried and so good. The uni makes this pasta creamy and decadent. Its really like a special treat. Its a definite must try if you like uni and udon. The fish eggs they add make for a nice pop of saltiness against the creaminess of the dish. Duck Udon - The broth was different, not like the typical pork base. I thought it resembled a soy sauce base but its actually fish and very flavorful. There was a decent richness to the broth. This dish was light and a good contrast the the rich uni."

9/3/2014,20140903,4,4.23,"I'm usually a ramen fiend, but Marugame Monzo has definitely edged udon into the race for my heart. As everyone has already laid claim, the house-made, hand-cut udon noodles are an absolute gem. They are long silken strands of noodle magic and have the perfect springy/chewy texture. The chefs have truly mastered their craft and the noodles shine in each bowl.-The mentai squid butter udon was delectable. The fine pollock and cod roe gave the dish wonderful briny flavor and the chunks of squid were incredibly tender. The noodles were perfect and I finished my bowl with alarming speed.-The Ikura cold udon was very good as well. The noodles were served in a bowl with grated daikon, Ikura (salmon roe), and green onion. When eaten with the accompanying dipping broth, the flavors of the dish reminded me of soba. -For lunch, diners are allowed the option of adding a rice bowl to their order for just $3, so naturally, I got the pork belly bowl. The pork was thinner than what I originally expected but the dish was so delicious. Minimally seasoned with salt, pepper, sesame oil, and green onions, the bowl was simple and fresh. Highly recommend trying! The one disappointment I had was the tempura soft boiled egg. It lacked any flavor and could have done with a heavy touch of seasoning. Too bad, because I'm a huge sucker for a well-executed soft boiled egg. One star docked for the egg and because my friend thinks she may be feeling weird from her meal... Won't stop me from trying Marugame Monzo again to confirm my favorable initial reaction."
9/3/2014,20140903,4,4.23,Not bad. I am not a huge fan of udon but I like that they have different varieties of the dish. Their signature items are all cream based but I only tried the cold ikura udon so I can't comment on the others. Service was efficient despite the long line. Probably won't revisit just because I'd rather eat sushi when I'm in little Tokyo lol.

I'm talking about it's fatter cousin to its right. Simply put, the udon here is spectacular!I ordered my kitsune udon (udon with soybean curd) and they accidentally punched in an order of fried tamago when I wanted fried squid. But it's all good! The udon was piping hot when it came out, and with each bite you took, you could tell the amount of time and energy spent to making it delicious.Matt M. next to me ordered the gratin udon which reminded me of my Saizeriya days back in Japan. While buttery and fat, it wasn't overpowering and was a nice compliment with the udon noodles.My only gripe is how pricey this place is, but for handmade udon in Los Angeles, you're playing for the craftsmanship of the udon chefs. If you can muster that, this will be an udon shop fit for you!Parking is available on the streetside as well as in various lots nearby."
9/4/2014,20140904,4,4.23,"My friends and I waited about 30 minutes to be seated on a Friday night. I got beef udon and my friend got their specialty sea urchin udon.

I will definitely be back!"

Ok so for the beef, it's thinly sliced and very tender but light in flavor. It's good but I wouldn't order it again.The udon was so yummy though. Thickness and chewiness of the noodles were on point! I enjoyed the creamy soup and little bits of uni.I have been and always will be an udon lover so I will def be coming back to try out the other udon bowls.Place is small. Waiters are fast.

9/5/2014,20140905,4,4.23,"Honestly i'm usually not a big udon fan but this place makes a really good udon. The traditional udon here is good, but also their signature uni and mentaiko, and ""new age"" udon has all been delicious. Confession: I my favorite thing here is their negi-toro bowl. Lines can get pretty long though, so I'd avoid this place during the peak hours. I used to see them hand make their noodles, but I haven't seen the guy doing it the last few times i've visited, so not sure if that's still a thing or not."
9/6/2014,20140906,3,4.23,"Is there such a thing as being too flavorful? The answer is yes. I came to this area looking for some ramen but there were twenty people ahead of me so I went to the next best place next door for udon. The waiting list was substantially less but it still took about 20 minutes or more for me to get seated. I've never gone to a restaurant for just udon before so I had no idea what to get. Based on Yelp reviews, I got the carbonara and my friend got the curry udon. Both came in gigantic bowls chock full of meat and noodles. The carbonara was very rich and actually tasted like pasta with bacon chunks in it. It was good... but strange at the same time. I kept on thinking it was too rich and fatty, but I kept eating it! My friend said the curry udon was too strong and couldn't finish it. I had friends try out this joint a day later and they also agreed that their udon was a little too strong. Maybe I'm just not used to the bold flavors. I didn't love this place, but I didn't hate it either. Something about the food here has my curiosity (probably the fact that they have 20 kinds of udon here) and I want to come back and try something else to see if maybe I just picked the wrong udon last time."
9/8/2014,20140908,4,4.23,"""innovation that excites..."" Believe it or not, this cheesy car commercial tagline actually describes an experience at Marugame Monzo. After having a number of traditional light broth udon places both in West LA and Torrance, Marugame really changes the game by introducing innovative udon dishes that are really impressive. Although I wasn't entirely thrilled with the tomato soup udon, the Uni Udon is spectacular. Rich, decadent, and creamy. Amazing. Pair that with the shrimp tempura and the very impressive jidori soft boiled egg and you have yourself a maru-game-changing meal.Best udon I've had in LA so far!"
9/8/2014,20140908,3,4.22,"I know I know.. everyone's been raging how great this place was and here I am giving it a 3 star? Let me do a little explaining first. The udon was BOMB! No wrong turns there buddy. It was fresh and chewy just to the right points. What was so great was that I got to sit in front, where the counter was and got to see them roll the dough and cut them. How fascinating! Anyway, I got the usual that everyone gets, the Uni Cream Udon. Two words: TOO CREAMY! It was way too rich that I couldn't finish it. I ended up taking the rest of it home. It's pretty delicious on the first bite or second or third. But after you've scrambled half the bowl down cause you were so hungry, it didn't taste as good anymore. We also got the the tempura fish with smelt eggs inside with curry salt dipping. It was okay.. not bad, pretty good actually and interesting. Well, that's why we decided to try it.We got lucky, so weird that it was a Sunday afternoon, maybe we had a late lunch around 1-2pm? There was no wait. We got seated right away. No AC in there though on a hot hot day.. umm, can you turn on your AC? :( Anyway, it's a pretty small place so I doubt big parties will fit in there. Most people come in a group of 2-4 people. The location is right on 1st street across from the Japanese Village and right next to Daikakuya. How weird is that?Okay so location wise, it isn't too hard to find. Parking was not the business. Finding street parking could take up to about 15 minutes or more. We decided to not round and round anymore and just parked in the Japanese Village parking lot where you can get it validated at the Village, which we didn't because we didn't eat there. Eh should have gotten dessert or something. Oh well! We just ended up paying about $8.75. Yeah i know, expensive. :( That's LA for you!Lastly... will I got back? Yes, since my friend wanted to next time to try their other udon options, soup based, no more creams thanks!!"
9/11/2014,20140911,5,4.22,"You must try the udon carbonara...I asked the waiter (also, try to sit at the counter where they prepare the udon...it's very cool) if it was 'not ethnic enough' and se pointed to all of the Japanese diners who were eating it. It's like the Italian version on flavor steroids! When you're in DTLA and in need of a noodle house fix, I would TOTALLY recommend Marugame Monzo!"
9/14/2014,20140914,4,4.22,"The creative udon dishes here are so so amazing.  If you want traditional udon, they have those too. All feature their signature homemade udon.My dish was the Mentai Squid Butter which was surprisingly brothy, not creamy. The broth tasted of the sea and butter! My brother ordered the cold udon with Mentai and Shiso with a side of tempura squid, one if those traditional approaches that didn't wow as much my dish. If you really don't want udon, they have rice too like my mom's tuna donburi with fresh tuna and scallions."
9/14/2014,20140914,5,4.23,"I really love this place. I've had the shrimp tempura udon, beef udon, and udon carbonara. All have been exceptionally delicious. The service is always on point and I love when they say ""arigato gozaimasu"" as you leave the restaurant. It makes me feel like I'm back in Japan. For appetizers, I've had the beef tataki and chicken karage both were really good. I'm not sure what was served over the beef tataki, but it had peppercorns on it. My boyfriend said it tasted like the holidays, I didn't really get that though. Whatever it is, it's good and worth trying. The chicken karage was good as well. I love chicken karage, I've had it all over restaurants in little tokyo and although it's not my favorite, it's really good. Make sure you ask for lemon because they don't automatically give it to you and unfortunately you can only order it during dinner. I really enjoy this place, I recommend it to all my friends because the food and service is consistently great!"

9/16/2014,20140916,3,4.22,"So here is the deal...food is good. But the service was HORRIBLE!We brought in desert and made sure there was no sign outside that says no outside food. Waiter asked us to put it away. So we did thinking I might have missed the sign elsewhere. I wasn't happy about it so before I left I went looking everywhere and I confronted the waiter that there is no sign stating no outside food, but we dined in for our main course. He apologized with a awkward face. He was our server too and wasn't attentive. Food was good, uni udon is great. On the pricy side but good for it's quality. I'm just bitter that the waiter was so rude!"
9/21/2014,20140921,5,4.23,"We came her for dinner on a Friday night. The wait wasn't bad so we got seated after few minutes. Let start with appetizer, we got beef tataki. Didn't know it was a cold dish. beef flavor was bland with mild olive oil and peppercorn. Sea urchin cream udon was delicious. Udon was chewy and perfectly textured. Cream sauce was very creamy and flavorful. I got to try some of my bf's duck nanban udon. It was good. I wish I could sit at the counter. It would be fun to see how udon is made XD. Service was good."

Creamy and rich with uni flavor. Be warned - it's HEAVY!! I only had half the noodles and saved the other half for dinner! YUMMY!!"
9/22/2014,20140922,5,4.23,Omgg the food here is sooo good ^_^ The Sansai Udon (9.xx$) Double (for 2$) was perfect for 2 people and we both really liked it! I was so in love & busy eating that I didn't even realise there was a dude making noodles in the window until half an hour into dinner lolI can't wait to come back here :3 It's da besttt place in Little TokyoWe were able to get in & out before some people even got a table next door at Daikokuya haha lame
9/24/2014,20140924,5,4.23,The udon and noodles were delicious. I have had better at a few places (only) but I have had udon at a ton of restaurants. Very enjoyable!
9/25/2014,20140925,5,4.23,"This place has become one of my recent favorites! (Udon even know!)They make their udon noodles in-house where you can see the chefs making them through a glass window. Some people are able to get front row seats (bar seating technically) while they eat and watch them make these perfectly chewy udon noodles.+Negitoro BowlI always order this along with one of my udon dishes. It's nice because you can eat this while you wait for your udon to come out! Yum.+Miso Carbonara UdonThis was one of the first udon dishes I tried here and it was delicious. I never imagined udon to be served like a pasta dish, luckily these guys did. As good as it was, I couldn't finish the dish cause I felt myself getting fuller and fuller with each bite. The cream makes it heavy dish.+Duck Nanban UdonNice broth and cooked duck. They were very generous with the duck servings as well.+Seafood Tomato Cream UdonMy current favorite! It comes with some onions, baby scallops (I really enjoyed these in this dish), & shrimps. This one wasn't as heavy as the miso carbonara and I was able to finish it. After all the noodles are gone, you can enjoy it as a bisque.You get what you pay for, it's ideal. Service is nice and welcoming.Parking is okay, it would be nice if they had their own private lot but then again we're talking about Downtown, Little Tokyo.I'll be back for more!"
9/25/2014,20140925,4,4.23,"Tried this place for the first time with my mom & sister about two weeks ago. We ordered the uni udon & the duck udon. The uni was exactly what I expected. Very creamy just the way I like it. My mom loved it too, so I'm very happy about that. The duck was a little plain. Wanted to order the curry udon to go for my little brother but they don't do to-gos for udons or any of the sides. Boo"
9/26/2014,20140926,5,4.23,"Parking seems a bit difficult to find in this area. We ended up paying ~$5 to park and walk over. That isn't too bad if you carpool with friends. Also, when they tell you it'll be a 20 minute wait. Come back after 10. We came back after 15 and our names were crossed off already and so were a few other people's after us. I seem to be on an udon/ramen binge lately. They get an extra star for having these specialty udon dishes that aren't so traditional. Wanted to try deter from the standard type of udon broth and ordered the Seafood tomato cream udon. My plus one ordered the Uni udon, which was a bit too thick for me. Surprisingly, my dish was just right for me. It is creamy for sure, but I think the tomato diffused some of the creaminess. I also like the baby scallops and shrimp that it came with. Overall experience was quite nice. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes."
9/26/2014,20140926,5,4.23,"A small restaurant with no more than 10 tables plus some bar sitting area. Once you walk in the restaurant, you can see the chef making fresh udon. It's pretty amazing. Food and price: Uni cream udon ($15.95) - white cream sauce with 2 pieces of Uni. The cream sauce tastes like uni. It has a strong seafood smell and taste. I can't eat a lot of it because it's way too tasty. You know what I mean, right? It's definitely worth trying if you like uni. Kake udon ($6.95) - udon and fish broth. We want to try the fresh udon so we kept it simple. The udon is super delicious! It's the best udon I've tried. It's fresh so what else can I say :) . Spicy tuna bowl ($5.45) - rice and tuna! It's so freaking good! It's one of the best! Service: excellent! Parking: meter parking or parking lot"
9/26/2014,20140926,3,4.23,"Finally got to try it since there's sooooo much hype about it. My bf and I took a little tokyo date, so he opted to go here when I suggested it (even though hes not a fan of udon). I got the sea urchin and he got the squid butter. Super glad I didn't get the squid butter because it wasn't as good as the sea urchin. The squid butter was like eating udon with salt water.. The sea urchin was alot better but it wasn't great. The creamy sauce is nice, but after a while I got so tired of it. And there was like 4 pieces of ant sized sea urchin pieces.. So I didn't feel that great about getting a creamy udon for like $17. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.There's not much to say because it wasn't a hit or miss for me. It was just nice. Although, I do understand that the udon itself is awesome. The staff is super friendly and attentive, coolio."
9/28/2014,20140928,2,4.23,"The Picture is SO DECEIVING. To paraphrase the 'Wendy's, ""where's Uni?"" on sea urchin udon. No Bueno! Too creamy and Uni is hard to find in the thick creamy sauce. Don't be fooled by the deceiving pictures. It's about 15,000 cal!Beef udon in the other hand was really good. But I wouldn't wait 45 min. for it."
9/29/2014,20140929,4,4.23,"I love all kinds of asian noodle soup. Udon is my least favorite because of the thickness of the noodle BUT if I'm going to eat it, it will be here. I had the squid butter and my friend had the uni cream. The flavors of both broths were very delicious and complex. My squid was cooked perfectly and not rubbery at all. I also got shrimp tempura on the side which was perfectly cooked and huge. We also had the pork belly which could have been more tender but the broth was amazing."
9/29/2014,20140929,5,4.23,"My favorite udon place in LA. I don't know if it's because I'm being influenced by the fact that I can SEE them making their own noodles in-house, but it really does taste fresh. They have traditional Japanese-style udon where the goodness of the broth and the noodles harmonize well. The value is very good too if you're especially hungry and you order extra noodle portion- for only a couple bucks more, you get seemingly twice the udon. If you're feeling adventurous, try the fusion udon flavors which are also pretty good."
9/30/2014,20140930,4,4.23,Tried:- Scallop Carpaccio (3.5/5)- Garlic Miso Clams (tasted good but little sandy) (3.5/5 if no sand... 1.5/5 with)- Sea Urchin Cream Udon (SUPER rich soup base. Worth a try if you have never had creamy Udon) (4/5)- Mentai Squid Butter Udon (4/5)- Service (5/5)
9/30/2014,20140930,5,4.23,"Delicious food, attentive waiters, bar seating with view of fresh udon being made. Got the uni pasta with some tempura and mentai rice bowl. Everything was good. The wait wasn't too bad-20 mins for a party of 3 on a Sunday afternoon."

10/2/2014,20141002,4,4.23,"Marugame Monzo....thank you for making some super delicious udon dishes! It was so good that I finished all the contents of the soup, and when I only had broth left and the waiter assumed I was all done...I asked for a to go box. LOL! It was just such good broth, I couldn't even imagine throwing it away. The fun part about the udon is that you can add quite the variety of side dishes. I went with the shitake mushroom tempura, and the soft boiled egg tempura. Yes, that's right...tempura egg! It was delicious, but I made the mistake of not putting salt on it, which would have taken it to the next level. Oh well, guess I'll have to go back and perfect the meal another time. ;)"
10/2/2014,20141002,4,4.23,"First time here folks. Started off with the beef tataki, average but prolly wouldn't order again, going to try the scallop dish next time. Shrimp tempura was good and worth it, would try some of their other tempura items, batter was good. We had both the squid and the sea urchin udon. The squid udon was wayyy toooo salty. Sea urchin was nice and creamy like an Alfredo sauce, if u like rich creamy then go for it. This place is a B for me, it's been hyped up and all our friends would say to go check it out and we finally made it out here. Would I go again, sure, but I won't be craving it."
10/2/2014,20141002,5,4.23,"I would love to give 4.5 stars if I could for not taking reservations. The wait is ridiculous long and painful. It would've been a perfect 5 if we didn't have to wait for over an hour out on the street. (If I may vent, these two girls left one of their friends inside and took a long smoking break AFTER THEY WERE DONE EATING!!! The only thing they did after they went back into the restaurant was to pay and leave. Why on earthy couldn't they pay and take the smoke break, I don't know. I'd say that their parents obviously did not teach them manners. Thanks to those rude people our wait was 20 minutes longer than it would've been.)The service was very friendly and swift. We were almost shocked at how fast we got our food. Probably less than 10 minutes for 1 appetizer and two pasta dishes. Uni udon, which I was dying to try was all so yummy. So much better than Angelini's sea urchin pasta, which was, I think, double the price Marugame Monzo charged for its uni udon. Miso carbonara had perfectly cooked bacon and the cream sauce was just perfect, but we wished we had ordered a different type of noodle dish since uni udon had creamy sauce as well. Not very well thought out there. Beef tataki was a great way to start our meal. So tender. So flavorful."

10/4/2014,20141004,4,4.23,"I can officially say that I am hooked on udon! Been to this spot three times in a two week span! My absolute favorite is the creamy urchin udon with the miso carbonara a close second. The uni with the fish eggs complements the creamy sauce perfectly. The miso has that smokey pork flavor. The tempura, especially the soft boiled egg is amazing! How did they do it?! Crispy on the outside and gooey goodness in the inside! I always order the assorted tempura and add that heavenly egg and it never disappoints. I also tried the squid with butter sauce and egg roe. The first bites were good but the flavor got a little overwhelming halfway. Added some chili powder to change the flavor a bit. The udon with mussels has a broth full of flavor. The beef tataki was not too impressive. The meat was sliced to think for my taste. The service is always great here. The wait is not bad either. I'm surprised why they do not have a longer wait, but hey I am not complaining! I enjoy watching the udon noodles being made. It's amazing.Parking can be street (if you're lucky) or parking structure found in the area. Either way, it is always good to walk off the carbs you will be inhaling in this place."

The udon was so delicious! I had the Miso Carbonara and it was perfect! The udon noodles are chewy, and the sauce is so creamy, it just melts into your mouth! We also ordered the Braised Beef as the appetizer. That was just okay- wished the beef was more tender, but still great nonetheless. We also had some drinks (beer and sake) and it complimented the meal. I would come by this place again and again!"

In the summer time, I usually get the cold oroshi udon and a bowl of rice with the pork belly for about $12. The thirteen year old in me is still waiting for someone to order the bukkake udon, but I digress... The only things that kept me from giving the restaurant five stars are the tight seating and the occasional hipsters who wander in. Tight seating and the resulting audible conversations between hipsters wandering over from Daikokuya are just enough to knock one star off. At least the hipster thing is dying..."

I didn't know this because I am not from LA - I accidentally came here because I was waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant and didn't want to wait. Second, this is hand cut noodle. Very nice to know that it is not mass manufactured from some factory in china.And the taste - it's super rich but that's what you expect from any creamy pasta. Uni pastas are one of my favorites and this place did not disappoint."

10/7/2014,20141007,1,4.22,"I am so upset at my dining experience yesterday. I tried to sleep on it but I'm still so angry. Here's what happened: We get to the restaurant with four people and we were waiting for one more of our friends as she was parking. The waiter then told us that he cannot sit us until our whole party has arrived. Which is understandable, I guess... So we waited outside and he gave away our table because our friend got here like five minutes later. At this point I was already mildly upset. But I can't do anything about it so we put our name down again and waited. About thirty minutes later, and I had to walk in and ask WTF it was taking so long and then he said he had a table ready for us. At this point I'm so angry that I had no appetite. He walks us towards a table that can visibly only sit four people. So I was like wait a minute.. We have five people. He's like oh I know you can squeeze three people on the booth portion of the table and sit two at the chairs. OMG WTFFF! There was another table that can sit 6 people that was opened! I know they are trying to maximize seating but we are paying customers too! WTF do we have to suffer if we wrote our names down first!! And don't try to tell me it was a five seater when the table next to us had the same size but with four. I don't see any other party of five squeezing in this little four seater table. We are grown adults, not children. But because it was my friends birthday, I tried to be a little less vocal. So we sat and squeezed at this little table. The people on the booth ( which I was one of them) sat sideways for the entire meal. After the meal I was still so upset.. So I had To speak to the manager. I explained to her the whole situation.. That the initial waiter didn't even issue an apology. So I told her I wanted him to apologize to us. He walked over to us so nonchalantly and said oh I'm so sorry.. My English was is not well and I couldn't explain to you why I had to sit you here. HEY MAN YOUR ENGLISH WASNT AN ISSUE IN THE BEGINNING AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN ITS NOT GOOD? Whatever I just said alright. And then the whole time after his apology he was speaking Japanese the entire time... Whatever... I'm so over it. But I have to say that the food was very good. I would have given more stars if the service was decent."

10/8/2014,20141008,5,4.22,"Great udon like most people raved about here. I was clueless so I asked for a popular item in the cold udon menu. The cold udon with the soft boiled egg was so good. The udon itself is so fresh and yummy. It was a great combo with the assorted tempura as an appetizer. The assorted tempura can be customized so you can choose which ones you want. But, we went with what they gave and was very satisfied. I love the mushroom tempura :) There was no wait for us, a party of two, since we came before the dinner rush which was around 6:00 PM. The dinner rush started around 7:00 PM."

10/12/2014,20141012,4,4.22,"Definitely want to come back. Went to Little Tokyo to meet my friend and his wife to have some ramen at Daikokuya, but as expected the line was too long. So my friend's wife said the udon place next door was good, so we got seated in about 20 minutes. As far as clean dining experience goes, this place is the good antithesis of its next door brethren Daikokuya. I'm sorry to say, but I don't care how good you think Daikokuya is, it's a f'g dump and in need of a good scrubbing. It's not endearing, historical, etc. It's a dump and the bathroom is worse. But I digress. Monzo is very well designed and clean and feels like the owner put some time, money and effort into making a nice atmosphere. I like that you can see them making the fresh udon noodles---always like restaurants that make the effort to show you what they make. Surprisingly the food came out pretty quickly. We all ordered different things. I got the duck udon because I was feeling mildly adventurous. I also ordered the tempura egg and a side of the raw fish ball with rice. The broth of my duck udon was very clean tasting but a little lacking in flavor. The udon noodles were great. Nice and thick and had great texture. The pieces of duck were very good too and not overcooked. The fish ball with rice looked promising, but the combination of cold raw fish with the hot rice was a little strange to me. The sauce on it was pretty good though. I believe its the same sauce as what they'd put on takoyaki with the Japanese mayo. I think if they put the bonito flakes on it, it would taste better. I don't think I'll order the fish ball thing again. The soft boiled tempura egg was a nice side, I highly recommend it. I put a splash of soy sauce on it to make it taste better and it did.I took a trip to the bathroom and it's very clean and well done. Tile floor and wall. The sink is one of those modern looking, contemporary type. One thing I noticed was the restaurant wasn't as cool as it could've been. Everyone around us and including us were sweating. I realize we're all eating a hot bowl of soup, but if all the patrons around us are sweating, the a/c needs to be turned down a little bit more. Parking in the area is a pain and/or expensive. One of the reasons why I don't visit Little Tokyo as often as I'd like. I'll be coming back though :)"
10/12/2014,20141012,4,4.22,"I have been wanting to come here for awhile now and I finally got the chance today. Since it's the weekend, I figured there would be lots of people so I decided to come out 15 minutes before they opened and sure enough, there were already people waiting outside. My friend and I were lucky and we were able to sit in the bar watching the chef handmade all the udon.Since many people suggested the uni udon ($15.95), that was exactly what I ordered. For the udon, texture wise I couldn't honesty taste too much of a difference compare to those that are bought frozen at the Asian store so pardon my taste buds. But for the uni sauce, it is so creamy and flavorful!! I don't really like uni by itself but it is made like this, it's so delicious so definitely recommend this one.By the time we left, there were so many people waiting so I do suggest come in early if you don't want to wait. If you have time, stop by the Japanese American Museum which is just a block away. They have a new exhibit going on right now with the Hello Kitty so if you are a fan of it, go check it out!"
10/12/2014,20141012,5,4.22,"First time trying Sea Urchin Creamy Udon, and I have to say it was freaking delicious!!! Creamy udon blends nicely with sea urchin flavor. Initially came here for regular udon, but I am glad I got to try this. Friend of mine got Vongole Udon, but she said that was bit on salty side. She doesn't really like salty stuff, so this may be different story depending on your preference. They make udon noodles right front of you, so you know it's freshly made. All staff were super friendly which is always nice. Expect long line, but if you love udon, it's probably worth the wait."
10/13/2014,20141013,5,4.22,"I've never been so indecisive on what to order like I was at Marugame on Saturday when we stopped by for lunch. Everything on the menu sounded so good that I wanted to try as much as possible!We actually tried to dine next door at Daikokuya, but the wait for a table was going to be a long one, so we opted to eat here instead since there were only two groups ahead of us and we were starving.I'm glad we ended up here because I've been on an udon fix lately and was pretty excited when my hubby told me that is pretty much what they serve here, woo hoo!I finally decided on the beef udon, he ordered the pork belly udon and we and shared the negitoro (tuna belly) bowl, an order of the tempura and a pork belly bowl. It was a lot of food, but we wanted to sample so much and limited it down to these items since that was all that would fit on our table, lol.The negitoro bowl came out first and it was about the same portion size of a small miso soup bowl serving. Just enough to sample, but oh boy, this was really, really good! If they served this up in a larger bowl and if I weren't in the mood for udon, I'd eat this as my meal since it was pretty spectacular. The flavors in this small bowl packed so much goodness for our taste buds. Order it if you plan on trying this place out! The tempura is your typical tempura, came out with an assortment of veggies and one shrimp. I wish the shrimp had a little more flavor, I was dipping it like crazy in the sauce that accompanied it to compensate for the lack of flavor. The veggies were good, we finished most of it.The small pork bowl was good, its presentation wasn't as inviting as the negitoro bowl, but it was good. Imagine uncooked bacon strips, but rather than cooked to a crisp and served nice and reddish-brown, it was boiled or steamed and looked very white over a small bed of rice. It was still pretty good, but it didn't look as appetizing as the tuna belly.The final service was our udon. My beef udon looked really good, pretty cool that the noodles were super fresh since you have full view of the guy making it in the kitchen. If I weren't so hungry, I probably would have remembered to take his pic of his udon making process. My udon bowl was pretty fantastic, but I hit my limit two thirds into this bowl and couldn't finish it. Overall, it's a great place with tight seating and expect a wait if you go during peak times. We lucked out having to wait no more than five minutes for a Saturday at 12:30, but know we may not be so fortunate the next time we go back. I'm just excited to be returning back to this part of town in a few weeks when I attend Hello Kitty Con and hope I can get more udon here with my Mom!"
10/13/2014,20141013,5,4.22,"We LOVE this udon place! My favorite is the mentai squid butter! But I also love the uni cream udon! Any type of udon is good at this place as it's all freshly made! And it's all delicious!You can see the chefs making the fresh udon and sit in front of the window, which is fun! The beef tataki is also good and a great appetizer! All in all, we love this place! It's so good!"
10/14/2014,20141014,5,4.23,"I probably should've ordered a more spectacular dish than regular udon since I probably won't have the chance to come back for a long time, but let me tell you... Even if you get the basic kake udon, it leaves such a good impression on your tastebuds. We came when there was a wait (about 30 minutes). Not the most fun considering I was tired from the day, it was late, and I still had to drive a couple hours home after. I was getting hangry, but the waitresses were fast to clean up a table and set it when patrons left so they could seat the people waiting. Maybe because this is a small place they can do that, but it was nice to see swift and considerate service.The BF was recommending the uni cream udon or the mentai squid butter but I wasn't feeling something so fancy. The simple kake udon was DELICIOUS. The broth was flavorful and clean (and just what I needed since I was tired). I felt like the broth also highlighted the quality of the udon noodles. Those damn noodles were perfect. The handmade udon noodles' texture is miles apart from the texture of store bought/boiled udon noodles (clearly). I haven't had this good of udon since visiting Japan years ago.I would like to think since they got the basic udon sooo right, their fusion dishes should be great to try too (especially since the majority of reviewers are raving about them)."
10/15/2014,20141015,5,4.23,"Heard a lot of good stuff about Marugame Monzo, so I had to give it a try and it was fantastic. We had to wait 45 mins for the table, and it was worth the wait. Once seated we aready knew what we wanted.The Uni Cream Udon was what we came here for and surely it did not disappoint. I got mine with tempura soft boiled egg which was absolutely fabulous. The soft boiled egg was cook perfectly. It was nice and runny. The Uni cream was very rich and creamy and very flavorful. So delicious!! You really can't go wrong with this dish if you love freshly made udon noodles and Uni, and they were very generous on the uni. Highly recommend this dish.Their Beef Tataki was excellent. The beef was cook perfectly rare. One of the best yet.The Fried chicken skin. Really can't go wrong with that. Great flavor the skin was nice light and cripsy.Their service was fast and friendly. The food can out within 10 minutes once ordered. I'm absolutely a huge fan of Marugame and will return to try other different udon bowls."
10/16/2014,20141016,4,4.23,"Fresh, hand made udon. That's why you need to try this place at least once. 4.5FOOD QUALITY:Fresh, handmade noodles never fails to bring a pleasant texture to the mouth: a sort of springiness that has a pleasant, tough chew but tears like butter. The noodles keep their elasticity better too as they don't turn into mush.Kakkuni Udon shines with a sweet, porky flavor with each sip, and that sweetness is amplified by the sweetness of the udon, so you won't taste any of that dense, savory, fatty pork flavors until you take a bite of the three pork belly cubes you get. So if you don't get a bite of that pork belly along with your udon, you'll just be experience a slightly off-balanced sweet broth and udon.You'll get some of that seafood essence taste from the Mentai Squid Butter Udon; it's a light broth that delivers a heavy salty, moderate buttery, and subtle sweet squid flavor in a single bite. With a bite of the udon, you're getting a pretty balanced dish if you're looking for something that's light in density but heavy on salty/savory flavors.The sea urchin udon is surprisingly good. I was told that it'd just be too much to eat one bowl by yourself, but I think this can do well as a standalone if you need something of moderate substance. The sea urchin flavors aren't so much of a highlight, but it's there somewhere providing a sweet balance, alongside the udon, to the creamy, savory, and buttery flavors that invade your palate when you take a bite. It's a somewhat dense broth, not light like water but thinner than sauce. It's amazingly balanced in flavors such that all the ingredients put in this thing are just melted into a ball of goodness. Though, if you're craving for something light in density then I'd pair this with a beef udon or melted squid mentai udon, because those broths will bring refreshing clarity to your palate. SERVICE:It's quick and efficient, but not exactly personable as they want to get you out of there as soon as possible. The nice thing about that is that they accomplish in rushing you out without making you feel like you're being rushed out. ENVIRONMENT:Clean, sleek, dark wood textures, ample lighting with cramped spacing. Definitely good for dinner with friends, or a quick-dinner-date with a follow-up dessert place. Might as well make use of paying $4.00 for parking across the street. Overall, I think I'd come back here have my own bowl of udon. Not that I don't mind sharing, I just want more."
10/16/2014,20141016,4,4.23,"Best noodles in town.The fatty tuna rice bowl is amazing and the noodles themselves are fantastic; a window at the end of the main eating area provides a look into how the noodles are made. There's also a bar right in front of the window so you can watch while you're eating. There's usually a line after 12:30, so as with most of the smaller restaurants in the area getting here right as they open is generally a good bet.I personally love the curry udon, but the duck udon is pretty good and the Tempura udon is tasty!"
10/20/2014,20141020,3,4.22,Uni udon was good but they got skimpy with the uni. The price was the same for little to no uni. See photo that I uploaded. Would prefer uni pasta at EMC Seafood & Raw Bar. I would have given it a 5 star if there were more uni.
10/22/2014,20141022,5,4.23,"So far I've tried the shrimp tempura udon, as well as the uni cream udon. Both are totally different spectrums to the taste palates.. Both both equally good.. The side pork bowl is a definite must have as far as some side action... Can't wait to try all the other udons here. My friend got the clam one and that was delicious as well.. 5 stars for quality.. Cleanliness.. And great staff."
10/22/2014,20141022,4,4.23,"It was a long wait for a table for six on a Saturday night. After we sat and had the udon, it became obvious for the wait. Their chewy, torn udon made right in front of your eyes is the star of all the dish. Remember to order a side of the tempura egg with your dish.Their is a selection of creamy udon, soupy udon, cold udon, hot udon, yummy udon. If you are not feeling like udon for the night, there are salad selections and rice dishes. I had the pork belly over rice as an addition to my creamy udon. Yes - I love to eat. Do not let the pictures fool you.Aside from good food, the staff is attentive, restaurant is homely, and restrooms are clean."
10/24/2014,20141024,5,4.23,"This is an amazing udon place. The best part about it is that they make the udon noodles fresh, right in front of you!. They have a variety of different udon dishes, including as well as some unique dishes, such as uni udon! I went for the curry udon, which was flavorful and yummy! Love how the noodles are chewy and fresh. The uni udon is something everyone talks about on yelp, but it looked a little too creamy for me and wasn't in the mood, but I'll definitely have to come back and try it!The wait varies, but can be long especially on a busy night. Well worth it though.  The service was great, friendly. Parking is on the street if you can find any or in the paid lots/structures."
10/24/2014,20141024,5,4.23,"Food: Our group ordered a wide variety from the simplest udon (Kane) to the sea urchin, all of which were satisfying and tasted great. We had many items that reviewers here recommended: braised pork belly, the mentai squid butter and sea urchin, and the tempura boiled egg. We really enjoyed the latter three, they are certainly worth a try. If you do not live in the downtown area, it is quite a trip to get to this restaurant what with traffic and difficulty in finding parking. If you are coming as a group of 4+ you will be in the queue for a long while. For my group, we went on a Saturday night (early evening) and waited close to an hour by the time we were seated. Those with just a party of 2 were able to be served a lot quicker and could bypass the queue. The restaurant is very small and unless you are seated on the bar or at the table facing the kitchen, it is hard to see the chef make noodles. Personally, I didn't think it was that worthwhile, as I have seen more ""theatrical"" if not impressive displays of this kind of technique outside the U.S. Service: servers were friendly and came with our food in a timely manner.Ambience: casual"
10/24/2014,20141024,4,4.23,"Very good, noodle are cooked perfectly, had Ikura Cold Udon and a tempura soft egg... Very delicious, flavors are subtle and delicate so don't expect big strong flavors... I'm guessing the Uni Udon and Udon Carbonara looked like richer dishes. All in all great atmosphere, will be back for beef udon and clam udon... Saw both those on the way out on multiple tables, might be the things to get!"
10/26/2014,20141026,5,4.23,"Yummy hearty udon that hits the spot on a cool night. What else can you ask for?They make their udon fresh by hand here, and because of this, the noodles are chewy in a bouncy way (does that make sense?) and super satisfying. It's different from eating ramen in that ramen is all about the broth, and here, it's all about the noodles. I had the Vongole udon this time, which had a slightly saltier broth than the typical, and will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu."
10/28/2014,20141028,4,4.23,"Word on the street is lot of uni-lovers come here so they can engorge themselves to the point they cry little uni tears. Yeah, the uni cream sauce is amazing, especially at first bite, but the handmade udon noodle was the unexpected highlight of the meal. Something about that perfect balance of soft but chewy kept me coming back for more. The daikon and roe cold udon was simply refreshing. The broth is extra salty, but what makes it special alongside regular soy sauce udon is the shredded daikon. Unlike the uni udon, the daikon and roe cold udon is something I see myself ordering again."
10/28/2014,20141028,5,4.23,"So. Freaking. Good. As an out-of-towner, this was my last meal before heading back home--but DEFINITELY not least. We went in as soon as they opened at 5 p.m., so there were only a couple of tables, but it definitely was getting more packed around the time we left.Appetizers:-Braised pork belly: holy moly so good. just get it.-Beef tataki: honestly, not my favorite. not bad by any means, but compared to that pork belly, it was just whatever.Udon (there were options for additional toppings for udon, but nobody in my party added any):-Vongole udon: This one was mine. I love seafood (and vongole pasta), and I didn't want anything too heavy before getting on the plane, so this was perfect. The broth was light and refreshing, the noodles were nice and chewy, and there were a good number of clams in my bowl. It was basically everything I wanted.-Beef udon: This was one of the more traditional Japanese-style udons. It was good, but not my favorite--maybe a little too sweet for my taste? The beef was good, though (kind of like yoshinoya beef).-Miso carbonara udon: Creamy, yummy. Carbonara with a Japanese twist.-Uni (Sea Urchin) cream udon: Now I'm not the biggest fan of uni, but man, this was good. If I have a chance to go back, I would definitely get this one.All of the above with a nice glass of Asahi made for a killer meal. Not to mention, we sat at the bar and got to watch the udon noodles being made. The menu also had cold udon and salad udon dishes--wish marugame monzo was in DC, so I could try everything!"
10/29/2014,20141029,4,4.23,"Marugame Monzu has been on my list to try since forever. When I was finally able to try it, I was impressed. We were seated quickly at the bar, which was a perfect view of the man in the window making more handmade udon noodles. I ordered the popular dish, the uni cream udon, and my friend had the curry udon. We added, each to our udons, deep fried tempura egg. The uni cream udon was very rich and flavorful. Super creamy, salty, but the thick noodles made all that sauciness slurpable, definitely balanced the saltiness away. As for my first time trying anything uni, I thought it was a good first experience. The tiny amount of roe were great little bursts of flavor in a single bite of noodle. Take a bite out of the tempura egg and eat some noodles. You get an awesome combo. That egg is so cool, tempura batter but the egg yolk is oooozing out... Yes folks we got some yolk porn here. The curry udon noodles were great as well. It isn't a soup base but a curry sauce. Drenched udon noodles in a thick curry sauce topped with beef slices. Souper (literally) saucy. Very tasty. Probably the best udon noodles I've had. Soft and chewy. Does not taste like the prepackaged udon noodles. Overall, great place for dinner. Next time I will try an udon with soup. -Give it a try!!!!"
10/30/2014,20141030,4,4.23,"Closed between 2:30P.M - 5:00P.MNo takeoutI heard the reason for no take out is because they want you to experience the freshness of their udon. It's freshly made everyday and if you sit by the bar, you'll get to see how it's done too. Dined here for lunch and it wasn't crazily packed that day. They're right by another famous ramen place so you can't miss it. I'm still not a big fan of udon, except for the one in Hawaii. I guess this can be similar to it but not quite there yet. There are several choices on the list. Hot udon. Cold udon which has no soup of course and with just buncha sides. And creamy udon which fall under their signature dishes. Some people even order an extra rice bowl with their meal. I can't even finish my bowl of udon by itself. If only stores do mini size for people who don't eat much like me! Cause seriously that bowl is huge! I went with Shrimp Tempura Udon ($12) that day and it was pretty good. The udon itself was soft and fresh. The soup was nothing spectacular. It was kinda salty? My friend's creamy broth udon looked so much better than the regular udon! Maybe I'll try that next time. I heard their soft tempura egg is really good as well."
11/2/2014,20141102,5,4.23,"Best Udon in LA to date. Great friendly service, reasonably priced. The wait can be long depending on the time of day, you will def wait on the weekends. I am a fan of the Kitsune Udon, the tofu has a specific sweet flavour. Hey! They have clean restrooms ;)."
11/3/2014,20141103,5,4.23,"Sometimes, a restaurant treats its dishes like works of art. Marugame Monzo is one of those places. Consider their ""no take out"" rule. Dishes like uni cream udon are available only straight from the kitchen and within their premises. No take home containers here! This place is well worth the visit."
11/4/2014,20141104,5,4.23,"I came here during the Hello Kitty Con and unfortunately had to wait about an hour for a table...but...it was worth the wait! Those thick, homemade delicious udon noodles were wonderful! Perfect texture and perfectly cooked. I had the Chicken tempura udon and left very satisfied. The chicken wasn't the highlist obviously but the udon was really good. Prices were reasonable also and the portions were huge. I'd return again!"
11/5/2014,20141105,5,4.23,Not really sure where else in LA you can get signature udon dishes. The sea urchin udon is the best. Mentai squid butter is more on the light side but the squid is very tender. I could've done without the beef tataki appetizer. But the sea urchin udon is a must!The bowl is huge but the portions are unfortunately small. Womp womp for such tasty noodles! I definitely wanted more...or am I just a fatty?Service was excellent. I use to live in Japan. It's so nice to here the workers use Japanese. Also there was no wait at 5:30 on a weekday.
11/5/2014,20141105,4,4.23,"My two girlfriends and I had dinner on a Sunday- Food was great, it's a small place so expect a long wait. I will definitely go back again! We waited outside the restaurant for our table. The area at night could be a little sketchy only because of the homeless. When you sign your name for a table don't walk too far away, they will cross you out if you don't answer by the third time.  Restaurant is clean and staff is pleasant."
11/8/2014,20141108,5,4.23,"You would have to travel to Japan and search specifically for sanuki udon shops to get noodles as good as these. I love their springy chew and the un-Japanese portion sizes (an extra $2 gets you double the noodles). The offerings are mostly traditional with a twist, much like the set-up of the restaurant, where the noodles are beaten to deliciousness by an old Japanese man, yet served by young waiters who all look like they could star in a J-Drama.I think udon tastes best served hot and in a dashi-based broth, but the uni cream pasta is something special. The sauce is rich and buttery, with a distinct hint of sweet sea urchin. There are chunks of uni here and there but I found myself enjoying their texture more than the taste, since all of the flavor is actually in the sauce. Sake-marinated ikura is also served with the dish, sitting atop the noodles on a fresh shiso leaf like pearls in a clam shell. Both the briny roe and the minty shiso pair perfectly with the uni cream and lend the entire dish a wondrously complex fragrance.The sides are great too. We tried the tempura soft boiled egg, which surprisingly was very light. It was practically flavorless, so I recommend dunking your egg in the broth/sauce of whatever your udon entree is. The other tempura options are also quite tasty and I've heard good things about the $3 rice bowl add-ons you can get. Basically, you're guaranteed to leave Monzo full.It's hard to believe that the line for Monzo is shorter than Daikokuya next door. If you avoid the typical lunch hour, I'd say the wait time is reasonable (service is quick and efficient). There's a lot to eat and love in Little Tokyo, but hands down Marugame Monzo is my favorite noodle shop in the area."
11/8/2014,20141108,5,4.23,"I came for uni and I conquered! Don't be scurred of the line as you pull up, it moves quickly. My scallop carpaccio arrived a minute after placing my order. Delicious!Uni udon followed and was creamy and very filling. Udon is made right in front of your eyes.Complementary hot tea was flowing and I left very satisfied."
11/8/2014,20141108,5,4.23,Best place for udon. All the food is great  Had the curry. And the tomato cream seafood. The beef appetizer is fantastic
11/9/2014,20141109,5,4.24,"The restaurant is small, they don't accept reservations, and the wait is long, but once you get in... my oh my... deliciousness.It took our party of four over 45 minutes to get seated. Once inside, the service was friendly, and the atmosphere was a lil loud and the seating felt a bit tight.We started off with a few appetizers:1. beef tataki: sliced, seared, rare beef goodness.2. crispy fried chicken skin: awesome.3. assorted pickles: tasty and excellent palette cleansers.For our main courses we had two orders of the miso carbonara, the uni cream, and the squid butter udon. I had a taste of each, and they were all very very yummy! I had the squid butter udon. The squid was perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing.It seemed like a lot of food, but we left no morsel behind. We killed it and and I'm already thinking about when my next return will be."
11/10/2014,20141110,4,4.23,"Fresh handcut udon...absolutely perfect!For appetizer, we got the beef tataki. Wow,,the plating was beautiful and the beef was perfect to texture. I wasn't too big of a fan of the relish, but overall it was still good. We also tried the curry udon...the soup was perfect with great consistency--not too thick, not too liquidy. I got the uni udon. It was great, but was a bit too creamy. If you don't want to feel overly full afterwards, don't drink any of the soup...just enjoy the pieces of uni from the soup."
11/10/2014,20141110,4,4.23,"I had the sea urchin cream udon. Perfectly chewy, slightly springy texture. The cream sauce was so flavorful, creamy, and rich alone and the sea urchin was just delicious! Please try it! A tad pricey but that makes sense given the title of the dish. About 16 dollars for this one. The other udon dishes range from around $8-$15."
11/11/2014,20141111,4,4.23,"The fresh handmade noodles (in itself) are pretty amazing. Friend and I split the uni udon and the squid mentai udon. Honestly, neither were mind-blowing. I'm personally not even a fan of uni or squid. I can say that the dishes were flavorful, particularly the uni. The creaminess of the uni pasta does creep up on you, so it's helpful to balance it out with broth. For you uni-lovers, it's only fair to warn you that the bits of uni may be a disappointment to you. It's nice to have a spot like Marugame Monzo in J-Town, esp. as a ramen alternative. Prices may be a bit more than your usual udon spot, but just think of it as paying for the labor that goes into them noodles."
11/11/2014,20141111,5,4.24,Best uni udon I have ever had! A little disappointed that it was topped with Ikura instead of uni like other yelp photos have shown. I feel a little jipped but the flavor of the uni cream sauce was tdf. Ikura don was light on the Ikura. I would expect more for $6.25/ bowl. Mentai squid butter udon was fabulous. Squid was melt in your mouth. We got to sit at the bar and watch them make fresh udon right in front of us! The kids loved watching the live show.Great service. Quick. I like that they repeat your order. Kid friendly. They offer plastic bowls and plastic utensils but no kids cup. Would definitely return.
11/12/2014,20141112,3,4.23,"Awesome open kitchen where you can see the staff rolling the dough and cutting the udon fresh right in front of you. Very cool :) definitely sit at the bar if available! I've tried their special udon including the uni and squid. Definitely liked the squid better. Recently tried their traditional udon, one was beef and the other was sliced duck meat. Both were tasty. After trying this place four times, I definitely prefer ramen over udon because of the thinner noodles."
11/12/2014,20141112,5,4.23,"The wait is worth it.In the epic battle for turf in Little Tokyo, one noodle joint says screw you all I'm doing my own thing. Where everyone has their opinions on the best ramen spot, there's only one when you talk about Udon. The service is great and considering how many people are usually waiting, the wait looks worse than it actually is. This place hand makes/pulls their Udon. The stuff of gangsters. The noodles come out perfectly cooked with just the right consistency and texture when consumed. Even on cold nights, I opt for the Cold Zaru Udon with their dipping sauce. It's one of my favorite dishes in LA. Slap some Shrimp Tempura on that order and I'm a very happy person. What I like most though is that you can have a high quality meal and leave for less than $10. This is not to say that the hot bowls of Udon aren't good too. There's also Uni Udon (which I've heard isn't the best in LA but still edible) and some other off the wall Udon concoctions. It all just goes back to the quality of the noodle though. It really helps set up all of the dishes and is the main event in every bowl. Quick Hitters:1) Tempura. Soft. Boiled. Egg. Yolo.2) Double Noodoe upon request and extra money.3) If the wait is long, I like to head to Far Bar and grab drink while I wait."
11/12/2014,20141112,4,4.23,"Monzo without the line would be 5 stars! But the staff there works very efficiently trying to get you seated as soon as they are ready. If you can, sit by the bar where you can see the master at work - hand made udon that will be a part of your delicious meal."
11/13/2014,20141113,4,4.23,"Review is based off of one dish: The Sea Urchin Cream Udon. I have to say, its everything you expect it to be. Read what the others are saying about it. I think the only thing thats pulling me back from giving it 5 stars is the fact that i got heartburn after eating it. I feel like its too rich and heavy for one person and they might have to ease out on the portion with how rich it is. Take this with a grain of salt because i literally wolfed it down as soon as it came to my table, you forget all sorts of food morals because the dish is so compelling and mesmerizing. You get lost in the moment while eating it. And that is something special and doesn't happen often for me. It deserves 5 stars but i just had a bad hangover 5 minutes after i finished the dish. I ordered it with two pieces of shrimp tempura and their egg tempura. I think i could have done without the egg. Not sure if it was a good fit with the dish. Maybe egg works with ramen but I'm not sure about this one. Also, i feel like the dish could have been a little cheaper. (maybe 5-10 bucks cheaper) I don't know if its the rent or the amount of money thats needed to make it but i paid close to 30 bucks total for what i ate. Not sure how high-end and quality the ingredients are. I think its sorta worth the price cause of the handmade udon. but i don't know if i would immediately without thinking consider coming back just cause of the price. If someone would nicely comment on why its priced that way and justify it with me then i might retract this statement. I also love how i didn't fall in line. I went on a monday at 930pm right when they were about to close. I heard you have to fall in line to eat here. Glad i didn't!"
11/15/2014,20141115,5,4.23,Literally heaven in my mouth. Their uni udon is a must if it's your first time.. or 2nd.. or 3rd.. if you like creamy and and if you like uni. This is it! Not enough uni chunks/pieces but understandable because uni is expensive.Wait wasn't as long as I thought it would be because there were about 5 parties ahead of us. Wait was about 10 minutes on a Saturday night.I liked how we got sat in front of the bar tables in front of the guy making the handmade noodles. Kind of like a lil show with dinner (Not much of a show.. but better than nothing). I wish the restaurant was a little but more roomy.. everything's really close to each other.
11/16/2014,20141116,4,4.23,"I've had this place bookmarked for their uni udon pasta. I finally got to try it this weekend. Got there early, around 4, in between lunch and dinner and there was only a 5 minute wait for 2.I ordered the uni udon pasta and my bf got the curry udon. The portions here are very good for the price!! The uni pasta was around $15 and the curry udon around $10. Onto the food, the uni pasta was creamy and rich!! I loved the sauce, I wish I had some bread to dip it in. My bf really liked the curry udon, it was a very thick sauce. The udon noodles are made fresh, and was cooked perfectly. I also tried the tempura soft boiled egg $1.50, it was yummy!! I will definately be back to try their other udons!!"
11/17/2014,20141117,5,4.24,The best udon I've ever tasted! We came early on Saturday and there was a wait before the restaurant even opened! I ordered the uni..it was so good! I'll definitely be back for more:)
11/19/2014,20141119,4,4.24,"Monzo's handmade noodles are dense and delicious. I love that it offers creative and traditional dishes. Sea Urchin cream udon is heavily sauced. It is a rich dish, and the uni gets completely lost in a crazy sea of cream. It's a shame. This dish would be better and easier to digest if they cut back on dousing the noodles in a cup of cream.Previously, uni was placed atop a shiso leaf which is now replaced by Ikura. Not a bad move.Tempura egg: they are wildly popular here. The center of mine was cold which was a bit creepy."
11/20/2014,20141120,5,4.24,"the noodles are freshly made in front of you!!!i love this place!!! affordable, casual, delicious! parking can be a challenge depending on what time amd day you visit and the wait could get pretty long (45-1hr wait), but I've been lucky so far. there's parking across the street but you have to pay depending on how long you stay I've gotten a few things here and haven't had anything i didn't like. beef with rice is a must try!"
11/21/2014,20141121,5,4.24,"OH MAN! OH MAN! That Sea Urchin Udon definitely HIT THE SPOT! Oh so creamy. Oh so flavor packed. Wowzahs! I definitely left this place with a happy belly! It's nice to see the chefs make their freshly homemade udon noodles right in front of you. Makes you really appreciate the food you're eating. I love pasta! I love seafood tastes! I love udon noodles! So, wow, the sea urchin udon was one special UNIcorn. Kekeke. I was very happy with my dish. I'm sad to know that once I go back up to NorCal, I won't be able to get another bowl for a while!Also, I very much enjoy the tea, bowls and spoons along with my meal."
11/21/2014,20141121,5,4.24,"So awesome. It's cool to watch them roll and cut the noodles at the bar. Negitoro bowl is super tasty and only $4 at lunch! I went two days in a row because I couldn't stop thinking about how great everything was. Servers were pleasant and attentive. I had my baby with me and I took out her yogurt and, without even asking, they brought me a small spoon so I could feed her. I felt a little bad bringing in a baby to a busy lunch place but there were perfectly hospitable. Can't wait to go back!"
11/24/2014,20141124,3,4.24,We have been here on Sat. for lunch...first time we surprises looking at the long line outside..Waited for 40 min. And finally got a table a bit earlier as we were 2 people..We ordered uni pasta and cold udon.Uni pasta was a bit disappointed...too much butter and hard to see uni.Cold udon was ok...plain. but later come back home we had a lot of water... it seems msg was in the sauce.. it always cause me to drink a lot of water...:(
11/24/2014,20141124,4,4.24,"Small and busy place. Was able to sit where we can watch them make fresh udon noodles right before your eyes! Pretty neat. I didnt go too crazy in ordering anything exotic. Just stuck to their beef udon, which was yum! Bad part is they didnt refill my water...guess they wanted us to hurry up and leave. And parking sucks. I had to park at the Tokyo plaza structure which cost me 10 bucks."
11/25/2014,20141125,4,4.24,The udon were exceptional as it is freshly made in front of you. You can taste the difference from its texture and chewiness. The fish broth was so-so but I highly recommend the signature dishes like the miso carbonara and the mental squid butter.
11/26/2014,20141126,5,4.24,"If eating soft pillowy noodles doused in creamy broth is wrong, I don't want to be right. Food: Marugame Monzo's noodles are like something out of a fairy tale because what they do to your tongue is magic (need to stop binge watching Once Upon a Time). Picture creamy white noodles as thick as a pencil with a consistency that strikes a perfect balance between butter soft and firm. It's pretty much impossible to resist eating unsafe quantities of this stuff. Luckily, you can double your order for just $2. Unfortunately, some of the special dishes are excluded from this deal, including the amazing sea urchin cream udon (yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…). The creamy broth has tiny bits of delicious uni and tastes almost like liquified mac and cheese. That may sound sort of nasty, but I swear on a stack of iphones that it is one of the best dishes I've had all year. I was, however, able to apply the $2 double noodle order to the duck udon (yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…). The duck itself wasn't impressive, but the insane amount of noodles and the clear, but flavor packed broth amounted to a winning combination (plus no one is stopping you from putting those extra noodles into the uni broth). I also tried a soft boiled tempura fried egg (yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…), which proved difficult to eat with little reward. The inside wasn't as liquified as I'd hoped, and the tempura skin slipped off mid-bite letting the egg ooze out like some sort of alien spawn. Also, it's not marinated in any way, so you're just getting a normal soft boiled egg wrapped in crunchy stuff that will turn soggy once it takes a dip in the soup. Atmosphere: A huge plus of this place is the free show you get if you're lucky enough to sit at the bar. My friend and I got a front row seat and spent our entire meal watching one of the employees skillfully rolling out (yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…) and slicing (yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…) those little strings of heaven. Seating is tight, so bringing a lot of baggage might lead to a logistically frustrated dining experience. This place is right next to the eternally popular Daikokuya, so even the wait outside is cramped. Service: The traffic at this place is expectedly heavy. Don't be daunted by the long wait list. It seems like most people sign up as a backup to Daikokuya and then fail to return. It takes about a half hour to get a seat even though they may tell you an hour or more, but if you leave you will probably lose your spot and will have to sign up at the end of the list all over again... Once you're in, they treat you right. Synopsis: You don't know udon until you've tried this place."
11/26/2014,20141126,3,4.24,"So this place has a lot of hype surrounding it and its famous uni udon, so I was super excited to try it. It often has a decent wait. I came for lunch and shared the uni udon and the curry udon with a friend. The uni is good but it's really rich, I could only take a couple bites. I didn't like the curry udon at all, but that's probably personal preference. I just don't really like japanese style udon at all, but it was my friend's choice.Anyways, the noodles are good and chewy, and it's worth coming in to try the uni udon, but it's not a place I'd come often."
11/28/2014,20141128,4,4.24,"Everything I had here was good. I would not bother with the hyped up uni. Its is good, but at $15.95 it is not that much better than the less expensive items. I loved the pork belly rice bowl even more than the creamy uni udon despite it being just a three dollar addon side dish. Go with the less expensive items and you will not be dissappointed."
11/29/2014,20141129,4,4.23,"Omg so good! Came for early dinner on a Saturday and there was only a short wait for our party of 2. We got seated at the bar right in front of the kitchen staff hand making the udon, which is a treat to watch.It was difficult to choose what to order, but I already plan to return. Decided on the Miso Carbonara. I had never had creamy udon before, and this seemed like a great place for my first. I really like the texture and firmness of the udon noodles. As for the overall bowl, I already figured I would enjoy it because I like creamy pasta, and thought this would have at least a tiny bit similarity to it. It was an interesting mix - very savory but not too salty. Felt like it could have used more bacon. I very much enjoyed this udon, however the cream did start getting to be too rich and heavy for me. Next time I'd like to try a broth base for comparison."
11/29/2014,20141129,5,4.24,"I love love love the handmade udons here. It's chewy and savory! My two go to udon dishes here are the squid butter and the sea urchin. Can't go wrong with either one of them. They're creamy though, so not great for lactose intolerant people. They do, however have other udon bowls that are dairy free. The restaurant is super tight spaced. You can literally hear everything the other table next to you is saying. I noticed they had bar seating where you can eat while watching the kitchen prepare your food and hand pulling your udon noodles. But I've yet to get a chance to sit in those seats. People that come eat here are usually pretty good with eating quick and leaving. Do not get discouraged with the group of people waiting outside of the restaurant. This place is totally worth the wait!! I'm salivating as I'm writing this review!!"
11/29/2014,20141129,5,4.24,"I love Marugame Monzo and crave it often. I've tried a few more items since my last review and they deserve mention. Having tried the popular mentai squid butter udon, I made it a point to try the equally popular uni udon. It did not disappoint!The uni udon eats like an untraditional pasta dish. The sauce is creamy and thick, almost like an alfredo sauce infused with sea urchin. It sounds unconventional, but it is crazy good. I've had uni pasta at Italian restaurants before, and they butcher it with weird cheeses and the like-- none of that here. Marugame Monzo serves a delicate and rich uni sauce that has just the right amount of seasoning and flavor. It's way better than the uni pasta at EMC, where the cream overpowers the uni. Some have argued that the uni udon is a little too rich and that they found it hard to finish.. All I can say is I wish I had been there to finish theirs off for them because I found the richness comforting.The negitoro bowl is their toro don. The fish is fresh enough, but the sweet/salty soy-based sauce and the mayonnaise make this bowl.  Don't let the mayo scare you out of trying this dish-- it's deceivingly light and flavorful. Combined with the thicker soy sauce and the toro, it makes for a wonderfully satisfying addition to your meal. As always, the quality of udon is superb. I can't wait to go back and try more options which I'm sure are just as great as everything else I've tried!"
11/30/2014,20141130,2,4.23,"Came for the unidon it's pretty disappointing. The unidon was expensive and the portions were small. It was a huge bowl, but barely any uni in the bowl, not much udon eitherMostly sauce. It's the sauce that fills you upVery disappointing and does not live up to the hype. Look at my pictures and u will see it's a struggle to capture uni in that bowl"
11/30/2014,20141130,5,4.23,"The place is a very friendly to family or your someone whom would become a family one day. It didn't take RSVP on sun lunch and there were long wait, 30 solid min. Once seated, things roll very fast and prompt. Everything ordered were made fresh. My Uri Udon was out of the world. The pasta were freshly roll. It's got the nice chewy bite to it. And the sauce is amazing. Made with half and half, butter, Japanese meso, fresh uni, and other ingredients. The temp of the food is perfect. 5*I can eat several more bowls. :-)"
12/1/2014,20141201,4,4.23,"If you're looking for quality handmade udon Marugame Monzo is where it's at. Tired of waiting for Daikokuya, why not just step next door and eat some Udon instead? The Udon noodle master even makes the stuff from scratch right in front of your very eyes behind the glass window. My favorite is the Curry udon and the Sea urchin Cream udon. The Curry udon is filled with thinly sliced cuts of tender beef. The curry is not as thick as regular Japanese curry over rice and katsu but it is however thick enough to attach itself to the udon when you slurp it up. The portions are pretty big so you don't have to worry about not being full. The Sea Urchin Cream Udon is also super delicious with its super thick cream sauce. The Udon can use a little more sea urchin but overall the taste is pretty strong. I would also suggest getting the Tempura soft boiled egg which is delicately breaded and fried to perfection with a oozing yolk in the center. Marugame is located right next door to Daikokuya so you can either park on the street or one of the parking lots around the Little Tokyo Area."
12/1/2014,20141201,3,4.23,"My group of friends loves this place. I get it, it's hand made udon noodles in various broths or sauces. The noodles are definitely great for udon noodles, but, I'm not the biggest fan of fat noodles. I am a fan of light broths and their basic Kake Udon - tasty, but not overly salty...which is probably why I'm not a fan of the creamy udon dishes - too rich for my blood. I usually get the shrimp tempura add in because it's gigantic and nicely battered. Small restaurant, so there's always a wait during feeding hours, but, the service is fantastic when you finally get seated."
12/2/2014,20141202,4,4.23,Glad to say that the wait was worth it. Uni udon... I'm salivating as we speak. Beef tataki - a little disappointing because the picture looked so much better. Has a distinctive aftertaste to it. Not sure what it is. Tempura Egg - Not a fan of the tempura but the egg hits the spot! Uni Cream Udon is my favorite! GET IT!!!I will be coming back again and again! please check out my pictures : )
12/3/2014,20141203,5,4.23,This place is the bomb! You can watch them make Udon while you eat (and it's the best you've ever had).
12/4/2014,20141204,3,4.23,"I was really excited to try the uni udon, but left feeling quite underwhelmed. I think my love for uni is dying off as well. It was super heavy and it left me desiring some kimchi, ha. Noodles were nice though and I like how you can watch them preparing the noodles!I would like to come back to try the other lighter udon options."
12/5/2014,20141205,5,4.23,"I work down the street from Monzo but never seem to go because there is always a line. Since today was a bit on the chilly side, we decided it would be worth the wait. There were about 8 small groups ahead of us, but we only waited about 30 minutes. We also got the bar seating and saw the guy hand-make the udon *exciting*.The first time I came here I was able to try their very popular uni udon which was pretty good, but was a little too heavy/creamy for me. Today I ordered the beef udon and was not disappointed. The beef was thinly sliced, tender, and had a sweet taste. The broth was also very tasty - nothing like the cheap stuff. I was also able to try a bite of the negi toro bowl which was delicious! I'm definitely ordering a whole bowl for myself next time.On top of the food being delicious, the food came out really fast. This is probably one of the best udon places I've been to -- definitely one of the best in LA."
12/7/2014,20141207,5,4.23,Fresh udon! We went in starving and left extremely full! Nothing like great udon! Expect the wait to be a little long... But worth it!
12/8/2014,20141208,4,4.23,"The udon is yummy. Hand made noodles, hot broth. Really satisfying. I found the uni udon to be a bit too rich for my tastes and the uni had an odd bitter flavor. I would recommend this to share since it is so rich. Skip the duck udon. The meat was so tough it was kind of disappointing, the broth and noodles were fantastic. My favorite thing to get here is just the classic udon. It's perfect."
12/9/2014,20141209,4,4.23,"I came here late on a Saturday night and waited for about 5-10 minutes before I was seated. I was hoping to be seated in front of the window so I can watch them make the udon but I wasn't :( oh well.I already knew what to order before even looking at the menu because I always like to do my research beforehand haha. I ordered the uni udon with a tempura soft boiled egg. I really enjoyed the subtle creamy flavor of the broth and the springy texture of the udon. My friends, however, did not like it and wished they ordered something that was less creamy. Different preferences I guess. I also would not recommend this udon if you are trying to look graceful while eating it, because the soup WILL occasionally splash on your face lol. You can add 2 dollars more for double portions, but this deal doesn't apply to their signature udon dishes. Whyyyyy?! :(We also ordered the beef tataki and it did not impress. I can't really describe the taste because we didn't like it and kind of regretted ordering it. The vegetable tempura appetizer was also pretty tiny. All in all, the uni udon was very good but I did not really leave feeling full. If you are a big eater, I would probably recommend the other non-signature udon dishes so you can order a double portion."
12/10/2014,20141210,4,4.23,Really good food and good service. They make their own udon and you can see them while they're doing it. The noodles are thick and chewy just like I like them. Broth is delicious as not salty. I had the hot udon with duck and my friend had a vegetarian cold udon with lots of fresh ginger. I think I might order it next time. I wasn't a fan of the duck so much but it could have been just me not feeling duck at the time. Also had the shitake mushroom salad as a small appetizer and one side of tempura pumpkin. When in LA and in Japantown I will be back. I highly recommend it.
12/11/2014,20141211,4,4.23,"Marugame MonzoI've been to this restaurant numerous times, but never the chance to write a review up until now...For those who are going to argue/debate whether Daikokuya is a better restaurant, then get the f*ck out of here and walk your ass next door. Save that shit for the birds. Those two places are incomparable. One serves ramen, and the other serves udon. How hard is that to understand? If you really want to compare which restaurant is better, then compare them to other restaurants that serve similar dishes. DUH. Anyways, enough with the rage let me review dis bitch.I started dinner with a couple appetizers to get my shit started. Activating the salivary glands and prepping #datmouthfeel. Listed below is the order in which my food was served. There are some pictures provided, but my fat ass finished some of the dishes before even remembering to take a photo...TWICE. Shame on me.1) Negitoro Hand roll. It's a great starter if you feel like starting your meals with some baller shit like toro. They lay all the ingredients out on a plate and you basically make the hand rolls yourself. They give you a mound of fatty tuna, sliced cucumbers, micro greens, and pieces of dried seaweed. The hand rolls are served with a soy-sesame dressing. The saltiness of the soy sauce is toned down by the sesame oil.2) Assorted Tempura. This shit was pretty basic. It was extra oily. It was just like any other tempura you buy at any Japanese restaurant. I didn't care much for it. Be careful who you eat with, because they might order lame shit like tempura...which my group did.3) Crispy Chicken Skin. My favorite. Skin so crispy. The dressing is on point. Order. A must.4) Uni Cream Udon. I always order this when I come to Monzo. Everything about it is pretty great. The name itself pretty much explains it all. This dish is definitely heavy. If you don't want to feel ashamed about yourself for eating such baller shit, then order...5) Vongole. My second favorite udon dish. Mentai Squid Butter is good, but Vongole makes me feel amazing after I eat it. I don't know what the f*ck they put in it. It's probably because it made me feel better about myself after having that Uni Cream Udon. The clam broth is light and deep in flavor. The chili gives it enough spice, but it might catch you in the back of the throw. It's a great dish. I recommend.The only thing that sucks about the place is the wait for a table. Seating can get cramped on busy nights, especially the weekends. This place is definitely not for large groups. I'd say 4 people max to be seated in a fair amount of time. Groups larger than that then you're f*cked. Have fun standing outside with your group talking about what you're going to order while you watch people eat what you're going to order. How fun. It's probably why Daikokuya is always packed; they don't want to wait for Monzo."
12/13/2014,20141213,4,4.23,awesome udon that you can eat in little tokyo area. shrimp tempura is a must. batter are really good. had the beef udon the beef is similar to yoshinoya beef bowl :) not something that i will go back for..had the urchin udon before and it was really good.
12/14/2014,20141214,5,4.23,"So maybe I love udon a little more than the average person, but this place definitely lives up to the hype! Udon is made fresh by a guy behind a glass just a few feet away from you (restaurant is small, it's true wherever you sit).We ordered the uni cream udon and it was heavenly and I don't even like uni or cream-based sauce. We also ordered the mentai squid butter udon and will return to this place for this particular bowl of udon. The sauce & squid are delicious, a must try! On the side we ordered squid and eggplant tempura which was nothing spectacular. I need to come back for dinner where they offer more appetizers on their menu like beef tartare and scallop carpaccio."
12/15/2014,20141215,5,4.23,"Knowing how these Japanese restaurants work, we waited for lunch 15mins before they opened.Lover heard how they let us watch the fresh udon making at the bar, so we requested a seat there. There's nothing like watching your food made fresh by hand and then to eat it right on the spot, leaves a positive impression on my mind. Not only was it visually pleasing to the eye, but my taste buds echoed in agreement. Every strand was chewy, but not overly so. It had a nice crunch, and it was obviously meant to be eaten in the purist way possible. With handmade noodles that good, nothing should overshadow it's quality. Talk about a dinner and a show, I was entranced the entire time.We ordered: Uni Udon 4.0 Stars            Champon Udon + salmon roe and rice side dish 5.0 stars!Lover took one bite of the udon and immediately thought how the creamy uni soup covered up the good quality udon. However, the dish was a good creamy broth filled with lots of uni. THe thing we both agreed on, it's a dish you only have once in a while. It was too rich!Champon Udon was a seafood noodle. I don't know what they put in that broth but it was like crack. This noodle wasn't their traditional noodle, but it had a turbid white color to it instead of the traditional being clear and see through. The seafood part was: small shrimp and bay scallops. The shrimp was fresh and crunchy, but the bay scallops I was a bit disappointed with. It was overcooked and rubbery =/ That was bad but I was willing to overlook it because the soup was so good. The veggies were fresh as well, with yummy julienne cabbage and sprouts.  The salmon roe and rice bowl was good of course. Can't mess that one up. Although I do have to say the roe tasted more potent than the ones I'm used to. Yum!Muy Bueno stamp!!"
12/19/2014,20141219,4,4.23,"Here at Marugame, you can see them in the back through the window making the udon noodles by hand. No, these are not some store bought shipped noodles. The restaurant was full, but we were able to get a table luckily without eating (weeknight). I ended up getting the double portion of udon for a couple bucks more. Big mistake! No way you need more than the normal portion. I ordered the duck udon. I wish I had just gotten it without the meat ($6 cheaper), which didn't add much. The real star here was the broth and udon. I am definitely excited to come back and try some of the other udon variations they offer on the specialty menu."
12/21/2014,20141221,5,4.24,Came here after a night of ice skating and was definitely not disappointed!! This places uni udon rave really does live up to its hype!What we ordered 1. Uni udon ( favorite) reminds me of fettuccini Alfredo but with a Japanese twist. 2. Scallop tataki ( ordered this cuz they ran out of beef :( 3stars)3. Crispy chicken ( they messed up our order cuz we originally ordered crispy chicken skin but I'm not complaining cuz their crispy chicken turned out amaze balls )4. Duck udon (3.5 stars) ( was tasty and light)5. Don't forget to order their fried eggy!!! It was the cherry on top of our meal!
12/21/2014,20141221,1,4.23,"Noodle tastes good. However the service is very bad. I have been to a lot of Japanese restaurants and I have never seen any Japanese restaurants treat their customers like ""I don't care about you"". Service is slow and make false promise. It is good you locate in little Tokyo, otherwise you will lose all the customers."
12/21/2014,20141221,1,4.23,"I came back with my friends the second time because I really like the taste of the noodle. However they won't let us go inside because of our eight people group was missing one of us. We waited for another 30mins. I understand different restaurants work differently, but for this type of bad services, I won't come back and this really hurts my feeling of the entire Little Tokyo community."
12/21/2014,20141221,3,4.23,"cream uni udon was flavorful, rich, creamy, super thick...overall too much where it was overwhelmingfried tempura soft egg was ok...fried octopus -yum but it was a tiny bit fishy"
12/22/2014,20141222,4,4.23,"Is there a decent udon spot on the Westside? NO, THERE ISN'T. So every time I want to get some bomb-tastic udon, I have to drive all the way to Little Tokyo to get this gem. I mean, it makes sense that the best udon is in Little Tokyo, but still. It's a hike on a weeknight :(Anyway, my favorite here is the Uni Udon. It's so rich and creamy, but not too overpowering where you feel like you're eating something completely unhealthy for you (though you probably are). The flavor is amazing, the noodles are firm but chewy, and the pieces of uni are delicious. You'll be slurping up the noodles and broth to the very last bite, trust me. That sauce, broth, liquid concoction or whatever you want to call it is addicting.I've tried the curry udon, squid butter udon, scallop carpaccio, and beef tataki. The curry udon is a little basic. The squid butter is tasty, but a little on the fishy side, so if you're not into that, I'd suggest a different dish. The scallop and beef were ok for appetizers... Nothing memorable. Except for how tough the beef was, I remember that... I'd skip or try some of their other items to be honest.But yeah, that Uni Udon... Can't go wrong at all. Solid 4 stars for that dish alone."
12/22/2014,20141222,3,4.22,"Meh, this place is just okay. I will admit that I may not like udon that much, but it may just be that I don't like udon at this place.I've been here twice: the first time I was really excited because I had watched a video of the noodle making and it looked like it was going to be awesome. The ambiance was good and the service was prompt but I wasn't impressed with anything really. The udon was just like the kind you buy in the refrigerator section of the Asian market, and when I found out that the noodles are only made of all purpose flour and water, the whole thing kind of lost its appeal.Second time I came here I was dragged by my friends who love the place, so this isn't to say that it's bad, just not my kind of noodle. I do enjoy their carbonara dish, but it's much to rich to enjoy without hating yourself afterward.If you're debating between this and ramen, I'd say go with ramen."
12/24/2014,20141224,5,4.23,"This go-to spot in Little Tokyo has gained a loyal following during the several years it has been open. Next to Daikokuya Ramen, this udon (thick white Japanese noodle) shop has proven to rival its noodle neighbor's menu with traditional and Japanese-Italian-inspired dishes including a carbonara--all dishes mind you are made with udon noodles made right in the restaurant.The wait is ~15-20 minutes, usually longer for parties more than 2 people. Of course weekend nights are a bit longer.Wakame Seaweed Udon is amazing. Pretty simple and cheap at ~$8 but it lets you try the lightly-battered tempura side dishes ~$1-3 without making yourself too full. Duck Nan-ban Udon. A bit tough but still a good option for the broth.Tempura. Get the tako (baby octopus), nasu (eggplant), and shrimp. All are light and complement the hot udon dishes well. Double noodle portion for $2 is an option for both hot and cold udon. Also, you have to get the ground ginger with the udon here. It makes the dish. I've never been here when someone's gotten a Japanese-Italian dish, but I've heard only good things. Give this place a shot!"
12/24/2014,20141224,2,4.22,Food is ok. Deviates from traditional Japanese food. If kitchen is about to close they don't offer you water.. Just make sure you don't chock.
12/24/2014,20141224,5,4.22,"Yup, lives up to the hype. My wife and I were able to get in before the crazy lines. I have heard people (my brother, friends, etc) saying that they had to wait 40 minutes before.The uni was great. Thick, creamy sauce over udon. If you don't like heavy cream, this is probably not the udon you should get. The uni flavor was very strong as well.Beef has a very clean taste to it. This is certainly very light compared to the uni.Carbanara is what you would expect it to taste like. I would like it if they put more bacon in it. Of the 3 I tried, I do like the uni the best. The beef was a close second. The Carbonara is something I can live without. It was good, just not as great as the other 2.Love their udon noodles. The texture and flavor is certainly one of the best noodles I've had."
12/25/2014,20141225,4,4.22,"Uni udon was too heavy for my taste.I love uni, but just on sushi...My son got the beef and cant remember what my husband got :)Definitely, the texture of the noodle was so tender and fresh!"
12/25/2014,20141225,4,4.22,"Good but not better than Fukada in Orange County. Props for the creative specialty udons though! The tempura egg was cooked perfectly but needed a little salt or something for extra flavor. The shiso tempura was perfection but a bit pricy at $1 for a single leaf. The uni cream udon was good but a little bland. I guess that's for the best since if it were as rich as uni spaghetti I would have gotten sick of it after half the bowl. The noodles were a bit heavy, and not very chewy, which is one thing I value highest in udon. For my time and money I prefer Fukada for sure, but this was a neat place to try since we were visiting the area."
12/27/2014,20141227,5,4.22,"There is nothing in the world like fresh noodles. They are nothing like their dried counterparts. The a light and flavorful and this place does them better than anywhere else. I love this place and came here 20 days of the first month I found it. I love it and being able to watch them make them in front of your eyes is a huge added bonus for me as a trained cook. I have tried everything here and it is all incredible. One of the best restaurants in this part of the city, maybe one of the best in all of LA and beyond."
12/28/2014,20141228,3,4.22,"Overrated. Uni cream udon tastes bland, EMC is definitely better. Tempura is bigger than expected. We ordered Ikura and Kaikage bowl but boy those are small child size rice bowl for $6.95!! Service is good even though the place is packed like sardines..."
12/29/2014,20141229,4,4.22,"Decided to give this place a try after there was over an hour wait at THAT other place next door.  Deliciously surprised. Ordered kitsune udon, wakane seaweed udon w/ double portion udon, a seared beef appetizer and onigiri rice ball w/plum flake. Udon noodles are made fresh right before your mouth watering eyes? Huh? You get the picture. Broth is superb, udon al dente, plenty of green onions, and bustling atmosphere. A great night out."
12/29/2014,20141229,3,4.22,"Marugame Monzo has been on my list for a while, and I'd have to say that I wasn't that impressed. The udon quality is incredible, of course -- all made in house, showcased for the world to see -- but unfortunately, that's all it really has going for it.Scallop Carpaccio = Not enough flavor, a pretty lackluster dishBraised Pork = Not tender enoughFried Chicken Skin = OkayTempura Soft-boiled Egg = Egg was good but tempura coating was too doughyUni Udon = This is what I came here for and it definitely was skimping on the uni. There were a few small broken pieces in there and it was completely overpowered by the creamy broth, which faintly tasted like uni. It was good, just with too little uni flavor.It may be worth it if you were seated immediately, but it's definitely not worth the ridiculous wait."
12/29/2014,20141229,4,4.22,"i was here on a random tuesday for lunch and it was PACKED. which always makes me wonder, don't people have work? how do they have the time to wait in these long lunch lines? my bf had the uni udon (~$16) and i had a pork belly rice bowl (~$5). the regular pork belly rice bowl entree was a small size, so if you're hungry, i'd recommend ordering something else in addition to it. i was expecting slabs of pork belly like chashu, but instead, this was thin slices of fatty pork belly meat, resembling the pork version of yoshinoya rice bowls. it was tender, well seasoned, and the fluffy, fresh rice balanced the umami meat flavor perfectly. the uni udon was creamy, rich, and heavy. i had a small bowl and shared with my bf and it was the perfect amount. not sure if i could finish an entire bowl myself. my bf said the udon reminded him more of italian flavors, like pasta with creamy sauce. the texture of the noodles were on point with just the right amount of chewiness. i also had a lightly fried tempura soft boiled egg and it was delicious. the batter was light, the yolk oozed out in glorious yolk porn. $16 for a bowl of udon at lunch is a bit steep in my book, but if you share, it's not too bad. service was quick and friendly, i've always been a ramen fan and stayed away from udon, but this place has made me a believer in udon."
12/29/2014,20141229,5,4.22,This place is my new find in Little Tokyo. I kept noticing the lines when waiting for Daikakuya so decided it was worth a try.Their Udon is so fresh and delicious. I have only had Tempura Udon but can't wait to go back!
12/29/2014,20141229,5,4.22,"Why wait in line for Daikokuya next door when you can get the freshest most delicious Udon here?? Watching them hand roll and slice the udon noodles is mesmerizing (ask for bar seat!) The champon udon is my personal winner, but the miso carbonara and mentai squid butter are close seconds (last two are definitely heavy and creamy, good to share). I just recommended this place to my good friends tonight, and I FAILED MISERABLY because I didn't tell them to make sure they get the soft-boiled tempura egg. Because THAT is the true champion. I'm a terrible friend. Get the egg. Just do it. Also, their bowls are beautiful. I appreciate that."
12/30/2014,20141230,5,4.22,"I had the creamy udon with delicious roe, salmon, and shrimps. We also ordered tempura fishcake and softboiled egg (amazing). For apps we had fried skin and pork belly, yum.I'm not normally into udon, but this is by far the tastiest food I've had in LA in a long time. We killed some time in our hour-long wait by getting drinks at farbar."
12/31/2014,20141231,5,4.22,"Fresh udon, delicious dishes, and very reasonable prices - I love this place! We recently came here after being deterred by the line for Daikokuya on a Sunday night. I was pleasantly surprised - after a very brief wait, we enjoyed hot steaming bowls of the best Japanese comfort food I've had. There seem to be dishes for newbies and advanced udon-eaters alike. I am drooling just thinking about it."
1/2/2015,20150102,5,4.23,"dinner and a show: display of how they make the udonWait: Note: can be super super long! Daikokuya has a long wait but Marugame also can, try to come really early or later or prepared to wait! I figured it would be a shorter wait if it's raining outside, but the line gets even longer, probably something to do with .... hot udon sounds delicious on rainy day, just doesn't help that ppl crowd into the small restaurant to duck the cold and rain So all their udon is hand made :) So good and delicious! They have the traditional udon: regular udon with soup based or they also have some udon - fusion: italian udon fusion like cabonara udon, uni udon, vongole udon, squid ink udon! i think one of my all time favorite is the squid ink udon and also the uni udon so delicious. appetizer: braised pork belly is a MUST, although they are known for their beef tataki, the pork belly sauce is just way too unresistable! Parking: street or a lot .... be prepared to pay or stalk some cars!"
1/2/2015,20150102,5,4.23,"From out of town and visiting Little Tokyo like us? Then you have to put this on your short list for eats. We arrived for lunch just after 11:00 am. They open at 11:30 and the line behind us starting growing fast. The restaurant is small and fills up fast. We had the curry udon and the kakuni (pork belly) udon. Both were stellar with the handmade noodles being the star. We also order the mentaiko and negi-tori don to complement our udons. A great meal! Service was on point. With so many great reviews, just give it a try during your visit. You won't be disappointed. For locals, you have a gem of a udon joint."
1/2/2015,20150102,2,4.22,Trendy and overrated. We waited over an hour for udon that wasn't really much better than the packaged kind with fatty beef that tasted like yoshinoya. Waste of time and money.
1/3/2015,20150103,4,4.22,"I love coming to Little Tokyo because even though I come often there is always something new to try! This place is right next door to that famous ramen(which btw is overrated) and yes there is a wait for both. Lucky us, we didn't have to wait too long before we were called! Inside is a bit cramped with tables and seating at the bar but nothing too bad. Once seated, we proceeded to look through the menu and I decided on the uni udon because I love me some uni while my friends ordered the shrimp uni, shrimp tempura and one more uni udon! For the starter I picked the beef tataki which was good but looked better in the photo. The food arrived shortly because we were hungry! Was it good enough to come back?! I think so! The service was on par and really I have no complaints! Definitely want to try the other udon but I suspect I'll end up ordering the same dish. Tips-parking is of course all around Little Tokyo, streets and structures available. Of course bring cash in case they don't take card for the parking fee.Picture finally added!!!"
1/3/2015,20150103,4,4.22,"When you come here, you need to be ready for the wait. Not accepting reservations must be a conscious choice to help drum up the hype of this location, and I--along with hundreds of others--don't mind that one bit. Depending on which day of the week and the time of day that you come, you'll either be hit with a short wait or a long one. The first time I went was back in March, and the wait wasn't bad. I went back for my second visit a couple of weeks ago, and we waited an hour.THE FOODBoth times, I ordered the Uni Cream Udon. It's not worth your time ordering anything else, in my opinion. This is what makes this place so popular and unique. Who wants to drive all the way to Torrance for Maruhide every time you need to satisfy your uni craving?The dish is pretty monstrous for a small lady like me, but I can finish that and a small Pork Belly Rice Bowl in one sitting without breaking a sweat. I can't get enough of the rich, creamy broth and the small pieces of uni distributed throughout. You get hints of uni with every bite so you don't get overwhelmed by all the richness. There is almost nothing better to eat on a cold night Downtown. As for the pork belly, it's thinly sliced and peppery and DE-LICIOUS.Yum yum in my tum tum.THE SERVICEThe servers are very friendly, but there's no time for chit chat! This place is crowded, and everybody wants your table. Sometimes it can get so crowded that they forget what you ordered for drinks. It's cool!THE ATMOSPHEREPart of the reason why so many people wait outside is because there's minimal waiting space inside. You're seated almost too close to your neighbors, and you can actually hear their conversations without trying too hard. If you're lucky, you'll get to sit at the bar and watch the chefs make the udons. FINAL GRADEA // I'm coming back here over and over again"
1/3/2015,20150103,5,4.22,"Holy mother of all noodles, this place is a gem that is worth every star! As a self proclaim noodle connoisseur, I would give this place the highest marks if my criticism even matters on a professional calibre in terms of texture, chewiness, taste, and consistency...but it doesn't unfortunately. For a noodle aficionado like me, what I can elaborate on based on the experience of eating at many different place is that Marugame Monzo is a store that has master it's craft in its udon. Like most popular places, Marugame Monzo has a ridiculously long waiting time but dread not, it is located in the middle of a cultural sector of Downtown Los Angeles, Little Tokyo -- which has a handful of bars (my favorite, The Far Bar) and stores to just leisurely kill time until you could be seated.The ambience of the restaurant is very homely and of course modern in terms of design. The place is a bit small and packed but I guess that is what contributes to fabricating that homely experience. The customer service was also very welcoming and attentive.Upon seating down with my party, I quickly studied the menu and had appreciated that the options were not too expansive but not too reserved either. A good variety of options in the appetizers, entrees, and drink menu. For starters, we ordered,Clam with Garlic Sauce: 2/5 -- Average, nothing too outstanding. The clams were of decent size and the sauce could be more flavorful.Beef Tataki: 2.5/5 -- Had potential to be a great dish but felt like the combine flavors of seasoning were a bit too bold and conflicting. The searing was perfectly executed however.Fried Chicken Skin: 3.5/5 -- As unhealthy as it sound, it was pretty darn good. The skin was fried to a level of perfection that was drizzled in a citric based soy sauce (most likely ponzu but a bit more sour).Scallop Carpaccio: 4/5 -- This was probably my favorite appetizer of the night. The scallop was very cool and refreshing. The sprout and masago did well in complimenting that refreshing and cool palette along with the creamy based sauce.For Entrees, we orderedMentai Squid Butter Udon: 3/5 -- I am a big fan of mentaiko (Japanese salty fish roe) thus it led me to give this entree a shot. One key note is that mentaiko has a very distinctive flavor that is usually eaten in small portion with rice to balance out the overwhelming umami and salty tang. My curiosity led me to wonder how the restaurant manage to saturate the saltiness while still retaining the flavor so that it can be edible with udon in a butter form. Instead I got a very fluidly base sauce that tasted just like the udon was served in sea water. Even though I was rather disappointed, the squid was cook well--not too chewy yet not too soft to be considered raw. Uni Udon: 5/5 -- This is the star dish that gave this restaurant it's reputation and is rather quite well deserve even from me despite all the other average options in the menu. The perfectly created udon soaked in the creamy and flavorful uni based sauce is a pair destined by the gods. Seriously. A must try for all first timers!"
1/4/2015,20150104,4,4.22,"Very busy restaurant, I recommend walking in, writing your name on the list, keep track of how many people are ahead of you (if any) check out Little Tokyo and come back. We had 11 guests ahead of us, parties of 5 or 4. We walked to the Japanese American museum and looked at the gift shop, returned in 15 minutes and it was our turn, nice!It's very warm inside! Dress in layers.We ordered the curry udon, and the Kanye udon ( be sure to add sides!)So delicious!I loved the udon, so fresh and cooked to perfection!We also ordered iced green tea and oolong tea, blame in soda cans, so not freshly brewed...Bill was less than $30! Love the price! If there isn't any street parking, use the lot on Judge John Aiso St. $7.Will return, service is great, food is delicious."
1/4/2015,20150104,5,4.22,I love this place. I get the carbonara and add an egg. It's so good. We always sit on the bar so we don't wait for more than 10-15 minutes. I love that all the waiters speak sign language. It's brilliant and lovely. The udon is just omnomnom.
1/5/2015,20150105,4,4.22,"If you love udon, then you'll love this place. Just make sure to come here early if you don't want to wait with the huge crowd. On a cold night is when you can expect a good wait but if you come here around 6:30pm or so, no need to wait. Once it hits about 7pm is when the crowd starts forming outside which competes against Daikokuya. Their Uni pasta is one of the best with its uni cream based. Don't be fooled by the name expecting unis to fill the plate. You will however find small bits of it but not huge pieces of uni. The other udon to get are their Miso Carbonara and Mentai Squid Butter. You can't go wrong with either one as their handmade udon makes it that much better. If you don't feel like getting one of their signature udon, then you can opt for a hot udon and add sides to it which are tempera sides from soft-boiled eggs to pumpkin. Their soup base is great to get. Seating can be tight here as you'll feel you're eating alongside the people next to you but the service is great because refills keep coming and the staff is always polite."
1/5/2015,20150105,4,4.22,"Handmade Udon Noodles. Delicious bold yet delicate broth. Ambiance of a Japanese noodle house. Perfect. Marugame hits all the right notes with little shortcomings. Their hot soups are some of the best I've had. I love light broths that are still salty and warms the soul. Marugame's hot broths do just that. The pork belly is also a tender addition that just makes life so wonderful. Their cold soups aren't bad either. Despite their smaller size and portioning, there's enough flavor to make you feel satisfied, but perhaps not full. Not meant for everyone, but worth giving a whirl! After a mild wait time, you'll be enjoying a delicious bowl of udon. In a city that is infested with Ramen, Marugame Monzo was one of my favorite recommendations this last year."
1/6/2015,20150106,4,4.22,"I'm not a fan of uni or creamy sauces so I was a little skeptical of this place since that's their two most popular dishes. I opted with the kake udon and was blown away with how flavorful it was and how perfectly al dente the udon was. The portions are huge so come hungry!The restaurant is pretty small so the wait can get long but it seems the patrons here get that it's a quick eat and jam place, not really somewhere you linger and talk for hours. Plus you're kind of cramped in there so it's not exactly ideal for talking anyways."
1/6/2015,20150106,4,4.22,"We waited about 45 minutes. There's another popular ramen spot right next door; so it's an intermingling of hungry people; lots of activity on that sidewalk. Ordered curry udon. It was good. Nice think noodle, we ordered the assorted pickle which was good as well.They were Jonny on the spot with the water; glass wasn't more than half empty at any given point, though I guess that's all based on you're perspective on life. We had a pretty good spot in the middle of the restaurant. Lots of action, servers coming and going but never felt anxious or overcrowded."
1/9/2015,20150109,5,4.22,"I never knew how much I loved udon til this place opened! I'll confess, I was originally intrigued by the idea of freshly made noodles, especially when you can watch (!) them being made. But the amazingness of Monzo goes beyond the ""novelty"" of house made noodles. Despite the ~30 min drive from West LA and the 30 min - 1 hour wait, we make the trek here at least once a month. The texture of the noodles is a nice balance between chewy and firm, and you can tell that the freshness makes a huge difference. Usually I order the shrimp tempura udon or the kitsune udon with a side of tempura egg and/or shiitake. The egg yolk is perfectly gooey and a nice contrast to the crunch of the tempura. I've also tried the chicken tempura, which was juicy and tender, not at all dry like one might expect. I've also had the beef udon, curry udon, miso carbonara, and uni cream udon. The latter two were tasty, but a bit too rich for me - after one or two bites I couldn't really handle more, let alone a whole bowl (no worries, they were shared with other people so they didn't go to waste! :P). As for the beef udon and curry udon, they were not bad but I prefer the more ""traditional"" shrimp tempura and kitsune udon dishes. For appetizers, the scallop carpaccio and beef tataki are my favorites. Both are tender and tasty, and just enough that they don't fill you up too much for the udon!Service is usually speedy and attentive. If you don't want to wait too long for a table I'd recommend going either really early or on the later side of lunch/dinner time. They're pretty efficient with getting people in as soon as a table is ready - but don't worry, that doesn't mean that they rush you while you're eating either!"
1/10/2015,20150110,4,4.22,"Simply awesome! Coming here last night reminds me of the wonderful time we had in Japan in 2010 . We found a hand made udon with the best tempura the second day we were in Tokyo and this place reminds me so much of our experience. Yes, there was a wait but it is so worth it! This is a small hole in the wall but it is so charming. I had the tempura udon and the shrimp was very big and tasty! The beef udon is rich in beef flavor, chicken tempura was also very tasty. Curry udon soup is a little heavy on the gravy side rather than soupy. Tuna rice bowl is on the smaller portion side . I can not believe I forget to order the kakiage so I have to definitely go back and also try the creamy udon! Yum!"
1/11/2015,20150111,5,4.23,What a treat. Best Udon I've had in SoCal. Definitely will return. If you're looking for Udon this place is a must.
1/13/2015,20150113,4,4.23,"Solid udon house.They make fresh noodles and you can sit at the bar and watch the kitchen do their thing. They get very busy on weekend nights so be prepared to wait. I live their side dishes i.e. eggplant, hot oil, shitake etc...Go and enjoy a nice hot soup."
1/13/2015,20150113,5,4.23,I love this place. Its my first visit here and definitely not the last. I had tempura udon and it was delicious. The noodle was cooked perfect and the dashi was equally delicious. The noodle is so fresh b/c they make their own noodle and you can watch them make the noodle. I had tempura udon and it was a seriously the biggest shrimp tempura ever. They offer both hot and cold noodles. I can't wait to try ume shiso udon. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.
1/17/2015,20150117,5,4.23,"we got uni cream udon, mushroom cream udon, miso carbonara and curry udon. all four of them were amazing. it was worth waiting!definitely comin back !"
1/17/2015,20150117,5,4.23,I went there last night with a friend to enjoy a nice night out in la with great food and entertainment so we decided to pick this cute spot to start our night. We were on the waiting list with about 12-14 people ahead of us and the hostess told us about 30 mins give and take. We didnt mind the wait and hoped it would be worth it and it was! We ordered two appetizers: Monzo Caprese and Beef Tataki. The monzo caprese was alright and nothing too special. The beef tataki had great flavors and such but was on the chewy side. For our main dishes we ordered the Miso Carbonara and Seafood Udon that had the creamy tomato base for the pasta udon. They were both soooo goood... most def will be back!
1/18/2015,20150118,4,4.23,"Been here a few times and feel like I can finally write a full review. I've had the curry, mentai squid butter, uni cream, shrimp tempura, and the beef. I've tried a few of their other side dishes but I want to focus on the udonEverything I have tried here is not too salty. The broth is light and flavorful. I like that all the udon I've tried are not one noted and full of fillers.My favorite is the squid butter. The squid is cooked perfectly, not chewy at all. Everything is served warm, so if you don't eat fast enough it'll get cold quick. Not sure if this is how it's supposed to be.The wait staff is very fast and friendly I don't feel rushed out of here. I will definitely come back many many times."
1/20/2015,20150120,5,4.23,"2nd time having UNI UDON,.. AMAZING! It wasn't cheesy like the first one I tried in SF. The udon was freshly pulled and made right infront of me. The UNI udon was rich and buttery,.. you can taste the uni pieces on each bite. Once you order a UDON dish, you also get to order one side dish for a cheaper price. We had the pork belly don and NegiTORO don - ALL WAS VERY YUMMY! I think this place is worth waiting in line for,.. instead of the RAMEN place next door! I will be back!"
1/20/2015,20150120,4,4.23,"Normally I prefer ramen to udon--I think the flavors are richer and the soup tastes better. But when I heard that this place had uni ramen, I couldn't resist. I'll never pass up uni!The wait was around 45 mins when I came. It was probably because it was MLK day and they only have walk-ins. Some reviewers talked about the technique of making the noodles, but to me they tasted good. They were a little long in size, so it was a little difficult to eat in one bite. However, they were nice and firm, not too soft or soggy. The uni broth was awesome! It tasted like a broth made from uni. If there was anything that could be added to make it better, it would be to add more uni and more garnishes. I only found small pieces of uni, and I would have paid a premium to get more served on top. Also, the lack of many other ingredients make it a little one-noted. Maybe it's an udon thing, but it would have been nice to have more garnishes to add to the dish. Overall though, I enjoyed the generous portions and the creativity of the udon."
1/21/2015,20150121,5,4.23,"Usually it's a wait but not tonight. Love coming here. Good eats. Just sometimes it a wait but we'll worth it. They make fresh udon in front of you. After your finish, walk off the food in little Tokyo. Get some matcha."
1/21/2015,20150121,4,4.23,"I came here with my friends because Daikokuya next door had a 2 hour wait and this place had none LOL.We all ordered different things- I got the standard udon bowl, Kake Udon, which is $7, with an egg (1.50) and chili oil (0.25).The servings here are huge. Not only do you get the most ginormous bowl of broth, but you get an extremely generous serving of handmade udon noodles. They gave me my chili oil in a shot glass. I used all of it, but it wasn't spicy at all ): However, the spicy powder they have at the table helped a lot. The egg is covered in tempura, which is pretty interesting. I like the way the egg is cooked, but I wish it had more flavor! The udon itself was pretty good. The broth wasn't anything special or mind blowing- just some standard, salty broth with some yummy noodles.My friends got the curry udon and the pork udon. All our broths were different. The curry udon tasted just like Japanese curry and the consistency of the broth was almost as thick as regular curry! I would even call it sauce over broth. Overall, we paid around $10 each. Service is slow, but very nice. Bathrooms are super clean which is always appreciated~"
1/21/2015,20150121,5,4.23,"I came here for a friend's birthday (there were just four of us). I do not recommend this restaurant for parties larger than four. I had the sea urchin (uni) udon and it was amazing! I love udon and uni, so this dish was perfect for me. It's really creamy, so if you're not a fan of creamy pastas - you might not like this dish.The food here is on the expensive side, so don't go to this restaurant if you're looking for a cheap meal. Try to get to the restaurant 20 minutes early because it's pretty popular and you need to write your name on a waitlist. Parking is extremely scarce, so keep that in mind. You can either street park or park in a garage around the area.Hope this review helps you!"
1/22/2015,20150122,4,4.23,"I love their food!!!!If you loved Uni, you must try their Uni cream udon!! Handmade udon that's super chewy with the rich creamy Uni sauce. They kept the portion perfect so it didn't get too much. Service is just okay, as they tend to get super busy. Oh not to mention the long wait. However, it's worth it! Gotta try their appetizers as well!"
1/22/2015,20150122,4,4.23,"I love little Tokyo! Some of the best spots to eat within its parameters. My friends and I were deciding on a place for lunch and stumbled across this spot while doing our search. Well worth trying! I ordered the tomato based seafood udon. It was great! The udon noodles were fresh and perfectly cooked. The tomato broth was creamy and a surprisingly great combination with the noodles. The seafood was shrimp and scallops. I wish it came out a bit hotter than it did, but it's OK because it was still deeelish! My friend tried the duck udon and she liked it as well. She felt the duck fat wasn't rendered out enough but other than that she loved it. My other friend got the cold udon noodles with pork belly and she loved it! Overall I was quite happy with our eating experience. They have great options and great service. I'm definitely coming back to check out the other yummy options"
1/22/2015,20150122,4,4.23,"Came here on a Wednesday night around 8 with my bf and we were seated immediately. He ordered the uni udon, which was ~$16, and I got the duck nanban udon, which was ~$13. I was surprised that the uni dish didn't come with larger pieces of uni, but the flavor is definitely present in the sauce, which is extremely rich and creamy.I really liked the duck udon, although the duck was a little overcooked. The noodles themselves were cooked perfectly though - too many places have mushy udon, but these were al dente. A bit pricey, but the service and quality were great! Portions are good too. Would definitely come back!"
1/23/2015,20150123,5,4.23,"While in Little Tokyo yesterday, we observed two lines at lunch. One for this place and one for the ramen place next door. The ramen place had a longer line, but most were Americans. This place had all Japanese in line. When we found ourselves back In the area today, we decided to go with udon. There wasn't a line today, but it was an overcast, cool day. We were seated near the bar, so we were able to watch the guy making the udon. The wife was leery about udon as she always spills on herself and we were going somewhere after; however, she ordered the curry udon after seeing the guy make it and figured this would be as fresh as it gets here in the states. I ordered the shrimp tempura udon. Both were amazing and huge portions. I got to eat mine and half the wife's!  The staff were all friendly and the prices for lunch were very reasonable. We would definitely go back."
1/24/2015,20150124,3,4.23,"Good quality udon, freshly made in house. However, the uni cream sauce was only ""meh"". Could have been a little thicker, a little saltier, and did not have the oomph as some other ones I've had."
1/26/2015,20150126,4,4.23,The creamy uni udon and mentai sqiud butter is worth the drive for! Perfect with a side order of tempura to balance the creamy taste.
1/27/2015,20150127,5,4.23,"Came in on recommendation from a coworker when we wanted to try a place near little Tokyo. Came for lunch, no wait time, we were seated right away.Freshly made udon, very nice to see. We ended up sharing the uni cream udon from their signature udon list, mixed tempura and a soft boiled egg tempura.The soft boiled egg was perfectly cooked. Love the runny ness and softness of it. The other tempura was okay (giant shrimp, shiitake mushroom, kabocha, and eggplant). Everything seemed really fresh.The signature uni cream udon was delicious! Creamy, lots of bits of uni and roe on top. Flavor was not overpowering, but really good. The udon had a chewy texture, but not overcooked. I really liked the freshly made udon. One thing to note is that it is really heavy. Gf and I were glad we only ordered one to share. Two would have just been too much. Overall a must try if you're in the neighborhood. One the best places for udon in the area!"
1/27/2015,20150127,5,4.23,"handmade udon on the spot???? I wish I got to sit front row seat so I can see my noodles being made in action haha! Ordered - [x] Udon with bean curd - Mmm came with 2-3 fat slices of bean curd ... YUM!!! And you can definitely taste the freshness of the udon. It's chewy and soooo good. I usually eat the frozen kind so you can tell the difference. It came in this HUGE bowl which made it seem like a huge portion but I was able to finish it haha! They even give you a wooden spoon which was pretty neat :)[x] Negitoro Don - Just for $4 more, you can pair your udon entree with one of the smaller sides. However, this was NOT small... it was a generous amount of fresh ground tuna with rice topped with sesame, seaweed and mayo sauce. You basically mix it all together and get this kind of tuna mixed rice. SO GOOD! NO SHARING FOR THIS (They specify it in the menu haha) Pricing is fair :) and it does get crowded so I suggest to come early! We came during weekday for a late lunch around 1:30 and there were still quite a few people. It's small so you sit pretty close to other tables, not a lot of room if you wanna talk secrets HAHA"
1/27/2015,20150127,5,4.23,"Incredible. I can't even describe how wonderful the seafood tomato udon is. I'm going to be dreaming about it for weeks. I don't even care that there's no place to park, I need those beautiful noodles again soon. Friends ordered udon in broth and a pork rice bowl, with the awesome deep fried egg on top, and both were completely satisfied. I was the only one with leftovers and ate them for breakfast the next day, it was THAT GOOD."
1/28/2015,20150128,5,4.23,"Wow, the best udon I've had! Excellent, excellent texture. Made in-house, and it has just the right amount of give. I also liked the cold options, and their signature ones are good for those who want something a little more fusion. Plus the servings are huge - everything comes out in giant bowls!THE WAIT: About a 20-minute wait for four of us at noon on a Saturday.THE SERVICE: Really professional and thorough. The guy who took our order really wanted to get it right, he repeated it back to us to check three times!SIGNATURE UDON* Miso Carbonara (Creamy White Sauce based Udon w/ Bacon, hint of Miso flavor. $12.50) - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…An interesting mix of western flavors and eastern textures. Definitely a very thick sauce, very heavy, just like you'd expect from a carbonara sauce at an Italian restaurant, and it went surprisingly well with the thick udon noodle thought I couldn't taste the ""hint of Miso flavor'. The thick bits of bacon were great. If you want something more familiar to a western palate or really different for Asian food, this is the way to go, but I wouldn't get this if you're looking for authentic Japanese cuisine.COLD UDON* Bukkake Udon (Cold Udon with Cold Broth. $6.95) - 4.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…This was great! I was intrigued by the cold udon section, something I'd never had before. The photos made this serving look really small, but it still comes out in a huge bowl. You have to mix the different toppings (radish, bonito flakes, scallion, and tempura pieces) really well together. Once they're all in their right proportions mixed in, then it really tastes right! The radish adds a thickness, the tempura this great crunch, and scallion/bonita extra flavor. You can pour the sauce, in a separate container, over the noodle, but that ends up sinking at the bottom. I found it was better to make your spoon with the noodle and mixed toppings (get some from the bottom; they've invariably clumped there), then pour the sauce over your spoonful. Delicious!I also tried a bit of the Beef Udon (Hot Udon section), which was very classic and tasty. The meat was sliced very thin and was tender. It would've been my next choice had I not wanted a cold udon!yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…Menu: yelp.com/biz_photos/maru…"
1/28/2015,20150128,2,4.23,"If you're not a party of two, I would not recommend dining here on the weekend. Most of the tables are set up for two so three or more people have to wait double the time. The food is good but nothing that is jaw dropping good. It's not worth the wait in my opinion and at that point (super starving), I'm sure anything would taste decent. People enjoy watching the chefs knead the noodle dough from the counter. At least that is something new that you don't get to experience at other Japanese noodle restaurants.   Service was unfriendly and the servers seemed stressed out. Hopefully, they can somehow improve the seating arrangement so groups of more than two can dine without an unbearable waiting time."
1/28/2015,20150128,5,4.23,If you love udon then you'll definitely have to try this place. Freshly made udon - the texture is wonderful with a bit of chewiness to it.
1/29/2015,20150129,5,4.23,"Yes. Marugame Monzo. Yes.Parking:Find street parking, or park in the structure across the restaurant.Service:Very polite, courteous Japanese waitresses. Only thing is that they are a bit busy during the dinner time but it's all good. You can also see the chef making udon noodle in the kitchen. I almost wanted to buy the noodle cutter machine...it's super cool. Food:One word=YUM! I usually get sea urchin cream udon which is my favorite. I can eat this everyday. It's just the right combination of uni and cream. Udon noodle is cooked just right. I've tried their miso carbonara and that was pretty amazing too. Tempura udon was alright.I'd definitely recommend this place to all Uni pasta lovers!"
1/30/2015,20150130,5,4.23,"Oodles of nooOOoOodles. We came here on a whim and I've never had udon as fresh and well made as this place!Daikokuya had an hour wait & we only had about 30 minutes to eat.. so we stopped by to check this place out and we were seated in less than 10 minutes! They have an awesome seating policy. If they call your name & your entire party isn't here or you stepped out, they'll move on to the next party. Simple. We were immediately seated at the bar which was easily the best seat in the house! We had a sweet view of the cooks kneading, rolling, and cutting fresh udon noodles and loved every minute of it. Let me tell ya, it was like watching a live version of ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" (a stunning sushi documentary of a man & his love for his profession) but with udon!Service // Wonderful. We always had our water and tea refilled, the food came out in a short amount of time, and the staff was really responsive.Shrimp Tempura Udon // So good. Shrimp was crispy and served on a separate plate so it wasn't soggy. Udon was cooked perfectly and the broth was flavorful but not too oily.Overall, a great dining experience & stellar lunch break."
1/31/2015,20150131,4,4.23,"Finally made the trip to try the UNI UDON after what seems like forever. On a regular weekday around 1:30 pm, there was NO WAIT, in fact there were even a few empty tables. I gotta admit, the udon is chewy, soft, and delicious but my UNI udon didn't deserve 5 stars. For $15.95 I expected there to be at least maybe 2-3 slices of uni, but instead I got maybe 3-4 miniscule shreds of what tasted like overcooked uni in a very creamy kraft cheese tasting sauce base. Overall, I think they can do slightly better by adding more visible pieces of uni ;)"
2/3/2015,20150203,3,4.23,"Nice udon restaurant in Little Tokyo. Of course parking is rough here so be prepared. Went on a Monday for lunch and only a five or ten minute wait.We had the cold plum shiso bukkake udon and kitsune udon with a side kakiage bowl. Both udons were good, we definitely preferred the plum shiso udon, although I'm a sucker for umeboshi so I may be biased but it was fresh and colorful tasting and great for lunch on a hot day.We didn't sit there, but there's a bar where you can watch the chefs prepare the meals as well. It's a busy, crowded place with fast moving servers and a fast moving line so not the place for a relaxing lunch but if you're just looking for good noodles, I'd recommend it!"
2/3/2015,20150203,4,4.23,"The short of it:- udon restaurant- hand made udon noodles- unique menu items- small/cramped restaurant in Little Tokyo- reasonable pricing- Favs: uni udon; soft boiled egg, and shrimp tempuraThe long of it:So this place is the closest I will ever get to getting pretty delicious udon in LA. The only udon place that blows me away is sadly in Hawaii. This place is definitely quite popular and the crowds show it. Arrived here on a Saturday afternoon after the lunch rush, around 3pm, but this place was still packed! Luckily even though their were 8 parties ahead of us the wait wasn't that long since there were a lot of parties that just got crossed off the list since they weren't present when their name was called. Oh well, your loss is my gain. We were seated in cramped area, but couldn't do much about it. I ordered the duck udon with a soft boiled egg, tempura shrimp and a pumpkin tempura. The fiance ordered the uni udon based on the overwhelming yelp reviews. I liked my duck udon, good flavor and I love duck. The soft boiled egg was the best part, it was actually a tempura soft boiled egg! So awesome and perfectly yolky inside. The uni udon blew my duck udon out of the water though. It was so good, but I could see how it can get a bit much with all the creaminess. It was good that we got different dishes so we could cleanse the palate a little with some broth when the uni udon got too rich. I really wish there was an udon place like this closer to home, but at least I had the chance to try it and if I'm ever in the area I'd definitely go back!"
2/3/2015,20150203,5,4.23,"Great fresh made Udon noodles, definitely the best I've had in Los Angeles. As many people have noted, its fun to watch the guy making the noodles by hand at the bar while you eat."
2/5/2015,20150205,5,4.23,"Got the mentai squid udon and shrimp tempura udon. Both were excellent. The mentai squid had a creamy, seafoody, really unique broth and the shrimp tempura was solid. The fresh noodles are the best part - flavorful, chewy with a nice bite. The soft boiled tempura egg and the tempura eggplant were good sides too."
2/6/2015,20150206,4,4.23,All my friends told me to go eat here and try their uni cream udon.So today i went with my boyfriend this afternoon for lunchI had uni cream udon my boy had a miso carbonara udonOn the side we ordered fried boild eggs and nigitoro bowl.I realllly liked nigitoro some tuna bowl it is so small it did not fill me up at all. Nxt is uni cream udon. Personally i love uni. But i guess not udon. Haha lol it was too greasy for me.. I think im going to try others nxt time. This place is located right nxt to daikokuya ramen place. Parking is sucks.. street parking or public parking. I paid for my public parking $8 ughhhh...!
2/6/2015,20150206,3,4.23,"I guess the appeal is fresh made Udon noodles....honestly I couldn't taste the difference!They had pretty friendly service, but also stuck to their guns by not letting us sit down until our entire group had arrived (we had 3 out of 4). This was a little awkward because there were plenty of open tables, and since the entrance is narrow we were in everyone's way who came in. As for the food, the menu had many tempting options with lunch specials on the back. I ordered the seaweed Udon with the Negitoro Bowl (fatty tuna chopped topped on rice). My Udon was exactly that. Udon with a swarm of seaweed. The broth tasted of the ocean. (You literally get what you ask for). The Negitoro Bowl was delicious, I'd recommend it! (Only $4 for the lunch special).My friends'/the other customers' Udons all looked great. One unique item they have it the tempura soft-boiled egg. That's pretty neat! They also have cold udon, which I've never seen. The location is nice. I'd come back to try some of their other items."
2/6/2015,20150206,4,4.23,"This place is good. I've been here about 4 times and each time I go, I leave satisfied. I've tried mentai squid, some cold one, and some fatty pork one. I like both the mentai and the cold one, but I'd never get the pork one ever again. Pork should probably be left for ramen."
2/7/2015,20150207,4,4.23,"Packed, packed, packed. This place is definitely not for large groups. This place is more of a lunch-on-the-weekday-with-a-friend place. I went with a group of 8 last night and we needed to split into 2 tables after 30+ mins of waiting.This was my second visit and it was more negative than neutral. A little drama because our whole party wasn't there and the servers didn't mind to show their irritation. The food was delicious though. Stay with the udon. Someone got the rice bowl and the kushiage and it honestly wasn't up to par with the udon. The mentai, tomato cream, and regular soup udon deserve the yelp comments... I dropped a 2 foot udon noodle last night.. It was the greatest regret of the year for me."
2/7/2015,20150207,4,4.23,"I got the Uni Pasta, with appetizers [Chicken Skin & clams] while my friend ordered the bacon carbonara. Oh my goodness, the food was really heavy and flavorful. It was delicious but you can BET money that you will have food coma!!!!!! Next time I go here, I will probably split a pasta and order appetizers. The clams were nothing special so don't order them. If you like crispy and chewy in your mouth, def. get the chicken skin."
2/8/2015,20150208,5,4.23,I like to come here for special occasions. The noodles are chewy and delicious. If I want good udon this is the only place that comes to mind.
2/11/2015,20150211,4,4.23,Love the taste of the signature uni based udon dish. It'd prob be a 5 but it's pricey for what it is/how much you get and the wait is long usually. Soft-boiled egg is $1.50 lol. Speaks for itself...
2/12/2015,20150212,3,4.23,"It was around noon and already fully packed. And the customer were keep coming.Good hand-made udon.Portion sizes are big enough. Marugame Monzo offers a LARGE selection of udon. Some are very interesting innovations, such as creamy uni udon and the mentai squid butter udon."
2/14/2015,20150214,4,4.23,this was my second time here this time was better than my first experience..the negitoro app was greatbeef carpaccio- meh not flavorful enough and toughclam hot soba- very good
2/14/2015,20150214,5,4.23,Just tried their place in Torrance. Its in the Nijiya shopping center. The best udon I've had since having hand made udon in japan on shikoku. Not cheap for noodles. Get the plan udon and a side of tempura. We've been their twice in 3 weeks. We'll be going back. It's worth it if you want the real stuff.
2/15/2015,20150215,4,4.23,"After hearing good reviews about this place, my friend finally took me here and all I have to say is Monzo, you just gained a loyal customer. ParkingFinding street parking might be difficult but there's parking right across the street ( roughly $4 ). If you don't mind walking a little then there's validation parking at Office Depot. All you have to do is park there, walk about 5 minutes to Monzo, grab something small after from Yogurtland or Starbucks to get validation, and you're parking is free!Special UdonI ordered the Mentai Squid Butter udon $12.95 with deep fried egg $1.50 and pumpkin tempera $1. The portion they had was pretty good. If you have a small stomach like me, you'll have some delicious leftovers to take home. My friend ordered the Sea Urchin Creamy Udon $15.95 and immediately that became my favorite. It has a creamier sauce than the Mentai Squid Butter but its worth the try! ServiceI went around 4:40pm on a Sunday and we got lucky there was no wait. However, within 15 minutes a line started to form outside. The place is really small so I suggest going with a small group of 2-4."
2/15/2015,20150215,4,4.23,"Holy cow. This place is awesome! I came without much expectation because I've never heard of this place until I actually dined here. I had no idea what the fuss was all about...until now. This restaurant is basically located at Little Tokyo. If you've been here, then you know the parking situation. So be prepared!First off, they don't seat your group unless everyone in your party is here. The wait wasn't that bad for us though. We were waiting for the rest of our party, but when everyone arrived, we got a table pretty quickly. I ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon since this is one of their signature dishes and everyone is crazy about it. So, why not? But now I know. It's absolutely delicious! The Sea Urchin was so creamy. That sauce got me good and it's so good. It had both actual uni pieces along with the cream sauce. The udon was also very very good. It was a good chewy, it was smooth, it was handmade!! The only down side is that it could get tired of the sauce just because it's so thick and creamy. It could be a little too much after sipping on that sauce the whole meal. I was very satisfied with my meal here. It is a little pricey considering that it is Sea Urchin, but it's so worth it. I would definitely come back for more next time I am around. I highly recommend this place!!"
2/15/2015,20150215,5,4.23,The hype is realI don't like to step outside my house but the traffic/wait was well worth it.
2/17/2015,20150217,5,4.23,"Parking sucks, but it's DTLA so I can't say much about that.Came here for a Valentine's Day dinner and it was surprisingly not as packed as I was expecting, given the Yelp warnings. There were around 7-8 parties of two before us, and we ended up maybe waiting for half an hour. Luckily, Little Tokyo is a fun area to explore so you can kill time by just walking around!We got lucky and got seats right with a front row view of the udon-maker. I could have watched him for hours. That level of precision and authenticity is hard to find in LA, and really makes you appreciate the meal that much more. I got the Mentai Squid Butter udon and my date the Mentai Squid Cream udon. Both were delicious (I preferred mine just because his soup was a little too thick, but if you're into that texture I'd highly recommend it). The noodles are thick and chewy, probably the best udon I've had outside Japan. The service was great and they even gave each of us a little pink bag of chocolates with our bill!My only complaint (not really a complaint, more a comment) is that the portions aren't as large as I would have liked. I'm a girl with a small stomach and I was really satisfied afterward, but you know...it would've been nice to have some leftovers. :)"
2/17/2015,20150217,3,4.23,"We were intrigued by handmade udon, so decided to give Monzo a try.The creamy uni is interesting ($16). It's very much like a fettucine alfredo. But Japanese style, I suppose. It reminds me of something that Tribeca Grill would serve in New York (Japanese-Italian). It is very rich, however, so I would share udons with someone who got something lighter. (My sister and I also shared a beef udon ($12)). In the end, however, I don't think the handmade stuff is all that it is cracked up to be. Call my palate un-discerning, but I couldn't tell the difference between hand and machine made (perhaps this is a testament to machine-made noodles?)Don't stress about the line--it moves faster than Daikokuya! (Full disclosure--We came to the area originally wanting to go to Daikokuya. Then we saw a huge line outside Monzo and were like ""good thing we are not going there"". So then we put our name down at Daikokuya, but noticed that Monzo line was disappearing a lot faster. So after fifteen minutes of waiting at Daikokuya, we put our name down at Monzu, and were seated in five minutes. If we had originally gone to Monzo before waiting at Daiko, we would have been seated way beforehand)."
2/17/2015,20150217,5,4.23,"Homemade udon definitely tastes different from what you're buying frozen in the store! They make all of their noodles fresh and to be honest, everything here is solid. My faves include the uni pasta (if you're looking for something rich and creamy) and the kitsune udon (for the typical broth udon). If you have a large group, get some extra sides and share everything I say! :) The rice bowls are all great (pork belly and negitori are my faves). If you need a little extra umph in your broth, ask for a side of chili oil... Otherwise, the spice on the counter is good too. If you don't have a group and can't make up your mind, check out their lunch combos which give you a rice bowl AND udon option. Bon Apetit!"
2/18/2015,20150218,5,4.23,"Do yourself a flavor. Don't even think about coming here, there's nothing to think about, it's amazing! The wait is a good 45m, so come put your name on the list and go grab drinks, otherwise you'll be super pissed off waiting that long. Can't go wrong with the beef udon. Every sit/bite was delicious, and udon is made on the premises! Treat yo' self and come here."
2/19/2015,20150219,4,4.23,"Finally tried this place. It is very good. I had the creamy uni udon and hubby had the tomato based soup udon . We also ordered the addition of soft boiled egg and tempura octopus. This I think was not worth it. For I think $1.50 you get 1 soft boiled egg lightly fried tempura style. And the octopus was very small and it was also fried tempura style for $2.50, I think. Sorry forgot the prices, but know that it was not worth it. We also tried the fried chicken skin. Although this is a good appetizer, I think they should have served the sauce on the side. Because the chicken skin lost it's crispiness when served. Over all I would definitely come back and try the other items on the menu."
2/20/2015,20150220,4,4.23,"The noodles are so good - firm and chewy yet still take on the flavor of the broth/sauce. Each noodle was the same thickness and it was cooked perfectly! Watching them make it fresh was so fun.Mentai squid butter - buttery but not too rich. The squid in the dish was superb!Curry - would recommend. Its thick and rich and is perfectly balanced out by the noodles.Miso Carbonara - super rich and creamy. I enjoyed it, but it was too heavy for my taste. Tempura appetizer/side - yum! The tempura egg I got was cold which was disappointing. Don't know if that's how all of them are or if I just got unlucky.Good quality food with great service!"
2/21/2015,20150221,5,4.23,"Udon heaven. Their variety of choice is amazing from traditional to Italian fusion. I wish it weren't so crowded every time I go. You gotta prepare yourselves to wait a bit. But if you're with great friends waiting for great food, it's really no biggy, right? It's crowded because they're delicious! I love the vongole udon!! What a great idea. Their appetizers are amazing, too. Everything is really yummy. Parking sucks but it sucks mostly everywhere in Little Tokyo so whatevs."
2/21/2015,20150221,5,4.23,"handmade udon noodles-- can't get any better than this, folks!"
2/22/2015,20150222,5,4.23,"Was in LA for business last week and had a window of free time to roam in Little Tokyo. I stumbled upon this place for lunch and have no idea why I was drawn to it as the outside storefront was innocuous. Once inside, I was pleasantly surprised.So how can one go wrong with an establishment that makes its own udon noodles? You can't! So fresh, cooked perfectly -- firm and chewy. I did not realize until after I ordered that MM is known for its eclectic preparation of udon which was abundantly clear by the people around me ordering the creamy uni udon and other unusual looking noodle dishes. In any case, I ordered something simple: wakame udon soup with a side of shrimp tempura. The broth was deep and flavorful... but oh those house made noodles! They were indeed the shining star. While I cannot speak to the more popular dishes that everyone seems wild about, I will say that I will definitely return on my next trip to LA!"
2/23/2015,20150223,5,4.23,I have a soft spot for anything with noodles and Monzo will definitely be my go to place for same fantastic udon!Kakiage Rice Bowl - Come here for a lunch special and get this delicious bowl for a meager $3 with a full udon bowl. The kakiage was piled super high over a bowl of rice and had scallops and shrimp. It was hard finishing it along with my udon but this was so worth it. Other patrons asked about what it was when it was brought out!Chicken Tempura Udon - The udon and broth did not disappoint. It felt super cool sipping the deliciousness with a huge wooden ladle. The broth was not too salty and was super comforting on a rainy day in LA. The chicken tempura itself wasn't that great though and I could probably skip. I've definitely had better tempura at Hannosuke in West LA.Wakame Seaweed Udon - There's a lot of seaweed in here and it definitely changes the taste of the broth. I thought it was ok but I'd rather have mine without the seaweed.Definitely a recommend!
2/23/2015,20150223,5,4.23,"Amazing! I've had my share of uni pastas at different places but the uni udon here was still so unique and absolutely wonderful. The flavor is very full-bodied and creamy but not so rich that I can't polish a bowl off on my own. The texture of the udon noodles was great with the perfect chewiness. I also was a huge fan of their kara-age (fried chicken). It was perfectly fried, juicy inside, and the mayo/curry powder dip they give you is very yum (a little goes a long way).Service was fine overall from the two times I went and the waiting times were not bad for non-peak times."
2/23/2015,20150223,5,4.23,"This place is so delicious and amazing. Pretty decent service despite it being very crowded. Shared the scallop carpaccio which was amazingly fresh and ordered the uni udon. I wanted to cry over how delicious it was. Its really creamy, buttery, and filled with so much uni!! :)"
2/25/2015,20150225,5,4.24,"Hands down!I think I just found the best Udon in Los Angeles.I came here for dinner on a Friday night with the boo. Luckily, there was no wait! The hardest part was choosing what to order cause everything on the menu looked so goooooood.After much thought and deliberation with the boo, I decided to order the Shrimp Tempura Udon with the soft boiled egg tempura and he ordered the Miso Carbonara Udon with the soft boiled egg tempura as well. We both enjoyed our udon... as what I said earlier, THE BEST in LA. Another thing I loved about Marugame Monzo, is that you can see the noodles being made.I highly recommend this place!"
2/25/2015,20150225,5,4.24,"I am not a big udon fan but this place changed me. I discovered my love for udon after trying this place. Theres actually a guy who continuously makes udon noodles through a glass window. My favorite from the Hot Udon section would be the Kakuni udon (braised pork belly). The noodles, broth, and pork belly is flawless. For the Signature Udon section I've tried : Sea Urchin Cream, Seafood Tomato Cream, and the Gratin. All of them great. Sauces are a bit on the heavier side (a plus in my opinion)! They do not skimp on any of the ingredients used for the Signature Udons. Other than the udons (all great) I've tried the Beef tataki & Chicken soshi and I would recommend skipping those. Beef tataki is beautiful visually but the taste was a little off-putting. Chicken soshi is chicken with grated ginger, literally. The place is very small with limited seating but it's worth the wait. Right next door to Daikokuya."
2/26/2015,20150226,3,4.23,"I've eaten here a few times, love the kitsune udon.  The uni udon is too rich for me. I enjoy watching the man make the noodles, the staff is friendly, but sometimes the wait is too long. The menu is large, and the staff isn't that helpful on what to order. And last time, our waitress got a few things wrong on our order."
2/28/2015,20150228,1,4.23,"After waiting here over an hour on a rainy Saturday night, we go inside to find out they already called our name, and to top it off, the woman ""courteously"" told us we would have to put our name at the bottom of the list and start over. Yeah I know that wry Japanese smile. I'm Japanese after all, don't give me that..Seriously make us wait in the rain and then tell us too bad come some other night? A little respect would have been nice. I would expect more from my fellow Japanese. One star, will never be back."
2/28/2015,20150228,4,4.23,"Ever since moving to California I've been searching high and low for an authentic udon place like Soba-Ya in Manhattan (by far the best udon I've tried in the U.S.). Marugame Monzo comes very close!I had the Wakame udon and the broth was pure dashi heaven, made entirely from konbu and bonito without added MSG, soy sauce, chicken broth or whatever. As a result, the entire bowl went down so comfortably. The noodles were just the right thickness and texture, slightly chewy and al dente.This is better than Udon Miguzo in San Francisco's Japantown, which falls short of being a true go-to place for authentic udon."
3/2/2015,20150302,4,4.23,"UNI UDON. I came here on a Sunday after the Firecracker Run in Chinatown. The shop had just opened for 3 minutes and we got the last table before the first wait. YES!I ordered the uni udon and it was delicious. It was creamy and like most have said already, not too fishy. I wish there were more or bigger pieces of uni though. My bf got the Negitoro bowl and I got a small bite of it. It was good. He enjoyed it.Although the place was tiny, it was really good and I'm so glad I didn't have to experience the super long wait. Get the uni!"
3/3/2015,20150303,5,4.23,Ahhhhhhh seriously SOOOOO GOOD. MUST TRY. Haha - let's just start it off like that.Uni udon - creamy delectable taste of absolute uni paradise. It wasn't overdone in the least. MENTAI SQUID BUTTER UDON is what you MUST order. Squid dishes are hard to master - they either come out too chewy or tasting super squiddy. Hahaha - you know what I mean. This squid just dissolves into your palate and all that goodness zings the taste receptors in your brain with a KAPOW! Try it. The broth definitely balances the buttery goodness of the squid.Chicken Skin - Nice and crisp - exactly what I expected.Service was awesome. :)MUST GO BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN!
3/4/2015,20150304,5,4.23,"After coming back from Japan this was one of the first places that seemed on par with what I could get in the mother country. Even on a late weeknight there's a decent wait. We ended up sitting up at the counter and getting to watch the Udon noodles being made by hand and see the rush of the line and expediting at the same time. Uni cream udon, mentaiko squid udon, pork belly, and tempura fish were the meal. So goof all around. The quality of the noodles, broths and everything was excellent down to every last bite. Getting to watch the work being done was pretty cool too. I even got to use some of my basic Japanese to order and such. Anyone waiting in that crazy line next door is totally missing out on this place."
3/4/2015,20150304,4,4.23,"UDON fanatic unite!1.Food:A) Udon: The noodles are freshly made and they have many different flavorsB) Tempura Fried egg: Really good and the yolk was still runny!2. Decor: Clean and simple, very Japanese looking restaurant. 3. Price: Slightly more expensive.4. Service: Service is good, but it gets pretty pack in this tiny restaurantThis is a more specialty restaurant and if you like udon and/or Japanese food I always recommend this place."
3/4/2015,20150304,4,4.23,"Ordered the Uni Udon, which was delicious! Very creamy and a bit heavy, but good nonetheless. I was hoping for actual pieces of Uni, but for that price I guess it's understandable. A girl can dream right... I also ordered the mini mentai rice bowl. Yummy too! The rice and udon made me perfectly full. I might have fallen into a food coma afterwards, but I'm blaming it on the carb overload. The wait for two wasn't too bad around 1130AM on a Sunday, but when I left there were sooooooooo many people waiting. Next time I'm getting the Egg too, looks amazeballs."
3/5/2015,20150305,4,4.23,"I came here last Saturday afternoon and was seated after 30 minutes. Since the restaurant is located in Little Tokyo, we just walked around the shops in the plaza across the street. When we got back, we were seated about 5 minutes later. The waitress sat us an a table next to a pillar. The tables are very close together and there's only a small gap for you to slip through to get to seat against the wall. We shared the Sea Urchin Cream Udon and the Udon Gratin. We ordered two cream based udons, which was mistake because the creaminess got a little overwhelming. Nevertheless, the Sea Urchin Cream Udon was sooooooo delicious. With the prefect ratio of uni and cream. The fresh udon noodles are the best I've ever had. The Udon Gratin was good. It reminded me of the udon version of mac and cheese. This restaurant offers the best udon I have ever had. I recommend this place to anyone who loves uni and udon."
3/5/2015,20150305,4,4.23,"All the names of the dishes sound amazing, but does it live up to its hype?- presentation 5- combination of ingredients 5- taste of food 3.5i think when you actually taste the food, its not as great as it sounds or looks. they need to add more pepper or some kind of flavoring or spices. the ingredients dont come together. its sorta tastes bland after bite after bite. doesnt make me want to keep eating it till the end. this is coming from someone who is japanese and has tried these types of ingredients on an everyday basis so i think im making a pretty legitimate statement. even the person who i came here with agreed with me on giving this place NOT a 5.i think they have potential as a restaurant, but they need to experiment more with the ingredients. i think a 3 would have been more suitable for the food quality, but because of their food concept, i will give them a 4."
3/7/2015,20150307,4,4.23,"Visited this place last week and stood in line for lunch on a weekend for a good 30-45 min. I was so excited given the number of rave reviews on this place. My husband ordered the Uni udon (with the plan of sharing hehe because I am not so brave myself) and I ordered the duck udon. Service is prompt at this place despite the initial wait! Our dishes arrived in 5 minutes. The decor in the main restaurant dining area and the bathroom is simple but modern. Long story short, my husbands Uni udon was creamy rich and delicious! My duck on the other hand was not. The broth in my bowl was clean, light and my udon noodles the perfect texture. We wind up taking my udon noodles out of my bowl and mixing it with my husband's extra Uni sauce hehe. I loved it but husband said that he has had better Uni before. This place is unique; I would check it out!"
3/8/2015,20150308,5,4.23,"Damn it. I should've sat at the bar. The rule of thumb is to ALWAYS SIT AT THE BAR, PEOPLE. I missed out on some good udon making action that night. I came in with my mom on a Wednesday night, 9pm. I paid a flat fee of $4 to park at the parking lot across the street. The restaurant was packed and for a second I was scared because I thought the line for Daikokuya was for this. Thank god it wasn't. Monzo is behind Daikokuya, fyi. Still, it was a 30 minute wait. My mom ordered the tempura chicken udon and I ordered the mentai squid butter udon. Despite my unhealthy habits, I also trusted my gut (get it?) and ordered the tempura chicken skins. Even though my mom has skyrocket-cholesterol levels, she couldn't resist the chicken skins. My mom's udon came with two pieces of perfectly fried, lightly battered chicken breast. We both enjoyed our dishes. The udon wasn't the best I've ever had (it didn't reach my chewiness/bounciness/QQ threshold), but it was certainly pretty good. That mentai squid butter sauce though. Briny but comforting and not excessively heavy. VERDICT: Check this place once and see how you like it. It was definitely worth the drive, but I can't say I'm suffering from cravings at the moment."
3/10/2015,20150310,5,4.23,this place is amazing! try the sea urchin udon. It's delicious!
3/11/2015,20150311,3,4.23,"My friend suggested this place after we had attended a Hello Kitty workshop at the museum on a rainy Sunday afternoon. She was telling me that this place is known for their uni udon and people's Yelp reviews also mentioned the same.Uni udon it is! The first couple sips of the creamy broth were tasty, then the broth started to ""harden."" My favorite part about this dish would be the texture of the udon. You can really feel the al-dente-ness of the noodles. However, for almost $16, I expected more uni, instead of the 4 booger-sized pieces of uni.After all that's said and done, I'd probably come back again and try one of their regular udon soup, but no thanks to their uni udon."
3/11/2015,20150311,5,4.23,"If it is your first time here. Your must try the Uni Udon. My bf tried to be all different and try something else, and my friends got something else, but in the end they all loved mine the best. The other is not like is not good, do not get me wrong, but if Uni udon was right there with it. I'm sorry Uni get the gold trophy. :)"
3/12/2015,20150312,4,4.23,"Huge bowls of udon! I came to Little Tokyo with a friend around 1pm on a weekday with the hopes of scoring a seat at Daikokuya. Since there was a line (no surprise), we sauntered over to Marugame Monzo, and we were seated immediately. I ordered the beef udon and we sat at the bar. You can watch the chefs slice the udon right in front of you!As for the food, the broth was flavorful, and a little sweet. There was so much udon in that bowl, I couldn't finish it. I don't know how anyone could order a double portion of udon. They also give you a very generous portion of thinly sliced beef and green onions. The only thing that could improve this would have been an egg, which is sold as an add-on. Boo! Otherwise, I was deeply satisfied."
3/12/2015,20150312,4,4.23,"I had the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon ($13) with a small Hakutsuru sake ($6). This made for one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My only gripe is that they didn't have any other selections of 180 mL sake. I would have loved a Hakkaisan, but since I dined alone, 300 mL and $18 seemed like overkill.The sauce of the udon was deliciously creamy. Such a balanced flavor-- sweet and salty and umami-- wow! The texture of the handmade udon was just right-- bitey but not chewy, supple but not too firm.On a Wednesday night at 9 pm, I waited about five minutes for a table. Service was prompt and courteous but not overly friendly. I would love to come back here to explore some of their other udon dishes. Compares well to my favorite handmade udon restaurant, Fukada in Irvine. But the menu here is more creative and varies, much less utilitarian."
3/13/2015,20150313,4,4.23,"Absolutely delicious food for a pretty good price! Little cramped and a little bit of a language barrier, but overall nice restaurant. It's a nice touch to be able to see into the kitchen and watch them make the udon noodles from scratch and prepare your food!"
3/13/2015,20150313,5,4.23,"I came here with my girlfriend and her cousin on a Saturday night. Wow there was a long wait to get in. We waited for about 40-45 mins. It was way worth it though! We even got to sit in front of the windows where you get to see them make the pasta! The portions are huge too, and for an appetizer, we got pork belly and it was delicious! I would so go here again and wait in the long line!"
3/14/2015,20150314,4,4.23,"House made udon noodles (which you can see through a glass window)... Need I say anything else?The place is located next to Daikokuya on 1st street so there is an unusually large crowd in front. I always go with the conviction to try the uni pasta but some how always get something else. Maybe the Yelp reviews about it being too creamy to finish affected me? Anyway, I've had a lot of the traditional udons here and the mentai squid butter. The udons are clean and refreshing and the consistency of the noodles are great. The mentai squid butter is very light and doesn't leave you with food coma symptoms. The squid is tender and not rubbery and is a very mild dish so it doesn't have an overwhelming flavor. The wait has never been too bad when I've gone but to be safe, I always add my name to both Daikokuya and Marugame to increase my chances to eat sooner haha."
3/14/2015,20150314,5,4.23,"lives up to the hype...got the uni and mentai squid, both were excellent.highly recommended"
3/15/2015,20150315,4,4.23,"Great Udon, Great experrence. Only trouble is not really their fault...it's just so popular that on weekends, at least, we have to wait a bit for a table and there's really little room to wait. But, still, it's well worth the wait."
3/15/2015,20150315,5,4.23,Yes. Their udon noodle is worth trying. Felt bad for a guy making noodles by hands. It looks like hard demanding work but he might get a good workout from it:) I tried Ume cold udon and it was pretty good. Tempura was really good and kitsune udon was classic. Wait is not so bad - since they brings out food super fast and people eat super fast so turnaround is fairly quick!
3/17/2015,20150317,5,4.23,"NOT overrated. First, I've never had Sea Urchin Cream Udon before this...and if I'm going to have Sea Urchin ""uni"" Cream Udon ever again after this experience, I will have an extremely high expectation. I can't believe it took me so long to try this!=FOOD=The SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON is amazing! The udon noodles are all handmade, and if you're lucky enough to sit at the bar, you'll be able to witness udon in the making. The first sips of Uni Udon soup feels like you've actually died and gone to heaven. It's rich, creamy, silky, and so full of uni flavor. Imagine uni blended and juiced. You have to eat/drink this when it arrives. After time, the soup films over and gets a little thick. At the end, I could not even finish it because it was too rich! There are a decent amount of uni pieces, but as an uni fan, I wish there were more! It's a little pricey for a bowl of udon...but I think it's worth it!The BEEF TATAKI was pretty good too. It's a cold meat dish that had a very nice and fresh feel. Since the udon was so rich and creamy, I found myself reaching for these thinly sliced pieces of the beef tataki quite often. It's made perfectly with good flavor and is pretty much rare beef in the center. The little garnishes on top added just the right amount of taste to go along with the tender meat. =PARKING&RESERVATIONS=If you have a large party, make sure everyone is present, and to call ahead to check out wait times. They don't take reservations! Also, there's metered street parking, but I'm one of those lazy drivers so I always park in the public parking lot RIGHT ACROSS the street. On weekday evenings, it's usually pretty empty and ends up being $4-$6. Not too sure about weekends. =FINAL VERDICT=I'd say if you're in Little Tokyo and you're itching to have some delicious udon, THIS is the place you have to try this place! It's right next to Ramen Manichi (ALSO really good!!!)"
3/18/2015,20150318,5,4.24,"Maybe because we don't have restaurants like this in Montreal but this is definitely worth just to travel for. You can watch the chef make the fresh udon through a glass window.Broth is on point, not overly salty yet still flavourful.I believe I waited almost an hour to get in?I'd wait longer if i have to.This place is definitely underrated."
3/19/2015,20150319,5,4.24,"The udon here are freshly made; and hand made. They are chewy; and they are soft. They aren't just good; they are the BEST! I love their sea urchin cream udon. I thought it would be a waste to put sea urchin in soup coz I like to eat it raw with just a bit of wasabi............ but........... the cream soup here is so good with the briny flavor of the sea urchin. You got to try if you love sea urchin! I miss you, LA!!"
3/21/2015,20150321,4,4.24,"Negitoro bowl (fatty tuna) for $5.49 during lunch or $4 when ordered with udon. Great atmosphere and a kitchen that can be seen from the dining area. Overwhelming service that keeps asking if I needed water, appreciate it but maybe only when I ask for it."
3/22/2015,20150322,4,4.24,I've eaten here on several different occasions and I must say that the food here is really good. I've pretty much tried almost everything on the menu and highly recommend ordering two things.-the beef bowl and the pork bellybowl. they are small in size and is perfect as a mini appetizer. As far as entree goesI'd say they are all pretty good. They hand make their udon right in front and it tastes amazing. Only thing is for me is that when you order creamy pastas (e.g. uni pasta) it gets pretty repetitive and bland. Overall I've never had a bad experience with the quality of the food.Why this isn't a 5 star diner is the fact that the inside is really small and is a little uncomfortable to eat in here. The service isn't too great because they are so busy and will most likely have to wait in line before getting seated.
3/23/2015,20150323,5,4.24,"Even though we had to wait an hour to be seated, it was so worth it. we ordered the uni udon, pork belly udon, and scallop carpaccio. I recommend all 3 dishes, but the uni udon in particular. However, the uni udon got a little heavy for me, halfway through the dish. And my bf's pork belly udon became a little too salty halfway through.. So... We switched! Problem solved. The udon noodles were oh so perfectly chewy and delightful. I can't wait to go back! The seating is a bit uncomfortable because they try to cram too many tables and chairs right next to each other, but the servers are very accommodating, and sort of make up for it. Tip: you can order extra noodles"
3/24/2015,20150324,4,4.24,Marugame Mozo has some really great traditional Japanese Udon but also some very unique options like their Uni (sea urchin) Udon which is very rich but very tasty. All of the dished are very reasonably priced but be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour for a table! The food is worth the wait!

3/24/2015,20150324,4,4.24,"Fresh udon and tasty rice are sometimes all it takes to satisfy me. Marugame Monzo has both. I'm a huge fan of donburi. Also, I love chewy fresh udon but I try to stay away from dishes to regulate my carb intake level. Would I be able to resist Monzo though? No. Would I be willing to wait in line for more than 30 minutes? No - that's why I can't rate this place 5 starts. I usually go when they open to avoid the lines. It's a great spot to get that Japanese comfort food. I recommend sitting near the kitchen where you can see them making udon. I think eating their udon while watching the process made it taste even better."
3/26/2015,20150326,3,4.23,"Pricing: Good-Expensive. Do not expect cheap udon here!Quality: Good. Not a big fan of fusion.Turnaround: Good. Neither too slow or fast.Service: Good. Nothing to complain about.What happened to good ol' traditional Japanese udon? I guess I went to the wrong place, but I can live with trying new things. However, the pricing is reflective of the fancier cooking combinations and udon specially made in-house so be prepared with the wallet. I ordered the champon, one of the few traditional items they had and I have to attest, it actually does taste like home to the point where I wonder why I did not just go home and make it myself? Don't get me wrong; the champon was very good and done with the right flavors. I tried a little bit of my friend's Mentai Squid Butter and boy, was that interesting. The broth was super rich in contrast to the traditional light broths due to the butter. The squid was well-cooked as were the udon, but I am not the type who would enjoy this kind of fusion. The broth kind of overpowers everything and the heaviness detract attention from the udon's texture, which is something I was looking forward to since the udon is made in-house. Anyhow, the turnaround was adequate, feeling neither too slow or fast and likewise, I have nothing to complain about the service. They refilled waters frequently enough and took care of our check when we were read in a timely fashion."
3/28/2015,20150328,3,4.23,The shrimp tempura udon was very okay...it tasted pretty average but the noodles stood out. They were very fresh and you could see people making them in the kitchen. I would not recommend getting the kakiage bowl since it was basically a pile of fried stuff (onions?) on top of a bowl of rice. The only udon worth getting would probably be the squid butter udon. The soup for the squid butter udon was flavorful and had a unique taste to it that the shrimp tempura udon lacked.
3/28/2015,20150328,5,4.23,"Probably the best udon I've had. Since it's my first time here and I take my noodles seriously, I ordered the very basic udon with a light broth. It's definitely different from any regular udon I've had. Most udon noodles I've had has a thin, translucent, starchy coating, making them very slippery and the broth sometimes foggy. The udon here doesn't have the coating and the broth is clear. Noodles lean on the firmer side while it's fully cooked through the core. The tuna bowl is also very delicious."
3/29/2015,20150329,5,4.23,My favorite spot in little tokyo now. The udon is made fresh and you can taste the quality. I was in town for a conference so I went everyday (sometimes twice a day) for lunch. I'm trying to try everything on the menu and so far I haven't been disappointed. My favorite is definitely the sea urchin udon. The creamy soup is amazing; gave me a foodgasm. A close second favorite is the mentai squid. There is a line sometimes but the wait is nowhere as bad as a certain restaurant nearby with a yellow awning. The service is great too. Everyone is friendly and attentive. Shout out to Gie and Rie!
3/31/2015,20150331,5,4.24,I instantly fell in love with the uni udon! It is like the fettucini Alfredo of Japan. It was creamy and delicious with wonderfully chewy udon. I can see myself craving this all the time!
4/1/2015,20150401,4,4.24,Aww sweet my friend took me out for dinner. Yummy never tried undon. The broth was a little salty but still good. You can taste how fresh the noodles are and they taste good. Didn't get to taste the shrimp tempura but it looked really good you can order it as a side dish for I think 2.50 for two pieces.
4/4/2015,20150404,5,4.24,"Yummy!! I had the Mentai Squid Bowl after reading the reviews. Glad I did, it was delicious. Next time I'll try the Uni Bowl."
4/5/2015,20150405,4,4.24,"I've come here a few times and continued to order various things. I have to remove a star because my favorite dish--the Uni--has been noticeably not fresh the last handful of times I've gone. I keep thinking that maybe it's just a fluke but after my recent visit of having tasted uni that is noticeably rather danky, I've come the conclusion that they have really lessened their standards.Very upsetting :("
4/5/2015,20150405,4,4.24,"So yummy and fresh udon noodle soup! Kinda on the pricey side but the bowl of noodles are decent size. I couldn't even finish my portion. everytime my BF and i come here, we order the sea urchin cream noodle. and i always get the beef udon noodle soup. fresh made to order udon noodles. They even have a little window and you can see them making a fresh udon noodles in front of you while you wait for your food and eating! pretty cool! but the wait can get long. this is a really small hold in the wall next to Daikoya ramen. Be patient and wait to try this place! =]"
4/5/2015,20150405,4,4.24,It was a treat watching the udon being freshly made in front of us. The result was a firm and chewy udon that was cooked just right. The curry udon was a little salty for my personal taste. The ikura bowl could just with a small bit more of ikura. Otherwise it's a great meal.and I really enjoyed my udon.
4/6/2015,20150406,5,4.24,"Marugame Monzo is my absolute favorite udon place in Los Angeles. This isn't any ordinary udon, the flavor profiles of each soup dish is very unique and works very well. Uni Udon: Very creamy, but delectable! The first time I ordered this dish, it was too creamy for me to finish the entire bowl on my own, so I shared with friends, but in later visits, I had no problems finishing it all. The creaminess is equivalent to eating a fettucine alfredo.Mentai Squid Butter Udon: Lighter than the uni udon. If you love squid, you should definitely try this dish!Curry Udon: I was a bit skeptical at first, but I was surprisingly pleased by how this dish turned out. It's more than just curry with added udon. It's a bit thick, but it all works well and is very comforting on a cold night. Champon Udon: lots of vegetables and has a light broth. Probably my least favorite of all the other dishes I've tried.Soft-boiled egg lightly coated in tempura - I'm not a big fan of this egg. I usually love soft boiled eggs, but it was slightly over cooked--not as runny as I hoped. The tempura coating was very light, crispy and not oily--that was pulled off well!"
4/6/2015,20150406,5,4.24,"I finally got to see what the udon hype was about and I was pretty darn satisfied with everything here! The food, the service, everything was great, if only the restaurant was a little bigger. Sadly, it's a pretty small restaurant, you'll literally be a few inches away from the person sitting next to you and it makes you feel a little claustrophobic...of course this is out of their control so no star deductions there!My friends love this place and call it their favorite udon place so I've been wanting to try it out, so of course I would order their well known uni udon which was delicious. It was super creamy and rich, if you don't like creamy foods, I would probably steer clear of this dish. If you do though, this will be amazing! I wish there was more uni in it but I know that's asking a bit much. My boyfriend got the miso carbonara and he loved it, it was just as rich and creamy with a thick white sauce and a lot of bacon. He said it reminded him of italian food and he loved that. He also got a small beef bowl which was okay, he liked it but I wasn't a big fan. I order a side order of a soft boiled egg and it came out fried like tempura style which totally threw me off guard. It was interesting and yummy, but I think I would have preferred just a normal soft boiled egg, I wish they told me it would be fried. The egg was soft boiled perfection though, it amazes me every time I go to a Japanese restaurant, how perfectly the eggs are boiled!Our server was great as was just service in general. Everyone was very kind and helpful and you just don't get that kind of service anymore at a lot of places. It's amazing to see everyone smiling! It definitely improves the dining experience instead of having to see some angry worker hating their life. Being able to see the chefs hand roll and cut the udon is also a plus, I can't wait to come back to try more of their dishes!"
4/8/2015,20150408,4,4.24,I think I would give it five stars if the portion for super fulling cheese udon is smaller... It's worth trying tho it's really good. I would definitely come back soon.
4/9/2015,20150409,5,4.24,"Waited about an hour to get seated on a Sunday night. There were so many people standing outside! I tried the Uni Udon and it was freakin amazing! I shared half of it with a friend and it was very filling but I'm sure I could've eaten the entire thing myself because it was delicious! I literally wanted to lick the plate ... It was creamy and might be a little heavy so I'm glad I shared. And they make the noodles right in front of your face!!! How awesome is that?? The ambience of the place was nice, as well; the restaurant is small but it's cozy. If you have to wait, go walk around Little Tokyo or grab a boba at Four Leaf. There are so many little shops in the area. It's not too difficult to find free parking in Little Tokyo but you may end up walking a bit.Definitely going to come back here for more delicious udon goodness."
4/9/2015,20150409,5,4.24,"Best udon I have ever had state side. The noodles make all the difference. They make them fresh there, on the spot, in front of your eyes. They are soft, slightly chewy, and perfectly prepared (not soggy). What you put the udon in is also quite a variety, from traditional to creative. I've been here a few times, and I have tried the famed Uni udon, seafood udon, tomato udon, and yaki udon. All were great, though there could be a bit more uni or something else in the Uni udon. It's a bit lacking in content, but amazingly rich and so damn good you'll be thinking about it later in the day. I have not tried any appetizers... only udon!If you've tried udon but not been a fan, give it another try at this place! Great udon is tough to get, due to its thickness its tough to ship from factories that produce them without losing quality. Try this spot as they make them fresh!"
4/12/2015,20150412,2,4.24,"Unfortunately and unlike many of the other yelpers who left a review, I was not satisfied with the quality of service or food at this restaurant. As a food enthusiast, I have to say that this restaurant did not impress me. Let's start off with the menu, or don't and just leave before you are in too deep. Anyways, the menu was bare, had very little to offer and the deals included were quite confusing. For example, there is a rice and noodle deal, but my party consisted of eight people and I guess everyone at the table is required to order the same thing, such as 8 udons and 8 side rice bowls. So two people at the table got udon and rice bowls, but since they didn't order them in the right order (They ordered the rice first, then the udon), the deal wasn't valid. Then, there are the staff who seem rather negligent or just plain incompetent. We had a party of 8 and waited about 45 minutes for a table. When we were finally seated, a friend of mine ordered the rice bowl and they gave her udon beef. As if that is not bad enough, she asked for some soy sauce and was given 1/4 of a shot glass, which seems downright stingy. However, it did not end there. Apparently there are no substitutions, only 1 bill is allowed per table, you can only use 2 credit cards max, and there are no drink refills. Then, the sharing of your food with friends is looked down upon, which is just plain ridiculous. You would hope that maybe the food would make up for everything that is lacking, but it does not even come close. The beef is tender, but ultimately flavorless and the drink sizes are too small. When the bill came, my patience was put to the test once again. I did not want to give a good tip because of the poor service. However, a gratuity of 18% was included on the bill.I wasted far too much time and money here. Learn from my mistakes. Just do yourself, your friends and your family a favor by staying away from here."
4/13/2015,20150413,4,4.24,"Even though you notified Yelp HQ to take down one of my pics I posted for your establishment, I will not be biased reviewing you based on that. I will still give you a solid 4 star because I am just the honest yelper this side of the Heights! For those who want to know what picture it was, it was a selfie pic of Gigi M and myself.  I guess we had too many likes. But I'm so use to having most of my pics being deleted. Whatever...Moving on...Uni udon, I liked but Gigi M is the expert and uni udon lover. She said it was ok but she's had better. We ordered their fried chicken skin and it was definitely yummylicious, light & crispy crunchy!Chel had the mentai squid butter udon. Absolutely amazing flavors and hit my hongry spot that night. Udon was made fresh and cooked perfectly. Broth was saucy. They could've gotten more creamy but the flavors was bomb regardless. Everyone knows how I love all things creamy and buttery! But it was all good. I was happy at the end! Albeit we waited for thirty minutes before we were seated, we were perfectly fine since they allowed us to go down to the Far Bar to grab some drinks.Good come back after taking down my pics, yo!#hungry#thankful#pissed#off#GLOY#rules#always!"
4/13/2015,20150413,5,4.24,"Soooooooo yummy.Came here in a group. We all split the scallop carpaccio and crispy chicken skin. The scallops were delicious and creamy. The chicken skin was good, but I'm not a big fan of greasy fried stuff so it didn't really rock my boat. Between all of us, we ordered the squid butter udon, duck udon, regular udon w tempura, and chicken udon. Everyone loved their orders. The duck udon was a wonderful broth. The squid butter had a genuinely deliciously fishy taste. If you're into the smell of seafood, you'll love this. Unfortunately this one was served with the least amount of broth -- I had broth envy!Would definitely come here again. Everything is delicious and if you're with friends, an hour wait isn't too bad."
4/14/2015,20150414,5,4.24,"two words: uni udon. creamy, but not heavy, fresh udon goodness that is out of this world. i love it more than the ""famous"" place next door. and it's fun to take friends from places like Idaho or arkansas who don't have the luxury of fresh udon being stretched out in front of your eyes in a magical array of a show. doggone it, one said. but just be aware that they stop taking your name down at 9 pm. that seems insane to me when there are hoards of udon lovers willing to wait, even on weeknights. i haven't ever waited longer than 45 minutes though, even at peak dinner times on weekend evenings. maybe i've just been lucky."
4/16/2015,20150416,4,4.24,"A good handmade Japanese pasta. I always go for simpler, traditional types and they taste authentic to me. (I'm from Japan.) It's fun to watch pasta being made. My complaint is that now it's so popular and there is always loooong wait. I used to go there often, but now I tend to avoid just because of the wait. Too bad."
4/16/2015,20150416,5,4.24,"Im writing this review from Oomasa because there was a 30 minute line for it. Part of me wants to give it a bad review so the star count will go down and the line will be shorter next time I go, but then my karma will be bad even though I don't care about karma. Anyway, best Udon I've ever had and I've been going to Japan twice a year for 15 years now. I asked when their line is shorter and they said when they open at 5 so see you then!"
4/17/2015,20150417,4,4.24,"I've been here a couple of times but this time it really stood out, because I finally tried the sea urchin (uni) udon! Seriously if you don't try it then you'll just think this is a regular udon place. It's about $15 but completely worth it. The curry udon was alright but I wouldn't really recommend that. When you come to this restaurant, you should order one of their signature dishes. I tried the squid butter udon before but nothing really compares to the uni here! If you come around 5pm there probably won't be a wait at all! When we left around 6pm there was already a really long line. The only complaint I'd have about this place is that the portion for the uni is sorta small, so it didn't really fill me up completely. Also, they told us they don't offer extra udon.Parking is annoying here but it's lil tokyo so what do you expect. Park at the structure at 1st and San Pedro, probably the cheapest option out there!"
4/18/2015,20150418,4,4.24,"Surprisingly there's always a wait for ramen next door all days of the week, but not this place. The longest I've waited for a table here was about 15 minutes.It's a very small restaurant with maybe 10 tables or less and bar-type seating where you can watch the udon being stretched and cut. Don't come here with a large party, maybe four people max.I've been here a few times and only had their udon; the sea urchin udon, curry udon, and the mental squid butter udon. My favorite so far is the sea urchin udon because of its rich and creamy flavor, but it doesn't have a lot of uni in it. It's kind of like an alfredo sauce but even better with specks of uni throughout the sauce. The mentai squid butter was really buttery that you'll be smacking your lips together. I like curry but I didn't really enjoy the curry udon because I think curry is better with rice.They also have rice dishes and other items on the menu if you're not an udon fan.Service was descent, but they should be more attentive so they can turn over tables quicker for patrons waiting outside. Parking on the street or in paid lots."
4/18/2015,20150418,4,4.24,"Hand made udon noodles made right in front of you. You can order any kind of udon noodles from this place, they have a wide variety. If you like bacon, carbonara is the one to order. The only issue is the wait. It's a small restaurant so the line gets pretty long. Be prepared to see ppl waiting outside, but the wait is worth it!"
4/19/2015,20150419,4,4.24,"As a fan of noodle soup, I would def recommend checking out this udon place. It's right next to Daikokuya (which has awesome ramen) and I wouldn't be surprised if the competition's fierce -- the battle between udon vs ramen! Typically, both places has a long wait, so we put our name in for both and see which one calls us first (I'm sure we're not the first to do this). Anyway enough talk...let's get into the review:What I ordered:I don't usually get all fancy, so I ordered the beef udon. It has a very clean and light broth taste and the hand made noodles are amazingly al dente considering they're thicker noodles. My hub's ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon which was amazing as well, but a bit too creamy for me. Ambience:Clean and cute Japanese decor. There's a bar area where you can watch them make the noodles. It's a small restaurant so the seats are a bit cramped together but that's sort of expected of Japanese restaurants.Parking:It's DTLA so it's a bitch. You will either need to find street parking which is a rarity or park in a structure. Either option, you'll still need to pay to park. Service:Good service. They're attentive to your needs and are very polite.Price:Depending on what you order, you're probably looking at around $15-20 per person for a bowl of udon with tax/tip."
4/20/2015,20150420,4,4.24,"So much yum! I came here on Sunday with my aunt. Didn't do as much research as I could've, but having a 60 year old Japanese aunt with me seemed to be all the reassurance I needed. There were probably way more dishes I should have attempted to try but we were on tight stomach space, so I went for the beef udon. Surprisingly it was really amazing. I'm not sure what I was expecting growing up with udon and not being unfamiliar with it, but the in house noodles being made, the broth and the thin slices of beef were phenomenal. It was the perfect portion for my size. Might not be in enough if you have a generous stomach but I was satisfied. The noodles themselves combined with the broth was simply amazing in flavor to me. Or I was just really hangry. We parked near the Japanese history museum and walked over after visiting the museum. Service was just meh. 4 stars for the food, service was nothing outstanding. More of a sit you down and get you out as fast as possible. Also really small tables and booths. :( regardless I hope to be back as I was not disappointed with the food!"
4/20/2015,20150420,1,4.23,"Came here on a Sunday night and saw a lot of people waiting outside, so we thought we'd give it a try. The wait was about half an hour. Eventually we were seated. I tried the creamy sea urchin sauce udon, which the waitress recommended, while my fiancee tried the curry udon. Both left something to be desired. The sea urchin sauce seemed like a glorified alfredo sauce pasta (i.e., one of the simplest pastas to make), with just a tiny bit of urchin to flavor it. Other than that, it had the complexity of mac and cheese. I seriously did not expect it to be that plain. The curry udon had tons of curry and some pork belly - what are you supposed to do with that much curry? There seems to be an attempt at a fusion of cuisines, but the implementation just felt like just a couple ingredients slapped together. Pass. Also, here's a pet peeve: I'm against these sorts of menus where you're supposed to ""customize"" a dish, by nickel-and-diming yourself to death. If there's ingredients that go well with a certain dish, make that known; don't expect a customer to be the chef. Put together some recipe templates that customers like, and give that dish a nickname. In any case, I will not be back."
4/21/2015,20150421,5,4.23,"I've been here a couple times and luckily I never had to wait more than 15 minutes--and this was for a group of 6 so it was totally understandable. I really like the interior of Marugame because it's black and clean and looks good. In the back area you can see the chefs making the udon and I think that's really cool--although I never sat directly right in front of them so I could never really see it. Let me start of by saying that the udon here is all hand-made! This is probably the best udon I've had here in LA because its perfectly chewy and dense--love love love! Here are the dishes that I've tried:1) S E A  U R C H I N  C R E A M  U D O N:This is their most famous item on the menu and is also my favorite. The cream sauce is strong in flavor, and unlike most other uni dishes where the flavor of the uni gets masked and becomes bland, I can definitely taste the uni in this sauce--there are even visible bits and pieces of uni, YUM! However, I do want to point out that the first few bites is heavenly, but as you get near the end you might feel sick from the heavy cream sauce. But no worries! It's a mistake I make every time :P No ragrets. This will always be my go-to dish here at Marugame. 2) S H R I M P  T E M P U R A  U D O N: The soup base in this udon is much much lighter. I wasn't a big fan of the tempura being place inside the noodles because it got all soggy and isn't the point of tempura to be crispy? This would be a great option if you aren't feeling too hungry and want something easier to digest. 3) M E N T A I  S Q U I D  B U T T E R  U D O N:The mentai squid butter udon sauce definitely has a buttery texture and is also quite heavy. There are many pieces of squid and a lot of mentai--Marugame is really generous with their ingredients! I thought this dish was pretty good but I prefer other options on the menu. But this is definitely worth a try! 4) P O R K  B E L L Y  R I C E  B O W L:I love this! The pork belly is mixed with sesame oil and green onions, placed on top of the rice. The sesame oil makes the pork belly really flavorful and it's delicious! The only con I have for this dish is it's quite small in portion. I guess you're meant to eat this with one of the udon bowls but I can't eat that much :( for those of you with small-medium appetite this will definitely satisfy your hunger and not make you too too full, but for those of you with bigger appetite I suggest you to order something extra :)"
4/24/2015,20150424,5,4.23,"A good udon place that hand makes their noodles fresh. You can even watch them make it if you get seated at the bar. A great place to take friends from out of town, but seating is limited so be sure to come early. Tried their Uni Udon as I absolutely love Uni .... The first few bites were amazing, but heavy use of rich cream limited my Uni fix to just a few bites. My friend got Ume Cold Udon which was quite delicious. You can also order a small rice bowl for a few bucks with your choice of sushi/mentai/ or other topping. Really recommend the mentai. Lastly, don't forget to get a tempura egg for your udon. It is cooked perfectly with a soft creamy center and really tops off any dish."
4/25/2015,20150425,3,4.23,"Oh, it is right next to the original Daikokuya!Marugame Monzo is known for their uni udon and you can witness the popularity just by looking at how long the line is. Our group waited about 15 ~ 20 minutes before we got our seats. This place does NOT take reservation, so plan accordingly. If you are lucky enough to sit near the kitchen area, then you can see udon making process behind the glass window.Kakuni (braised pork belly, $6.50): It is your typical cubic-size pork belly. Other than somewhat interesting sauce (it was slightly sweet), I was a little bit disappointed with its tough texture. (2.5/5)Tataki beef ($12.95): Pretty good - beef was tender and flavorful (some of flavors came from peppercorn and relish). (4/5)Sea urchin cream udon ($15.95) + soft-boiled egg ($1.50) + kakiage (a kind of tempura, $2.50): To me, broth is the heart and soul for an excellent ramen bowl. However, noodle is the heart and soul for a great udon bowl. Yes, uni sauce was creamy and it was certainly tasty. but I thought noodles were a bit on firmer side than chewy side. Soft-boiled egg was good and kakiage was too much for me to handle. (3.5/5)It is a hit-and-miss restaurant and I don't think their overall food quality is worth half a hour wait. Personally, Oumi Sasaya in Lomita is a much better option for udon (yelp.com/biz/oumi-sasaya…)."
4/25/2015,20150425,4,4.23,I loved Marugame Monzo. We started with the beef tataki which was not bad but I couldn't eat a lot of it. What I really loved was the curry udon. I'm obsessed with curry and this dish didn't disappoint. Their udon is excellent. I also had some of the pumpkin tempura which was a great side to your entree. The wait is definitely there so arrive early.
4/26/2015,20150426,5,4.23,"I finally made it to Marugame Monzo! Hallelujah! Been dying to check this place out for a LONG time. Little did I know that it was located right next door to Daikokuya in Little Tokyo. I'm a ramen kinda girl, so my eye didn't wander elsewhere when in town last year. But, they should've!! MM has me made appreciate and see UDON in a whole new light. ""Marugame Monzo, you make my heart sing!"" You make fresh handmade al dente udon noodles. Just the right chewiness!If we sit at the noodle counter, we get to see your cooks in action through the glass window. There was a vast array of udon optionsHot or cold. Broth or no broth. Creamy or light! We were in udon heaven. Here's what we ordered: SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON ($15.95): the description of this creamy deliciousness was the reason we drove all the way up here. The creamy sauce had a hint of cheesiness with a taste of UNI in every bite (topped w/ salmon egg). Uni was a tad bitter. Dish leaned on the heavier side. But, we LOVED it and licked the bowl clean. BUKKAKE UDON (cold noodle w/ cold broth) with soft boiled egg: Everyone at the table next to us ordered this, so we had to try it. A cold udon sitting in a small amount of cold broth with a soft boiled egg and tempura shavings.. It was delightful and refreshing. And with these 2 ADD-ONs, this dish was MY FAVE: 1) JUMBO SHRIMP TEMPURA ($2.50); complemented this dish to the tee. As for its size, it's average and not so jumbo-ish. Left me wanting more 2) SPICY MENTAI COD ROE: salty and spicy, brought out UMPH to my bowl.  NEGITORO BOWL ($4): ""Smashed"" fatty tuna sitting on a slightly overcooked bed of rice with a nice balance of eel sauce, mayo, and green onions. It's gud! TID BITS: 1) Read the ""WAITING RULES."" You snooze, you lose. Gotta bring your ""A"" game here. ""No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."" 2) Small restaurant, expect to wait. Almost nonexistent waiting area. Prepare to stand outside. 3) Metered street parking OR parking structure that charges an arm and a leg (lunch $35, parking $10...WTH!)4) Modern and clean bathroom...I love Japanese bathrooms. 5) Friendly service, fast turn around.""Marugame Monzo, you make everything groovy!""Margugame Monzo, I think I love you!!""We will be back to try the Mentai squid butter udon. Until next time......"
4/26/2015,20150426,4,4.23,"Not normally an udon kind of guy but I gave into peer pressure. We were told we might not get a seat since it was near closing time. Our party was not all here yet but at the very last minute they came and we were the very last patrons of the night. Staff was extremely friendly, they kicked people out( in the nicest way possible) to make room for us and was still friendly even though we came at 9:56pm when their closing time is 10:00pm. So we get our food quickly and out comes the creamy uni udon! You call tell that the noodles are handmade when it comes to taste and texture. I'm a big fan of uni( it's like the butter of the sea) so I was excited to try the cream. The cream had a faint taste of uni and was just ok. The ikura roe balls saved the dish for me but I wish they gave more. The dish has no meat! I don't know what the big fuss was about for this dish.Jidori poached eggs were runny and a good size. But didn't have much of a taste.Udon gratin came out looking like a cheesy Italian pasta dish from Olive Garden. It was just cheesy( no pun intended).Seafood tomato udon was very flavorful and the squid was fresh tasting from the one bite I had.Overall food was 3.5/5 for what it is, the price, and the wait.Service was 5/5 , they even chased us down the block on the street when we left our leftovers! Excellent service that goes the extra mile."
4/26/2015,20150426,4,4.23,"this place never fails to satisfy our udon cravings! The wait is worth it. If the wait is ridic, get some drinks are far bar or walk around little Tokyo. There are shops and things to do around it."
4/26/2015,20150426,5,4.23,"Freshly made udon right in front of your face? That's how you know how everything is made from scratch at a restaurant and that they have nothing to hide! I've never really had to wait long when coming here, maybe I get lucky and beat the rush."
4/27/2015,20150427,5,4.24,"It rained. Yes, it actually rained in LA. So plans were changed and rather than attending another art show from the current one, I decided to spend my money on a meal than an admission fee!A foodie friend recommended this place to me I was stoked! Here's what I came for:UNI (SEA URCHIN) CREAM UDON SOUP - $15.95Order this if you love: - Uni--I mean GOOD uni - Creamy rich food - Noodles, like udon - To be happyThis wonderful bowl of rich, creamy delightfully good stuff made me so happy.  I know its the most expensive thing on the menu, but its worth it. Not only do you get fresh hand made udon noodles (you can watch them through a glass window), its served with uni! That is rare to me. The creamy bowl not only served with tiny chunks of uni, but you will have a small pile of salmon roe--WOOT! I counted 8 in mine :) It's quite rich and be sure to save any leftovers because it is good with bread when you bring it home! Don't let that sauce go to waste! I see this as the creamy Fettuccine Alfredo on the menu. You get to eat with this awesome wooden spoon, too!NEGITORO BOWL - $5.45Fatty Tuna hopped with green onions over rice. Sweet sauce with mayo.I mean, doesn't all that up there sound delicious? Cuz it was. Everything about his rice bowl was amazing. Just trust me and order it.I came here on a rainy day with a friend Saturday afternoon, so the line wasn't terrible. It was maybe a 15 minute wait. Lucky us! Eating here made my day!"
4/28/2015,20150428,4,4.23,I wanted to try this udon place for sometime now. I love sanuki udon so I was really excited I got to try it today. For sanuki udon the koshi or the texture of the noodle is really important so it's always best to have it cold. I had the hanjuku tamago bukkake. It was very good. The texture I was looking for was there. It didn't fail. The tsuyu was perfectly blended. I guess I've found my udon place but I would have to try their hot udon before I declare that this is my favorite udon place. They have Italian udon menus everyone's raving about. I'll try them next time!
4/28/2015,20150428,5,4.24,"Went here while staying in Downtown LA with my girlfriend. We wanted somewhere to eat without waiting too long. We got seated right away at the bar, which I highly recommend! You can see them making the udon fresh right in front of you. If you can wait for a seat at the bar, do it for the experience. Its better than just getting a table IMO. Our food came out quicker and service was great!For appetizers we got the Scallop Carpaccio and the Fried Chicken Skin! Bomb! Definitely recommend both. Goes well with their draft Asahi! We got the Uni Cream Udon Soup, the Squid Butter Udon. Make sure to add on the soft boiled egg to both and ask your server what they recommend for toppings for both! I was about to add on a ton of toppings, but retracted as soon as my server gave me the X_x face haha. Overall, this was a great experience. Will definitely come back again!"
4/28/2015,20150428,4,4.24,"3.5 stars is more appropriate. i loved the ambiance, the noodle making watching, and the idea of uni udon (the whole reason we came) but in the end i still prefer uni spaghetti over this version. the freshness of the noodles were fantastic, but the dish overall was too soupy for my tastes and the texture was not quite right. the uni and the cream weren't totally synergistic like i know it can be. definitely check it out for the experience but don't go in with any kind of expectation. it's unlike anything else. like other yelpers have mentioned, they did skimp on my ikura. but actually there was plenty of uni. i sorta saved it for the end (per my usual save the best for last strategy), which was a mistake because i ended up not being able to finish, so all that luscious uni went to waste. it would've been nice to have a salad or something else light to cut through the cream but their menu is a tad limited."
4/29/2015,20150429,5,4.24,"i love udon. i loved these udon.i do find the uni cream udon a bit on the heavy side, so go with a lover or other intimate you are willing to share spit with, order a lighter one, and then trade :P"
4/29/2015,20150429,5,4.24,I always liked Udon. But I never knew how much until I tried theirs. Next-level udon. Had no idea how good udon could be. Marugame's udon is to other udon what Earth is to other planets.
4/30/2015,20150430,4,4.24,"For the adventuresome udon-phile. This can be really hit-or-miss, kind of like all the crazy American-ized sushi rolls. You either love California or Philadelphia rolls, or think they are an abomination. I personally like California rolls, but think Philadelphia rolls need to stay on that side of the Mississippi - so semi-open to creative riffs on traditional Japanese foods. The good: mentai squid butter udon, vongole udon, uni cream udon, scallop carpaccio.The not so good: the more traditional udon, I don't think their men has the superior flavor & texture necessary for such a pared down delicacy. The duck udon. The curry udon. There's usually a line, but it goes surprisingly quick. The staff are really on their game here so they cycle people pretty efficiently without feeling like they are rushing you."
5/1/2015,20150501,5,4.24,I love their uni pasta. Everything I'm in LA I need to come here for my fix. The other stuff is good too and sometimes the wait is really long. But I love uni and they don't skimp on it when they put it in the cream sauce. The pasta is an udon noodle shop the texture of amazing too. I love!!
5/2/2015,20150502,4,4.24,"My favorite UDON place in LA!!I ordered ""oroshi Jo-yu"" which is cold one. And My favorite.And I ordered ""shishamo tempra"" for the first time. It was really delicious! But I asked to have regular salt. That was better for me. It usually comes with curry salt...We went there friday this time. So we needed to wait a little bit. That's understandable.They're still keeping Japanese style UDON!Hope they're gonna keep on having same quality!!"
5/2/2015,20150502,4,4.24,Very nice udon restaurant. Uni udon was creamy and not overwhelming. The kitsune udon was perfect with pumpkin and chicken. The texture of the noodles was just the right amount of firmness . There was no waiting as we arrived around 6pm. There are so many different options for udon that were creative and unique. J can't wait to try them all
5/4/2015,20150504,5,4.24,"Amazing. I'm not a huge Udon fan, but I love this place. They also have amazing pork belly and the best raw scallops I've ever had. Definitely worth a 30 mins wait."

5/5/2015,20150505,4,4.24,"I ordered the uni udon because of all the hype and to be honest the first few bites were amazing but after awhile the flavor became redundant. The broth was too rich for my liking. I would compare the uni udon to a Japanese styled carbonara or fettuccine alfredo. The negitoro don however was amazing! It is the best tuna bowl I have ever had. The mixture of fatty tuna, dried seaweed, green onions and special mayonnaise was just perfect."
5/7/2015,20150507,4,4.24,"Fresh, handmade udon noodles! Made right in front of you (if you sit near the bar) for your viewing pleasure. How's that for quality?You can definitely taste the quality of these delightful noodles. The udon noodles were thick and the perfect balance of chewy and soft, which I love. I had the Sea Urchin Cream Udon (uni udon) which did not disappoint. It was positively delicious! It's not the standard soup udon you might expect but more like a Japanese version of pasta. Absolutely a must for anyone loves a rich, creamy sauce (I hesitate to call it a broth because it's so thick). I had no problem finishing the whole bowl so the portion may seem small to some considering the price you pay (~$15), plus the uni is in the sauce/broth and you don't get actual pieces of uni. However, it was perfect for me and I felt satisfied. All of the udon choices fall in the $10-$20 range, so there's sure to be something for everyone, whether you prefer the more traditional udon soup or the pasta-like variations. I'm already eying the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon and Mentai Squid Butter Udon to try next time!The downside... service was a bit slow (to get our orders taken, to get refills, to get the bill). Considering the small size of the restaurant (don't come here with your posse of 10+, or even 5+) and how it was full but not overly busy, it took a while but then again, quality handmade noodles are worth the wait."
5/8/2015,20150508,2,4.24,"I'm being really picky on udon noodle. I'm originally from a place close to Kagawa which is most famous for udon noodle in Japan. Udon that I am fan of is the ones from Kagawa. Even though this place is better than most places on LA, the quality of the noodle has gone down comparing to the earlier time when they opened the business. They used to be better.I went to eat here around 8:15 pm. The waiting line was not bad, 10 mins. We've ordered a curry udon, a wakame udon, kaki age, boiled egg and red ginger. They forgot our order making us wait way more than 30 mins for those orders. I wish they've given us some discount or something instead of saying quick meaningless ""sorry"" with a smile... (Which irritated me more). Kaki age was lukewarm that tells me that the tempra has been sitting out. Texture of udon noodle became softer than before not from over boiling but from either mixture of ingredients or kneading method has changed. Overall, knowing how it used to be, this was such disappointment. There's a new Marugame Monzo opened in Torrance (182nd and Van Ness) where they knead and make udon just like this place which opens only during lunch time in weekdays. They also have plenty of parking also. I think I'll try the new place and hope it's better than this LA branch."
5/9/2015,20150509,4,4.24,"Mmmmmmm their duck udon!! The duck is really tender and the green chills they give you for it pairs with it really good. If you like duck, must try their duck udon."
5/10/2015,20150510,5,4.24,First time coming here on a Saturday afternoon. I've always noticed it being pretty full but only waited 5 min to get seated. The store is small but it's expected in this area. The staff was courteous and it was very cool to be able to see the noodles being made. I must say I very much enjoyed the duck udon that I ordered. Very filling and the broth was flavorful. Next time I'll definitely order it with the soft boiled egg. It's my friend's favorite spot and I'll definitely be coming back here with friends.
5/10/2015,20150510,5,4.24,"We arrived at 9:30PM on a weekend (Monzo closes at 10 on weekends) to a line, was told we would be served before the shop closed for the night, and about 15 minutes later we got a table!I got the curry udon, which I'm pretty sure is the greatest idea ever. The curry broth was so flavorful that I could have (should have) taken home the leftover soup and served it over rice.A++ would eat curry as broth again."

For years, I've tried to slowly develop my appreciation for its unique flavor...but I just can't seem to like it. Anyway, enough rambling on my experience with ""sea urchin"". With that said, during my very first visit here, I ordered their Sea Urchin Cream Udong mainly because my cousins kept raving about how they love their Sea Urchin Cream Udon. Well, I'm very glad that I listened to my cousins. Haha! The soup was on point. So creamy and delicious! The udon comes with a few little bits of sea urchin, so you don't really taste the sea urchin. For anyone who hasn't tried it, I highly recommend it!"
5/11/2015,20150511,5,4.24,"Oh man! Such a great spot. Such delicious udon noodle soup! I got the beef hot udon and a cold udon bowl w veggies. The tempura is all awesome. Fun to sit at the bar and have a beer, eat and watch the guys make the noodles from scratch. The food is light but also hearty and delicious. Love it. Great for late night especially to avoid long waits. I recommend highly."

5/14/2015,20150514,5,4.24,The udon noodles were hand made and very soft yet chewy. I ordered kake udon and got a side of tempura. It came with one shrimp and five vegetables and an egg. The tempura was fried perfectly. An overall great meal. You will have to expect paying more than 10$ though.
5/14/2015,20150514,5,4.24,"Amazing. I'm not a huge Udon fan, but I love this place. They also have insanely good pork belly and the best raw scallops I've ever had. Definitely worth a 30 minute wait."

Surprisingly, my wife and I only waited about 5 minutes at the most to grab a table at 8pm. We sat right in front of the prep area for the udon so it was entertaining to see the guy pounding away and cutting the noodles all fresh in your face. Call me crazy but it made it taste a bit more flavorful. Started with the tataki for $13 and though tasty, I kinda wished I got the fried chicken skin instead. Wife got the uni cream - super rich and tasty apparently but it looked too rich for my lactose stomach. I got the kakuni which was exactly what I wanted. Perfect fat ass pieces of pork with simple fish based broth and some green onion. Noodles were perfect texture. My only complaint is that I ate it too fast and got too full too fast. Good part is I got to take a big chunk of pork and some soup home so my daughter could try it. Next time I'm getting the chicken skin and curry udon."

I've been eyeing this place for a while and decided to finally eat here with my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. BEST VALENTINES DAY MEAL EVER! We ordered the Chicken Karage Appetizer, Uni Pasta (Of course), & Curry Udon. Of course the star dish of the night was the Uni Pasta. I loved that the sauce wasn't overwhelming with Seafood flavor. It actually really tasted similar to fettuccine alfredo sauce, but with some hints of Uni! My boyfriend actually isn't a fan of Uni, but when he tried this dish he was just overwhelmed with how delicious it was! The homemade udon also tasted amazing and was the perfect texture with the right amount of chewiness. I'M IN LOVE. The other dishes we ordered, Chicken Karage & Curry Udon, was just okay. I definitely wouldn't order it again and just really recommend ordering the Uni Pasta. It seriously will not disappoint!I wish there was a place like this in the Bay Area. I'm definitely visiting this place the next time I visit Los Angeles!"

The cream was cooked to perfection and was not overly-creamy at all. I was only expecting a couple pieces of uni but surprisingly I was greeted with at least a handful of uni. Portions were generous and delicious! I also tried the soup of my counterpart who ordered the Wakame Seaweed Udon and the broth was very flavorful. It wasn't too salty or too plain and was perfect after adding the chili powder.There's a reason why there's always a wait here and you will be glad you waited.

5/18/2015,20150518,5,4.24,"A celiacs nightmare but a dream come true for me! :DLove, love, love thick chewy wheat flour udon noodles and absolutely love the fact that they make fresh noodles before your eyes in their open kitchen which is fun to see. Grab a seat at the bar to watch the process unfold, and it's a tedious one. So much work goes into hand rolling and folding the dough in every which direction several times, lost count, until the right smooth texture and thickness is achieved. They then use an equipment to cut the noodles precisely, smack the noodles on the board several times then twist and store away. Pretty cool to watch. Not one Asian kitchen staff in sight, those Latinos have it all nailed down to the T. They could have fooled me. The food truly reminded me of the amazing authentic cuisine I recently had in Japan, specifically reminded me of a joint located in Ramen Alley where I would also sit and watch them prepare fresh noodles thru the window. Probably one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in this part of town. The Mentai Squid Butter Udon topped with seasoned cod roe, butter sauce, tender squid and onions was so damn delicious. Slightly fishy, plentiful roe which wasn't salty whatsoever, absolute perfect noodles. Easily wanted MORE.Kakiage Don, a bowl of Tempura Veggies & Seafood atop of rice. Definitely recommend this as a side dish. Uncertain what sauce they use to squeeze on top but it penetrates down to the rice and gives it a nice refreshing flavor. Goes so well with the noodles.Pork Belly Don - Thinly sliced pork belly served atop rice. Slightly fatty but more meat than fat. A well seasoned side dish though I preferred the veggie tempura bowl. A new favorite spot."

Also, expect a wait, unless you come before 7pm.Came here for the first time and I'll definitely go again. I highly recommend sitting at the bar-that's where all the action is! Everyone suggested the uni udon but I'm kind of a purist and wanted to really taste the noodles and broth. I ordered the shrimp tempura udon and it comes with two or three shrimp tempuras (I completely forgot how many but they're big and not greasy considering that it's fried). The broth is fresh and clean. The noodles were perfectly cooked! My friend ordered the miso carbonara. If you're a bacon lover, this is most likely your go to dish. We got the negitoro wrap and man was it delicious! It comes with a scoop of fatty tuna and 4-5 pieces of seaweed. It's like a sushi taco...mmmmm, so good!Didn't get dessert but walked over to the boba shop a couple of blocks down. All in all, I'll definitely go back and try one of their signature dishes. Maybe I'll get the uni this time."

5/29/2015,20150529,5,4.25,"I have yet to be disappointed with this place and it's my favorite udon place. Although that's not really saying too much as it's pretty much the only one I've been to. The udon is just about perfect in terms of texture and firmness, I feel like I could eat it plain with nothing and still enjoy it. But the variety of broths they have are amazing. The first dish I tried was the more adventurous sounding uni udon dish which was pretty creamy, but not as overpowering as I thought it would be. Sort of wish there would be more uni in there, but I guess that would up the price quite a bit and the real winner of these dishes is the udon and broth to me. Also had some other dishes there and all of them were great, so you can't really go wrong with whatever choice you decide.I've gone here with someone who have been to Japan and had great udon there and also with someone who have never had it before and they both really enjoyed their time here. Highly recommend this place to anyone, even if you know nothing about udon."
5/29/2015,20150529,5,4.25,SO GOOD. SO SO GOOD. I love the duck nanban and the uni cream udon. I also love their tempura menu. Great spot to get udon with the kind of awesome texture that only freshly made udon would have.
5/29/2015,20150529,3,4.25,"Another hyped up noodle joint. It's really not bad, it's just A-OK. 3 stars is not a bad thing; it's just not 5. I've had udon both in Tokyo and Osaka and around town. Presentation is nice, on a large bowl, nice modern interior and a see through window where you can see the guys pound the dough all which makes it look like you're getting really good udon but the proof is not in the pudding on this one. Broth lacks depth of nice katsuobushi and their fried shishamo looks like is a joke. Anyone who knows Japanese cuisine will tell you that Japanese fry their food with their family names on the line much like everything else. You can tell right off the bat that their tempura is sloppy with numerous clumps of batter. You can get this type of tempura across the street at the Chinese food place, not impressed at all. The noodles lack the texture of a really good udon, it's a tad bit thick, slightly undercooked and doughy. Think you're getting authentic experience? Buyer be ware."
5/30/2015,20150530,5,4.25,"The rave reviews are true - the udon here is amazing! Perfectly chewy and fresh. The uni udon is a must try, a few of us shared one because it seemed too rich to have our own, but it was so good I probably could have handled eating all of it myself!We also got the shrimp and scallop rice bowl and the kake udon. Both were delicious and simple. Price is very reasonable, the simple hot udons were about 7-9 bucks a bowl. The uni was about 16."
5/30/2015,20150530,5,4.25,"Can you please open a branch in SF? We need you here! Friends took us to Marugame Monzo and promised us a great meal, and it truly was. My hubby had the sea urchin udon and I had the buttery squid. Even though I am not a fan of sea urchin I really liked it here because it wasn't overwhelming. The buttery squid udon was also absilutely delicious. The plate is really big and beautifully plated. The atmosphere of the place is very nice. Cozy yet modernish. The staff is very helpful and friendly. There's gonna be a wait so keep that in mind. We only had to wait around 7 minutes before we were seated. Marugame Monzo it a must visit every time I am in L.A. restaurant."
5/31/2015,20150531,5,4.25,Very fresh udon. The uni cream sauce was rich in uni flavor. Must go back to try the other dishes. JONASAPPROVED!
5/31/2015,20150531,4,4.25,"I love handmade noodles, so as soon as I read about Marugame Monzo, I knew I had to visit. Right next to the uber popular Daikokuya Ramen, the wait can seem intimidating, but I think more than a few people put their names down and then wander off to find something that doesn't require so much of a wait. We went at an off-peak time and about half of the people ahead of us on the wait list were not present. We sat at the bar, which was awesome because we could see the udon being rolled. It was not so awesome because I was in the corner seat right next to the register, so my chair kept getting hit by the wait staff. I ordered the Uni Cream Udon, which is basically Japanese fettuccine alfredo: a very milky cream sauce, udon noodles, and a few uni pieces in the sauce. I did try to coat the noodles in sauce so I could pick up more of the flavor, but it was more like washing the noodles than coating them. After I fished out the noodles and the uni bits, I was left with a puddle of cream in my bowl. I expected a lot more uni flavor in the sauce, but this basically tasted like a lighter take on fettuccine alfredo. 3 stars for the uni cream udon, because it was alright, but I wouldn't order it again. 5 stars for the handmade noodles, which were awesome.So, overall, 4 stars. Can't beat the handmade udon noodles, but I would order a more traditional preparation next time."
5/31/2015,20150531,1,4.25,"Big disappointment. Came here for the Uni udon and paid $16 for a bowl of udon without any Uni! They used to give you a generous portion of Uni considering we pay $16 for a bowl of UNI udon but today's visit put this restaurant to shame. Got my bowl of udon and didn't see any Uni at all, brought it to the waitors attention and was told they ""smashed it up in the bowl"" that's why we can't see it..yes I understand that..BUT there were chunks of Uni before.. Oh well, no more Uni udon for me, will get the curry udon IF I come back."
5/31/2015,20150531,5,4.25,"Went here three times in the past week. I dig it. Thanks to me having the smarts and making sure that I have my boyfriend with me every time so that I can try 2 diffent udons every visit.1) Cold udon with paste - it's very good and refreshing. The broth can be a tad salty so I'd be careful.2) Squid butter - other reviewers ain't lying y'all! It's off Da hook.3) sea urchin - my boyfriend loved it, it was a tad too creamy and rich for me. I prefer lighter broths. But the flavor was top notch!4) Curry udon - not a fan. I've never gotten used to eating curry with noodles, but wanted to try because it smelled so damn good. It was just a confusing combination for me.5) Duck Udon - pretty good. The duck slices are okay, chewy. Im used to melt in your mouth chunks of duck.I wish they had sides that weren't tempura. I'd like to be able to order some greens like steammed spinach or something. Unless it is an option but I never asked and only saw tempura sides on the menu. The udon themselves are cheap, but you'll prob want to add on sides like eggs, shrimp and such. That's when the bill goes up.Wish they would stay open past 10pm as well."
5/31/2015,20150531,5,4.25,"My favorite udon spot! They are so good at what they do, everytime I went I left feeling satisfied. They are known for their Uni udon (which is very flavorful and rich but it gets overwhelming if you eat too much of it) but I come here for their udon dipping style dish. I forgot the name of it but just look for the description ""dipping"". They bathe your udon in a hot bath of water, then you take each strand out to dip it in this sauce with diced ginger, onion, daikon (I think). The chewy udon with the flavor of the sauce mixes very well together. Since the order only come with udon and dipping sauce, you get to order extra sides to complete your plate. I would order their egg and tempura shrimp."
6/1/2015,20150601,4,4.25,"I've heard such great reviews about this place and was scared at how long the wait would be, but it wasn't that bad. Came on a Saturday at around 6pm and it was just about a 30min. wait. We got seated at the bar (which I was hoping for). We got to see the chefs making the udon noodles which was really cool! I got the uni udon and I enjoyed it. I was a little nervous that it was going to get too ""greasy"" because of the cream sauce, but the sauce was somehow on the lighter side. I was able to eat it without feeling gross by the end. I do wish the uni had a stronger presence though. The Kakuni udon was great. Good broth and the pork belly was cooked nicely. Thick and not dry. The noodles in both dishes were cooked perfectly. Chewy but soft."
6/3/2015,20150603,2,4.25,"I think I had higher expectations than the manager running this place. Udon is made fresh and in front of you? Cool. Took my first bite into the udon and it wasn't even soft it was rough. I got the udon with the clams and the broth was so salty. My entire family got a different type of udon and they felt like eh it's ok. The type of ok where the place doesn't deserve a second visit. Sheesh they're cheap with Uni too lol They charge a 18% tip gratuity for parties of 6+ * The joint is extra small so there's always a line, but eh I'll pass."
6/5/2015,20150605,5,4.25,"What is better than Udon on a rainy day? I came here with friend under her recommendation because I was craving noodles and the first place we wanted to go to closed. We were seated after some time because of a really long line! I ordered the Shrimp Tempura Ramen. The tempura is on the side, not in the ramen. The udon was soft and chewy. It was made to perfection. The soup base was also very yummy! I'm happy to say I completely devoured this meal because it was so good! I'll definitely come again to try more exotic options next time!"
6/5/2015,20150605,3,4.25,"I really really enjoyed the Uni udon in the moment, but I probably wouldn't order it again. You know that smell when you walk down the seafood section at the grocery store? That's the aftertaste it left in my mouth. The udon was good but didn't wow me. (Kind of reminded me of the frozen udon from H-Mart). But besides that, it was pretty yummy, the broth/sauce was really thick/creamy, and most importantly, the Uni was super flavorful and fresh! The portion was also very filling. If I come back, I would want to try the beef tataki or the other udon soupy flavors!"
6/8/2015,20150608,4,4.25,"Best Udon I've had in a looooong time!Had the Sea Urchin Cream udon, bro had the Mentai squid butter. Both were absolutely delicious and will come back again.The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is bc based on previous pictures it looks like they gave more Uni than what I had today. Other than that service & quality of food were spectacular! Can't wait to come again."
6/10/2015,20150610,3,4.24,"The novelty of Monzo has worn off for me. I was impressed when it first opened, and for the cheaper udon dishes I'd still consider coming in, but I feel I can get a better bang for my buck in my own kitchen - especially with the uni udon. If your culinary skills do not include udon, by all means, this place is a great treat ~ especially after an event in downtown or if taking the Gold Line for an adventure in Little Tokyo. However, I would not personally wait more than 10 minutes for a seat nor spend over $15 for udon."
6/11/2015,20150611,5,4.25,"Yum!! I'm definitely a noodle person and I love the way their freshly made udon tastes :) Its chewy and thick but not too chewy or thick... I don't know exactly how to describe it. It's just perfect!!They don't take reservations so make sure you time your arrival appropriately (usually a 30-45 minute wait). Parking in little tokyo sucks but at least there's a ton of delicious food and desserts around here.Sea urchin (uni) udon- sooooooooooooo delicious! definitely very creamy and heavy, but it just tasted so yummy, I couldn't help but gobble up the entire bowl! For those of you who want to try this but have no idea what it tastes like, it kind of tasted like bacon to me for some reason. The sauce was creamy and bacon-y, which is good by my standards!The beef tataki was good too, very well seasoned. However, it seemed more cooked than it should have been.They will tempura like anything here. I recommend the tempura soft-boiled egg! It goes amazing with any udon and it's just really unique :) the outside is fluffy and crispy and i'm always a fan of runny yolks.They're pretty efficient here and give good service. They constantly check up on you and ask if you need anything. Make sure you have your entire party though because they will give your table away if it takes too long!"
6/13/2015,20150613,5,4.25,"Amazing food! I had the shrimp tempura Udon and my husband had the carbonara Udon both where amazing, but what blew my mind was the soft boiled fried egg. It's the first time I've ever seen a soft boiled egg battered and fried you must get it."
6/14/2015,20150614,4,4.25,"When I saw that they had uni cream udon, I had to come check it out. It was really good! I shared the dish with my boyfriend and glad I did because towards the end I started to get a little sick of it but that's me since I'm not a huge fan of creamy noodles.with those, the first few bites are great but then I start to get sick of it. The udon noodles are handmade and sooo gooood. They're thick and chewy and each noodle is so long. We also had the scallop carpaccio which wasn't really worth it.Also the smelt fish tempura was too fishy for me haha. But all in all a great experience and the service was awesome as they're all super friendly."
6/15/2015,20150615,4,4.25,"I've come here many times now and we always leave satisfied! The wait is also not very long (not nearly as long as daikokuya next door), if there is one. My favorite is the Mentai Squid Butter Udon but all the specialty ones are tasty. You can't go wrong with any of the udon selections. The taste and quality is always consistent and fresh. I can always count on knowing what to expect and leaving with a happy full stomach!"
6/15/2015,20150615,5,4.25,"Note: No reservations. First come/first serve basis only. Don't tread too far, they call your name three times and if you're not present, you're skipped. Also, expect a wait, unless you come before 7pm.Came here for the first time and I'll definitely go again. I highly recommend sitting at the bar-that's where all the action is! Everyone suggested the uni udon but I'm kind of a purist and wanted to really taste the noodles and broth. I ordered the shrimp tempura udon and it comes with two or three shrimp tempuras (I completely forgot how many but they're big and not greasy considering that it's fried). The broth is fresh and clean. The noodles were perfectly cooked! My friend ordered the miso carbonara. If you're a bacon lover, this is most likely your go to dish. We got the negitoro wrap and man was it delicious! It comes with a scoop of fatty tuna and 4-5 pieces of seaweed. It's like a sushi taco...mmmmm, so good!Didn't get dessert but walked over to the boba shop a couple of blocks down. All in all, I'll definitely go back and try one of their signature dishes. Maybe I'll get the uni this time."
6/16/2015,20150616,4,4.25,"I decided to break away from my usual sushi spot in Little Tokyo to try Marugame Monzo and its much raved about udon. On a Monday evening at around 6pm, there was no wait at all.The negitoro handroll came out as a beautiful presentation with a scoop of fatty tuna, a few sheets of nori, and some veggies for you to put together yourself. It tasted great, but I'm starting to wonder if it was this that caused upset stomachs in the middle of the night for us. :(The kakuni - chunky pieces of pork belly in a surprisingly light sauce. The famous uni udon ($15.95) was creamy, unexpectedly light in flavour, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. If I had a bigger stomach, I would've devoured the entire bowl.The miso carbonara ($12.50) was also creamy and delightfully tasty. If it was a first bite, I'd think it was the greatest, tastiest, most magnificent thing I had eaten all night, but it followed the uni udon and just couldn't compare.Portions seem small, but trust me, it'll fill you up rather quickly and you'll leave with a satisfied tummy. :)"
6/16/2015,20150616,5,4.25,"I LOVE udon and this place knows how to make the fat kid in me oh so so happy! A few things you need to know about this place. It is tuck in Little Tokyo right next to Daikokuya (the best ramen in town) and across from Citibank. There is a public parking across the street so you don't have to pay for parking like I did. The wait can get quite long especially with those who is dining with a larger group of people, but trust me it is worth the wait. I came here last monday and it was during lunch time and i waited a good 30 minutes for a party of two so dont expect to be seated right away. The place itself was a little cramp, the table next to us were pretty close to our table.Onto the food review: I had the miso carbonara and the boyfriend had the uni udon. Both were very creamy and flavorful. My favorite part would have to the the fresh made udon. Nothing taste better than fresh made udon. I also order the tempura soft boiled egg, which were cooked just like how i like it--not too runny. The only thing that threw me off a little was the fast that i wished they left some uni on top of the uni udon instead of mashing it all up into the broth and the tempura egg was cold. I wished they fried it right before they send it to my table instead of giving me one that had been sitting out.Overall, this place is an A+ in my book! Definitely try out this place if you are an udon fanantic like me."
6/16/2015,20150616,5,4.25,"I ate here like once a week for a couple months when I worked in downtown and all I can say is PLEASE SIR, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE?Location/Parking/Inside: Its on a crowded little street in Little Tokyo. You can usually spot it by the bright yellow Daikokuya sign and long wait next door. I usually walk there, but on the off chance I drive, I park in the parking structure at the Japanese Village across the street (which can get pretty expensive, but many of the stores in the Village will validate). Its typically busy on weekdays at lunch, so get there early and come with your whole party because they're really strict on the whole we-wont-seat-you-until-your-whole-party-is-here thing. You enter through this little curtain flag thing hanging in the entrance (which is weird and a little annoying) and sign-in if there's a wait. Its pretty small inside but its nice and there's a decent amount of seating (table + bar). Plus you get a clear view of the chefs making the noodles from scratch, which is awesome and strangely satisfying to watch. Food: I always opt for the lunch special which comes with a bowl + udon of your choice. I do the Negitoro Bowl + Kake or Bukkake udon (yes, those are the names, just go with it). Negitoro Bowl is a small bowl of white rice topped with a scoop of finely chopped fatty tuna, drizzled with eel sauce and mayo, and sprinkled with green onion. It's AMAZING. However it may be too mayo-y for some people, but they will gladly go light on the mayo if you ask. Kake Udon is a huge bowl of broth, udon noodles, tempura flakes, and green onions. Its plain, but in a good way. I always ask for the tempura flakes on the side because I don't like how quickly they get soggy.Bukkake Udon is a huge bowl of udon noodles, benito flakes (which I don't like, so I ask for none), green onions, tempura flakes, and grated daikon. The cold broth comes on the side, so you can add it to the bowl if you want.I also get a side of pumpkin tempura to dip into my broth.Pricing: Very reasonably priced.Service: Quick and friendly.TL;DR IT'S AMAZING, GO HERE."
6/16/2015,20150616,4,4.25,Uni Udon!. Handmade noodles make all the difference. Must try the Uni cream Udon.
6/16/2015,20150616,1,4.24,"Got jipped on my uni. When I asked the server about it, she just replied they crushed it all in the broth. Whack, not coming here again."
6/17/2015,20150617,4,4.24,"Creamy, creamy goodness. The first word that pops into my mind when I think of Marugame is CREAMY. Who would have thought creamy udon is so good? I had the tomato cream udon and my boyfriend had the squid butter udon. Both are so good - I would highly recommend them! If possible, I recommend splitting two different types of udon dishes. The squid butter udon is a white sauce and it's super rich, so you may get really tired of eating only that. My tomato cream udon was a tiny bit tangy and not as rich, so that was a nice change. The udon noodles are probably the best I've ever had so far. They are tender and chewy at the same time. The texture is just so pleasing. It's a HUGE portion, so you will probably have some to take home for leftovers. When I had my leftovers the next day, it still tasted really good but the noodles lost their amazing texture. They were very soft and soggy - as expected. So, try to savor the noodle texture as much as possible while it's fresh! We both ordered tempura soft boiled egg to go with the udon. I love soft boiled eggs...I think I could have done without the tempura outer shell, but it was definitely something different. We came on a Monday evening close to when the restaurant opened and we were seated right away.This place is a creamy and carby heaven!"
6/18/2015,20150618,4,4.24,"Not a huge udon fan, but this place changed my mind. Sea urchin udon is sooo good! It's heavy creamy dish like an Italian japan fushion dish . Wish they had this dish in Texas !"
6/18/2015,20150618,4,4.24,"Food was good but service was so rude. We walked in at around 1:50 and there was no line so we were seated immediately. The server took our order and we got the food in a relatively short amount of time. We got the pork and Uni ramen and both were pretty good. The pork belly broth was light but flavorful and they had cooked the pork belly so that it was really soft. Uni udon was really creamy, the noodles were pretty chewy and they gave quite a bit of udon. The service, however, really marred this experience. They were SO pushy trying to get us out the door. They gave us the check about 10 min in the meal and kept coming over and checking if we put the card down/signed the receipt etc. We were not even close to being finished eating so I really did not appreciate that passive aggressive behavior. If you're going to say that you're closing at 2:30, at least have the decency to let your customers who came in previous to that time eat in peace. If 2:30 is too late for the staff to wait for their customers to finish eating, then they need to think about changing their closing time."
6/21/2015,20150621,4,4.24,Came here today for lunch! Arrived just when they are able to open and was able to get seated. Food:Uni pasta.....very cream and rich. Should at least try it once. Not something I could eat everyday...like once in a long while.Udon with chicken tempura on the side....very plain.Negitoro bowl...pretty goodService: attentive!Parking: free parking on Sunday on the street!Food is good but too expensive for udon.
6/21/2015,20150621,5,4.24,Wow. This is possibly the best Udon i've ever had. The noodles used in the udon was the freshest i've ever had. The guy was literally making the noodles about 4 feet away from the table you're sitting behind see through glass. I ordered the sea urchin udon which I thought was going to be risky but saw everybody on Yelp posting photos about it so I knew I had to try it. Very tasty and creamy. The thickness reminded me of alfredo sauce but it had a very good bitter sweetness to it. They also put caviar on top of the noodles which adds a good pop to it.The tempura soft boiled egg is also a must. It was cooked to perfection (and eggs are tricky). If you're ever in LA make sure you try this place out. Also it gets pretty crowded around 8-9 pm make sure you get in right before everybody gets outta work to get a spot. (no reservations)
6/21/2015,20150621,5,4.24,"I love Marugame Monzo! I've been here several times in the past year. The quality, consistency and service is always at a high level and the pricing is very reasonable!RecommendationsAppetizers - can't go wrong with either the Pork belly or the Fried chicken skin.Uni udon - their most popular dish. sea urchin in a flavorful creamy sauce on their handmade udon noodlesMentai squid butter udon - FYI mentai is spicy cod roe (fish eggs). This is mixed with decent portions of squid and udon in a wonderfully flavorful brothPorcini mushroom udon - my personal favorite dish. I love mushrooms. Porcini is my favorite mushroom.

(Best to go in small groups)Because they are a small restaurant they will not seat you until your whole party has arrived."
6/21/2015,20150621,5,4.25,Wakame seaweed udon was the best thing I ate all week in LA! I had a front row seat watching the noodles made fresh. Can't wait to go back.
6/23/2015,20150623,5,4.25,"Lived in Japan for 12 years with the Navy and miss all the great food! In LA visiting family and had to visit after seeing all the great reviews. It was all the hype and more. Absolutely wonderful, fresh, atmosphere was alive and the place is just overall wonderful! Highly recommend it!!!"
6/23/2015,20150623,5,4.25,"So delicious. Best udon in town made right in front of you. i love the sliced scallop sashimi style. Look for the white curtain in front of the door, and enter the secret club! Try the udon in tomato soup"
6/25/2015,20150625,5,4.25,"I came here because everyone says that they make the best udon noodles ever. I was not disappointed. Although udon is not one of my favorite Japanese dishes, the hand made noodles and the special udon preparations here made me appreciate this simple dish a lot more.You know a place is popular when there are people waiting before it opens. We arrived a few minutes before 5pm, and there were already a few people gathering outside. We opted to sit at the bar in front of the glass so we could see the noodles being made by hand. Although it's a pretty simple process, there's something strangely satisfying about seeing your noodles being prepared to order, knowing that they are being served literally, as fresh as can be. Since it was our first time here, we ordered the popular Sea Urchin Cream Udon and the Mentai Squid Butter. The first thing I noticed was that the portions were quite generous, and larger than what I expected from a ""Japanese specialty noodle restaurant"". I know everyone raves about the sea urchin udon, but the star for me was really the noodles. The texture of the noodles was spot on, with the perfect amount of bounce without being undercooked. Although the sea urchin cream sauce was deliciously rich and savory, it became a bit one noted after a while and the flavor was not decisively better than some other uni pasta sauces that I have tried. The mentai squid butter on the other hand came in a beautifully complex broth with hints of subtle seafood flavor balanced with the saltiness of the cod roe. This one was literally one of the best bowls of udon I have ever eaten. The squid was cooked to delicately tender which added just a hint of meatiness to the dish. The beef tataki was also refreshingly light and made for a good side of protein for the udon.For a place that prides itself on one single item and builds their menu around it, there's a lot of pressure to deliver on their promise of a quality bowl of udon. After finally making the trek to try this place, I can honestly say that I was completely impressed. There's nothing more endearing to me than a restaurant that takes the time to focus on one particular thing and perfect it. I don't know if these guys make the perfect bowl of udon, but they certainly come very close."
6/27/2015,20150627,5,4.25,"Amazing udon noodles. Chewy and delicious with the perfect texture. You can watch in mesmerization as they roll out the noodles in the back. They have many different types of udon from the traditional (kitsune, etc...) to the creative (creamy uni, vongole)."
6/29/2015,20150629,4,4.25,"Their noodles are handmade and adds a nice touch to your ramen. I ordered the Curry Udon which is different because I've never had curry and udon together. No need to add spice or anything, it's good just the way it's served to you. Price is a big high for ramen, but something worth trying. Expect a short wait and to look for parking when you're in Little Tokyo."
7/1/2015,20150701,5,4.25,Monzo Udon is made in house and you can see them doing it! The servers do not always seem to be too enthusiastic but the food is always really delicious!I've had several of the hot udon and each time is just as good as before. Noodles are perfectly toothsome and chewy and the broth is wonderfully fragrant ! Sometimes can be busy for lunch but usually isn't too bad - would definitely recommend !Edit- okay so I keep coming back to this place because the udon is just DAMN GOOD- and revising the rating from 4 to 5 stars! Love monzo!
7/2/2015,20150702,5,4.25,"If you're a fan of udon you will definitely be able to appreciate this establishment. The noodles are made right in front of you (if you're seated at the bar-esque area) and they have a superior consistency & texture. I have never had such chewy udon noodles like this before!My boyfriend had a lot of appreciation for the Creamy Sea Urchin Udon, which has a creamy milk base similar to that of fettuccine. Apparently, this is a hot dish here.The beef tataki is a MUST. It is a simple appetizer that is so rich and oh-so satisfying. I am happy to spend $13 on it. LITERALLY A MUST.Pleasant service. Expect to wait, especially at dinnertime; get your name down early!"
7/2/2015,20150702,4,4.25,"Food: I ate the tempura udon and uni udon right before closing during lunch time. The uni udon was lighter than I expected. I didn't want it to be too rich and creamy and I thought it was served as a creamy pasta type dish but it was more of a creamy broth with udon noodles. I'd definitely try this again. The regular tempura udon broth was slightly salty but the shrimp tempura itself was delish.Service: No complaints. They came around for last call before lunch was over which I appreciated. Ambience: Good table space. Open kitchen. Location: Parking is awful but it's Little Tokyo. You can street park or park in a lot, which isn't a big deal."
7/2/2015,20150702,4,4.25,Good food but loong line so come early. Gotta try their cold Udon but their dishes are good too.
7/3/2015,20150703,2,4.25,Mentai too creamyPork belly overcookedNothing special Service was fine
7/4/2015,20150704,4,4.25,Yum Yum!! The udon noodles are delicious. I sat next to the window where you can see them make the udon noodles. I ordered the sea urchin udon noodles and beef udon noodles. Both were delicious! Kind of disappointed when I ordered the ice green tea. I thought it was going to be freshly brew but instead got a can of green tea that you can purchase at the supermarket for one dollar. They charged two something for a can of ice green tea. The sea urchin udon noodle is creamy.The beef udon noodle is soupy.
7/5/2015,20150705,5,4.25,"4 words: Sea. Urchin. Cream. Udon. If you are an uni and udon lover- then this dish is for you. We watched our udon noodles being pulled and rolled, stretched and cut, and placed in the pot of boiling water before being plated in this delicious sea urchin cream sauce, topped with uni and ikura, with a side of a tempura soft boiled egg. The egg was perfection and the creamy yolk only enhanced the magic of the dish. I am actually salivating as I type this and already planning my return. I came for lunch on a Thursday with some friends and our kids. They open at 11:30 am and by 11:00, there was already a line forming outside the unassuming (almost hidden) entrance. The signage wasn't easy to see. It has a black awning, next door to Daikokuya. The restaurant is small, a few tables and counter seating, but service is pretty quick. I ordered a side of the pork belly rice bowl for the kids and they enjoyed it, but once the chicken tempura and shrimp tempura udon was served, they dropped their forks in exchange for soup spoons and chopsticks. Can't wait to return!"
7/5/2015,20150705,4,4.25,"This place has the best homemade udon ever! It's a great experience sitting in front of the kitchen where they make the udon from scratch. I normally order the Mentaiko Tarako udon, but I wanted to try something new this time. I ordered the Gatten udon and regret it because the pizza cheese was not creamy and there wasn't any other flavor to balance out the pizza cheese flavor. The chicken was not good either. From now on, I'm going to stick to more traditional Japanese udon dishes."
7/5/2015,20150705,5,4.25,"Got free tickets to the anime expo so went to that before coming here. Wasn't really looking to eat udon but it showed up on yelp with really good reviews. The restaurant is a pretty small place so if you come at a busy hour be ready to wait quite a bit. I came here at around 4pm and the wait was already around 30 minutes which wasn't too bad. Whats also really cool is that there are old Japanese men in the restaurant making/cutting the udon right in front of you.We ordered the tempura eggs, mushroom salad, cold half boiled egg udon and the sea urchin udon. The mushroom salad came out first and it was just greens with what I believe was shiitake mushroom on top. It was extremely mushroom-y because of the added mushroom tasting dressing. Then the eggs and udon came out. The Cold one was a giant bowl of udon with tempura, daikon, ginger, green onions and en egg. They also gave you a tiny pitcher of sauce to pour on it making it the perfect amount of salty. Then came the famous sea urchin udon that everyone talks about. I really liked it but it pretty much tasted exactly like the Uni pasta I tried at EMC seafood. Worth trying and ordering though. After the bowls were finished I ordered another side of udon to put in the leftover sauces. Super worth it. Overall this is the best udon joint in my opinion. Will definitely be coming back as soon as possible."
7/5/2015,20150705,3,4.25,"When this place first opened the service was superb, the food was delish and there was a real udon noodle master that was making the noodles right in front of you. I'm sad to say that the service has become almost non existent, the noodle master has disappeared and has been replaced by a Radom kitchen staff. The noodle master was a very meticulous man who had OCD. He spent a lot of time examining the noodles and throwing away any noodles that weren't up to his standard of perfection (ie uniform size, length etc). There isn't that same type of perfection anymore. However, with that being said, I haven't found a udon place that has mentai noodle dish. I love, love, love uni, but the uni udon dish is too rich and creamy, it gave me an upset stomach. The tempura egg is light although being fried and the yolk is cooked perfectly. The braised pork belly used to be made perfectly, having the perfect amount of fat and meat. Now, it's just a huge piece of fat with a thin layer of meat YUCK!! I hope this place cleans up their act so they don't go out of business!!"
7/6/2015,20150706,5,4.25,"If I could take a bath in a big bowl of udon noodles from here, I would.Tomato cream seafood udon: sexy.Cold beef udon: unexpectedly sexy.UDON ME BABY.Also, I love watching the chefs make the homemade udon right in front of the tables through the glass window!!!Expect a long wait most of the time - the place is poppin' but once you sit the service is fast!"
7/8/2015,20150708,5,4.25,"I've only eaten the sea urchin cream udon here, but OMG it's amazing! I savored every bite and even drank the broth even though it's pretty heavy (super thick and creamy). There are little pieces of uni in the broth and I fished out every piece since the dish is 15.95... It's THAT delicious. It just works so well. You won't regret getting it. We came right before closing on a weekday, around 2pm and didn't have to wait but it was still pretty crowded. I can't imagine how bad it would be during peak hours. I want to come back and try other popular items like the mentai squid butter udon or tempura, but I don't know if I can ever part with the uni udon if I have to wait an hour to get it..."
7/8/2015,20150708,5,4.25,"I did not know that there were so many different kinds of udon. Its surprising to see so many different kinds. Creamy, hot, cold and fruit flavored broths. You will definitely be surprised in what you order and I believe there is something for everyone. When you come inside you are first attracted to the chef that is making handmade noodles in the noodle bar area. he pulls out the dough and rolls it out on his board and uses a cutter to cut the noodle into strips of noodles. I believe a lot of customers come here to see that and because they are told that the noodles are made there.The ordered the crispy chicken skin as a appetizer. THIS APPETIZER IS AMAZING! It taste like chicharron, but chicken. SOOOO GOOODD!!! We ordered the Plum shiso bukkake udon, Seafood Udon, and Cold udon with jidori poached egg. ALL of these udons have their own distinct flavor. They were all good. If you want something warming and soothing you will want a warm udon, but if you are daring and it is bit hot outside you might want to try the cold udon. The food might look like it will not be filling, but they do give you a lot of noodles. So do not be worried. I want to go back here and try all the udons. The price of this place was pretty decent. But make sure you go before 6PM because as soon as we were seated, there was a line outside the door. I would not want to wait an hour for my food."
7/9/2015,20150709,5,4.25,"I crave their sea urchin uni cream udon all the time. Why can't Seattle have these instead of Kukai and Santouka?! The broth is thick and creamy with heavenly bits of uni scattered within. They hand-pull their udon noodles; you can watch them because they have an open kitchen. My friend ordered a hot clam-ridden udon; she said she wanted to share the dish because she was so full. She ended up finishing the entire bowl by herself. It was THAT good. There is no waiting area inside the restaurant, which might be inconvenient in the winter (although I may be overestimating how cold Californian winters get). Although the spoons are pretty, it is impossible to fit into your mouth (don't try). Our server accidentally brought a bowl of Japanese pickles to our table; we thought it was part of the meal but it wasn't! He took it away but it would've been a refreshing, crunchy side to contrast to the heavy soup. Yes to next time!"
7/10/2015,20150710,5,4.25,"I'm still dreaming about the fresh, grade-A quality udon. Fiancé and I were amazed how wonderful this tiny restaurant was. It was one of our cheapest bill in our three-day LA stay. The rice bowls were also delicious! They're $4.00 a piece if you order an Udon bowl. We ordered two of each and thoroughly enjoyed them. The creamy uni Udon is a must!"
7/11/2015,20150711,5,4.25,"I got the basic cold udon topped with Roe and Shisho leaf with broth on the side. Texture of udon noodles were spot on and complimented the chilled, savory broth and faintly salty-acidity of the roe. A much welcomed addition to Little Tokyo. Would highly recommend this to anyone who loves fresh udon."
7/14/2015,20150714,5,4.25,"I love udon! I need a t-shirt for this. I think I may be in the minority since there are more ramen places than udon places around. I've loved udon since I was a little girl, and yes more than ramen I dare say. I've eaten in it's packaged form and in the restaurant form for years and I have to say this is the best udon joint.... at least in California. To be fair, I haven't had udon outside of Cali so the bar is set super high, but I'm open to suggestions...."
7/15/2015,20150715,4,4.25,"First review and I'm glad it's for a place so good! REALLY happy my roommate and I stumbled across this place while rummaging through Yelp reviews for restaurants in Little Tokyo. Such a great and refreshing take on Udon! Different from the usual udon I'm used to having, but definitely a change-up done right. TASTE:I can vouch for the Cream Mentai Udon, which includes the udon noodles in a creamy seafood-like broth mixed with scallops and shrimp and a bit of cod roe. The taste is savory, but in a subtle way. The broth isn't bombarded with unnecessary flavors that you would get tired of midway through the meal. Scallops and shrimp were very tender and matched well with the broth. Udon noodles (which are made for the whole restaurant to observe, freaking lit) had such a nice, soft texture. PORTIONS: A lot of the pictures on Yelp made the meal portions, especially the creamy udon, look very small. We were both pretty hesitant choosing this place because we wanted to have dinner at a place that had larger portions. Very glad we tried it out! The udon size is actually very big, definitely should come here on an empty stomach and a readiness to eat up. PRICING: Very reasonable. The specialty creamy udon ranged from about $11ish-$15ish. A little pricier than regular udon but you get your ""bang for your buck"" with this one. Unique and delicious at a great price I guess I'll call it. The smaller rice bowls are a little more pricier than what I would expect. I guess I am not used to small portions the rice bowls came in, or maybe I'm just used to eating everything by the pound. Most likely the latter. And just a note, they do NOT spilt checks. SERVICE: Servers were very busy doing their job, and doing it very well at that. Super considerate of their customers, always around to tend to any order change, add-ons or request for a refill. RESTAURANT:Tidy and clean. Quite small, but not cramped. It has a very authentic Japanese aura to it. Bathrooms are clean and well maintained. In the women's restroom there is a mirror literally RIGHT in front the toilet. I mean, just so you know. WAIT TIME: We went on a Tuesday during late dinner time at about 6:45? Didn't have to wait at all. Seated right away!!"
7/15/2015,20150715,4,4.25,"This restaurant is located right next to little Tokyo's Daikokuya, thus I am giving it props for its commitment to competition. I ordered the sea urchin cream udon because I have seen that dish over Instagram and Snapchat all the time. My date on the other hand took the traditional route and ordered the regular shio broth. After tasting both soups I would definitely choose the traditional broth, it just tastes so much more fitting for udon noodles. We also ordered some beef Tataki and a soft boiled tempura egg, which I thoroughly enjoyed breaking apart. Overall Score:Food 8/10 - would like to see more specialtiesAmbience 8.5/10 - hustle and bustle; however enjoyableService 9/10 - quick and efficient"
7/16/2015,20150716,5,4.25,"This is literally the best udon I've had. I got one of the udon specialties. I believe it was the udon chicken gratin. Came in a steel pot so it was still very much hot. The cheese was melted on top and soaked through the udon noodles and the chicken. It made everything so flavorful and tasty. If you love cheese, get the udon chicken gratin. So gooddddd. But be careful, you might be a bit gassy after .Also, my girlfriend got the sea urchin udon and my goodness, that was amazing as well. The noodles soaked into the creamy sauce was to die for. I am definitely coming back. The service was on point. Our server was always attentive and very nice. She gave us very good suggestions on what to eat. Tip: Parking is a hassle and the wait is sometimes long so plan ahead! I usually park in the little Tokyo plaza and walk over!"
7/16/2015,20150716,4,4.25,"Tried Monzo yesterday, and really liked this udon place. I loved how the noodles are made fresh and the udon broth is really tasty. The restaurant is really clean and the staff is friendly and attentive. This place gets really crowded so be prepared to wait. We came right when they reopened after their lunch break at 5 and ended up walking right in! The noodles are inexpensive in my opinion. I got the basic kake Udon and it was around 6.95 but I got a double portion of noodles for $2 more and it was a good amount to eat! The broth was yummy and the noodles were nice and thick and had a good consistency. My girlfriend got the sea urchin udon for $15 and it WAS SO GOOD! It's nice and creamy and definitely something new to try if you are just used to traditional udon.All in all the food is fresh and tasty, service is good, the price is fair, but the only con is that the waiting line gets really long but that is to be expected when a restaurant has a really good product"
7/17/2015,20150717,5,4.25,"I love uni as much as the next person, but its all about the squid udon. The squid was moist, not chewy and covered in the tiny little fish eggs. Delicious. The uni udon was good, but it was more cream with tiny bits of udon than any actual uni taste and flavor. I can't wait to come back here to try all the udon specialities. This is hands down the best udon I have ever had. It was light, perfectly chewy and soaked up all the flavor of the broth."
7/17/2015,20150717,5,4.25,"Oh my gosh you have no idea what udon is like unless you've gone here. Personally, this is the best udon-specialized restaurant in SoCal from my experience. I came here with a few friends, and here's a breakdown of what we had:Udon Gratin - It's what it sounds like. Udon noodles, baked like a gratin with onions and chicken. Cheesy and interesting. It's very heavy though (I was so full before it was half gone) and there's actually a lot of cheese, which was a bit much for my tastes.The udon noodles are as good as it gets - perfectly chewy and full of flavor. The dish itself was surprisingly good for what it sounds like.Sea Urchin Udon - Everyone here on Yelp raves about this dish, and boy they should! The udon noodles are chewy and just plain delicious. The sauce itself was even better. The best I can describe it is it tasted like an amazing combination of seafood. Definitely worth the $15. According to my friend (who ordered the dish), it is a bit heavy and creamy so it fills you up pretty fast.Beef Rice Bowl & Pork Belly Rice Bowl - Almost as good as their udon, really. The bowl was much smaller than what I was expecting (for the Pork Belly anyway, I had the beef rice bowl as a side to my udon) but I was still blown away by the quality. The meat is delicious and perfectly cooked, the rice wasn't all too bad either. It was a bit pricey for the portion, but still surprisingly filling.The portions for the udon itself looked small compared to the bowl it was served in, but it was incredibly filling. Definitely worth the money spent.TDLR; Udon is the best thing you'll find in SoCal and rice bowls aren't too bad. Go for the udon though, you won't regret, especially the Sea Urchin Udon. Will definitely come here again."
7/19/2015,20150719,4,4.25,"Marugame Monzo serves up some pretty delicious and creative udon dishes. I ordered the Uni udon which was pretty delicious; it was creamy yet not too heavy with small bits of uni. The handmade udon noodles are perfectly chewy, not too hard and not too soft, just the right texture. I do wish they would've given a more generous amount of uni pieces considering the price but the flavor was definitely apparent in the cream sauce. The girlfriend got the curry udon which was just aite; we both thought the curry was a bit too soupy than what we would've liked. The negitoro rice bowl we got to share was bomb.The wait can definitely get long here as there is fairly limited seating. I would say try to come in just a party of 2 as it's much easier to get seating this way. We skipped past many parties of 4 before us waiting to get a table."
7/20/2015,20150720,4,4.25,"Normally I wouldn't wait over an hour for a bowl of noodles, but since it's my first time, I thought why not...I tried their uni udon and it was really rich and creamy, I thought it it would have more uni but I only found like a little bitty piece in my bowl. I really liked that the udon was made in house! Nothing can beat fresh!! The portion however was not very filling. I was still pretty hungry after the meal... I wouldn't wait an hour again for their udon, but it was definitively worth a try!"
7/20/2015,20150720,5,4.25,"Definitely my ultimate favorite udon spot. After hearing so many rave reviews, I'm so glad to say I finally tried it and fell in love with itt!Luckily, the time I went there was no wait, which made this place even better! My friend and I was seated right away. I ordered the beef udon and she ordered the uni udon. First off, I love how their udon noodles are made fresh on the spot. It's sooooooo delicious. My beef udon was really simple and good! The Uni udon was also really good too. It's super creamy!! There's also rice bowls and little appetizers you can add on!Service was fantastic!Quite pricey though!"
7/20/2015,20150720,5,4.25,"Very fresh and flavorful! At first I was not into this place but once I actually tried the food it was Delish! I got the beef udon with added soft boiled egg, chili oil and seaweed. Noodles were thick but sooooo fresh and good!! For appetizer we tried the beef tartar which was also petty good."
7/21/2015,20150721,4,4.25,"Fresh hand made udon. Texture so bueno!sat at the bar and watched this guy magically rolled out a sheet of perfectly squared dough then cutting it into bundles of udon.got the uni cream udon, nothing like Ive ever seen. a bowl of creamy soupy udon with flecks of uni. noodles was really the star here. it was a little weird with the cream sauce being so soupy, but overall, an indulgent creamy delight. it was not overly heavy that made me super full.service was quick and friendly. nice place to grab a quick lunch."
7/23/2015,20150723,3,4.25,"The noodles are Doug-E Fresh! The broth is a light abundant dashi that compliments the udon well, however the ratio of soup to noodles is like the ratio of men to women in China. The soft boiled tempura eggs are good, but you can get better ones at the tendon place inside of mitsuwa food courts. What prevents this from scoring above a 3? Well, it's next to daikokuya which is a 5 - and for good reason. Also, there's hella gnats up in this place - dude, I'd rather not swat gnats when I'm eating."
7/23/2015,20150723,5,4.25,"Udon-lovers must try this place. It is the best I've had in CA so far. I love that the udon is freshly made. It is both chewy and soft. That is how all noodles should be. I had the Duck Udon and Uni Udon. The duck was cooked to perfection: tender, tasty, but it did not have that gamey taste. Duck is not an easy thing to cook and they did it well. The broth tasted like love and hours of cooking. Uni Udon was surprisingly delicious. Marugame Monzo is the only place that I know offering this dish. The Uni sauce was creamy and smoth. It did not taste fishy. I might prefer Uni Udon over Uni pasta."
7/25/2015,20150725,4,4.25,The best udon I've had. They make the noodles fresh and it shows. The broth is excellent. Had the butter squid udon and its the bomb. The portions are perfect - not too much and not too little. Complemented the udon with a Sapporo and I was in heaven.
7/25/2015,20150725,5,4.25,Customer service :4/5Quality of Food:5/5Price: $10~20 /per Always happy with Uni cream udon:)
7/26/2015,20150726,5,4.25,"Came here on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. First, it is not a strict vegetarian-friendly spot save for the pumpkin and shiso (mint) tempura and edamame, as I am sure the dipping sauces have a fish flavoring. But I overlooked that and thoroughly enjoyed the ume shiso udon with the freshly made udon, as well as the pumpkin tempura."
7/26/2015,20150726,5,4.25,"YES YES YES. Fresh udon- the chef was making fresh noodles VERY often, which made it fun to watch too! HUGE portions. Shrimp tempura- amazing. Get here EARLY- we got there a few minutes after it opened and there was already a line (parties of 2 were seated easily though). Small place inside too- tables were very close together, but it didn't matter because the udon was SOOOO good!!Clean bathrooms too! My only grip is the awful parking!!"
7/27/2015,20150727,4,4.25,"Mmmm... That mentai squid udon hit the spot. Fun tempura soft boiled egg was well fried. Was disappointed in the pork belly don since I was expecting a thick slab of grilled pork belly, but it did it's job and fed me. Uni cream udon was very tasty, but since I only tried it from my friend's bowl, it was great. I can imagine it being a very heavy dish where you're looking for a bed after this meal though. Would go back!"
7/28/2015,20150728,4,4.25,The restaurant is cozy with dim lighting and small tables. I got the shrimp tempura udon both times -- and was satisfied both times. The servers were always attentive and kept my glass full. Love this place!!
7/28/2015,20150728,5,4.25,My favorite noodle place in LA. Delicious hand cut chewy udon. I always get the squid butter or uni cream.
7/28/2015,20150728,5,4.25,"Home made noddles. I had the Beef Udon and it was delicious, it hit the spot. Customer service was great!"
7/29/2015,20150729,5,4.26,"Amazing squid in butter sauce udon, makes me hungry just thinking about it. Delicious, creamy and melts in your mouth! Sadly the portion is so small for the price you pay."
7/30/2015,20150730,5,4.26,"This is the combined review of 2 recent visits. I like that they specialize in udon - ever since I saw their store name next to Nijiya Market in Torrance, I wanted to try it so I searched up this location in Little Tokyo. Never was able to find decently priced parking here, but the food keeps me coming back. Their menu is extensive, so there's plenty that I want to try and devour. Everything they do that's fried, is delicious. Especially like the Fried Chicken and Crispy Chicken Skin appetizers. Also delicious is the lightly fried tempura shrimp that you can add-on to the udon. It's slightly different tempura'ed compared to the shrimp in the assorted kusiage appetizer, which I feel is heavier fried. Beef tataki is yummy as well, and the OK dishes for me are the Negitoro Roll and Scallop Carpaccio.As far as udon goes, sit by the counter. I enjoy witnessing the cooks in action - and all the different types of food that comes out to be served. However, I've yet to find a udon that I've really really liked. Kakuni Udon and Curry Udon were just decent to me, though the braised pork in the kakuni udon was pretty good and the udon is tender. Have to try more of their menu items, to properly evaluate their total scope of work."
7/30/2015,20150730,4,4.26,"SO. SO. SO. GOOD. If you really LOVE rich tasting foods, absolutely do yourself a favor and get the uni udon. When I say love, I mean that you would be in heaven with a huge plate of uni, pound of foie gras, block of cheese, bowl of egg yolks, and __insert heart attack inducing food here__). If you don't share this type of love, still get the uni udon and share it with someone. My boyfriend and brother found this dish a little too rich to finish alone. I, on the other hand, had NO problem finishing it without help. The sauce is deliciously creamy, the udon is perfectly chewy, and there is plenty of uni throughout the dish. CHECK UNDER YOUR SHISO LEAF! There's a load of uni under it. The squid and mentaiko udon was yummy, but I probably wouldn't order it again. There are just too many other things to try!The beef tataki was SUCH a disappointment. It seriously tasted like cold/room temp. steak that was left out the entire afternoon before it was sliced up and topped with oil, pink peppercorns, and relish. I don't understand the hype behind this dish AT ALL. Service was great! They were really nice and were appropriately attentive. The wait does grow extremely fast. We came around 6:45 and there was no wait. We decided to wait until 7 to start walking over from our metered spot. The wait turned into 25-30 minutes on a Tuesday. #TURNUP. Come early if you're not willing to wait."
8/1/2015,20150801,5,4.26,"Best Udon I've ever had. Don't think you like Udon, try this! He rolls it out while you watch like an Italian pasta master. Then, there's the fantastic chicken skin appetizer. My two favorites are the Mentai squid butter and another seafood one that I can't remember the name of. Fantastic place. Go!"
8/2/2015,20150802,4,4.26,"Their uni udon is very good. Thick, chewy fresh noodles in a sauce that tastes like lobster bisque. I also got a side of their veggie tempura and it was really good- hot and crispy!Their tuna rice bowl is delicious too, chopped up fresh tuna with a nice creamy sauce- I would definitely get this again! I also got their beef bowl which was chopped up beef on top of rice, filling, simple, and good. Their regular udon was good too but nothing too unique, other than the noodles."
8/3/2015,20150803,5,4.26,"Hands down, the best hand made Udons in Los Angeles. I love the chewiness, and dare to say bounciness of the udon! I love Marugame Monzo because they not only have the traditional Japanese udon broths, but they also have different creamy sauces, and seafood to add to your Udon soups!My go-to items here have always been the Mentai Squid Butter, or the Uni Udon. The boyfriend has gotten the Curry Udon here and loves it. It comes with beef cooked in with the curry sauce also! For the hungry folks, Marugame Monzo offers the option of *extra noodles* for a couple bucks extra! It's totally worth it because your bowl doubles in size. Not for the faint eaters because it really is a lot of food. If anyone has ever been to Marikame Udon in Waikiki, its really comparable. Except here, there's more broth options."
8/3/2015,20150803,3,4.26,"I think this place is more hype than anything else.. The food wasn't bad or anything but it was nothing more than average. Yes, the udon noodles were good but I thought it was slightly undercooked. The uni pasta was one of the better ones that I've had. Flavor wasn't too strong and I didn't think it was extremely heavy (granted, I didn't really ""drink"" any of the soup) but it wasn't amazing. You also get like 5 specks of micro-uni..We also ordered the shrimp tempura udon and again, nothing special. The egg tempura, as amazing as it looks, is pretty flavorless and bland. It's just a soft-boiled egg that's been fried.. Not that special..The chicken karaage was the best out of everything we ordered and even then I didn't think it stood out from any of the other places I've been to. I really don't think that this place is worth waiting 1+ hours and even with no wait, I don't think I'd come back."
8/3/2015,20150803,5,4.26,Superb! Katame (Al Dente) Udon noodle brings you back to Japan. We had the Uni Cream Udon and the Kamage Udon (dipping style). Uni udon didn't have a strong Uni flavor and was more creamy and thick tomato cream tasting. Kamage Udon texture was Al Dente and broth strong and flavorful. a must try.
8/4/2015,20150804,4,4.26,"Came here on Keto diet.Didn't even get a lick of the Udon, but still good. I had the pork salad with a side of braised pork and that beef dish. Everything tasted wonderful, and even the salad wasn't half bad. One day I'll come back for the Udon, but until then, I'd definitely return just for the appetizers and sides."
8/6/2015,20150806,4,4.26,"Some of the soupy udons were so plain it left much to be desired, but overall I like the food. We ordered a few apps, uni udon with tempura fried egg, duck udon and another udon, but I can't recall what it was... It was good, but portions are so big that to go is definitely necessary. I'd come back, especially for the uni udon. I'm a fanatic."
8/6/2015,20150806,5,4.26,"Everything is just awesome there. great udon, great rice bowls. problems r the line is always hella long and it's really hard to park there."
8/8/2015,20150808,4,4.26,"The food tastes amazing fresh and delicious. Their udon is handmade onsite and the full of favor. We have the butter squid udon and the soup fills with fish egg. Very tender and we cannot get enough of it. The pork belly adds sesame giving such wonderful aroma and the rice adds green onion, salt and pepper on puffy rice. We also have the cold noodle with softboiled egg and very unique experience. Very refreshing during the summer time and fills with favor. The only downsize is the wait and the seats are very small."
8/8/2015,20150808,2,4.25,Disappointed after 3 tries. The first time I came here was a Japanese guy whose the noodle very chewy. The second and third time I went the Japanese chief was no longer making the noodle. The noodle that the current chief made was like regular udon from any supermarket.
8/9/2015,20150809,5,4.26,"What a delightful Japanese culinary experience! Although this place is small (it is kind of the prerequisite for a Japanese place), the food definitely packs various bursts of flavor. The thing that catches your eye about this place is their udon. The most popular dish that they have is the Sea Urchin Creamy Udon. It is great if you are splitting the dishes amongst your friends although I cannot see myself eating a whole bowl of that creamy udon by myself. We also had a chance to try their regular beef udon which was pretty good. I appreciated the fact the udon noodles were made fresh, literally right in front of your face. Also, we had the beef tataki which was good and really chewy. I wasn't really a fan of the pork belly don as it lacked flavor. Finally, we had two helpings of the miso garlic clams. It was really that good! We waited for approximately 20 minutes to be seated which wasn't bad considering it was a Saturday evening. As a warning, you can only use 2 credit cards per bill so if you have a large party, make sure that everyone brings cash."
8/9/2015,20150809,4,4.26,"I love udon. I've always wanted to.come here. be prepared to wait 45 min to an hour tho. I ordered the wrong thing however it was still good. I ordered the udpn gratin. It was a bit too rich and thick for me. Its very creamy, udon was very bouncy..but I guess it was late at night...so a lighter broth would probably be better. Had a bite of the uni udon. Very good. And the clam udon...I forgot the name. But that's good and lighter to the taste. We also ordered beef tataki, it was good but a thicker cut than other places so the crust was a bit too hard. Yuzu ichiko - didn't like it. It was just way too sweet. Will def go back and try something else."
8/9/2015,20150809,4,4.25,"Located in Little Tokyo, Marugame Monzo serves up delicious bowls of fresh hand-pulled udon. We ordered the uni udon and squid butter udon. The uni udon broth was very rich and creamy. In my opinion, the broth would have benefited had more uni (only one slice) and less creamy. The squid butter was flavorful. The udon noodles were perfectly cooked and chewy."
8/10/2015,20150810,4,4.25,"LIKES: - Udon is always cooked perfectly al dente...'cause they roll it themselves :)- LOVE LOVE LOVE the Vongole udon (udon in clear broth with mussels). - Pork belly salad doesn't look super amazing, but it tastes amazing.- Clean, cool decor. Consider yourself lucky if you get a counter spot and can get a free show (no, not that kind of free show...) watching the chefs hand roll and cut the noodles.- Service is decent. GRIPES:- They don't do takeout :(- Parking here is tough - you can get free metered parking after 8pm, but metered spots are also rare.- Not a ton of great veggie options. (Fine for me since I eat meat and seafood, but just a heads up if you're of the vegetarian persuasion.)- Wait can be long, and if you're not there when they call you, you have to re-sign up on the list!Overall, a unique, delicious dining experience and my go-to spot for udon. Great place to take guests from out-of-town."
8/11/2015,20150811,5,4.26,"Marugame Monzo has a variety of udon and they are all very tasty! I love the open kitchen where you can see the chef rolling and cutting fresh udon. It makes for a very enjoyable eating experience seeing how the udon is made. The choices are plentiful - hot soup udon, cream based udon, dipping udon, udon salad, and cold udon! I tried the cold udon with salmon roe on my last visit, and it was absolutely refreshing and satisfying! It came with a generous portion of udon, topped with grated daikon, shredded seaweed, and salmon roe, and served with a light shoyu sauce on the side for added flavor. I would highly recommend this on a hot day. If you are looking for something hot and creamy, the sea urchin udon is a wonderful choice. Also must get is the soft boiled egg which always comes with the yolk still nice and runny.I like coming on Sundays when street parking is free in DTLA. Service is efficient, and the wait for two hasn't been too bad even during meal times."
8/12/2015,20150812,4,4.25,"I had only a few hours away from work when I could indulge in all that LA had to offer. In 3 hours I tried to stuff a week's worth of food. It started slightly before this but only slightly (see review of confection/mochi). I took an uber here and made sure to be early. The ramen place already had a line but they open 1/2 hour earlier than here.I lined up a few minutes before it opened and did not get seated in the first wave. The better to stare at the food. And people eat quickly so I was not waiting for long. The choices, the choices. Both the squid and the uni got many many reviews. I almost got both but they do not have take out containers for the udon. So I got only the uni cream. And it was real cream and lots of it. A little overwhelming on a hot day. But uni is uni is uni.If they could have made a lite version, I would have appreciated it. The udon was good if slightly over cooked. The broth versions looked very good. I'll have to come back, hopefully not for a trial since it that is a major time suck."
8/12/2015,20150812,5,4.26,"I'm a noodler and love udon. Kotohira was my favorite for many years, but this place is at another level.If you're a yelper, you are aware of groupthink or herd mentality. A ton of people swear by uni  udon or as I have heard people order here as ""u knee u don"". That's cool, but I've had their carbonara twice which is a huge stretch from from carbonara which is simply egg, guanciale, and dop pecorino (got all that in my fridge). Ok, there's a cool factor here as I usually sit at the window where they make fresh udon right in front of you.I'm also a traditionalist, so I've have their tempura udon a few times and it's awesome. The tempura itself it way up there. I typically order the tempura appetizer with one giant shrimp and veggies (where do they find shrimp that big?) because I love their tempura so much.My favorite for the last four times and maybe forever is their Zaru Udon. You can't get any pure than this as it's the cooked noodle served cold with a dipping sauce along with daikon radish, green onion, ginger, and tempura flakes. I usually dump half my sauce, half of the green onion, and a quarter of the daikon along with a pinch of ginger into the dipping bowl and adjust from there. You get the chew freshness of the noodle which is not continually cooking in a hot broth and you can taste the quality of the noodle without being affected by absorbing the broth. It's totally clean and refreshing. When you dip the noodle into the cool dipping sauce it's crazy good. The dipping sauce is not simply udon dashi, but it has a touch of sweetness, savory goodness of additional soy sauce (shoyu), and more intense dashi. I can only describe it as sort of mind boggling for me as a cook who loves udon. It's worth trying this dish especially when the weather is hot as it's refreshing, savory, highlights the fresh udon, and absolutely delicious."
8/13/2015,20150813,5,4.26,"tip: sit at the bar, watch the udon making before your eyes.At $15, the uni udon is on the expensive side but it is worth it because it's chewy, fresh, and the creamy uni broth is absolutely delicious if you like sea urchin. I wouldn't recommend getting the side of soft boiled egg because it is deep fried instead of actually boiled. The other sides are literally on the side with a small plate. They are not mixed into the noodles so it might be smart to ask if they could mix some of the desired sides in there.Overall, great place for fresh made udon right next to daikokuya."
8/13/2015,20150813,3,4.26,"There has been lots of hype about this place that I thought maybe It's THAT great.Well, guess my expectations are not met.First impression:Beef tataki has a ... Mexican influence?I thought this is going to be the authentic Japanese Beet tataki experience. Filled with smoky flavor of the lightly seared beef smeared with black pepper sauce. Then the dish came and I was disappointed. It was good, but NOT great. The beef quality isn't top-notch either. Second impression:Overly salty.I ordered the tomato cream seafood udon. Okay. It was creamy and yummy, but really too salty. Also wish they had put other things besides shrimp and scallop.Servers were rushing us the whole time guess it's coz the line outside.meh."
8/13/2015,20150813,2,4.25,"Just okay udon, but disappointing for a couple reasons. Being a noodle lover, I've had this place bookmarked for a while and finally got the chance to try it with a friend. We came on around 5pm on a weekday--still pretty early and no wait. Skimming through the menu, the pictures of the different bowls of udon looked pretty promising. We opted for the Uni sea urchin udon and Mentai Squid butter creamy udon.The names definitely sounded appetizing, but the dishes were such a let down. First of all, both of our dishes came out lukewarm so that made me less excited already. Then, the udon was overcooked and didn't have that chewy, bouncy al-dente texture that fresh udon is supposed to have. The uni udon was just alright--very few tiny its of uni mixed in with a creamy uni broth. Couldn't taste much of the uni though, the broth wasn't super thick. EMC's version kicks this one out of the ball park for sure. Pushing the uni udon aside, I was hopeful that the mentai squid butter udon would be redeeming, but it turned out to be an even bigger disappointment. The soup was very watered down and it was like eating udon and water. Also only came with like 3 tiny slices of squid...and that itself was $15. Kinda ridic. Don't get me wrong--the dishes weren't horrible, but I wasn't really impressed with any of the food. The bill also came out to be about $30 for 2 bowls of udon so it can definitely get pricey."
8/14/2015,20150814,5,4.25,"Delicious udon place in J-town!! All the noodles are handmade in store! You can watch them in action while you eat! Their udon selection is phenomenal - I couldn't make up my mind! We ended up ordering a beef udon with an extra tempura egg, pork belly udon & the creamy Uni udon! Boy was is satisfying! Please come open one in Hong Kong!"
8/14/2015,20150814,5,4.25,"Long waiting list!! Spent more than 50 mins with my mom for their Uni undo, it's totally worth it！"
8/15/2015,20150815,5,4.26,"Came here with my cousin and boyfriend to eat with a Youtuber and his brother. I've never heard of this place until he asked to meet up here. Came here around 11:30AM right when it opens on a Friday and it was already packed. I order uni udon ($16) and my boyfriend ordered the squid butter udon ($13). We also got tempura fish and vegetables. I am very amazed by both the uni and squid udon. The uni is more on the sweet side and really creamy. It reminds me of warm ice cream in uni flavor. There are also pieces of uni in it! I wanted to drink the soup but I was really full from the udon. The squid udon is fish roe based. It's more on the salty buttery side. It's really odd to me, but it's really good. The squid was really tender and almost had the texture of fish. Can't go wrong with either bowls. The udon is also really good! It's handmade and you can see them make it! ALSO, the Youtuber and his brother ordered a side of egg to go with their udon bowls and guess what?! It's freaking fried with tempura batter. How freaking awesome. I didn't try the tempura fish or vegetables but my boyfriend said it was really good! The place is small and kinda hot. I just wish it had the AC blastin' so I wouldn't have to sweat so much. I recommend parking at the hotel nearby for $6 all day or there's also cheaper parking for $3 a little further. It's cheaper than paying for meter especially when there's a wait for this small and cozy place."
8/17/2015,20150817,5,4.26,"I used to live in Shikoku, Japan, where Udon is originally came from. The Monzo is the real deal. People, THIS IS UDON, not Udon-ish noodle!I was tired of looking for the genuine Udon restaurant in America, and I was telling to myself ""ok, you should try Udon in Japan, because you're in America..""I tried a restaurant called Sanuki sth(I don't even remember the name exactly) in Gardena, and many of my friends recommended it. Actually the restaurant has a lot of pictures of famous stars trying their Udon over there, but their Udon did not deserve the price. (Basically Udon costs about $5-$7 in Shikoku)This restaurant is cheaper, and genuine. I can recommend this to even my family in Japan! Whatever style Udon you try, the heart of Udon is the noodle itself. So whatever you order, you are having the real Udon. Some said their original flavors are not Japanese food, but you know, who wants to try the restaurant that stops seeking the better flavor? I love their Miso Carbonara Udon. You cannot find it in Japan. Only here. Yeah this is MUST-TRY restaurant if you want to say ""I know Udon!"""
8/18/2015,20150818,5,4.26,"Not sure if I would have waited if there was a line but since there was no wait at 1 PM on a Monday, all good! My friend and I both got the sea urchin udon. So good! So flavorful and creamy. Yum. I sprinkled some of the shichimi (red chili pepper flakes) on and it gave it a little kick. I will be craving this soon. I already know it. Next time I want to try the different lunch special bowls."
8/19/2015,20150819,5,4.26,"I took the metro here because it's right across the street from the Gold Line stop, which is super convenient since I hate having to find parking in this area. So if you have that option, I highly suggest you use it! We came around 9pm on a weekday with no wait time, luckily, because the place is very small.Anyway, this is hands down best udon I've ever had. I love that it's made right in front of you and it's cooked to a perfect al dente. They have the usual Japanese flavors but the best part is the nontraditional versions of udon. It's probably one of the few restaurants I've come across that is strictly udon and it's all very creative.For an appetizer we ordered the fried chicken skin, which was really delicious and not greasy like you would expect. It has a nice crisp to it and the sauce it comes with makes it so much better. For our main course, I ordered the Udon Gratin and my sister ordered the Uni Udon and of course we got the soft boiled eggs on the side. It gets a little pricey, but you get huge portions and we both ended up taking leftovers home. The Udon Gratin was very heavy and cheesy but I enjoyed it! The texture was amazing and this dish was flavorful. It was like a Japanese take on an Italian pasta and they nailed it. I tried a bit of the Uni Udon as well which was also great. Uni is already rich in flavor and some people aren't able to handle the taste, but the dish is cooked to perfection and isn't overbearing.I would definitely not mind a wait time next time I come back here. It's so worth it!"
8/20/2015,20150820,5,4.26,"The food here is amazing.We've been to Japan several times and its been hard finding authentic noodles, and I'm sick of my husband complaining about sub-par ramen...thus we move on to the Udon.We love this place. The udon is cooked perfectly--al dente. The uni udon was amazing--creamy and perfectly set off the cream and the udon. We also got the tempura: well cooked. The soft boiled egg tempura which was an amazing play of flavors and textures. Also got the mini beef bowl--the meat was tender and had just the right amount of fat, we also got the hot dipping noodles, which was a perfect compliment to the rich uni udon.The only irritating thing was that there were little fly's flying around--in the restaurant and in the bathroom- hope they take care of those."
8/21/2015,20150821,5,4.26,"I want Marugame Monzo closer to my house!!! It has been a couple weeks since we went there, and we still talk about this place!! Everything we tried was good. I had oroshi mentai which is perfect for a hot day or when you are not super hungry since this dish is super refreshing. My husband tried uni cream udon. Man, that was heavenly! Rich and flavorful. My kids had curry udon and oroshi ikura, which are also very good. Their udon is freshly made in front of you. The service was a little awkward since they had trouble processing our order somehow, but it does not stop me from wanting their udon at all!!!"
8/22/2015,20150822,3,4.26,"Everyone raves about their uni udon so of course that's what we ordered. It's good but beware, it's extremely rich and thick. You can dip French bread in the sauce because it's that thick. I stopped eating it half way through because it was too rich. My husband ordered the curry udon which I thought was better. Give it a try if you like uni but we most likely will not return."
8/24/2015,20150824,3,4.26,"I was really excited to check out Marugame Monzo. I came here on a Sunday for an early dinner and got here around 5:30pm and there was a festival going on outside. The wait was about 30 minutes. The restaurant is pretty small, with only a couple of tables for larger groups. We were lucky and got seated in front of the glass wall where we could see fresh udon being made. The staff here were all really nice. We ordered one udon dish, since the portion looked pretty large and filling. We got the Mentai Squid Butter Udon with cod roe, butter sauce and squid and onions. The udon was definitely good, but honestly I could only enjoy a couple bites of it before getting tired of it. I guess overall, I enjoyed the broth better than the udon itself. Marugame Monzo is definitely an udon lovers dream, but I guess I should also say that I'm not a huge udon fan. We ordered the Fried Chicken and Fried Chicken Skin and both were pretty delicious. The Fried Chicken Skin was a little different than what I was used to, but it was different in a good and fatty way. The Fried Chicken was tender and the seasoning was good as well. I love almost everything with egg and when I saw the Soft Boiled Egg Tempura, I had to get it. The yolk was nice and golden and runny, very good. But overall, I didn't really enjoy it as much as I had hoped. I didn't like the the tempura batter on the egg. I ended up peeling half of the batter off and enjoying the soft boiled egg on its own. Overall, I'd come back again and try something else...but I don't think I'd want to wait more than 30 minutes for it."
8/24/2015,20150824,5,4.26,"We met here for an early lunch today and were totally impressed with the whole experience! We were seated immediately having arrived just after noon. I was torn between choosing their Sea Urchin Cream Udon and Mentai Squid Butter Udon... But I was completely pleased and pleasantly surprised with my decision: The Mentai Squid Butter Udon was incredible! The freshly made noodles were very tasty and served with super tender pieces of squid and tiny squid eggs. I don't think I've had a better bowl of udon!The service was VERY good - quick and attentive - the entire time we were there. And our food came out incredibly fast! Our waitress kindly told us that checks could be split between two cards only (useful tip!) along with cash, if necessary. We left absolutely content and will definitely be back."
8/25/2015,20150825,3,4.26,"I love that Marugame Monzo tries to do a fresh take on udon with their specialty dishes! Although I appreciate their creativity, the overall taste for the price you pay and the frequently long wait times make Marugame Monzo only okay for me.The uni cream udon is pretty heavy but good, in the same way alfredo pasta is delicious--it is so rich, but it also just sits in your stomach at the end, making you feel a little too full (even if you only ate half your portion). What was disappointing was the lack of uni in the cream--you can see bits and pieces, but the flavor was not very strong and no piece was large enough to get excited about.As for the mentai squid butter--the broth is clear (if you ignore the mentai scattered throughout the soup), but I found it to be a little too salty. Again, I didn't really taste a super strong seafood flavor, but I did appreciate the large chunks of squid.Given that you're paying $12-16 + tax for a bowl of udon, I think the prices run a little steep. I know that seafood is considered a premium ingredient, but I still don't really think the prices are entirely justifiable. However, their business is booming--we waited for 40 min on a Saturday evening, and people were willing to wait 60+ min by the time we got seated."
8/26/2015,20150826,5,4.26,"Oh my. The handmade udon noodles with sea urchin was to die for. It tasted better with ever slurp which was not at all expected. It was worth the extra calories. Another thing, the service was noticeable good. Servers were kind, pleasant and the kitchen staff worked fast. I can't wait to take my bestie for her birthday. She loves both noodles and sea urchin!"
8/27/2015,20150827,5,4.26,"Best udon in all of LA, hands down!!! I've had the shrimp tempura udon and the uni udon. Both are to DIE for!!!! The wait is reasonable (around 30-45 minutes on the weekends)."
8/28/2015,20150828,4,4.26,"Next door to the super poppin Daikokuya, Monzo serves up Udon instead of ramen. Even though this place is poppin as well I feel like it's option 1b a lot of the time. I've been here quite a few times and I've seen people put their names down for both places with this as more of a backup.So anyways the best thing about this Udon place is the... Pork Belly Rice Bowl. That's right, I said it, and I'll say it again Pork Belly Rice Bowl!!!! Yeah the Udon is good too but that rice bowl is just so good. Rice with Pork Belly topped with sesame oil and salt it's just delishhhhhhh. Add it onto any udon dish for an extra $3. On it's own it's $5.45. I've thought about just getting two rice bowls but I love sipping on broth when I eat so it's nice to have both Udon AND the rice bowl. I've tried the beef rice bowl too and it doesn't hold a candle to the pork belly. Now the Udon is pretty good don't get me wrong. They make it right in front there in front of you. If you want an extra close up you could sit at the bar and watch them roll up and slice your noodles TMZ style. They also have a pretty big variety of Udon dishes to choose from. They have cold udon which I haven't tried yet but my coworker did. It doesn't come with broth, just a little saucer of liquid you pour over. They have their regular Udon dishes with broth. I personally like the most simple ones with just Tofu or Tempura flakes. Not only is it cheaper but the ones I've tried with meat I really didn't like the meat. Then they have the crazy pasta like Udon dishes which are superrrrr heavy. I don't know if you can eat a whole dish like that since it is so rich but they are quite tasty. Also, I think the water they give you isn't tap. That's pretty amazing to me. It can get crowded like I stated so expect to wait 15-30 mins. And don't forget to add on a Pork Belly Rice Bowl."
8/28/2015,20150828,4,4.26,"I love Monzo! Cream uni udon and pork belly rice bowl. My perfect combo.Flavorful pork belly slices, perfectly peppered rice, yum yum yum! The udon is very creamy, velvety. Although, they can be a tad more generous with the uni though... The staff is just a tad negligent, but oh well.. asian restaurants... what can i say.... *shrugs*Careful though, they don't validate in the parking lot, and during dinner time do be prepared for a wait list out the door."
8/29/2015,20150829,3,4.26,"Was underwhelmed by the udon especially with all the hyped reviews. Got the mentai butter squid udon and uni udon which appeared to be the top faves. The butter squid had a light broth, and the squid was tender - almost tasted like fish instead of squid - but overall the flavor was underwhelming. Same with the uni udon - light and creamy broth that looks heavy but is light and you can even drink it - but you could only taste a slight hint of uni flavor. The udon noodles are handmade; they pretty much tasted like regular udon to me but more on the al dente side. They have quite the variety of udon dishes.Overall I thought it was just OK and nothing particularly memorable that would bring me back right away."
8/30/2015,20150830,5,4.26,"Located right next to Daikokuya, these two shops make the powerhouse of japanese food in ramen and udon. Although I have been here on numerous occasions, I haven't written a review, so I will talk about my most recent experience. I came in for lunch and could not be seated until our whole party was here. Once we were seated, we ordered quickly as we were in a rush, and the food came out within minutes! I love how the udon is handmade right in front of you, and you can definitively taste the difference between packaged and fresh made udon. We ended up getting the bukkake udon and the uni cream udon. The bukkake udon was light and refreshing, and had a nice aromatic soy infused broth. The noodles were extra long and were good tasting noodles. The uni cream udon was more on the heavier side, but the flavor was very rich and creamy! I can't decide if I like this one or the cheese baked udon better. Both are super hearty and could last me two meals if I wanted! Marugame Monzo not only delivers fresh made and delicious udon, but also consistency that you can always rely on. As one of the only udon shops in LA, there's not really a restaurant that can beat the quality and price of this joint!"
8/30/2015,20150830,4,4.26,The Uni udon was good. I just wish it had more udon in the pasta. I received a small handful and it wasn't filling at all. The sauce also didn't have enough Uni in it. I think if they had put more Uni in the sauce blend then it would have tasted better. The soup spoons were horrible because it was hard to scoop the sauce onto my spoon and also the slight flavor that you get from the wood threw the pasta off balance a bit. It could just be me tho because my palate is so sensitive. The creamy consistency was great and the roe that goes in tastes like it was fermented in sake for a few days. That was pretty cool. I went around 1:30 with a friend and we only waited 15 minutes to be seated. I'll be back to try their other udon. Btw few other yelpers claim that their udon is cooked al dente but it's not. It was too soft but went well with the Uni cream.
8/30/2015,20150830,1,4.25,"Their service is horrible!!!! A friend and I went for dinner and the server completely forgot to place my order in the kitchen. When we inquired, instead of just apologizing and telling us that there either was a misunderstanding or the order has been misplaced, the server blamed us and told us that I didn't tell her! She was giving us attitude all night! Not to mention there was a lady that was about to leave after signing for their payment. The servers looked at the credit card receipt and ran after her and told her that she NEEDS to put TIP!!!! Unbelievable! Will never ever ever eat there again and will tell everyone to never go there again."
8/31/2015,20150831,4,4.25,"Long wait, next time, I will come on an off hour.The udon was good (Bukkake udon - it was cold udon, and you pour sauce over it), but I don't know if I would wait that long for it again. Definitely want to come back and try the hot udon as winter comes upon us..."
8/31/2015,20150831,4,4.25,"A must-try udon restaurant in Little Tokyo! Every udon I've tried are great, especially the uni udon. It's so creamy with rich taste of uni. Their udon is hand-made in the restaurant and you can look at how they make it while waiting. I also had a beef don and it's really yummy. Their tempura is also worth to try, it has the right amount of batter and fried to crispy with beautiful color."
9/1/2015,20150901,3,4.25,"Only tried the uni udon, but now I wish we had looked at some more reviews and went for the rice bowls as well. The udon noodles were probably some of the best I've had, very spongy and full texture. The uni cream broth on the other hand was a bit overpowering. It's a cool thing to get because it's probably not found elsewhere, but it was just too strong for me. A bit much on the uni taste, the creaminess, as well as the saltiness. Especially considering that biting into each roe egg was an additional burst of seafood flavor in my mouth. I would return but try some other things next time."
9/1/2015,20150901,3,4.25,"Salty. And Salty. Been here about three times. I don't remember it being this salty. Neither I nor my guest were impressed. The Pork Belly rice was good, as usual, but that too was a bit over salted. Tried the Vongole udon, which was decent, but nothing really tying it all together, just some decently prepared seafood with some udon in a salty broth. I'd pass on it."
9/3/2015,20150903,5,4.25,"Bukakke Udon........+ $2.00 for a double portion. LOL Anyway on with the review!It's small store located right next to Daikokuya in Little Tokyo, space is limited so you may have to put your name on the list and wait a bit. Its worth the wait though! Ordered the Shiso Mentai Udon (cold udon), along with the Sea Urchin Cream Udon, to sample a hot and a cold udon. The make their own noodles in the shop and they are delicious. The shiso mentai udon was fantastic for a hot day, the cold broth was very refreshing and light and the udon was perfectly al dente the freshly grated ginger and mentai (cod roe) gave it some nice contrasting blasts of flavor to the face, err i mean taste buds. The Sea Urchin Cream Udon was a great juxtaposition from the cold udon, it was extremely rich, creamy and warm, the sauce bathed the taste buds with a luxurious coat of the buttery nutty flavor of uni. The ikura provided some nice salty pops of flavor to complement the creaminess of the uni and the fat chewy udon noodles. Turnover is quick, service is friendly and the food is tasty.You can see the guys making the noodles in the back too! Cool Place."
9/5/2015,20150905,5,4.25,You have to find parking on the street a couple blocks away but that's totally fine!We went on a Friday night at around 6pm and we just had to wait about 20 minutes? It's right next to Daikokuya as well.Very very good udon. Will definitely go back!
9/6/2015,20150906,5,4.25,"Came here after seeing photos of the infamous 'uni udon' aka sea urchin udon and it lived up to my already high expectations! Of course the creamy soup was impressive but what really had me was the quality of the handmade udon noodles, I mean you can see them making the noodles at the center of the restaurant.The udon noodles had a fresh, chewy texture which was honestly the best I've had thus far in LA. You could probably put it in any decent broth and it will taste amazing. Paired with the creamy, though heavy uni broth, it easily tasted like a dream come true for noodle lovers. Loved the fish eggs placed on top of the served bowl of noodles too. Basically there's nothing that hasn't been said yet so if you come here TRY THE UNI UDON! or any udon here for that matter because they all sound delicious tbh.With that being said, the uni soup is heavy and midway through I felt pretty full and felt like I gulped down a gallon of milk (it's that feeling). It has perfect flavor and texture, but eat it fast before that feeling hits you. Or just try it with a less heavy broth maybe.I also tasted some of the carbonara miso udon--creamy sauce also tasted quite flavorful but I'm not into bacon so the bacon pieces were a bit of a turn off for me.The portions of noodles and soup were perfect, just enough to fill you up. I ordered a tempura egg for my udon but it was totally unnecessary as the flavor of the broth overtook the egg flavor. Service was excellent, attentive and wait wasn't bad at all for an early dinner."
9/6/2015,20150906,5,4.25,Great dining experience! Never been to Japan but here the servers barely spoke English! Specialty is Udon noodlesLike:Urchin Udon - Wow! CreamyBeef UdonKakiage rice bowlWish:I can come more often to really familiarize myself with the dishes!
9/6/2015,20150906,5,4.25,I love coming here because this is the only pace I know that makes fresh udon noodle right in front of you (if you sit at the counter). Make sure that you come right when the open to reserve your spot early because anytime after that involves waiting at least 5-10 minutes to get a seat.
9/6/2015,20150906,5,4.25,Damn good. I usually don't like udon but I make an exception for Monzo. Worth the wait when it's crowded.
9/8/2015,20150908,4,4.25,"I came for the Uni Cream udon which was delicious. I have a favorite in SF's JTown that I love, but this came pretty close. Their udon was nice and chewy and that cream sauce was tasty! We also tried other udon items - again, great texture and consistency. Also loved the negitoro bowl. At first bite, that drizzled unagi sauce is a bit overpowering, but once you mix up the bowl - so complementary!The service was attentive and food was served timely. They're definitely trying to turn those tables quickly though they don't make you feel that way. Make sure you get your name on the list and stick close by as your party needs to all be present to be seated. And don't get confused with the line next door at Daikokuya Ramen as they tend to have long lines and waits as well!"
9/8/2015,20150908,4,4.25,"Came here with my boyfriend because he was craving udon. Honestly I wasn't expecting to like it that much because I don't love udon or anything, but it was really good. I got the seaweed udon and the texture of the noodles were amazing. Also, you can watch the workers cut/prepare the udon, which is interesting to watch. I liked the food here, but the store is tiny and parking can be a hassle to find in Little Tokyo, so I'm not sure when I'll be back. But I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves udon/noodles!"
9/9/2015,20150909,4,4.25,"We got seated right away.Food came at a timely matter.People poured in right after.I got the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. It was good.Best out of any uni (udon/noodles/pasta I have had). Parking is always a hassle in Little Tokyo. But it is always good to try this place out. I would have liked to see more uni in my bowl, but they put a bit more than Cafe Hiro.Thanks for the quick service. You all were kind!"
9/10/2015,20150910,4,4.25,"They make fresh udon in their kitchen and you are able to see the guy rolling and cutting the dough. I think it's pretty neat! The uni udon is bomb but I do think it was too thick to eat as udon! My family ordered 1 and we all shared, we all thought it was so good but would be too thick to eat alone. I got their beef udon which wasn't salty but the broth was a little sweet but still so bomb!!! It has the right amount of portion lots of meat and lots of beef. Beware when you order the beef bowl, it's tiny! The portion is in a small bowl. My nephew ordered it and he was not full so we ended up or sing a full order of Ramen for him. Then look on his face was priceless. The wait for this place wasn't as bad a dikokuya considering we came on a Sunday night labor day weekend. However when I was eating my udon I was thinking about Ramen the Ramen next door the whole timeMy husband ordered their beef tatai which is the seared beef. The need on top seemed seared but a lot of pieces of the bottom were extremely raw. Not sure how he felt about that one.Not sure if I would come back to this place. It was fun to try but I don't usually crave udon."
9/10/2015,20150910,4,4.25,"My brothers and I go here all the time when we are in Little Tokyo. To say the least we are big fans, though we rarely get the things all the yelpers go nuts for. We usually just get regular udon and some apps. The noodles themselves are so good here its nice to get bowls that highlight them. Our favorites, almost always with double noodles:-Zaru udon (cold dipping udon SO good)-Kitsune-soft boiled tempura egg-pork belly appetizer-bukkake udonIts especially mesmerizing if you can sit at the bar and watch them make udon noodles in front of you!"
9/11/2015,20150911,5,4.25,A bit pricey but omg the sea urchin udon is da bomb!! so goooood!! I would wanna make a trip to LA just for this dish!! yummmmmmmmmm
9/13/2015,20150913,5,4.25,Best udon and fusion udon I had in LA! The soup might all look creamy but you will finish it all. Traditional udon is extremely chewy and the fusion styles are iconic. Love it!
9/13/2015,20150913,2,4.25,"this is probably going to be biased since I usually don't care for udon.The place is really small, you probably would miss it if you walk by. We ordered the sea urchin udon, kake udon, and beef tataki. Everything was pretty standard, and worst of all they weren't even making the udon when I was there :("
9/13/2015,20150913,4,4.25,"Ugh I adore this place! Hidden next to Daikokuya in Little Tokyo, this place can be super easy to miss if you're not attentive.The wait for dinner can be long since it's small but time seems to go by quickly with all the other shops around the street. The beef tataki is amazing! The flavor is so good and the beed is always really nicely prepared. The assorted tempura is pretty good because the batter is so crunchy (which I love). They don't give enough tempura though in my opinion haha. But that's because it's so good so I want more!I've tried both the sea urchin udon and the mentai squid butter here and they were both so fricking good. The sea urchin can get a bit rich so I tend to never finish my bowl haha. The squid in the mentai squid butter udon is the best squid I've ever had! I don't know how they cook it but it's so tender and gives a nice chewy texture. The squid roe in the broth is kind of grainy though but still good!You can also see them making fresh handmade udon in the window so that's always a cool experience! The udon has such a good chewiness. Also the price is pretty reasonable here. You can pay from $9-$17 (the sea urchin obviously lol) for a bowl which isn't bad at all!"
9/13/2015,20150913,4,4.25,"Best udon noodles I ever have! I usually don't like udon much but this place make me craving for udon all the time. The noodles are amazing good. They always have long line but it's worth the wait! However, there side dishes like the sear beef tataki are not good and too expensive for the quality."
9/13/2015,20150913,4,4.25,The udon here is nice and fresh. My favorite is the kamo nanban and kamo seiro. I had two bowls of it. I tried the ikura oroshi and while it's nice and light for the summer it felt like a lot of noodles and enough toppings. The mentaiko and butter udon needed more mentaiko and less nori. The nori on it overpowered the whole dish. The signature uni cream udon was good but a better one to share as a whole bowl of it would definitely be too heavy for one person. I also feel the uni and cream could be blended into a sauce better rather than a creamy broth with chunks of uni it.
9/13/2015,20150913,4,4.25,"Great udon place in the heart of Little Tokyo. This place is a gem with great tasting udon flavors and combos ... be bold and order something unique. I think you will be pleasently surprised. If you just want regular tasting udon, theres plenty of that around the area. So, if thats more your style, its probably safe to say that you can just visit another restaurant without having to pay more or wait long. Got the squid and uni udon and they are great. The pork belly rice is tasty as well. Price is on the higher side.Keep in mind to grab seats early on or go by youraelf and grab seats at the counter. Otherwise expect a long, long wait during regular service hours."
9/13/2015,20150913,4,4.25,My oh my do i love marugame monzooooooo! If you don't want to wait for the terrible line at daikokuya then come here! The udon is fresh and the portions are generous. The price can range from 9 dollars to 20 dollars depending on what you get. I've tried the uni udon and MMMMM it tastes very cajun and really good! It kinda smells like ass tho so watch out. This couple was eating it next to me one time and im like ughh smells like farts and cheese feet. I REALLY LIKE THEIR SUMMER SPECIAL COLD UDON MMM ITS SO GOOD. The beef reminds me of yoshinoya (don't judge me i love that shit) and its quite refreshing on a hot day.I've also tried the charsiu udon and its quite delectable as well. Also their NEGITORO BOWL ON POINT MMMM. I love fatty tunaaa and its fresh and not gross like the one at tsujita bleghhh. Anyways come here if you like udon and even if you think u didn't u should try it cause itll change ur mind.
9/15/2015,20150915,4,4.25,"Saw all the hype from friends and had to come try this place too. It's right next to Daikokuya across the street from Japanese Village Plaza. Parking is on the backside of the restaurant in case anyone was wondering. (I spent 10 minutes circling around trying to find a place to park...) The restaurant is pretty small with very limited booth/seated areas and a counter area where you can watch them make the udon. I went around 9 PM on a Sunday so there was barely any wait. I ordered the Miso Carbonara and Fried Chicken Skin. The food came out minutes after ordering which was great.Miso Carbonara (8.5/10): This dish was pretty much udon in a very soupy and creamy white sauce. It was topped with a few pieces of bacon and I added a soft-boiled egg. The bacon was very good and fatty (my favorite :P) but was pretty scarce. The soft-boiled egg was tempura battered and cooked perfectly. Overall the dish was pretty tasty and definitely on the verge of being overly-rich. The dish was around $10 but the amount of udon was pretty low. You do have the option of doubling the portion for $2 I believe. Fried Chicken Skin (8/10): Being a huge fan of chicken skin I had to try this. The chicken skin sits above a tiny amount of a soy sauce, ginger and vinegar sauce. The sauce is really what makes the appetizer. You literally only need a few drops of it on the skin in order for it have a huge amount of flavor! Very great appetizer at $5 but could be overwhelming trying to eat it alone.Overall this restaurant is well-rounded with its udon pasta-like dishes and the traditional Japanese dishes and appetizers. I will be back to try the curry and beef udon."
9/16/2015,20150916,5,4.25,"There is no wait on a Tuesday night for some yummy udon! This is a small restaurant that makes their udon fresh. If you're lucky you can watch their chef toss and roll the noodles before being cook. Yes! A meal and a show! My friends and I shared fried chicken skin with ponza sauce and beef tataki, which tasted great unless you eat the chicken skin without the ponza sauce. Don't forget to pick the chicken skin with ponza sauce on it. I had the sea urchin cream udon. The first bite, I was like bleh! I gave up the Carbonara udon to try this, ugh! I'm so sad! I kept eating it and it was pretty good, better than the Carbonara udon. My one regret was not getting the soft boiled egg, it's a great add on."
9/17/2015,20150917,5,4.25,Authentic Japanese UDON can be found here.I like the Zaru or Kama age udon here. It's very simple but you can enjoy the true flavor of udon. My kids love Niku Udon (beef udon). Side dish here is okay but presented beautifully so I appreciate that.It can be a quite long wait depending on the time or day but it worth the waiting time.
9/18/2015,20150918,4,4.25,"i love thick, fat, chewy, al dente noodles. i also love creamy, gooey, melted cheese. so the udon gratin was pretty much like i died and went to heaven. maybe it's because i used to put cheese on my rice when i was a kid, much to my mom's dismay...thank god i'm not lactose intolerant. i also love uni, and tried my friend's uni udon but there wasn't enough uni and the cream sauce was a little bland and one-note. the beef tataki was pretty good. the wait here is not cool. the parking here is not cool. two out of three strikes for the hideous wait and the hideous parking and i haven't been back since, though i drool on myself sometimes thinking about that udon gratin. unless they start to take reservations, i don't know if it's worth it to go back."
9/20/2015,20150920,4,4.25,"FRESHLY MADE UDON how can you resist?---Uni udon: SO CREAMY and RICH, it was good at first but I'm glad my friend and I shared one bowl since it quickly became too heavy for comfort ---soft boiled tempura egg: yummy to add as a side to the noodles YUMMY noodles but next time I'll order a broth based soup & the beef tataki which is only offered during dinner NOTE: if you can make it at 1145 before the 12 lunch crowd rush on a weekday you'll be glad you came early"
9/20/2015,20150920,5,4.25,"I am absolutely in love with this place. I would always go back if it wasn't too far and if it wasn't too pricey. I would really recommend you to get the Uni Udon and the Tomato Seafood Udon. I know that the Uni one sounds a little weird, but damn, it is amazing. It is something you have to try when you go there. The broth of the Uni is very creamy and the Udon noodles are really soft and firm. You can tell that the noodles are made with love. The Tomato Seafood Udon has the same creamy base but instead, with seafood and tomatoes. We ordered other things also but I forgot what they were called. Overall food is AMAZING.Parking can be a hassle since it is Little Tokyo. I recommend you to park the next block over near that one judge street, I forgot the name, for like $5 i believe? or cheaper? I forgot.The wait can be long depending on the time and day you go. If you go right at lunch, no wait! Other than that, it can be long. Don't get mixed up with the people for the ramen place. The crowded of people can scare you away but its actually for the other store.Overall, amazing food and service. I would LOVE to come back again and eat it myself :)"
9/21/2015,20150921,4,4.25,"I LOVE THIS PLACE, I love their freshly made udon! I came here during lunch time on a Thursday afternoon, and I just missed the first wave to be seated so the wait was about 30 minutes for 2 people which isn't bad since the restaurant is pretty small. Honestly, if I came 40 minutes after their opening time, there wouldn't have been a wait since the restaurant started clearing out 10 minutes after being seated most likely because everyone's lunches were ending. But who knows, it could've been just that day.The workers are constantly making fresh udon (which can be seen through the glass towards the back of the restaurant) so the udon comes out relatively fast after being ordered. We ordered a cold udon with beef and grated daikon, Kakuni udon (fatty braised pork belly, yummmmm), and the Udon Gratin all of which are delicious! (I'm actually salivating thinking about these dishes!!!) The cold udon and Kakuni udon are both light but their flavors are on point. The Udon Gratin is one of their speciality udon dishes, it's creamy with onions and chicken and a layer of melted cheese to top it off. This udon is more on the heavy side so if you want something light for your meal, steer clear of this dish. But I have to say, this udon is the most flavorful which is why I love it. On the side, I also ordered a tempura soft boiled egg...I thought this was just average, there was just not much flavor to it. Needless to say, my friend and I were stuffed after this meal...we got carried away and ordered too much udon (no regrets though since it was delicious). One order of udon will suffice for one person hahaParking tip: it might be difficult to find parking since its in DTLA but there's a parking structure right across the street!"
9/21/2015,20150921,5,4.25,I was talking to the train today and saw this and was craving some Kamagge and saw it in the window so I stopped in. This was a great treat as I had the whole place nearly to myself. The presentation and the flavor was great. I'm not sure why it has $$ because my dish was $7.95 and I could have paid more for it.
9/22/2015,20150922,4,4.25,"I am a huge fan of uni, so I was drawn here by the uni udon. I return because of the beef udon. The uni udon is rich, creamy, and flavor-packed. The first bite is amazing, but the bowl is so HUGE that this inevitably will become too much to handle. Another issue I have with the uni udon is that once the uni is cooked, it loses some of its flavor and most of its texture. The beef udon was actually amazing. The broth is traditional and rejuvenating. The udon was had great chewy texture, and was clearly fresh and hand-made. Finally, the udon is topped with gyu-don, or strifry beef, onions and garlic. It both smells and tastes amazing."
9/24/2015,20150924,3,4.25,"Came here to try their famous uni pasta and udons with a friend. We came on a weekday and this place is SO hidden we walked by it twice and totally missed it. It's a good alternative to Daikokuya when the line is insanely long, though there may be a short wait here as well. This place is hidden, pretty unassuming. We waited maybe 10 minutes and was seated, inside was pretty busy. The regular udon was my favorite, with a good savory but light broth with perfectly good noodles. Was it worth the money though? I mean I felt like I could get the same udon at Bukkake at 333 Alameda for a lot less. The uni udon was rich and creamy with bits of uni floating around but slightly too rich for my taste. Is it worth $15? Meh, I'm not really a big fan of uni in the first place so not for me. We ordered a combo for one of the udons so it came with a small bowl of rice and spicy tuna which is exactly what it is. They also mixed up our orders with the next table, considering our order was pretty specific and the table next to us had it delivered and the recipients had a super perplexed look on their face, we just remedied it ourselves and let the staff know that they had switched it up. Parking is NOT easy in this area in fact it's a freakin nightmare. $7 parking lot even for lunch across the street and there's limited street parking so good luck. One thing I have to note is REALLY gross curtains. Like the type that is outside so it's beaten down by all sorts of weather and LA pollution and dust. The curtain hangs from the doorway ceiling to about my collarbone and if I didn't move it out of the way with my hands would hit RIGHT at my face. I would use my hands to hold it up so it wouldn't hit my face directly but considering the sheer number of people and just the fact that it's dirty disgusting DTLA that curtain makes me want to puke."
9/24/2015,20150924,5,4.25,"Little tokyo always surprises me. I thought i had everything here but great places like this always pop up.I had their Miso Carbonara Udon Noodles. Rich, creamy, umami filled flavor. This dish is just so savory that there is nothing comparable to it. The Udon Gratin was something that i didn't think was possible. Mixing something so Japanese like Udon with that much baked cheese... yeah definitely worth the wait outside the restaurant"
9/25/2015,20150925,4,4.25,"The food was good. I ordered the udon gratin and my friend ordered the uni cream udon. The udon gratin was pretty good; it was super cheesy and flavorful, but it was a little heavy. The uni cream udon was good as well, but it wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be since everyone raves about it; my friend said he probably wouldn't order it again. We also ordered the fried chicken skin and tempura egg. The chicken skin tasted a lot better than I thought it would! You should try and ask for the sauce on the side though, because the chicken skin on the bottom was way too salty to eat cause of the sauce. The tempura egg was also way underseasoned imo, but that's just me. It's literally a fried egg, no salt or anything. We were sat right where they were making the udon noodles, so it was cool to watch as we waited for our food. I had a good experience here, but to be honest, I don't see myself coming back. This will definitely be a one time experience for me."
9/25/2015,20150925,4,4.25,"My friends and I came here for lunch on a hot Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was packed with people. We waited 40 minutes to be seated. Because of how small this place was, ventilation was terrible. I could hardly breath in there. Tried their cold udon with grated daikon and a side order of the tempera soft-boiled egg. The udon was fresh and flavorful. Although the soup was a bit too sweet for my taste. The egg was tasty.  The yolk was nice and runny. Just the way I like. Food was light and delicious!Reminder: street parking only."
9/25/2015,20150925,3,4.25,"It was okay. Good experience but personally I'd probably never go back. I ordered the udon gratin because everyone always tells me I'd like it, and the first bite was pretty good! But after a few bites it just gets overwhelming.We went on a Friday morning, literally 11:40 and the place was already pretty packed. We didn't have to wait but we lucked out since there was only two of us and we sat in the bar. A couple came right after us and I think they had to wait for 20 minutes outside."
9/25/2015,20150925,4,4.25,"I stopped by this joint when I was visiting. Little Tokyo, originally planning on getting Daikokuya next door. However, the wait line for Marugame Monzo was longer than that if Daikokuya's, so I was intrigued & had to see what it was all about. I was very pleasantly surprised. I'm generally more a fan of ramen than udon, but the wide variety of flavors & combinations will leave everyone satisfied to find something to his/her liking. I went with the squid butter udon. The cream was thick & rich. There was plenty if squid in the bowl. & the seafood taste was present, but not overpowering. The udon noodles were warm, soft. & fresh. They make all the udon by hand in the restaurant (you can watch them do this), & you can definitely Tate the difference.Like, many popular places in Little Tokyo, this one is busy, usually with a bit of a wait. The décor is definitely Japanese but with a modern twist. It can feel cramped in the restaurant, however, & sitting at a small table with a friend, we were very close to the next table, making conversation awkward sometimes. I wouldn't say it's a spot for large groups. Expect to spend $12-20 on a meal.Service is great for the amount of people constantly in the restaurant!"
9/26/2015,20150926,4,4.25,"My first time in Little Tokyo and I wanted to make it count, because who knows when I might be back, since I am now living out of state. I came in on a Friday night, straight from LAX, and was hoping the wait wasn't long. I looped around a couple of times looking for parking, but settled to park in the garage across the street. I only paid about $4, so it wasn't too bad. When I signed in at the front, they told me 45 minutes, so I was happy it was only that long. The ramen place next door looked even busier, so I figured I made a good choice, even though it has nearly 7k reviews on yelp. After reading the reviews on yelp for monzo, I figured I would try what seemed to be two of the most popular items, mentai squid butter udon and the seafood tomato cream (uni) udon. I was looking forward to the uni the most, after having fresh uni last year in San Diego, but if you don't like creamy italian pasta dishes, like fettuccine alfredo, you probably won't like the overwhelming creaminess to this dish. I don't normally eat alfredo but I ate this dish anyway, every last but of uni chunks buried throughout the bowl. My favorite was actually the mentai squid, it had a real ramen broth you could taste and see and didn't taste seafoody all that much. I'd probably order this one next time.Of course monzo is known for making their udon right in front of you in the middle of the restaurant. I wasn't lucky enough to sit in one of the seats along the window where this happens, but only 1 table away. Freshly made udon is way better than the crap they serve us back in Houston, trust me.Service was excellent here, I especially love that the hostess was so nice , even though she was so busy, she went out of her way to let me know when I'd be seated even though I never went up to check on the timing of being seated."
9/26/2015,20150926,5,4.25,"BEST UDON I'VE HAD IN MY LIFEDuck is one of those things I LOOOVEEE eating. When I looked at Marugame Monzo's menu and saw the Duck Udon, I knew IMMEDIATELY that I wanted it!The Duck Udon not only lived up to Monzo's hype but exceeded my exceptions for udon! The noodles were so fresh (plus, you can see them making the noodles through the kitchen window), the broth was extremely delicious, and the duck was amazing and tender! Also, try the negitoro don!The fresh tuna in combination with the sweet sauce, mayonnaise, rice, green onion, and seaweed is just a harmony of flavors! I always thought rice bowls were pretty average tasting all around, but Marugame Monzo proves to be the exception! Monzo Fan boy right here!"
9/26/2015,20150926,4,4.25,"This place was appetizing and I had a good first experience, but it isn't somewhere I would come back. I had the chance to sit right next to the chef making the udon and that was pretty cool! I tried the Uni Udon and it wasn't as great as I thought, but still yummy. The portions were a little smaller than I would've liked but it is a little heavy. (A little too pricey for what it is in my opinion). I also ordered edamame and fried chicken skin and they were really delicious! Their service was also good here!But, the only time I would only see myself coming back here is if my friend never tried it and wanted to see what it was like.."
9/27/2015,20150927,5,4.25,"Best udon I've ever had! I had the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, which came with seasoned cod roe butter sauce with squid and onions. Super delicious and not too heavy! Very flavorful in the taste and texture. Udons were handmade and not too soft nor firm. A good portion of the squid and mentai. I also got to try the Sea Urchin Cream Udon and I personally didn't like it that much as it was too creamy and heavy to my liking. :( I would definitely get the Mentai Squid Butter Udon again on my next visit! Marugame Monzo really brings udon to the next level. :)"
9/27/2015,20150927,4,4.25,"Hand crafted Udon noodle place in Little Tokyo.If you are into Udon, this is a place to check out.Atmosphere : A good mixture of Japanese traditional look and modern interior. Minimal and clean. That's what you look for a good restaurant. This place is ALWAYS crowded. Keep it in your mind. Go extra early to write your name on the list. Dinner waiting time takes like 30 minutes or so.Food : Great! Not only their noodle has so much great ""koshi""(firm and somewhat chewy texture of the noodle) texture, but also they have a variety of unique good menu which other traditional Udon restaurants don't offer.Service : Fast and friendly enough. Nothing to complain. They take order with ipad POS system, so less confusion between servers and kitchen I guess. Comparing their newer location in Torrance, food comes faster here even though LA location is bigger and busier. Parking : It is Little Tokyo(DTLA) if you find a street parking, take is and pay extra time(parking ticket is not worth it)."
9/28/2015,20150928,5,4.25,"I'm hooked. Yes, the uni udon lives up to the hype. It's magical. Though not overly ""uni""-y it is still a perfect creamy and savory treat. The handmade noodles are divine.Order the fried chicken skins too! It's light, crispy without being greasy, and has a perfect vinegary sauce. Shrimp tempura udon came with two large pieces of shrimp, perfectly fried. The broth is traditional and comforting. The mentai butter udon was enjoyable, but the taste grew old. I'm looking forward to trying the seafood tomato cream, miso carbonara, or gratin next!Also the vegetarian udon is amazing, with a super rich, mushroom based broth."
9/29/2015,20150929,4,4.25,Solid place for udon. Tried to uni udon with shrimp tempura and tempura soft boiled egg and the negitori bowl. The portions looked small to me but the uni udon is so rich and creamy that it does a great job of filing you up. The udon is really the star of the show because it's handmade in front of you by the chefs. Highly recommend the uni udon with the soft boiled egg and shrimp tempura. Parking is awful because it's Little Tokyo. Just opt for a nearby lot because you'll waste money driving around.
9/29/2015,20150929,5,4.25,"Freshly made, from scratch udon made here. You know it's going to be a great experience when you can see them making it right in front of you! Be sure to grab a bar seat so you can watch them make it. The udon are the right texture and firmness. Much better than other udon or ramen places who use suppliers for their noodles. I always get the negitoro bowl. Reminds me of my moms homemade negitoro. Cold negitoro with warm gohan (rice), so great! They put a lot of sauce/mayo which overpowers it a bit, so I scrape it off. Udon- each time I go I never stray away from a select few, but how can I try something else when what I get is already delicious?! My favorites are either ume shiso or daikon. Both have been amazing! The ume and daikon garnish are just the right amount and it's a lighter broth. I've tasted the carbonara as well but it's a bit too rich/heavy for my taste. Definitely the best udon place in the Los Angeles area!"
9/29/2015,20150929,3,4.25,"This place was cool, given the fact that you have the option to sit down and watch your udon made in front of you. I came here on a Sunday evening around 5:30 - no wait. I ordered a regular udon in soup with the fried bean curds. I'm not sure if my noodles were undercooked, or if that's just how they make their udon...but I was very disappointed. I'm willing to give this place another try if I'm in the area though. Thankfully, my udon was only around $6-7 so I didn't feel like I was being jipped."
9/30/2015,20150930,5,4.25,"I was out with my brother and his friends when one of them said they really wanted to try this place. I was bummed since I don't like udon, but since they weren't my friends I felt obligated to go with the flow.And I'm so glad I did! Oh. My. God. We sat at the bar and watched the chef make batch after batch of fresh noodles. Awesome. I got the hot beef udon, and it was delicious. Broth exploding with garlic and ginger flavors. And the noodles were phenomenal!I should add a disclaimer that I think your experience may depend on what you get - my brother ordered the duck udon, and at the end of the meal he tried some of mine. He was shocked. He said that my broth was MUCH more flavorful than his, to the point that (and I quote) ""it's like night and day."" So there's that. BUT I should also add that he was served a shaker of seasoning to add to his dish, which he didn't use.Anyways, great food. I would go back."
10/2/2015,20151002,5,4.25,Best udon I've ever had. The handmade noodle texture was so good. And I'm really not even a udon fan. Their fatty tuna rice bowl is bomb!!!
10/3/2015,20151003,5,4.25,"I've been to Marugame Monzo a few times before, but this time it was better than I had remembered. My boyfriend and I shared the uni udon and the beef udon. Both were extremely delicious.Uni Udon -- Creamy and flavorful but not too rich. Definitely lighter and tastier than I had remembered it to be. A must have! Beef Udon -- A solid choice if you're looking for something without the dairy.They hand make their udon so it's fresh and cooked to the right consistency. It's fun to sit by the bar and watch them do magic with the dough in front of your eyes."
10/4/2015,20151004,5,4.25,"First time here! Was referred by my friend to try this udon place because she said it was reallyyyyy good!! My friend and I arrived around 7:45 pm on a Sunday night and waited til 8:40 pm to get seated. We ordered negitoro (tuna) rice bowl, uni udon, and tempura udon. The tuna rice bowl is the bomb dot com!!! My friend had the Uni udon and loved it! She said it was creamy, savory and you can just taste the uni flavor. I had the tempura udon, which was savory and delicious. The udon's texture is just right, chewy and not too soft, not too hard.We will most definitely come back!! Maybe on a weekday though :)"
10/5/2015,20151005,5,4.25,"The flavor department and authenticity of the place exceeds all my expectations. Every time I visit Monzo I have to try a new side item and I am never disappointed. Get ready for some great authentic flavors and textures. That might be the only issue I have with this place. You might have to wait up to 45 minutes to get a seat but it is worth it. Also, sometimes the wait time for the food could be longer than average of its during peak hours. That being said, I still have to give this place 5 stars. You will understand once you taste their offerings.I have only tried two of their selections of udon. Sea urchin cream sauce udon and the tempura udon with the traditional broth. Between the two I like the Uni cream better but making that decision was difficult because they were both mind blowing.My favorite sides are the soft boiled egg tempura and the kakiage.If you don't mind waiting for good food, you will NOT be disappointed making a visit here. If you can't handle the wait I suggest visiting at the beginning of either dinner or lunch before they open which will usually guarantee you a seat right away. Happy eating!"
10/5/2015,20151005,5,4.26,"Get here early and sign in, preferably with some non-boring friends (or your phone) because you will be waiting for a while. But it's so worth it.Must haves:- Mentai Squid Butter udon - Fried Chicken Skin- Negitoro Wrap Don't get overwhelmed by the wait though - there's another spot next door that has an equally long wait so it really just looks like one big ass crowd of people. Pay attention because on crowded nights (like Saturday) they may accidentally skip over you. They make the udon noodles in-house and honestly this is one of the best places I've ever been to. Bookmark it now cuz I'm sure once I post this I'll begin seeing it all over my Instagram feed.They have a miso carbonara dish that I'm definitely getting the next time I come here!"
10/6/2015,20151006,4,4.26,"Waited 20+ min around 3PM last Saturday. Food was okay, not bad, I mean. we had Uni cream udon and bean curd udon. I will recommend Uni cream udon, but for me, parking was too frustrating to go there again. 40 bucks for food, 10 bucks for parking! :("
10/9/2015,20151009,4,4.25,"Definitely fills up quick here but we came before the rush around 6pm and grabbed a seat by the window to watch the chefs cut and create the noodles. We were seated in a corner so we got less attention than most, but the uni udon was creamy amazingness! I am not usually a fan of uni but you don't taste the seafood taste for sure and the creaminess was not too thick or watery - just perfect. Noodles were made with perfect thickness and softness, too! My friend had the beef udon which felt a bit bland to me and the tempura was tasteless. I also had a soft boiled egg with my order that had tempura powder outside and it was super bland :/ thus the one star deduction. Total was around $39 for two people. Will definitely return!"
10/9/2015,20151009,4,4.25,"This is a very special place. House made udon! You can sit at the counter and watch the udon noodles being hand made. Pretty amazing This tiny restaurant and can get crowded quickly so either come as a party of 2, arrive early or be prepared to wait. The service is quite good. With the weather in the evening at 82°, I opted for a cold udon and needed assistance in deciphering the vague descriptions. The server was quite helpful and patient in explaining what each item was. With that, I tried the cold beef udon. The sautéed beef arrives warm, with grated Japanese yam and chopped scallions on a bed of soft udon noodles. The soup arrives on the side. Pour it in, Boom! You have a perfect meal. The fried chicken appetizer is tasty and since the portion is small, the perfect size for a shared starter. I look forward to colder weather so I can try the hot udon soups."
10/9/2015,20151009,5,4.26,"You can't go wrong with any of their orders. Seriously. I don't even like cold udon very much, but their udon is so yummy that the cold dishes are yummy, too! Did that even make sense? My faves are the duck udon, the urchin, and the au gratin. Ohhhhhh the au gratin."
10/10/2015,20151010,3,4.25,"This place open at 1130 am on a Saturday. We waited in line at 1105. Still second in line. Came in and was greeted by younger Asian lady. Same lady that was not so friendly by her tone of voice in Japanese. The older lady is really nice.Sat at the bar where you can watch people make fresh udon. We ordered before anyone else around us. But they all got their food before us. After looking around and noticed everyone that was seated got their food!!( guy nexted to us laughed and joke with us cuz he noticed how we ordered before him and he finished eating when we got our order)So we asked our server and she said it goes by the order that was put in. Ok so, does that mean she failed to put our order in before everyone else that she ordered at the bar or the other servers cut in front of us?? Food wise, I tried the curry udon, rice balls, cold udon dipped in sauce and the uni udon. I like the taste of the fresh udon. It has a little chewy texture (which I like). I would recommend ordering the curry udon and the creamy uni udon to share and combine the broths! It was tasty by itself but towards the end, it creamy broth got a little too creamy.I would also recommend sides because there's barely any uni.. I usually order side order of soft boiled egg and ikura. This time my server said there is no side Oder ikura but there is a rice bowl ikura. I didn't want to argue with her. I'm from Northern California and this is my third time here."
10/11/2015,20151011,5,4.25,"If you come here, I (and everyone else on Yelp) recommend trying the Uni Udon. I don't dislike uni, but I wouldn't call myself a fan either. It's ok by itself. But honestly, the creaminess of their uni udon makes me an uni fan. I also tasted the curry udon. It was pretty damn good as well. But I still prefer the creamy uni udon more. I love watching their chefs hand make the udon behind the glass. It really makes me feel like I'm in Japan. This place can get pretty busy if you're unlucky. I usually only come with 2-3 other people and get seated within 20-30 minutes max. The service is ok... No complaints."
10/11/2015,20151011,1,4.25,"I'm a big fan of udon and this summer took my 5yr daughter to Japan for her first trip overseas. She love the udon in Japan. I always wanted to try Monzo but live an hour away. Last night after an afternoon of furniture shopping in Century city, we had an opportunity and stopped in for dinner. Signed in with 9 parties ahead of us and were seated in 45 min. The beef udon, tempura soft boiled egg, tempura shrimp was excellent. The udon with bacon and pickled ? was average. The pork rice was very disappointing - unflavored and over cooked pork on white rice. Overall, I was delighted to find a udon place with some excellent dished that I really enjoyed. Why one star - I woke up that night to stomach cramps and the expect course of events. Soon after me, my pregnant wife awoke with the same. My little girl on the potty holding her tummy with tears running down her face crying for it to stop hurting. We dined the evening of 10OCT15. I didn't share any meals with my family earlier in the day."
10/12/2015,20151012,5,4.25,"In true hole-in-the-wall fashion, I walked past the restaurant while looking for it. I think it's because of the sheer number of people always waiting outside of Daikokuya (next door) combined with the fact that ""Marugame"" is not on signage, at least in English, that may cause one to miss the place.When you do manage to find the place you are in for quite a treat. I tried the famous uni udon and it was very unique and delicious. I was afraid that the creaminess would completely mask all of that subtle uni flavor that we love but they managed to allow the uni to shine without being overbearing. As others have noted, however, the heaviness can be a little overwhelming if you eat nothing else. Therefore, I think this udon is best if it's shared with other people to allow you to try other things. I tried this with the beef udon and it worked very well. The beef udon reminds me of going to yoshinoya and getting a beef bowl with extra ""juice."" Their beef has all that delicious marbling that every fat kid delights in eating. The udon noodles in both bowls were PERFECT. They have a good chewy texture and were the perfect complement to the broth. It's nice seeing them hand-make the noodles in front of you and it adds nicely to the ambiance.Overall, it's an amazing place for udon and definitely my new favorite (even better than Marukame in Hawaii). Cheers!"
10/12/2015,20151012,3,4.25,"First off on a good note I wanna say the texture of the actual udon noodle was perfect. Not too chewy & not too soft.... We were in town from Oklahoma and I had some reviews & that I should try the Uni udon. since I have recently became a new fan for sea urchin. I had the Uni Udon Not perfect only because I think I just had a high expectation for it probably got too excited because we don't have yummy food like this in Oklahoma. But don't get me wrong it was YUMMY! My fiancé had the Clam Udon which he loved & Uncle had the chicken tempura also good. Not so good note... The 3 of us got there at about 9ish, when we got there we wrote our name down on the wait list which we were next& 2 other 2 tops signed in after us.. And a few minutes later another couple came in & a staff asked if they had 2 and immediately cleaned off the nearest table to seat them before he even looked at the wait list... Prior that there was a table of 4 needing to be cleaned off as well which we ended up sitting in.... So someone was sat before us as well as 2 other people who signed in after us.. I have worked as a waitress before so I know how things like that work. It was rude he apologized & guy ended up being our server & really seemed like he didn't even want to speak to us. When I told him we were ready to order he went the table nodded his head and walked off...... ?? So a girl ended up coming to take our order. And then her iPad died & she told our original server and he just traded her iPads... I didn't know what the whole point was for... But whatever. & not only that... We're eating soup which is a crazy idea when it's 100 degrees outside & at night probably 80 degrees. But it's okay! Lol idk if the a/c wasn't working or what but the door was open for some air or for whatever reason so it was pretty warm in there... But despite all that it was pretty good so a 3 star.."
10/13/2015,20151013,3,4.25,"First thing you notice is that there is decent wait for this place, so get here early if you do not like waiting. All your party member must be present to be seated. The servers are very nice and they do greet you! I came here because people tell me these place has really good sea urchin udon. I tried it personally and actually thought it was okay. There is no actual ""whole piece"" sea urchin inside, it's all grinded up to tiny pieces and you can hardly taste it at all. Soup is very creamy to the point it taste more like cheese than Uni. To be honest, it would've been better if served with just uni on top of the udon in my opinion. It's quite pricey as well, but I think it's still worth a try if you haven't got a chance to taste it. The dining areas are clean, tables aren't sticky, and services are rather fast. We didn't wait very long to get our foods."
10/15/2015,20151015,4,4.25,"Finally got to come here on my last trip to LA!The only Uni Udon that I've had previous to this is the one I made at home from scratch so I wanted to see how mine compared ( how real uni udon is supposed to taste)FOUR STAR! The uni udon I feel was the right amount of uni flavor, very creamy, but not to thick with uni chunks. Wish there was more udon noodles though since I ran out with plenty of sauce left haha.We also got the mentai squid udon which was also good, it was more brothy and less sauce like the uni udon. It was a good taste of a different kind of flavor, but the uni udon definitely took the spotlight."
10/16/2015,20151016,4,4.25,"This place serves really fresh noodles, that's probably what their known for. But their soup is pretty much simple. But it was pretty good, nothing really special though. But good quality and noodles. pretty pricey though .."
10/17/2015,20151017,4,4.25,"I've only started eating uni recently, and omg the uni udon here.....you don't know what rich and creamy means until you've tried the uni udon here!! SO. GOOD.We got the miso carbonara and uni (sea urchin) udon. Both were unbelievably yummy. Every taste was flavorful and the udon was just the right amount of chewy. I am definitely coming back to try other flavors!"
10/18/2015,20151018,2,4.25,Food:Sea Urchin (Uni) cream udonCarbonara udonUdon noodles itself was good. Sauce for both dishes just tasted like the same cream sauce with a very soupy consistency. There's hot pepper powder left at the table. I put a ton in mine because it tasted like it needed some red pepper flakes. Table next to us requested hot sauce. The server said they didn't have chili oil as requested but they had Tabasco and that it was an extra charge of 50 cents. Be warned that the only seat your party when all are present. Smells and feels musty like A/C wasn't in.
10/18/2015,20151018,5,4.25,"Great customer service. Fast and friendly staff. Food is fresh, yummy and usually don't have to wait long for the food to get to the table. It's a good place to go on a date or just to have lunch. Lunch special anyone. Love deals."
10/19/2015,20151019,4,4.25,"I've visited LA once a year ever since I moved back to Colorado, and this time, I moved my trip a little earlier because I found out about the heavenly dish known as sea urchin cream udon.This place is right next to Daikokuya in Little Tokyo, so don't be intimidated if you see a TON of people outside - Daikokuya always has a wait. It has a very ""hole-in-the-wall"" vibe when you look at it from the outside especially since there's no flashy signage. There were about 6 parties ahead of my table of 3 and we were seated within 15-20 minutes I would say. Looking through the menu, I already knew what I wanted. My friend and I both ordered the sea urchin cream udon and my other friend ordered the crispy chicken skin and another udon that had bacon in the name but was still more on the traditional side (for the life of me I cannot find the name of this dish on Google, so here's my lackluster explanation).The udon came out before the crispy chicken skin and after I spent approximately half of my life trying to get an aesthetically pleasing photo of my food, I took a sip of the broth and I was absolutely floored. I LOVE uni and I LOVE creamy, fatty substances that will one day clog my arteries and this was a holy matrimony of both. The cream was rich with a background taste of uni in every bite. I thought things couldn't get any better until I bit into a noodle and I was on top of this very emotional roller coaster all over again. I've never had handmade udon noodles before, but I don't think the instant stuff is gonna cut it after this. It was so damn good.My poor friend who did not order this masterpiece had a bite of mine and he literally said, ""That is so good. What the hell did I order?"" That being said, I found the actual pieces of uni in the broth to be a little underwhelming. Maybe it's because I've never had cooked uni before, but I found it a little overcooked and boring - the uni flavor seemed to have been sucked out of the actual uni and injected into the broth. The crispy chicken skin was also pretty good. There was a tangy sauce (ponzu maybe) with it and the chicken skin was exactly like advertised - crispy. The acidity in the sauce definitely helped cut the richness of the sea urchin udon I was slurping down.The service was great - water was always filled and servers were very nice and polite. The table next to us found a hair in one of their udon bowls and the server promptly replaced it for him without a problem.The sea urchin udon is very, very rich so I can't imagine eating it more than every blue moon, but seeing as how I'll be states away, I'm pretty sure this is the stuff that I'm gonna be dreaming about in the future."
10/22/2015,20151022,5,4.25,"They make fresh udon themselves! Their udon was not too soft which was the texture that I like, and it's quite chewy. Food that I tried: uni udon, Shrimp Tempura Udon and beef cold udon.- Uni udon: it is creamy and heavy tasted, worth trying once.- Shrimp tempura udon: hot soup based udon, it's great to have it when you want something to warm your tummy. The shrimp tempura was crispy and they didn't put too much flour to fried it. - Beef cold udon (summer special): the cold sauce based matched really good with the udon and beef. The beef kinda taste like sukiyaki, sweet taste. I recommended not to put too much daikon (Japanese white carrot) and ginger in it, cause it will mess up the simple soup base. **not a long wait at night time"

10/25/2015,20151025,3,4.25,"I've been here several times and each time has been a very different dining experience. I would've given 4 stars but we brought some out-of-town friends to visit yesterday and it tainted my mental reputation of the restaurant because they were such sticklers. We bought some mochi from Fugetsu-do while waiting to be seated and placed the wrapped package on the edge of the table after being seated since there was no other space. Even though we weren't planning to open or eat the mochi, they insisted we couldn't have outside food in the restaurant. ...... Where could I put it? On the floor so it can be stepped on? My husband had to eat lunch with a package of mochi on his lap. How ridiculous. The waiter also made another girl throw away her outside drink--she had asked if she could just put it away and he said no!! They also prohibit sharing lunch specials (udon + rice bowl), so we had to order a side dish --while our friends were able to share their udon with dipping sauce since it wasn't a lunch special, despite it being less than half the price of the lunch special (it's really not price-related). Makes no sense. The restaurant has good handmade udon. I've tried the beef tataki, curry udon, kamaage udon, miso carbonara udon, uni udon, pork belly rice, kakiage, tempura, and I can't remember what else. I don't like uni, period, but I enjoy the uni udon because it the taste of uni is very faint and actually tastes like mac and cheese haha! The wait for tables isn't bad at all + they won't seat until the entire party is present, I've never waited more than 10 minutes. In the past, they've quoted the wait to be 15-20 minutes but a table was ready in less than 5 minutes. Because of that, I'd recommend staying outside the restaurant to wait rather than walking around and returning."
10/25/2015,20151025,5,4.25,"One of my absolute favorite restaurants! I always bring newcomers here and impress them with how delicious the udon is. All the friends I bring exclaim over how yummy it is and come back for more. You can't beat handmade udon, it's the perfect texture of chewy and firm. If you're lucky, you get seated at the kitchen, where you can see a man whip and cut the dough into noodles. My go-to order is the sea urchin udon, but I also like the beef and the clam one!"

Compared to the ramen place next door, this place is much more efficient and they seat you very quickly cause they get people in and out quickly. I've also tried half the items on the menu and my favorite is still the Kakuni Udon with the braised pork belly pieces with the pork belly bowl. All the pork just hits the spot. My only gripe if is I wish they would include a little more noodle. I do enjoy the entertainment from watching the guy hand make noodles as it passes the time while you are waiting for your food to come. I usually come alone or with someone else, but if you have a big group, you will wait a while because the place just isn't that big.

The portions are somewhat small and my friends told me that their portion has gotten smaller. My party was not full after so we stopped by pie hole shortly after. Food was great. Prices were decent.

There were several people waiting in front of the place outside, so we went inside to put our names down on the list and went back outside for 15 minutes until we finally got to our table. Despite of the small space, this place was definitely lively with the servers being friendly and attentive to our needs and the staff creating udon from scratch. I had the squid butter udon, which was definitely extraordinary. The ingredients were high in quality, the cream was just about right, the flavors stand out, the noodles were soft and freshly made and they all left a great impression to my smiling face.

I am a passionate uni eater (when I am stressed, I ""take"" 2 trays of uni to ""feel better"")As an uni lover, I was very disappointed with my experience. I like how uni is light, fresh, and sweet. In the uni udon, I can obviously taste the bitterness of low grade uni, and the cream made it really heavy. The udon itself is good. A place worth trying, just ADVOID uni udon! Bummer!"

I didn't want to calorically commit to a uni cream pasta... or whatever heavy crazy pastas they have here, but my boss told me that their udons are off the chain because they're hand made.... I guess not off the chain if its a basic udon, bc it was just whatever. on the other hand, she got this basic cold soba like one... and that one was pretty bomb.... so... I guess... don't order the wrong udon. OH... also, i ordered a egg tempura, and it came SUPER late after i was pretty done w/ my meal... and then that sucked because it ended up being pointless. eh... probably wouldn't give this place a second chance either way I look at it."
10/28/2015,20151028,3,4.25,"I yelped ""uni"" and found this place. I am a passionate uni eater (when I am stressed, I ""take"" 2 trays of uni to ""feel better"")As an uni lover, I was very disappointed with my experience. I like how uni is light, fresh, and sweet. In the uni udon, I can obviously taste the bitterness of low grade uni, and the cream made it really heavy. The udon itself is good. A place worth trying, just ADVOID uni udon! Bummer!"
10/28/2015,20151028,3,4.25,"I think I ordered the wrong thing. I just got one of the basic plain udons... and it was whatever. I didn't want to calorically commit to a uni cream pasta... or whatever heavy crazy pastas they have here, but my boss told me that their udons are off the chain because they're hand made.... I guess not off the chain if its a basic udon, bc it was just whatever. on the other hand, she got this basic cold soba like one... and that one was pretty bomb.... so...

10/30/2015,20151030,5,4.25,"Let me just say, that I have been wasting my time in the Daikokuya lines for far too many years. When here stood Maragame Monzo. I ordered the Vongole Udon. Holy cow. Fusion food at it's finest. I normally would gravitate toward the mentai squid butter udon, but I was feeling something lighter and comforting. The butter/wine sauce had the perfect blend of flavors. Not overly salted with just a hint of briny sweetness from the clams. P ordered a plain udon soup with a side of tempura chicken and tempura battered boiled egg. I don't know what sorcery they used, but the yolk was bright orange and runny. Holy cow it was good. They give you the perfect portions; I felt comfortably full and satisfied. The service is very quick, attentive, and friendly! The place was already filling up when we arrived at opening time. But just as quickly emptied out for the next herd of patrons. 5 stars are well deserved here."
10/30/2015,20151030,4,4.25,"Alright I went back and the Carbonara here is legit. The wait is not the business and tables are REALLY close to each other, but I crave this place more often than not now. MONZOOOOOOI'm actually going here tonight and really excited!"
10/30/2015,20151030,5,4.25,"Love the Udon... cut fresh in-front of you... and they have many different styles.One with cream sauce and bacon (yum yum) One with sea urchin cream and I ad the spicy row (yummy)My date gets the normal udon and she loves it.... boring.The Asahi Black is on draft (bonus) I will bring some wine to this place someday... but have not cared to yet.Great (really great) tempura and creative too.Sad that this review may help pack this place even more... but I must hand it to them, they are doing a very good job.  Pretty clean (especially for the area) and the service is very good."
11/2/2015,20151102,4,4.25,"THE UDON NOODLES ARE CRACK & FRESHLY HANDMADE. Juicy and thick. DELICIOUS. Came here around lunch time and was seated right away. I ordered the miso carbonara udon with a side of tempura soft-boiled egg and the kama-age rice bowl (lunch special for an additional $3 with the udon). The miso carbonara is creamy, filling and delicious! It almost tasted like pasta! I couldn't taste the miso though. Bacon was thick.The tempura soft-boiled egg, lemme tell you.. when you break into that egg, the crispiness of the tempura and the yolky goodness just melts in your mouth with the udon noodles!The kama-age rice bowl was okay. I was definitely full with the udon.* FYI: if you're not fully satisfied with the udon portions, just ask them to double the portion size for an additional $2. You get a huge bowl of udon!Ok I'm done! Just try this udon."
11/2/2015,20151102,5,4.25,"The wait was 20 minutes. It was windy outside of Little Tokyo. The small udon establishment neighbored a ramen joint and a slew of hip/hop ironic t-shirt and novelty stores that would give places like Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic a run for their money. This was an isolated part of downtown Los Angeles, yet very much a part of the city's history. Away from Skid Row and the museums, it had its own culture, it's own vibe. It was filled with people of my kind. Which by-the-way has nothing to do with race. But it has everything to do with principles. People of my kind are people who know where the good food is at.These are the tweens, millennials, and working class Gen X'ers. A Japanese cultural center and plaza is across the street, a spot-on way to kill the wait time. A warning to the famished who come here, there are many distractions that will fill your tummy before you even start to dine at the spot you came for. This is good news, in fact. It helps kill the wait times because of the impatient and hangry parties.The wait time was quickly reduced to 5 minutes...2...1. The doors opened to a narrow rectangular restaurant and the sounds of slurping crescendoed. Small 2-4 table parties were smooshed together. The only place where there was ample room was at the bar counter. The bar features the fastest service because the middle person (ie: the waitress) is not needed. Your order is given to one of the several Latino line cooks and when the food is done, the cooks give you your order immediately when it is scooped into a bowl. Sure, the order is eventually told to the wait staff so they can plug it in their computer system, but other than that, there isn't a need for them.The majority of the patrons are of Asian decent (whether it be American born or not). The wait staff is of Asian decent too. The line cooks are all Latino, but these Latinos make some of the best Japanese udon noodles one has ever slurped up.The menu is predominantly udon and tempura dishes. One doesn't need to actually read the menu to know that these are the specialty dishes. Instead, they can look over through the looking class at the kitchen and see the Latino cooks roll and cut hand made noodles with TLC.Uni udon, Duck udon, a tempura egg, and tempura shrimp were ordered. A place like this, a Spotify playlist isn't needed. The soundtrack comes from the eating. Those are usually the best tunes anyway. There is some ample chatting to and fro between tables, but when the bowls of noodles make their thud on the table, the majority of the restaurant's inhabitants shut up.The uni udon was like a seafood lobster bisque with little pieces of the sea urchin row mixed in. It consisted of a pink color and its consistency was creamy and thick. The duck udon had 8 pieces of thick cut roasted duck breast. The beef broth it was served in was on the smoky side without being overly salty. These noodle dishes were quite simple. The best dishes are always quite simple. Three ingredients: noodles, soup, and a protein. Instead of bread, the innards of the bowl were ""scarpetta'ed"" with the lightly fried accoutrements. One doesn't leave stuffed or full. They leave fulfilled and replenished. They leave happy with a smile on their face. More more can you ask for?"
11/3/2015,20151103,4,4.25,"Fresh udon doesn't get any fresher. The fresh noodles and delicious broth is the next big thing since theres no marukame here in Cali. unfortunately, the prices is much higher but it's worth the sacrifice since there isn't any place that can satisfied my taste bud in Los Angeles. I came here on a Thursday night and to my surprise there was no wait. I order the shrimp tempura and I found it to be quite delicious. the broth was light yet flavorful. the one item I should of order more of was the kakiage. definitely addicting!"
11/4/2015,20151104,3,4.25,"I would give this place 4 stars because I did taste their uni pasta which I thought was really good (but I unfortunately couldn't order it for fear of cream repercussions), but I got their curry udon. I really liked the flavoring of the curry, as there was a little bit of a spice to it, but the fact that there was so little meat in it was disappointing. I think I came across 4 little pieces. That irked me."
11/5/2015,20151105,4,4.25,"I see alot of people recomending mentai squid uni udon, so when I visited the place I ordered it with high expectation. Okay, it wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't good as I expected either. the portion was okay for me, but you might want to consider ordering as a combo with a bowl.the place doesn't have any parking space by the way."

11/7/2015,20151107,5,4.25,"My favorite udon place in LA (so far)! They make their noodles fresh and in front of you (if you get the lucky seats at the bar). I heard the wait can be a bit long (but not as long as their neighboring noodle shop Daikokuya), but since we came early it wasn't a wait at all. Parking is a bit of a hassle, and got a $10 flat rate one across the street.I got the Sea Urchin (Uni) Udon- which is probably what they are most known for. The soup base was rich and creamy and had lots of pieces of Uni. The udon noodles itself was mildly soft and chewy and perfectly done. I am a big eater, especially after work/gym, so I got a side of egg (tempura battered and soft boiled inside; although not flavorful at all...) and shrimp tempura (nicely done with flaky tempura crust; not the thick battery kine).Would love to come back- want to try their Mentai Squid Butter Udon, which is also great from what I hear!"

The food comes out relatively fast and always piping hot. I've lived in Los Angeles for a little over a year and have eaten here at least 5 times already!My recommendation: Get the pork belly rice bowl! It is simply the most delicious rice bowl I have ever had. The pork belly is thinly cut, tender, and savory and the seasoning is simple, yet satisfying.If you havent tried their creamy udons, the sea urchin cream udon and the bacon carbonara are both yummy."
11/8/2015,20151108,5,4.25,One thing about this place is that it is PACKED. But it certainly lives up to the hype.The restaurant is pretty small but the service and the food was what made up for it definitely. I waited about 30-40 minutes.I ordered the hot beef udon double portion. If you're hungry this will certainly get you full. The broth was what made it amazing.Overall it was a good experience and the food is quite good. Recommend to try it.

11/9/2015,20151109,4,4.25,"soo good!i thoroughly enjoyed the creamy uni udon but i dont think i would get it again for $15. Uni was barely there. Don't get me wrong, it was really really good and I would eat it again and again, but it really should be called creamy cheesy udon (and cost maybe $9 TOPS)My boyfriend got the regular basic udon (i think kake-udon?) with double order noodles which was well worth the money and very good taste. 1 was enough for me, but he eats a lot so he got 2 order of noodles.We came at open so there was barely anyone there but we were kind of in a rush with only 45 minutes to eat, and the food took forever to come out. We were like the second people there but some other people who arrived well after us got their appetizers before we got our soups.Anyway it's really good and the noodles are amazing quality! Next time I wanna try the carbonara."
11/9/2015,20151109,5,4.25,"Great place for udon with pretty reasonabke prices considering you're getting handmade noodles and just great quality food in general. Most of the house specialties challenge your preconceptions of what udon is supposed to be with dishes like the uni udon and mentai squid butter udon that taste more like pasta dishes. I recommend getting shishamo as an appetizer, deep fried pregnant smelt if you like oily fish. If you're not a fan of fish like mackerel this may not be for you. Also recommend getting the fried soft boiled egg with your udon if you're not getting one of the richer udons, it adds that extra bit of luxury to a great meal."

11/10/2015,20151110,5,4.26,Came here for mine and my boyfriends anniversary dinner. To our surprise there was no wait and we were sat down immediately! We were approached by a server quickly after we sat down. I ordered the uni udon and my boyfriend had the udon gratin. Both were delicious. Of course i would have loved more uni in my dish but its understandable. Uni is pricy and you get what you pay for. The gratin was very cheesy and tasted like a fettuccine alfredo almost. It was a great experience but we plan on going with the traditional udons time! I also want to try the squid butter one.
11/10/2015,20151110,5,4.26,"I usually won't go OMG on udon because it's just light and soupy - seems like something I would only crave when I'm sick. But I would definitely go out of my way to come here even when I'm not sick! The quality of the food is really good, and they give you a big ball of noodles with a great ratio between other ingredients and noodles! It's definitely a MUST TRY place!"

These guys do it right!!!In the last few years, there's been a huge trend towards ramen, but the younger p, more flavorful and bastard stepchild, udon has never gotten it's reign atop the hipster pyramid of meal options...Probably why you can still get a seat at this place and there's a 2-hr wait for Daikokuya down the street...perfect for me! This place is udon heaven. They have everything from the basics to the most creative. Never thought uni and udon would go together...probably the same as those original inventors of the peanut butter and jelly....but when e combination hits your mouth, you ask yourself, where've you been all my life?Definitely recommend to all my friends when they're in d.town to swing by this place"

11/12/2015,20151112,4,4.26,"I looovee udon noodle so I wanted to try out a fusion of it. These handcut noodles were perfect size. Not too big not too large and perfect to slurp!We got the mentai squid butter and the udon gratin. The udon gratin is basically fettucine pasta..yet it was different. It's more loose than regular Italian fettucine. On top of that, when you see something so creamy, it's hard to even want to take another bite. BUT this is what I love about my dish. Even though it looked heavy, when you take a bite, it's just sooo good and not as creamy as it looks. They give you a good amount of chicken in the dish. Even so, for me, I wouldn't get it again unless I was craving something creamy! I rather have the udon gratin over regular Italian chicken fettucine any day. The mentai squid butter was gooooood! I love that in the soup (or the butter base..) You could taste the flavor of squid. There were fish eggs that gave great compliment to it. I wouldn't mind getting this again unless I crave an actually soup base.The only downside that both dishes are extremely oily. I'm not sure if they can do anything to reduce the oil but we couldn't clean the dish cause the amount of oil gets to you. We also had the beef appetizer (I forgot what it was called) but it was super duper good! Even though it was literally garnished with oil. Overall, I would for sure come back to try the other specialty udons and the regular ones!"
11/13/2015,20151113,3,4.26,"I unfortunately did not enjoy it as much as everyone else did. I found this place by youtubers I follow and they said it was ""bomb"". I feel like IT IS good, but it gets so tiring to eat, I literally got sick of eating it. It's just too much, that you want something else to eat instead.We went during lunch and the wait was about 30 minutes or so. Not much appetizers to try on the menu since they have a different lunch and dinner menu. The only appetizer they had was basically tempura things like fried tempura with one shrimp and veggies or fried tempura Shishamo (little fishes) or salad.The waiter wasn't much of a help with what to order or things to add to your udon (spoke to us like we were dumb) nor was he attentive when it came to service after we ordered.--Assorted Tempura (4/5) - 1 shrimp, 1 slice of mushroom, sweet potato, eggplant and some fried kale. The tempura was a really fresh fried taste to it. Probably the best, fresh tempura i've had.--Miso Carbonara (2.5/5) - Creamy, bacon-y creamed udon that was a bit thick. Too much of the cream and thick noodles got a bit overwhelming. It was good, it was fresh, but it was just over-kill--Sea Urchin Cream Udon (3/5) - Uni is something that is really hard for me to eat sushi style, but the uni udon was better than what I had expected. I didn't taste much of the uni, but it had a different taste and the flavoring was excellent. I would have rather ordered this than the miso carbonara, but this too would have been overwhelming for me.The view of the people that make the udon is excellent, shows how freshly they're made and how they perfection each roll and cut. It's a very small restaurant so it is understandable why the wait is probably always so long, but if I were to ever come here again then I would come during dinner to try the appetizers I was dying to try and get something more soupy and clear."
11/13/2015,20151113,5,4.26,"Pretty fast wait considering how busy it was. Got to sit at the bar and watch the fresh udon being made whish was awesome!! The food is super tastey, a little packed inside bit totally worth the trip I'd you are in Little Tokyo."
11/14/2015,20151114,4,4.26,This place was so good. I tried out the urchin cream udon and I really liked it. I can see why some people wouldn't like it though. It might be a little too creamy for some people but it had a new unique flavor that I never got to have in other places. My friend ordered the pork meat udon and the broth and the meat was amazing! The meat is sweet and super tender and the soup is very nice. The quality of the noodle is good too. If you want to try out something new then try the urchin udon. If not go for the normal hot udons :)
11/14/2015,20151114,5,4.26,The udon here is worth the wait !! I got the vongole which is udon with clams which was so good! It was a little too salty for me but my bf said it tasted fine to him. I also tried their regular beef udon and the flavor was mouth watering. A lot of people get the sea urchin udon which is what they're most popular for which I definitely want to try next time. Definitely craving udon as I write this review.
11/15/2015,20151115,1,4.26,yoshinoya beef bowl in jtown thats all about itbeef udon = yoshinoya beef bowl with soup very overpriced !! rip off do not waste your money
11/16/2015,20151116,5,4.26,"People weren't exaggerating about the udon here, which were excellent. My fave is the curry udon. I get excited just thinking about it. I'm not a curry lover, but the curry base is semi sweetened and light so the broth is slurped like a soup. Udon noodles are fresh and chewy to the last bite. Portion looks big, but you'll plow through it in no time; it really is that good. Everybody seems to like the uni udon, even those who claim they don't normally eat uni. I like it just okay. The consistency is too dense and creamy for me. Soupy ones are good but nothing to go home about. Go for the curry udon; you won't be disappointed! Warning: all members in the group must be present before they can seat you."
11/16/2015,20151116,4,4.26,"This was my third time here and I'm very much a fan. I came with a group of 4 other friends and were seated right away at the bar. It was really cool to be seated in front of the chefs making the noodles they served by hand.I started off with the Pork Belly Rice bowl and it was okay. Each bite I took was different in the sense that one bite would lack flavor while the next would be a bit too salty. I ordered the Udon Gratin, which is covered in cheese and has some bits of chicken in it. The first few bites were really good, but after that the cheesiness got a little overpowering and the rest of bowl got kinda tiresome.Once everyone got their noodles we passed our bowls around to taste each order's orders. Out of all the udons my favorite was the Vongole Udon, which has clams in it. The Sea Urchin Udon had a very strong seafood taste that was too powerful for my personal taste, but I'm not much of a seafood person so others might view it differently. The Curry Udon was alright. There was a lot of sauce but not that much noodles in it and my friend that ordered it was still hungry after she finished it. On that note, I feel like the portions are kinda small. I can't really eat all that much in one sitting, but I always order a rice bowl when I come here because one bowl of udon isn't enough to satisfy my belly.I think my past experiences here were better. I prefer the Beef Rice Bowl over what I got this time. And the Miso Carbonara and Porcini Udon from past visits were really good. Definitely recommend these two."
11/17/2015,20151117,4,4.26,"I'm a soba person. There you go, end of review.Just kidding.I like all kinds of noodles. All shapes and sizes from around the world. And you can't beat the fresh ones. At monzo, it's a guarantee that your udon is not only fresh, but the best in Little Tokyo.Their uni (sea urchin) cream udon is simply irresistible. You can smell it as it is brought to your table from the kitchen. It is creamy and rich. It can get heavy, but who cares, this is my favorite dish and I will keep coming back for more."
11/17/2015,20151117,4,4.26,"All the udons were goodliked the squid one the bestsea urchin one was least favorite but still goodbeef udon was good as expected, but wasn't unique like the othersthe carbonera was also goodI really enjoyed the cold udon with plum sauce"
11/17/2015,20151117,4,4.26,"I had high expectations based off of reviews and recommendations, and I was not disappointed. I was finally able to try the Sea Urchin Cream Udon, and the hand-made udon was so soft and fresh! I am not even a big udon fan, and still enjoyed this dish. It definitely hit the spot on a cold & windy evening and was quite filling (despite my eyes deceiving me about the amount in the bowl). The only downside is that I can see how it can get too creamy for people who don't like creamy dishes and the price of the udon can be a bit pricey (worth it for me because it was freshly made). The interior is quite small, and they pack a good number of people inside. The wait was not too bad since we came 30 minutes after they opened on a weekday evening. However, if there is a long wait, be prepared to wait outside since they do not have much space inside. The bathroom is quite clean as well (although I was a bit taken aback by the mirrors inside).Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and try the Negitoro/Pork Belly rice bowl next time!"
11/18/2015,20151118,4,4.26,"I've never been a big fan of udon, but apparently that's because I've been having bad udon. This place is definitely the go to for udon.The day I went there was a bigger line here than Daikokuya next door! It was a bit of a wait (30min+) but it was worth it!"
11/18/2015,20151118,4,4.25,"Really good but super crowded. Last time we went it was for Sat dinner and the wait time was at least an hour. I ordered the Tempura Udon which was delicious, but my friend's Uni Cream Udon was kinda gross..."
11/19/2015,20151119,5,4.26,"let's just say that after finishing the udon in my uni cream udon i was tempted to use my drink straw to sip out the remaining uni cream sauce... because it was THAT good... but alas i didn't because it was a business meal so you know, gotta keep it professional.the texture of the house made udon was on point. and cooked to perfection, it wasn't tough NOR too soggy. just the way i like my udon!and the uni cream? thought it only happens in my dreams but seriously SO good. perfectly creamy to coat the udon with pieces of uni. i love the ikura because once you mix those in they will burst by surprise :)anyways, what i'm trying to say is, you won't regret ordering the $15.95 uni cream udon. so worth the money.we had a party of 8 and arrived promptly at 11:30 for lunch. we were seated right away and didn't take long for the excellent udon to silence the whole group. we were in and out of the restaurant within 1 hour, they definitely got efficiency down!"
11/20/2015,20151120,4,4.26,"The squid cream udon transformed what we all know tastes like squid into something I have never tasted before. It was creamy yet tasted like a master chef cooked a portion of fish. The crazy thing was it was squid. Very cool!! I also ordered the Uni cream udon which inherently placed the Uni flavor in the sauce yet the actual Uni was cooked to taste more meat-like as opposed to its usual raw flavor. The cooked Uni was something I never tasted before either. The Uni consistency was hardy and thickened in texture. Several experiences before, the Uni was a flavor that complimented risotto or pasta but this dish made Uni the star if the plate because of its texture in the udon. We also ordered the fish tempura udon with a soft boiled egg. The shrimp were huge and the tempura batter was perfectly absorbent to the soup. The only suggestion I have for the restaurant is a fresher or completely warmed soft boiled egg would have been more charming. But the Uni itself was on point with freshness, thickness, and consistency!"
11/20/2015,20151120,5,4.26,This place is good for 2 people only you get your table faster the Miso carbonara and pork belly rice bowl are delicious will come again
11/21/2015,20151121,4,4.26,"*Park in public lot if you can't find street parkingUni udon.Because of a last minute lunch location change, my friend and I ended up in Little Tokyo. I decided on Marugame Monzo since it's been bookmarked forever.We put our names in and waited about 15 minutes to be seated on a busy Saturday afternoon.Seating is a bit tight in the restaurant. There was about a large handbag's worth of space between myself and the two patrons flanking either side of me. The too close for comfort environment means EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOUR CONVERSATIONS. I of course, went for the uni. My friend got the squid. Her broth was good and tasty, but the uni outshined. Creamy, rich, but not overly so. The noodles were perfectly cooked. I was in uni cream heaven.The giant spoons they give you do little to aid in slurping every last bit of uni ""chowder"". I was scraping my bowl and feeling a bit.. barbaric.I am definitely returning for another bowl of uni udon, and convincing my cohort to try something new so I can keep tabs on the rest of the menu."
11/21/2015,20151121,5,4.26,"Never knew udon could be like this.MUST ORDER: Seafood Tomato Cream Udon - 6/5Deep Fried Tempura Egg - 5/5Negitoro Bowl - 4.5/5(2) Uni Udon - 4/5Carbonara Udon - 3.5/5Pork Belly Udon - 3.5/5The seafood udon was sooooooo good. It had the perfect marriage of tartness from the tomatoes and creaminess from the broth. Everything about this dish was amazing! Literally licked the bowl clean. Wish I ordered 1 more to go so I could eat it right now...We were a group of 4. Yes, we ordered 5 udon dishes + 1 negitoro bowl. After the waitress brought our 4th udon dish, she was certain it was a mistake to bring our 5th bowl so she took it back, LOL. Negitoro bowl was so delicious. The toro tasted fresh and fatty. The dish was light and small. It worked perfectly as our ""dessert"" after our heavy udon meal. Wait was about 10-15 minutes on a Thursday night around 8pm. Totally worth it. Service was polite and kind. You could ask anyone for anything and they would be on top of it. It's right across the street from the Japanese Village Plaza and right next door to Daiko. Definitely coming back here soon!"
11/21/2015,20151121,4,4.26,"Looooong wait, but it was (somewhat) worth it. AWESOME udon. Awesome service. Broth/ sauces were just so-so. I had shrimp tempura udon, tried some curry udon, miso carbonara, and the uni udon. Although I enjoyed them all, nothing really stood out. The noodle (texture and taste) was definitely the star of the show. Side dishes were great! We ordered crispy chicken skin and pork belly rice bowl. So delicious!Parking was $10 at the parking structure right across the street."
11/23/2015,20151123,5,4.26,"The food here is so delicious! I love udon noodles and haven't had it in awhile so I decided to give this place a try.I was starving and was happy when there wasn't a wait when I got there for dinner on a Friday evening. I tried both the curry udon and duck udon noodles and recommend both! The curry udon tasted just like the regular Japanese curry you get at other Japanese restaurants. I liked the duck flavor because it's a unique flavor that most restaurants don't offer. Since this is downtown LA, you have to look for street parking!"
11/24/2015,20151124,5,4.26,"I mean it's only udon right? Riiiiggghhhtt until you take the first slurp!We ordered:Beef tataki - average, chewy 2 uni udon - very flavorful with buttery broth 2 draft asahi - served with waaaayyy too much foam Total: $60 and change, tipped $12Arrived around 7:45 pm on a Tuesday night and I was about the 6th on the wait list. That quickly grew. We were seated in about 30 minutes (about 4 transients asked us for money). Seated at the bar but still spacious. Food comes out fast and all in order (as in appetizers about 5 mins before udon). Prompt, courteous, and delicious. Definitely will be back to try an udon I can drink the broth though. Uni udon broth is a bit too buttery to eat alone but someone next to me ordered what looked like a tempura udon and he ate it down to the last drop. Surprised he didn't lick the bowl."
11/24/2015,20151124,4,4.26,"If you like fresh pasta, you'll love this place. Fresh, hand pulled udon noodles in amazing flavorful broth. They have tables and a noodle bar. It can get pretty busy even at lunchtime, so expect to wait especially if you have a large group. I would DEF recommend this place if you are fan of udon, ramen, etc, noodles in general. The quality and quantity are on par and you won't be disappointed. Parking is somewhat difficult, being street/meter. There is a lot across the street as well."
11/25/2015,20151125,5,4.26,i ordered cold beef udon i think its pretty worth it
11/27/2015,20151127,5,4.26,"If you like udon and you've never been here, you are doing yourself a disgrace.Having grown up eating really good udon since I have a lot of Japanese native friends, I am super picky about it. Marugame hits the spot every time.My favorite: pork belly udon, the carbonara, sea urchin udon, duck udon."
11/27/2015,20151127,5,4.26,"Their uni udon is fantastic!! Creamy and the udon is nice and chewy. Even my 4 year old niece loves it and asks to get the ""creamy noodles"" when she comes to visit."
11/28/2015,20151128,5,4.26,"The squid udon and uni udon are definitely true to the hype. Both were absolutely delicious. First the noodle consistency on both were nearly perfect. I do wish they were a little more under cooked, more aldente but I understand that it's not how udon noodles are normally prepared.The soup base for both are awesome!! I am used to the traditional soups so this was a new experience but I am very pleased. Also the spicy tuna ricebowl was a great addition. It had a little too much sesame oil but it tasted great. :)"
11/28/2015,20151128,5,4.26,"One of my first meals since moving to LA was at this delicious place. To be honest, we came in here because the wait was shorter than the one next door at Daikokuya. No regrets here, just a wonderful memory of warm noodle dish filling our tummies. We went on a Saturday night around 7pm; two of us waited about 20 min before being seated (compared to a 1 hour wait at Daikokuya). Service was efficient and considerate.The tables are close together, so you can pretty much hear all the conversations around you, especially if other patrons have speech immodulation disorder (yes, the table next to us had that). So there isn't much privacy here, but isn't that part of the fun of dining in a small, bustling restaurant? There are a few things more entertaining than watching two adults awkwardly wade through their first date over a meal consisting of slippery noodles.Anyway, the food. What everyone has said so far is true. Mentai Squid Butter udon was creamy, brothy, savory, but not heavy or too salty. And I don't know how they cooked the squid, but it was buttery soft and it barely needed chewing. We also got the Kitsune udon, which was clean and delicious, just like how Kitsune udon should be. For sides, we ordered Kakiage (recommend) and MUST-HAVE soft-boiled eggs. OMG the egg, you guys. I could eat that egg with nothing else everyday. With crispy, hot tempura outer shell, the egg is still soft on the inside, oozing the yolk ever so seductively when you cut into it. I was too busy eating to take pictures; thankfully, other more dedicated yelpers have taken many pictures for your viewing pleasure.We'll definitely go back soon."
12/1/2015,20151201,5,4.26,"I cannot get enough of this place. My most favorite thing to eat is udon and this place is AMAZING. If you're super lucky, you'll get a seat in front of the clear window and you can eat and enjoy the sight of a chef making fresh udon right in front of you. I usually always order the TEMPURA UDON because I love tempura and it never lacks in flavor or quality. I've tried the CURRY UDON and BEEF UDON and they're both delicious also! The curry udon is thicker and much more filling because of how thick the curry is, but it is still good. I love this place. The wait can be long, but it is DEFINITELY worth it"
12/1/2015,20151201,5,4.26,"A must if in the Little Tokyo area of downtown LA! First came here with a friend that had heard good things about it, and was faced with a waiting list and a crowd of people outside. Once I was inside with a bowl of udon noodles, however, it all made perfect sense. The udon is absolutely delicious! You just can't get this authentic, amazing taste at most places! I loved the big, deep bowls that the udon comes in, and they have Windows to the kitchen so you can watch the cooks making the udon noodles and other food materials! I loved it, and went back there a second time for a date! Definitely recommend if you're looking for some delicious Japanese cuisine!"
12/2/2015,20151202,5,4.26,"I've been hearing nothing but good things about this place, but it all came to a head when I actually found myself sitting there with a bowl of sea urchin udon right in front of me ready to be devoured. The night started off with my brother, boyfriend, and I arriving there at 5:30pm on a Friday night. As expected, there was already a wait attesting to the popularity of this place. Keep in mind, there isn't really a waiting area inside, so you'd most likely be waiting outside in the cold, which only makes you even more ready for the warmth of their dishes inside. The groups of 2 who came after us were being called in very quickly because most of the tables accommodated 2 people, so I might come back just with just one other person next time. We waited and waited in anticipation and finally got called! YES! It was about a 30 minute wait for us. They take your order very quickly. They are very efficient in getting your order out fast, your check out fast, and getting you out fast because of the masses outside waiting for their turn. I can appreciate that. We ended up ordered the fried chicken skins, uni udon, mentai squid butter, and udon gratin with three additional tempura soft boiled eggs. All three udon dishes were amazing! Life changing really. The texture of each udon strand is so soft and chewy. You can tell they were made fresh and with care. The chicken skins were also really good. Toward the last 1/4 of my bowl, the udon was getting a bit heavy however. Next time, I plan on getting some of their rice bowls to share and cut the heaviness of the specialty udon dishes. I would definitely come back again. Their food is just too unique and flavorful not to."
12/2/2015,20151202,5,4.26,"I LOVE this place!!! I've been coming as a consistent customer for about a year now. I go around once a month and it's always delicious.The prices are extremely fair, quality of food is amazing, and everything is top-notch. Since I've been the only problem is the occasionally long wait times and sometimes if you have a big group they'll squeeze you into a four-seater. But regardless, service is always good!Things I've had...Kake Udon - Great and flavorful, very standard Udon. The noodles are super good - the perfect amount of chewy and freshness. *TIP* order the Kake and then get your sides - it will most likely ALWAYS be cheaper! (For instance I used to order shrimp tempura udon, but now i do Kake with a side of shrimp tempura! Way cheaper :) )Kitsune Udon - Not bad. Good flavor profile. However, the kitsune is a bit sweeter and if you let it soak in your bowl it'll change the flavor as well.Shrimp Tempura Udon - Really good. I like how they give you two sides of shrimp tempuraChicken Tempura Udon - Great again. They also give you two sides of chicken!Miso Carbonara Udon - Good, but took a while getting used too. I enjoy my carbonara with lighter sauce and thinner noodles. However, the flavor profile was defnitely there!Udon Gratin - OMG SO GOOD. This reminded me of italian noodles I would get whenever I visited an asian country. The sauce is really creamy, rich, and thick. There's a lot of flavor!! It's also extremely filling. The dish comes in a pot and is essentially baked with cheese on top.Soft-Boiled Egg - Really enjoyed it. I really like the yolks of egg's runny, but if you don't, do not order this since it'll run into your soup!Shrimp - Good, quality shrimp that's also large in portion.Fishcake - DELICIOUS. This is honestly the best fishcake I've had. Inside of the fishcake there's a creamy part and it totally just adds to the flavor combination. Try this when you go there!!Negitoro Rice Bowl - THIS IS MY FAVORITE THING ON THE MENU!! Ok, so I took a chance with this the first time I got it and I have never regretted it! I was a bit skeptical since Monzo is more of a noodle soup versus a sushi or fish shop - but this side is my life. The tuna is fresh and there's plenty of it. They put this mayo sauce on it and if you mix it all together, it is literally heaven in your mouth. Beef Tataki - Great! Like a beef capraccio, but still really nice. Flavor profile is great and there's a lot of it. I would recommend this for groups of 3+"
12/3/2015,20151203,5,4.26,"I love this place! I always come here with my boyfriend when it's not so busy. On the weekends it gets way too packed and the wait is usually 30 minutes or more! Anyways, if you haven't tried it, you shouldn't think twice. The fried chicken skin appetizer is delicious! It's like fried pork rinds except more refined and comes with ponzu sauce that's perfectly citrusy and flavorful. The portions of their udon are huge! Come with a hungry stomach! I like their cold noodles, especially when it's hot or when I don't feel like eating too much. The miso carbonara is a creamy udon base with bits of bacon. It's really creamy and creamy! The udon soups are also yummy. I recommend getting their add ons like the chicken tempura or daikon radish! The service is friendly but not out of the ordinary."
12/5/2015,20151205,5,4.26,One of my favorite restaurants in LA. They serve the best udon in the world. Love the open kitchen where you can see them making fresh udon.SEAFOOD TOMATO CREAM UDON is my favorite. The taste of tomato makes it not so creamy. Don't forget to add a DEEP FRIED TEMPURA EGG. Be prepared for the looooong line and street parking hassssssle.
12/6/2015,20151206,4,4.26,"This restaurant has great handmade udon. I ordered the Zaru udon (cold dipping udon) and the negitoro bowl as a part of the lunch special (I recommend the special!). The udon had the perfect firmness and the dipping sauce complemented the noodles very well. This place tends to be crowded, but it's worth the wait!"
12/8/2015,20151208,5,4.26,Uni Carbonara was amazing. Never had anything like it and wish to have it more often. Great noodles. Long wait is worth every minute.
12/9/2015,20151209,3,4.26,"Food was good, but a little pricy. There's tons of udon and I got the udon with beef and a tempura fried egg. I have to dock stars because of the service. The waiter kept coming over and pressuring us to leave, and then brought the bill over while we were still eating. I get that the place is pretty packed but seriously? I don't think I'll be coming back here."
12/9/2015,20151209,5,4.26,"Marugame over Daikokuya + Shinsengumi combined.I know Daikokuya and Shinsengumi are ramen shops, but if you're not feeling picky about specifically eating ramen and are open to any kind of noodles, then come here. I've also been seated a lot faster at Marugame, so there's a great first impression for ya.Now, onto the food. I loooove the quality of their noodles. So soft and chewy, but not too watered down. Whether its in the uni cream udon or the tempura udon, the udon noodles steal the show. The uni cream udon can be heavy if you're not splitting it with another person, so get something like the beef tataki to cleanse your palette from all the cream.The restaurant is a little small so I recommend coming here with a party no bigger than 4 people.I love that the service here is fast, efficient, and friendly!I'll be back to try all the other udon items on the menu :-)"
12/9/2015,20151209,5,4.26,"I love sitting at the bar where you can watch the udon makers in action. It's almost meditative the way they move and cut those noodles. This place is fantastic, I love the tempura egg and the duck udon. Sometimes the wait is long but I've definitely gone where I barely had to wait at all. Worth the visit either way."
12/10/2015,20151210,5,4.26,"Oh yeah.I LOVE marugame monzo. There are times where there's a long long loooooooooong wait, and there are times where there is no wait. Luck of the draw I think.If you can get a seat at the fishbowl (aka right in front of the kitchen where they're making and cutting the fresh udon). Wait, did I just say FRESH udon? Yes sir, ma'am I did. Fresh udon + creative flavors = an epic awesome meal. A little on the pricey side, but totally worth your while. The udon is chewy, cooked to a perfection.What to try:Mentai Squid Udon - Squid-y buttery goodness in a bowl. The bowls look tiny, but seriously, it's a lot of food (looks are deceiving, ya)Uni Udon - OH yes. The piece de resistance. If you are an Uni fan, this is a must try. There's so much uni, creamy soup, and udon. You won't want or crave anything else.Beef Tataki - meh. Taste was delicious, but the slices of beef was just a tad too thick where the sauce/marinade doesn't soak in.Parking:Sucks in Little tokyo. Paid lots or parking meters.Takes cc, cash."
12/11/2015,20151211,4,4.26,"this place and their damn wait! when your food is good but the restaurant is small (as I noticed most Japanese restaurants are), then you get Marugame Monzo. They make fresh udon visibly to the customers behind a window, and you can see your udon getting freshly hand made. I usually take a small bite of the uni udon from whoever I'm with (because whoever I'm with always gets the uni udon), and get the curry udon for myself (bomb). Tried their shrimp tempura udon and that was pretty average.It is located on 1st street, so parking in a structure or finding street parking are your options (no valet). The reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because last time I was here, I tried the soft-boiled egg (which was delicious), but everyone who ate one got really sick afterwards. Still, for getting sick from eating here, I think 4 stars is pretty solid and deserved."
12/11/2015,20151211,1,4.26,"it was freezing tonight (low 40s windy and after rain), was told that the wait would be 25-30mins. so we waited in front for a bit then stepped away for 10mins to find out they crossed our name out. we went in to ask about it the guy was really rude and yelled at us, ""so u were not here when we called!"" we said no and he repeated again loudly. we asked if they could put us back in line next they guy yelled the same thing again. he said u can line up again (there are around 10 more after us and we JUST missed the call). we left. but one star for the ""service"". NO ONE EVER TOLD US THE POLICY and I dun think u need to yell at us. don't think we will ever come back again."
12/12/2015,20151212,5,4.26,"I dream of this place sometimes. I first ate here back in September and hands down the best udon I have ever had. The noodles are hand pulled and if you sit at the bar, the noodle making process can be seen behind the clear paneling. It's a quite small and popular place so expect a wait! They also operate like most Japanese places and are closed after lunch but reopen later for dinner. The first time I was here I shared the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and the Sea Urchin Cream Udon with a friend. It was amazing. The broth of the Mentai was so satisfying and light while the Sea Urchin was rich and creamy. The perfect complements to each other. They also have a list of tempura sides from which I got the soft boiled egg. I never knew it was possible to tempura it but that was incredible. Crunchy on the outside but a gooey on the inside. I was in a lovely food coma at the end of my meal. After that visit, I would think about the food with fondness and a craving for udon every once in awhile. I found myself in LA on Friday and knew I had to go here again. The wait was surprisingly not too long but it helps that it was just me that was eating. I noticed that parties of 2 tend to be seated faster. But any wait is worth it! As that day was cold and randomly started raining, udon was the perfect thing to order. I ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon again. It was even better that I remembered. The best comfort food to warm you right up. I'll keep dreaming about this udon until I can return to it again. Farewell delicious udon."
12/12/2015,20151212,5,4.26,"Probably the best udon I have had in SoCal!!! FYI they open at 11:30-2:30pm and then at 5:00-10:00pm, don't come between 2:30 & 5:00pm like I did because parking is not free here. We parked in a structure less than a block away from the restaurant for $1 per HR for the first two hours.First off, I wanted to try out this place since I heard great reviews about it from my favorite YouTuber (heyclaire). In the beginning, I thought it was overhyped and the food won't be great. I didn't know that they actually make udon in front of their customers and serve special udon dishes that you will not find at a regular Japanese restaurant. We ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon and the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. One word ""AMAZING"", I am a seafood lover and i am very picky with squid because if you do not cook it right then you will be eating rubber. The squid was prepared to perfection, I didn't know I was eating squid because it was so tender and juicy. The broth of the Mentai Squid Udon is lighter than the sea urchin udon with fish roes that given the soup it's body. The sea urch is similar to a carbonara pasta dish but with udon and a rich taste from the sea urchins, if you do not like seafood then this one is probably a bad decision because sea urchin is super rich in taste and will leave you a strong seafood after taste. I don't even have to talk about the udon itself because I have no words for it.... Too good to be true.I highly recommend this place if you are an udon fan. If you are not into seafood then there are other options: tempura, beef, curry, cold udon, etc...."
12/12/2015,20151212,5,4.26,"really good!there is a bit of a wait though, and it isnt cheap for udon. I'll come back again, but probably during a weekday afternoon.the cream uni udon is really good. it tastes kind of like shrimp scampi."
12/13/2015,20151213,4,4.26,"Wait was ~20-30 min at 630PM on a wednesday night... I was blessed because a friend got there early and put us down... We actually were trying to meet at Daikokuya and since he saw a poppin' place he automatically thought it was Daikokuya... Funny enough I get there and was surprised he was at the neighbor restaurant! Daikokuya is closed on wednesday... Anyways, it was good fun trying a brand new restaurant. We ordered:Beef Tataki (2/5): meat was thick, cold and chewy.... Flavoring was good but texture and the amount you had to chew really turned me off to this dish.Fried chicken/popcorn chicken (5/5). Tender and crispy lightly battered with salt and pepper seasoning... Dip in the mayo and then the japanese chili for a ZiNG!Squid Butter Udon: (4/5) nom nom. Broth is salty, its more for just having the noodles in... I didn't drink the broth but it created a nice buttery glaze on my noodles. Squid was oh so tender that my bf thought it was fish!Side order of a fried onion string with scallops and shrimp and tempura egg (both 5/5). awesome to have on the side with ur soup.Tomato cream Udon (3.5/5) was more like a thick vodka pasta sauce with mini scallops and small shrimp. First few bites were great but it's too rich to eat a whole bowl in one sitting.Asahi Draft (5/5). speaks for itself.Service was mediocre.. Busy night. had to ask a few times for anything including water, the bill, to take our orders... Would hate to see what it's like a weekend O_oCramped space but would come back for the FRESHLY MADE UDON NOODLES. They were so delicious. This was the highlight of the night for me for sure. :D"

Luckily, there wasn't a long wait.We were seated at the bar area in front of the kitchen. It was really cool getting to see them make and cut the udon noodles. And YES! You can taste the difference. The noodles here are cooked so perfectly and it makes all the difference!"

12/15/2015,20151215,4,4.26,A pleasant surprise to find this place. I was actually trying to get to the ramen place next door which was closed on the day we went. We waited for a table for about 30 mins before they called us in. I tried the clams and pork belly appetizers. I'd definitely order the pork belly again. The clams were tasty but really small and nearly half the shells were empty. Probably wont be ordering that again. I tried the Kamaage Udon which was also good. They kept trying to take our food away while we were still eating. I think it was their way to trying to tell us to hurry up and leave because people were still waiting outside when we got up. Kind of ridiculous considering we were only in the restaurant for 35 mins after waiting for half an hour. It's not a restaurant I'd drive up to LA for but I'd definitely try it again when I'm in the area.

12/16/2015,20151216,2,4.26,The Uni udon is very heavy. The portion is small. Not worth the hype. Overpriced for small portion. Services is very good tho.

12/17/2015,20151217,4,4.26,"There is a difference between freshly made udon and out of bag udon, it is simply better. The glass window gave the eaters are great view of noodle making art. They have a great lunch special where you can also add a rice dish for only $3, but I would recommend splurge all your carb budget in the noodles!"
12/18/2015,20151218,5,4.26,"As a lover of all things uni, the uni udon here was heaven. The broth was creamy and chock full of flavor and the noodles had that chewy, homemade consistency. I inhaled the bowl and considered getting another, but I was somehow able to control inner fat kid urges. I came with the girlfriend pretty late at night (like 9pm) and there was still a 15 minute wait, so I imagine it gets hectic during peak times. Worth it though."
12/18/2015,20151218,4,4.26,"If you come later, you're going to have to wait for a while. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of udon, but I didn't think it was overwhelmingly good as it had been hyped up to be. I like that you can see them making the udon!"

12/19/2015,20151219,3,4.26,"Cool place to try for some of the creamy udon options. If you're a traditionalist and prefer your clean broths, they have those, too. However, you would be better off going elsewhere where you can still get quality noodles for half the price. I ordered the porcini mushroom udon. It was an interesting fusion of Japanese udon noodles and more Italian/Japanese fusion cream sauce. For the price (about $13), I had hoped to have more actual mushrooms in the cream. I also would have expected more noodles as I have had larger portions of udon of equal quality for closer to $8. I left feeling full only because of the richness of the cream, not because of the portion size. I would probably go here again only to try another of the creamy options that caught my eye. However, once I have tried all I wanted to try, I probably would stick with the cheap udon noodle houses."
12/19/2015,20151219,4,4.26,"Been there two times, first time got the uni udon. Soup was super rich but then second time I got the miso which I thought was better than the uni one. Would recommend it! Also please get a soft boiled egg with it!"

12/20/2015,20151220,5,4.26,"This place changes the udon game. It's located on first street in Little Tokyo across from the Japanese village plaza. Parking is pretty hard, so we parked at the parking structure across the street. We came around 6pm and there was a wait. We wrote our names down and waited for about 45mins until we were seated. The restaurant is not very big. You can see the kitchen clearly through the glass and see them making the food and the udon noodles. The noodles are made fresh and you can see them cutting the noodles in front of you. Very cool!The menu consists of traditional hot soup udon, cold udon, and their specialty udon. You can also add extras to your udon line various tempura and other toppings. I got the Miso carbonara udon with shrimp tempura, soft boiled egg tempura, and baby octopus tempura. The miso carbonara was soooooo good. Very rich and creamy. It also has bacon on top, yum!! The tempura was also very good. My absolute favorite was the soft boiled egg and baby octopus. A MUST try for here. My friends both got the udon gratin, also creamy and comes with bits of chicken. We also got a mixed tempura appetizer to share. It was very small. Only came with few pieces of tempura. Not really worth it. This udon place is absolutely fantastic. I will defiantly come back for more!!"

12/20/2015,20151220,4,4.26,"Just little uncomfortable for sitting and waiting due to its popular. Otherwise, a must try if you are around area."
12/21/2015,20151221,5,4.26,"I work down the street from Monzo, and I couldn't be more ecstatic! I come here once a week for my udon fix. I swear, it's like crack, maybe even better! Uni cream udon is their bestseller, but I love love noodle soup, so I usually order their hot udon. I often find myself ordering their tempura udon or kitsune udon then I add fish cake and soft boiled egg tempura. And you've got one unforgettable bowl of goodness! At lunch time, you can even add a rice bowl topped with beef, shrimp tempura or salmon roe for $3 or $4. I dine alone most times because the wait can be long and because I get to sit at the bar and watch the noodles being made. Overall, it's a sensory experience and one that you wouldn't regret waiting in line for (if you're not dining alone)."
12/22/2015,20151222,3,4.26,"First of all, the uni udon is delicious. The udon noodles are very fresh. The soup is creamy. The portion is not big, but it's the right amount not to get cloyed. The service is slow. People seemed very busy working at the open kitchen cooking and making noodles. However, the 5-6 wait staff working outside of kitchen on a busy Sat relaxed too much. The speed to clean tables and to seat people down was just S.L.O.W. After 1-hour wait, we finally got seated. The table for 4 next to us was empty for about 10-15 minutes while tons of people were still waiting outside. I felt sorry for those people because the wait staff were so busy chatting and joking around. The rice bowl with ikura is very small. It's very overpriced."
12/22/2015,20151222,5,4.26,"cool experience how they make the noodles in front of you-long lines but delicious af. recommend this spot to all my friends passing thru little tokyo Have had the tempura udon, mentaiko squid one and the uni cream on seperate occassions. All of them were on point"
12/22/2015,20151222,5,4.26,The noodles always fresh and very tasty. I have tried several pasta and they are all perfect. I wish parking is a little bit more convenient
12/22/2015,20151222,4,4.26,"so good! the udon noodles are hand rolled and cut right in front of you!the bar is ""cozy"" and it does get pretty crowded, but i was in and out in a super efficient manner. The noodles are superb, the broth was good (although i feel like i've had some broth - Maru in WLA, for example - that had a little more depth) and overall a very pleasant dining experience."
12/23/2015,20151223,5,4.26,"What is as good as it gets? The udon noodles in cream of uni! I have never had uni (sea urchin) in a soup form and it is just wonderful!! I would highly recommend the sea urchin cream udon, which was exactly what I came here for. Add a fried, soft-boiled egg for $1.5 to make life even better! For appetizers, the clams and fried chicken skin were pretty good as well. However, my husband had the duck udon soup which was bland, and my father-in-law's beef udon soup didnt look too good either. In a few words, the uni cream udon would be your best bet! Try it Ya'll!!"
12/23/2015,20151223,5,4.26,"I'm addicted to udon! The udon noodles are freshly made and you can watch them cut them, it's amazing. I've tried the cold udon, the hot broth one, the beef and pork bowls. Overall, my favorites are the cold udon with sauce, the katsune udon, and the beef bowl. The noodles are amazingly chewy, and the broth is perfect. The beef bowl is delicious, the meat is tender and melts in your mouth goodness. Lines get long but it's well worth it."
12/29/2015,20151229,4,4.26,"I finally came back here when I was not dieting! Reading my previous review, I see that both times I have come here I ended up parking on 3rd. I guess that street does usually end up having more openings than the blocks closer to this restaurant... I must have come during an off hour because there was not much of a wait. Which was really good since my friend JC and I were quite hungry.We both ordered the same thing:-- SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON: Creamy Uni Cream Sauce Udon, topped with ikura (salmon egg)This is the udon I have been waiting to try ever since my last visit! Wow, there is a reason why this is so popular... it is really good! Because it is so creamy, I was worried that the entire dish would end up being too much and be slightly nauseating, but that was not the case. It was very delicious.-- SOFT-BOILED EGG TEMPURADoesn't this sound amazing? We had to try this. The egg was so perfectly cooked! But... it needed salt. In hindsight, I should have eaten the egg with the salty salmon roe that comes with the uni udon! I would say I will do that next time, but I don't really see the need to order this again. I'm glad I tried it once, but for $1.50 I think it should stay a one-time thing.I really loved the uni udon and would definitely be down to coming back here just for that. Upping my review for 4 stars! It could even be a 4.5 star review if half stars were possible, but for now we'll leave it at 4."
12/29/2015,20151229,5,4.26,"There is definitely a wait at this place, but the food is worth it! They close in between 2pm and 5pm, but I would suggest getting here between that time to wait in line. The restaurant itself is really small, but they are super fast at getting your order and seating you. I'm an absolute udon lover, and to see the amount of skill they use in preparing and making the udon made my little udon-loving heart super happy. There is something calming about watching one of the workers roll out sheets of dough. The Sea Urchin Cream udon was super flavorful, but after a couple of bites it got a little too rich for me. Luckily I also had the Vongole udon which had a super light stock and clams. It was a nice break in between the sea urchin udon."
1/1/2016,20160101,5,4.26,"We waited at least an hour to get seated, note that people were waiting before the restaurant even opened.We started with the beef tataki - it was ok, prob wouldnt order it again. For udon.. we had the curry, sea urchin, shrimp tempura and carbonara udon. The handmade udon noodles were amazing! From those four I tried, sea urchin udon was the best. I definitely want to come back & try rest of their menu.They do not validate parking here. I wouldnt say its good for big parties, we had a party of 6 girls and it was super crammed.Other than that, their udon is so amazing!"
1/2/2016,20160102,4,4.26,Uni udon was delicious! So glad my friend recommended me to try this place. Very small interior with tight seating and dim lighting. I like the flavor of the creamy broth and texture of the udon noodles. You can tell the quality of the hand made udon. The broth was also very good and not too creamy. Finished the broth as well. Will try the squid udon next visit!
1/3/2016,20160103,5,4.26,"The long line and hype is real!Came here on a Wednesday night around 7pm and waited about an hour. Don't be discouraged when you drive by, the crowds of people are a mixture of groups between Marugame and the Daikokuya ramen joint next door so the line was shorter than what it looked like. There's parking along the street, garages across the street for $10 flat rate or lots for $6. We opted for parking garage just so we wouldn't have to keep circling around. The restaurant itself was really small so it's really not meant for big groups. Make sure you stay nearby because if they call your name 3 times (quickly) and you don't respond, you'll be crossed off the list. We were lucky enough to get seated right in front of the window to watch the man roll and cut udon which was pretty cool!I ordered the Miso Carbonara with tempura soft boiled egg and my boyfriend got the Uni Udon. From the picture and looks of the udon, I thought the sauce was going to be too cheesy and rich but it really wasn't! The udon noodles were sooo soft and good! Sauce wise, the uni and miso tasted very similar. Portions were okay sized, as I wasn't super stuffed after finishing. Service was really good. They get you seated prompted, take your order and get food to you fairly quickly. Not really a place where you take your time to sit around, mingle and talk due to the massive wait outside. Will definitely be a must eat whenever I'm in LA!"
1/3/2016,20160103,3,4.26,Waited an hr and 1/2 and maybe it was the wait that killed it for me. Ordered the most popular meal on the menu which was the uni udon. I was expecting and thought i was getting the full flavor of Uni but instead it was alfredo sauce with a hint of seafood. I will give this place another try when it is less busy and maybe try a more traditional meal.
1/3/2016,20160103,4,4.26,"The food was good. Service good as well. I had the Uni (Sea Urchin) Cream Udon which I liked and my friends seemed to like it more than the udon they ordered. We went on a Sunday at 1:00pm and the wait for a table of 3 was about an hour. It's a small restaurant, but the food comes out quick and udon doesn't take long to eat, so tables do clear up rather quickly. Overall, though the food was good, I probably would not come back because I'm not really a udon connoisseur and I don't like waiting long for a table, unless it's spectacular. Special thanks to my friends who actually waited for the table, since I actually arrived 5 minutes before our name was called. Haha. **FYI, they only allow you to split the bill on two credit cards, so come prepared.**"
1/3/2016,20160103,5,4.26,"Came before they opened. Got in quickly once they did. Got sat right at counter, which is the way to go if you want to see how your food is made.Delicious food, good service."
1/3/2016,20160103,3,4.26,"OMG OMG OMG!! The food is super amazing, loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it! But! Please read this, the store has bad smell of us are close to the sink, we had changed the site but still (2stars minus ) :(. They need to be serious to fix the problem."
1/4/2016,20160104,4,4.26,I visited here yesterday. It was my first time to went there. I odered Udon gratin and negitiro bowl(?). Those things were very tasty especially negitoro bowl but udon gratin was very greasy food. I will definitely come back here and try to order different flavor udon!
1/4/2016,20160104,4,4.26,"Excellent udon in Little Tokyo! You can watch the chefs make the udon noodles in the back (which is why the noodles are soooooooooooo long). The uni is a must, as is the regular cold udon for fans of the plain udon. Expect a wait -- it's small, crowded, and the food takes a bit of time to come out."
1/4/2016,20160104,4,4.26,"Get a seat early! Wonderful, fresh udon -- house made in the open kitchen -- with wonderful, savory options. Liked the creamy uni very much though I'm usually not an uni fan. Solid traditional broths and meats for the no adventurous. Only disappointments are (1) the tempura egg side is flavorless and cold inside and (2) haven't seen the chef in the kitchen for awhile. He took such great care in presentation. :)"
1/4/2016,20160104,5,4.26,"Couldn't have been happier with this meal. Got the duck udon with tempura egg and loved it. We watched the noodles being made right in front of us, which you could absolutely taste. The rice sake we had was really creamy and sweet. Highly recommend ordering the second portion for $2. Waiter said his favorites were the shrimp udon and beef udon for the hot kind, which I'd love to come back and try. Would also like a taste of their curry."
1/5/2016,20160105,5,4.26,"Why do noodles always get me???? There's a man in a window that kneeds udon dough and then super slices it with an udon cutting contraption into instant deliciousness! The creamy uni udon is mmmYum! If you've never had uni before, this is probably the best way to try it. I personally think the texture of uni is weird (it's like licking a tongue) and the taste is definitely acquired.But! In the udon, the uni texture is hidden and the taste is elevated as a creamy savory sauce. The udon itself is a perfect, chewy texture and it will keep you slurping for more. The wait can be ridiculously long (45+ mins during rush hour), so don't come on completely E. Otherwise, you just won't make it with the yummo aroma drifting the streets (where you will wait because there is no standing room inside). I like to pair my uni udon with shrimp tempura (as a vessel to eat alllll the sauce) cuz you know, licking the bowl in public is highly frowned upon. :)"
1/6/2016,20160106,4,4.26,"I ordered the Uni pasta for lunch and while it was super delicious, I quickly noticed it was way too heavy for lunch. I would definitely come back to try of their other dishes which looked super yummy! Freshly made udon noodles are the best! LK"
1/6/2016,20160106,5,4.26,FresH noodles made right in front of your face! Just knowing someone is putting their heart and time into making delicious noodles makes me smile. I love noodles.. Yup I'm a noodle head. The udon is soft and just perfect. I got the udon with pork belly and egg! I was completely satisfied with the service and food here. I should be coming back more often but it just gets too crowded for me. I'll probably have to catch a day and time when it's not so busy. But busy means good right? I've heard the uni one is good too but not really a huge fan of uni so I don't know if I'll actually try it.
1/6/2016,20160106,4,4.26,"Came here for lunch on an unplanned visit to Little Tokyo during our LA trip on New Year's day. Great little spot with pretty good udon noodles, right next to an arguably more popular Daikokuya. While waiting in line, I could see people going to Daikokuya with their luggage...I guess it's just that popular but I digress.Anyway I opted for the Sea Urchin Udon since it's literally 80% of the photos on yelp for this place while the girlfriend got the Champon. Both on their ""Signature Items"" section. While my item was creamy, rich, and buttery with uni and it went well with the delicious udon noodles, I couldn't help but think this udon was pretty close to an Italian alfredo or something. First time having a dish like this though and I thought it tasted good.The champon however had a very flavorful seafood broth with tons of toppings and veggies in it. I would argue the Udon here would probably be better with more traditional broths instead of the creamy sauces. Overall I really liked the udon here and would probably try a more basic Udon in the future with some of their other side dishes like rice bowls or appetizers."
1/6/2016,20160106,5,4.26,Pork belly udon. Broth is light but flavorful and udon is fresh and thick. My go to lunch spot.
1/7/2016,20160107,3,4.26,"I came here with a group of 4 around 7-7:30pm. It is really really busy here, and it took us about a half hour wait or so. The udon here is freshly handmade. I ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. The udon had a good chewy texture. The uni was tasty and the dish had a good amount of creaminess to it. I was hoping there would be more uni flavor, but it was still pretty good. I was disappointed by the amount of noodles they give you. It's approximately $16 for a bowl of this. If you're a big eater, you might want to consider extra noodles. I didn't read the fine print on the menu regarding that. This normal portion size is a tad on the small size. I wasn't too full, but I knew I could eat a bit more. Overall, it's a great place to try some awesome fresh handmade udon noodles. If you want more bang for your buck, maybe consider elsewhere."
1/7/2016,20160107,5,4.26,"I want to live here.... That's literally my thoughts each time I come.I have had a few different items from here, below is my list of favorites.1. Uni udon- of course! Seriously the best uni pasta I've had ANYWHERE. So creamy & mixed with the uni makes the perfect combination. I have a friend from that Canada that every time she comes, this is a MUST for her2. Curry udon- definitely better than curry house (imo)3. Beef soup udon- this will surely cute any cold day.4. Giant shrimp tempura- this pairs amazing with ANY of the above udons.Although the above are my top favorites I would say ALL of the udons are amazing and worth trying. Also the staff is always super nice, which makes me want to keep coming back:) Although be warned there is normally a 45-1.5 hr wait during peak hours, and if your wondering yes! It's worth it!"
1/7/2016,20160107,5,4.26,"This place is a small, cute restaurant that is known for their handmade udon noodles. I definitely try to come at least once a month here, always changing up my order.I would recommend the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. The squid is not over cooked at all and the texture is just the right amount of chewiness without it being too rubbery. It sits in a buttery soup and comes with cod roe on top, making a wonderful mouthful of yumminess.I also enjoy the beef udon or the dipping udon with duck broth. Both are quite delicious with a good portion of meat.For appetizers I enjoy getting the beef tataki or the smelt tempura with curry salt. The tempura is not too heavy, but nice and crispy, and the beef tataki is a yummy one mouthful bite."
1/7/2016,20160107,3,4.26,"Is it just me? I don't know. I've been here a few times now and it's just always A-OK, bordering on meh.From the beef udon to the uni udon to the curry udon, I just feel like I'm getting ripped off. Too much noodle, and not enough actual content? I think that's what it is. The ratio leaves more to be desired. I find myself eating noodles by itself halfway through my meal.Another thing about the noodles. Yes, cool that it's handmade, but they're not bouncy/chewy enough!Also, the beef tataki-- should just be seared on the outside, leaving the inside rare, right?! No, not in this case. We ordered 2, and both dishes came out over-seared to a disappointing medium center.-_____-"
1/8/2016,20160108,1,4.26,"This review is for Oct 2014. There was about a 15 min wait and we were very surprised that the wait wasn't as bad as we had read it could be. Guess we had been lucky and came in at the right time. We were excited to try out the food! I wish that my fiance and I had actually had a chance to eat here. We were seated in the booth right next to the small sink they have on the side. At first it was alright, but as the waiters were walking by you'd catch a whiff of a very unpleasant almost sewer/standing water like smell. My fiance tried switching seats with me to see if it was the ventilation or something, but it was just as bad. It was bad enough where I wanted to puke. We asked the host to seat us somewhere else but they looked annoyed that we were asking for another table. I tried to hold off a little longer but I think if I had stayed I would have thrown up in front of everyone else that was eating. We just got up and left and went to the Ramen place 2 doors down, where there was no wait and the food was amazing! Sorry guess we won't be able to try this place unless we order take out, cause even looking at the picture of the restaurant makes my stomach queasy."
1/9/2016,20160109,4,4.26,"I have heard about restaurants freshly made udon noodles, so I have decided to try this place since google search had recommended it as well as over 1000 reviews on Yelp and still a 4 star.It is a popular place with long line even at 3'o clock in the afternoon. However, I was fortunate to be seated in 5 minutes within arrival. The waitress recommended the Shrimp Tempura Udon...and I wanted something else more but didn't see anything else I wanted to try on the Lunch Menu. Apparently there is more selection on the Dinner Menu. The udon noodles were very fresh and Q, the shrimp tempuras were huge and crispy - I love it!! I would recommend to anyone who have time, not too hungry, and want to try these freshly made udon noodles to be adventurous. It is worth it. The price was reasonable, and they take cards with no minimum!"
1/9/2016,20160109,3,4.26,"TLDR: I know you're checking out these pictures of creamy udon and biting your bottom lip, but trust me, this place isn't worth your time.Everyone Elks: This place relies solely on the gimmick of making the udon right in front of you and dumping a bunch of heavy cream on it. I'm serious. If I was Drake and you told me you were going here for lunch I'de be singing ""dont do it, please don't do it...""Parking: It's in Little Tokyo, two doors down from Daikokuya. If you don't know what that means, it means that parking is essentially non-existant. Get your BK Ratch Techs on, cause you're in for a walk.Le Ambience:As I look to the right, I see some chick talking about how she wants to live in here. It's nice, but certainly no place that you would ever want to live. Some people might even say that it's quaint. I'm not really sure what quaint means because I'm a dude and dudes don't use that word. There's like 15 tables and everyone is pretty damn close together. Wait times go pretty fast.Service:Servers are really nice and get you in and out quickly. No complaints.Food:I'm just going to start with I don't give a god damn if they're making udon in eye-sight. Is your palate really sophisticated enough to tell the difference between fresh and frozen udon? If it is, I'm going to need you to contact me so I can submit your talents to Ripley's Believe It or Not.Here's the order:Kake udon - Wife: ""You could have made me this at home."" Me:...*$6 dollars down the drain fml.*Uni Udon - Let me set the scene so you can feel how I felt. Imagine you're on the information super highway in the 1990's and a picture of a nude 10 starts loading. Face shows first, and you're blood starts rushing. Then perfect C's, actually, D's load. You've got a half-chub. Then the rest loads and she has a wang. You're half-chub deflates faster than a balloon being used to make fart-noises (unless you're a freak and are in to that sort of thing). This is exactly what happens when you order the Uni Udon. You see the pictures on yelp. You read the description in the menu. You could fill a keg. Then you eat it, and you're like ""wtf m8?"" You could seriously make this dish at home. Here's how: Cook your udon in water from Santa Monica beach, drain it, dump a bunch of heavy cream on it, a pinch of orange food coloring and about 10^-23 grams of uni. You're welcome.Tempura Shrimp - Nothing to write a yelp review over.Price: I'm torn. I want to be pissed about spending $15+ on uni udon, but I can't help but feel like $7.00 is a fine price for kake udon.Final thought:Unless you're really in to bandwagoning there's a good chance you're going to be disappointed with this place. With that being said, save your self 30 minutes (the time you'll have to wait to be seated) and the $14+ I know you're thinking about spending on a cream udon, and go to Mr. Pizza instead. I haven't been there, but I'm sure it's a lot more satisfying."
1/9/2016,20160109,5,4.26,"LOVE this place. Not as insane of a wait as other hot spots in the area. Absolutely delicious, fresh noodles! Very nice waitstaff. Had a great time. Will come back!"
1/10/2016,20160110,4,4.26,"This is the fanciest udon I have eaten. I prefer ramen over udon but I still like udon. My friend tried this place before and took here to try it. I did not know it was next to my all time favorite ramen place, Daikokuya. Since looking at the yelp reviews and pictures, I ordered the sea urchin udon. It was creamy and it was my first time eating uni. Not bad. As it's my first time here, I just ordered the regular because I am thinking one bowl is enough. I finished in 5 minutes. My only mistake is that I didn't order the double portion. I will be back to try their beef udon and probably the double portion."
1/10/2016,20160110,4,4.26,"The wait was horrible. Took them an hour to get to our name. The place was small and very crowded. Be warned: don't go with a group if you want to be seated fast. I wanted to order something that was not too creamy so I got the Mental Squid Butter and my gf got her Uni Udon. They were both delicious. I was very satisfied with my food as well as my gf with hers! Service was ok, however they tried not to make it obvious to rush us, but we noticed the server kept on checking our bowls. Then they took my bowl away as soon as I finished first while waiting for my gf to finish hers. Overall food deserved 4 starsWait time: 1 starService: 2.5"
1/10/2016,20160110,5,4.26,"First visit impressions: excellent excellent excellent. Started with some tempura- the mixed veggie and shrimp tempura was very competent but the real star was the shisamo- whole medium sized smelts tempura fried and served with an amazing curry salt to dip in.They are famous for the uni cream udon, and it was excellent- a bit like a sea flavored Alfredo sauce- but the surprise was the mentai (cod roe) squid butter udon. We fought over who got to have the most of this! Huge chunks of meltingly tender squid in the bowl. Pro tip- order some tempura and veggie add-ons to have with the bowl. The tempura soft boiled egg, maybe?Very cramped seating, very busy, very loud, very worth it."
1/11/2016,20160111,2,4.26,"After hearing lots of good things about this place, my friends and I decided to check it out. I ordered the uni udon with egg tempura (3/5) and was slightly disappointed. It was just udon in the cream sauce and tiny bits of uni. The uni bits were good but the sauce was too creamy for me. For $15, I wish the bowl contained more things. I wanted to add other things but the extra $2 for mushroom or pumpkin didn't justify it for me. Sorry Monzo, I won't be joining your fan club."
1/11/2016,20160111,5,4.26,"I don't even like Sea Urchin that much, but I still keep coming back for their Sea Urchin Cream Sauce Udon. It's so good! There is street parking as well as paid garage parking nearby; however, street parking is quite difficult to find, so just come expecting to pay.The line to get in is about 30-45min depending on the size of your party. It's not too bad. There's just not too much to do in the area if you are waiting. So just sit outside and chill with friends as you prepare for a mouthgasm.When we came in, the waitress took our drink order right away and came back with our water and hot tea quickly. After a few more minutes, they came by for our meal order. Very quick and polite!After just a few more minutes of salivating over the table as I awaited my meal, the large bowl of creamy goodness arrived. Unfortunately, it was gone as quickly as it came. The sauce is creamy with a hint of uni, with additional uni scatters throughout the bowl. The udon noodles are perfectly chewy and flavorful and just soak up the flavor of the broth. I also got the tempura egg and added it to my bowl. The egg is covered in tempura flakes and fried. I don't know how they do it, but it came out perfectly soft-boiled!If you want to keep your broth for a second meal at home, make sure you leave some udon in it or the helpful servers might just take the bowl away despite trying to save the broth. It's a little pricey, but apparently I don't mind it because I keep coming back and the price is the furthest thing from my thoughts. Come. Eat. Do it."
1/12/2016,20160112,3,4.26,"The wait was around 30-40 minutes? for lunch on a Sunday. Not sure if it was worth it. It was a solid bowl of udon, but not the greatest. I got the sea urchin cream sauce udon - was super excited about it. I think the concept is better than the actual execution. The sea urchin gets very grainy and super fishy when it's heated up, and I got kind of sick of the cream sauce especially because there wasn't anything to cut through the richness of it. My boyfriend got the shrimp tempura udon with the soft boiled egg tempura - much better than what I got. Overall, it's a very cute place with pretty cool things on the menu, just wasn't impressed by the sea urchin cream sauce udon. The noodles were nice and chewy though; might have to go back to try other things on the menu!"
1/13/2016,20160113,4,4.26,"I enjoy going to restaurants that is very authentic and known for homemade food! Their udon is made from scratch. On top of that, their creamy sauce with uni is something special that you have to try! This place has a low lit cozy environment. Great for catching up with friends or a cute date. Not really for families. It's so far my favorite udon restaurant. Parking on the street or in a $4-5 parking area."
1/14/2016,20160114,5,4.26,"So yummy that I came back twice in a row! Very well worth the wait. I never thought that there would ever be this many people who loved Udon as much as me!!If you end up waiting on the list, I highly suggest counting how ""far"" down the list you are, then taking a stroll across the street at the shops of Little Tokyo. Or you could ask the waiter how much wait time, then come back roughly 15 - 20 minutes before that. Mind you - if they come out and call your name 3 times and you're not there - crossed off the list you are! Imagines off with your head scenario.Anyways, onwards to the food. Hot tea was standard, but I'm not here to review their tea since the reason I went to check this out was because of the FRESH udon. There's a man that's rolling, pulling, kneading, and cutting fresh udon the entire time. I seriously don't know how that man does it. It must be muscle memory, hours of hardcore training, combined with who knows what... But I am in awed that this man is not drenched in a sweat. Does it taste just as good as it looks uncooked? You betcha. Noodles are soooooooooooo soooooooooo long. Did you know it was good luck to eat long noodles on New Years? Anyways, somewhere this is a tradition. You're just going to have to believe me or use the internet to find it. THESE noodles are seriously long, consistent, and delicious just like a great lover. A very satisfied and happy camper. I can definitely give my vote of confidence and suggest the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. How do they put so much scrumptious squid in here!!!! You can double your udon portion, but oh god. I don't even know where to put the noodles if I did. If only I could pack this stuff up and take it home. Too bad they don't do take out or delivery, but I completely understand why not. Noodles do not hold up well traveling. Can I just ask for the recipe. I'll even sign a contract promising not to tell a soul.Until next time Los Angeles!!! You will see me again for sure."
1/14/2016,20160114,5,4.26,"Absolutely love their Udon!You can see the people making the udon noodles fresh. It taste great. Service is on point. We've been there a total of 3 times at this point. I've had the beef udon. I love it. It is a little on the sweeter side. I've also had the Kake udon. That's real simple, but still really good. I love that you can order sides of tempura. My go to's are ""kakiage"" which is shrimp and scallops with shredded veggies dipped in tempura batter and deep friend. I also always order the tempura squid (not chew at all). Husbands fav is the tempura soft boiled egg. It's always perfect! If you haven't been here you MUST TRY IT!"
1/15/2016,20160115,4,4.26,"Are you seriously going to wait for that?It is really fun to try once, or twice if you're crazy enough but for what it is, if the line is too crazy, don't stand there for two hours. Get uni pasta and other delicious Japanese foods at Kinjiro or EMC Raw Bar.Nice chewy fresh noodles, broths and sauces. But not worth the wait. If you're not very familiar with Japanese foods and haven't tried a whole lot of different kinds of freshly made noodles, this could be really fascinating for you. If you are a Japanese person, someone from Hawaii, or a foodie that's been around the food world you're going to shake your head and walk away. Even the LA Times reviewer said it was good but not incredible."
1/15/2016,20160115,4,4.26,"It was worth of waiting an hour and 20minutes. The quality of noodle were cannot be compete with machine made noodles. If you are not a big fan of cream spaghetti or something cheesy, you can go with house udon. Urchin/Miso cream Udon has good flavor but the portion of food could be small. Two people with 3 order of udon may be good portion."
1/16/2016,20160116,4,4.26,"It's a chilly day in the frigid winter of Los Angeles (yes, I know, us Californians are weather wimps!), and nothing is better than a hearty bowl of soup on a cold winter day. That's where Marugame Monzo comes in. This place has been a staple of the Little Tokyo area for decades, and does not disappoint. The huge lines to get a bite to eat here rival its next door neighbor, the ramen shop extraordinaire called Daikokuya. Marugame Monzo is a shop specializing in udon dishes. Not only that, but they are unique in that each udon dish features hand-made udon, something nearly impossible to find in the USA. Add to this the unique ingredient options (lots of tempura additives you can order) and unique dishes here, and this place is a winner!I recommend trying the Carbonara Udon - which is in a shio-based dashi, mixed with, yes, Carbonara sauce - creamy and with salty parma ham. Amazing. I also recommend the Mentai Ika (which is made with squid and cod roe) or the ever popular Uni Broth Udon. I'm not a huge uni fan, and I've tried it, but I actually prefer the Mentai Ika and Carbonara over it. You must add a tempura egg. It's life-changing - crunchy panko on the outside and a bursting yolk inside - yum!Just keep in mind, that to get in here, you should be willing to endure a long wait time. Speaking Japanese can be helpful to ensure your place in line, but the waitstaff are really good at keeping track of the horde of hungry peeps outside.The price here is the other drawback - nearly $18 for the uni udon, for example. The portion sizes aren't too generous, so this seems a bit too steep for what you're getting. But, keep in mind again, there's no other place that makes this stuff or that does handmade udon, and it does taste really good.Here's my score:Ambience/Service: 4/5 - nothing special; servers are too busy to be attentive, but the people are nice. Lines super long.Food: 5/5Price: 3/5. Way too expensive for a meal in my opinion.Overall: 4/5. Tasty food, but better to go when it's not so crowded if you can!"
1/17/2016,20160117,5,4.26,"Decided to try Marugame Monzo on the recommendation of a friend, and I wasn't disappointed. After a near-45-minute wait, my group and I were seated at the bar, where we had the pleasure of (partially) watching udon noodles being made from scratch, among the other hustle and bustle in the kitchen.I ordered Monzo's curry udon, which, upon first impression, looked like a hefty serving fit to feed two people. It wasn't. I devoured it, single-handedly. Made with a curry-based broth, udon noodles, tender pork belly slices and onion, the curry udon is packed with flavor and delivers the right amount of heat. For $9.75, it was ""udon-tastic.""The restaurant is well maintained (compliments to the clean men's restroom), and no complaints as far as service is concerned. The space, while compact, well accommodates moderate-sized parties (2-4 persons). A larger group would prompt a longer wait time, but Monzo offers patrons the option to split their party into smaller groups.Word of advice: If you plan on splitting the check between three or more people, I recommend having cash available, as we were told they are only able to split the bill two ways."
1/17/2016,20160117,4,4.26,"This place was good but pretty pricey for what you get. I don't think the quality was amazing for udon. I got the sea urchin udon but I barely got uni pieces in my udon ""/ My udon mostly tasted like a simple cream pasta, and not really like uni udon. Definitely would be a good cream pasta, but not too sure about it being a uni udon lolI got the uni udon and the rice dish (I forgot the name) with the spicy tuna, mayo, and flavoring in the rice. This bowl was good! The waitress said it was the most popular bowl. I liked the combo of the noodles with the rice because the noodles got a bit too creamy and repetitive (in flavor). I'm kinda torn between 3 stars and 4 stars.. Wish there was a 3.5.. But ended up giving it a 4 because I still did enjoy my meal. Don't really see myself craving this place in the near future, but I'm willing to give it another chance. Ended up paying $24 including tip and tax at the end for one bowl of udon and half a rice bowl (I shared with my friend). Pretty pricey! But I guess others think it's worth it. Don't know if it's worth it myself~"
1/18/2016,20160118,4,4.26,"I'm a HUGE fan of uni, so when I discovered that this place has uni with house made udon, I knew I had to pay a visit! This was actually my second attempt to dine here. It's located in the heart of Little Tokyo, so parking is always difficult unless you're willing to pay the typical 10-20$ for structure parking. Arrived around 5:30 pm on a Saturday. We knew there would be a rush and the wait is usually unbearably long. But even arriving at the beginning of dinner rush, we waited roughly 30 minutes for a party of 2. Started off with an appetizer-- crispy chicken skin. perfectly fried with a special ponzu sauce. For our entrees, we ordered uni udon (a must) and pork belly udon with 2 sides of soft boiled egg tempura and a baby octopus. I have to say that the uni udon was absolutely delicious. It is a little on the heavier side, very creamy. I was a little disappointed to the small amount of uni in my bowl. Pork belly was extremely tender and soft. If I had to pick a favorite part of this meal, I think it would have to be the egg tempura. Never have I ever had egg tempura and it was perfectly cooked for the yolk to still be very moist. The restaurant is very cute on the inside. There is a bar section and behind it is where all the udon action happens. Service was great, very attentive and food was served quickly. I do plan to return if I arrive before their 5pm dinner rush."
1/18/2016,20160118,1,4.25,"If you're vegetarian DO NOT even bother stepping inside. I joined a few friends here for dinner, and usually restaurants will cater to me by replacing the meat with something else, or even offering steamed vegetables with rice, however this place did not do any of the above. After looking through the menu a couple times, I realized there was nothing I could order, so I asked them if they would be able to offer steamed rice + veggies. The server went to go ask, and told me they can't do that. Before the restaurant opens, they already place all of their sides/vegetables etc. in the tempura batter and fry as they go. I was really upset, because I wanted something so simple, and they could not even offer that. I ended with a bowl of edamame."
1/18/2016,20160118,4,4.25,"Definitely worth the wait, but come knowing you will likely wait 20-45 minutes for a table. If you are not familiar with what they offer, it's be to review the menu before hand so you know what you are getting into. It's fun to watch them making the udon noodles in the kitchen as you are ordering. The sea urchin cream udon is great."
1/19/2016,20160119,5,4.25,"I had been to Marugame Monzo twice already. I first heard of this was from my sister who been wanting to try when she was in LA. I was in LA in April and came here to try their udon. The wait was about 30 mins for dinner but I would say it's worth the wait. I had the uni udon and It was REALLY good. Although the uni in the udon was not a lot but it tasted really good! My boyfriend had the miso carbonara udon. I still think mine was better. I guess I was so satisfy with my uni udon that the table next to us that just sat down had to ask what I was eating, cause I looked very into my food. We came back again in july. I couldn't resist from not coming back. This time the wait was shorter cause July in LA is very hot and no one wanted to have hot udon. But i didn't care, I had to come back for their really good uni udon. We also tried their fried fish appetizer. I forgot what it was called but I really liked it. I think this will be my must go place every time I m in LA."
1/19/2016,20160119,1,4.25,"1/18....... tick tock tick tock.... i got to the restaurant at 4:45 pmthe restaurant was still close... and there was few people already waiting on the line to eat the udon....my friend and I, we decided to come to eat their lovely hand made udon.and this is all the tragedy happened.....5PM..... the server change the sign of ""close"" to ""open""we were so excited that we came early and got the first seating of the restaurant.. the server was kindly if we need water or hot tea. So i did ask for the hot tea.We ordered 5 dishes at Marugame Monzo restaurant.....First, we had the Beef tataki and scallop carpaccio.         the presentation of the beef tataki was nice, however, the beef itself was flavorless, moreover, the sauce was not dress enough, that i thought i was chewing rubber. the scallop carpaccio was blend, the sauce of the carpaccio was cover with cream and tobiko, however, it doesn't have any creamy flavor or fish smell, it is like cream mix with water. blend, and boring. Second, the Entree udon, i had tempura Ebi udon.         i had to say, the udon itself was good! no question! it was good! however, a good plate can't live with only one good element!!!! all element should be good and great. the most disappointed thing was the deep fried ebi, they fillet the ebi to let the portion size looks big, but the ebi tasted mushy and flavorless. and i still have stomachache til now. SOMETHING is wrong with the Ebi, because it tasted mushy like puree. Last but not the least, the Negitoro wrap....        personally, i love Negitoro, but not this one. we all know that Negitoro is fatty tuna chopped fine and mix with thin slice scallion. the fatty flavor and the aromatic flavor of scallion are the key thing that make Negitoro so pleasant. But their Negitoro was blend and MUSHY again. that tasted like a baby food..... huge disappointed!! and the sauce was too salty that did not go well with the fish.Overall i spend 57 dollars...but would i come back? probably not......."
1/20/2016,20160120,5,4.25,Yummy udon! If you like udon you have to come here. Long and wait every time so I snack before coming here. I loved their uni udon. The sauce is creamy and thick unlike EMC where it's like watery and tastes too much like milk. There is not a lot of uni but I am okay with that. I tried the carbonaera and the soupy braised pork and thought they were really good too. The udon noises are amazing and the portions are just right Definitely always have a craving for this place! I'm actually glad for the long lines and no take out rule or I would gain so much weight!
1/20/2016,20160120,4,4.25,"I crave. If I want udon, this is the place. Waiting sucks but it's worth it for me. Oh, and I got my baby cousin to like sushi by tricking her to eating the tuna tar tar. Her parents are upset as now their sushi bill will be more expensive."
1/20/2016,20160120,5,4.25,"I've never had udon this incredible before. I used to be a ramen head and never really gave udon a chance because it seemed so basic and boring... that was until I discovered Marugame Monzo. Now beating myself up because I wasted all of this time on ramen; I've learned what greatness a bowl can contain. This review is strictly for the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, as I'm thinking very fondly of it in my belly, and it's all I may ever try at Marugame because it's that good. The lunch time wait on a weekday was only 5 minutes and I was a little sad that I was at a table where my view of the noodle making was completely blocked from sight. Udon noodles are made to order in plain view, rolled out and cut from fresh dough. This is legit. I feel torn because I feel that the broth and the noodles were equally exquisite, each complimenting the other perfectly. You simply cannot fake fresh noodles, as their quality shines through in their pillowy chewiness and taste. The broth was something to behold- a symphony of perfectly paired sweet and salty, an umami holiness with the richness of butter to hold it up. Pieces of squid, so tender that you'd think you were eating fish, were covered in perfectly salty cod roe. I ate until my stomach hurt from fullness. I did try the udon with the tempura soft boiled egg I'd read about, and have to say while the egg was good, I don't know if it's something I'd go back for. In comparison to the broth, the egg seemed a little bland but the yolk was perfectly runny. I'm full as I write this but already cannot wait to go back for more."
1/20/2016,20160120,4,4.25,"First time here. I wanted to see what the hype was about. Stood and waited for about 30-40 minutes in line since the place is always busy. We ordered the assorted tempura, tempura & sea urchin udon. Both of the broth was good and the udon was soft. However, it was good but it wasn't the best udon I've had. The sea urchin flavor wasn't too powerful and it had chunks of uni pieces. The tempura was also still hot and crispy. It had the right amount of batter. I will definitely come back because the food and the service was great but I don't think the line that long is worth the wait."
1/22/2016,20160122,3,4.25,"Came in expecting the best uni udon ever only to be disappointed.. And only moderately full. Ordered mentai cream udon (not the squid butter) and it was so much better than the uni udon. Shrimps and scallops made it amazing and the udon/broth was on point. I would recommend getting this for sure!Uni sea urchin udon for $15.95 is pretty expensive for such a small amount. It has a slight uni taste with little itty bitty uni chunks. I just felt like the broth was alright and sort of bland. Udon was great though !Sides to get :- tempura soft-boiled egg $1.50- kakiage $2.50Our waiter told us everytime he eats udon, he'll always order tempura soft-boiled egg and kakiage. Both were good and the kakiage adds a nice crunchy texture to the meal. Overall, this place is super hyped. Good to go once to say that you've tried, but not a place I'd come back to on a regular basis. Always expect a 30-45 minute wait!"
1/22/2016,20160122,5,4.25,"I have been to Marugame Monzo time and time again and the quality of each plate I have tried has been consistent. As you can see in the photos the noodles are made in house right before your eyes. Unfortunately you may not make reservations but no need, the wait may seem long but diners come in and out just as quickly as the plates are sent out. GET THE CARBONARA. You wont regret it. Also wear something you don't love because you are bound to splash onto your garments. Portions are large but you won't want to share!"
1/24/2016,20160124,1,4.25,"Just returned after a year & the sea urchin udon is still at $16 except there's ""disintegrated urchin"" dissolved somewhere... & based on my previous experience, it's just somewhere OUTSIDE my huge bowl of creamy tastelessness. Upon alerting the waiter, he stood stone face looking at my bowl and insisted the 2, yes TWO CRUMBS, of urchin was indicative that the urchin ""melted,"" except not my first time here LOL. So they've lost another recurring customer yet unknowing spill over by-standers (who can't be seated at ramen shop next door) may now be warned. So sad"
1/24/2016,20160124,1,4.25,"We came later like 2 mins,than the waiter just ignored us, and let us wait like 30 min.So disappointed."
1/25/2016,20160125,5,4.25,"Uni udon is amazing! I've rarely had to wait, especially compared to the line next door."
1/26/2016,20160126,5,4.25,"best udon in LA. great rice bowls.portions are large, i always overestimate how much food i can eat, but so worth it.gets packed, so be prepared to wait."
1/27/2016,20160127,5,4.25,"my cousins and i came here around 8pm, and we were seated right away, but we're right by the door so we didnt get a chance to see how the chefs make their noodles. :( i finally got to try the sea urchin cream udon that everybody's raving about, and they're right, ITS SO GOOOOOD! i felt like i was in heaven in a few seconds! my mouth was watering the whole time as i kept on slurping them. the taste also reminds me of alfredo, i was a bit disappointed that there were small pieces of sea urchin, that was the best part! but when its almost gone, i was starting to get full, bec. its so creamy and rich! i felt like a can of calpico is not enough, they should offer some free drink refills at least. i also ordered their beef bowl rice, it was ok, its not bad either, its bec. their beef are so skinny and its not enough for their rice bowl!! i prefer yoshinoya, but i'd give it a 3 out of 5, cuz im not used to the taste, but probably if i eat this more often, i'd probably rate it more too, but i was hungry when we came here so i finished it all up. then after that, we ordered a few appetizers such as Negitoro, they say thats one of the popular ones, the tuna tasted like potato but if you put that on the seaweed, with cucumber and sprouts (minus the wasabi) you dip it in the sauce, it was so good! then we ordered another chicken skins, its kinda like chicharon, that one was also good specially when you eat it from the bottom where it has vinegar sauce inside of it. then their fried chicken, tasted a little bit like something's missing.. i think if they added some soy sauce, it would've tasted good, but thats just me.. the service is also good too, the waiter/tress are very friendly. overall, im glad we choose to go here over Daikokuya, its also cuz we dont carry cash atm, but my experience here was the bomb! i dont mind going back here again."
1/28/2016,20160128,5,4.25,"I love love Udon and was so happy when a friend of mine recommended this place to me a while back. Marugame Monzo was the first udon house I've ever been to and I'm so happy to have tried it. It's located right next to Daikokuya, so don't be intimidated by the large crowd waiting outside (they're often times waiting for ramen next door). The longest I've ever had to wait at Marugame Monzo was probably 30 mins, which is not bad considering how small the restaurant is. I've tried many of the signature udons, my favorites are the [1] Mentai Cream Udon, [2] Sea Urchin Cream Udon, and the [3] Mentai Squid Butter Udon. I like to add the Tempura Soft Boiled Egg (which is so perfectly soft boiled) and the Kakiage (deep fried sweet potato, baby shrimp, and baby scallops. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach and I end up taking some of the udon home. I Some tips: parking on the northwest corner of 1st and San Pedro is pretty cheap. I wouldn't come to Marugame Monzo with any more than 4 people, and definitely try the sea urchin udon! Things get really creamy here... so if you're not into creamy sauces, stay away from any of the dishes with cream! I highly recommend this place, definitely on my list of must eats if you're ever in DTLA."
1/28/2016,20160128,2,4.25,"Out of curiosity, I went here yesterday with my sister for dinner. Upon entering the restaurant, it had this damp / wet smell. Similar to the scent of a wet mop. We were offered to sit on the counter table (near the workers). I regret choosing this seat because the damp smell got stronger. I think this was a major turn off because while the food was good, the wet smell interfered with my tasting of the udon. It also gave me a pretty bad impression of the place (given this is my first time).The price of the noodles were expensive - I guess I couldn't expect less since it's a restaurant - and the serving was little. However, food was good. I don't think it was worth it though. The soda drinks were $2 and it's basically a standard can of soda (no free refills?). They give you the can along with a glass cup with a straw that is unwrapped (ew). I don't think I'd come back. I'll just stick to Tsurumaru Udon."
1/28/2016,20160128,3,4.25,"Ugh I hate that I wasn't impressed. I was really looking forward to trying it.There was no wait. Thank goodness. But where we were seated had a strange mildewy smell. It threw me off a bit, not a good way to start.Scallop carpaccio (2 stars) -- I didn't feel the scallops were fresh. They were fishy and the texture didn't quite sit right with me. The tomato slices and the mayo-y sauce on top all didn't go well together. I only hand one piece and I couldn't eat any more. Pork belly rice bowl (4 stars) -- the best dish of the night. Super flavorful meat, well seasoned rice, perfect side dish portion. I could've just had a large bowl of that as my entree. Uni udon (3.5 stars) -- rich, creamy. It tasted more like alfredo sauceMentaiko squid udon (3 stars) -- I really didn't feel the udon noodles were that great. Maybe mine were slightly overcooked. The broth was a bit too buttery for me. The flavor got monotonous after a few scoops.  Overall, disappointing to say the least. Not sure what the hype is all about."
1/30/2016,20160130,4,4.25,"I went here with the intent to order the special sea urchin udon ($16) and only the special sea urchin udon. Well, my plan never goes as planned. We ended up ordering tempura too. It was too tempting! The tempura is sold by the piece and ranges from $.50 - $2.50. We ordered two pieces of pumpkin and a soft boiled egg to share. It wasn't until the yolk was dripping into our bowl of udon that we thought of the idea to put the soft boiled egg in our bowl. Anyway, the tempura was spectacular. The batter was crisp and fresh and honestly, I'm sure the tempura dipping sauce is from a bottle, but it tasted like a sauce that I haven't had before. Now, for the holy grail of udon. No surprise, as every other review mentions this, but the noodles are fresh and you can definitely taste it. My friend and I split a bowl and we're so glad we did. I do think the salmon roe eggs on top of the udon was a nice touch. However, I do think the sauce was too rich to the point where I'm glad I only ate half a bowl. It would've been nice to have something refreshing to cut the richness for a balanced dish. I really don't think I could've finished a bowl. All in all, I'm a fan of it and would order it in the future, but I would definitely split and order some sides."
1/30/2016,20160130,4,4.25,"Came here for lunch at 2PM. Seems like that's the sweet time to come cause we only waited 10-15 minutes. The restaurant is tiny so expect to stand outside until your table is ready. We ordered the uni udon and the chicken tempura udon. For an additional $3, you can also order any rice bowls (also known as ""dons"") of your choice. We got the negitoro don add on. The bowl is meant for a single serving so don't order it expecting to share!Out of the three items I tried...I liked the negitoro don. It was drenched with a mayo sauce on top, but definitely a good reason to make today a cheat day. The bowl almost reminds me of the spicy tuna don at Fukada in Irvine for those who have tried that place. Though the uni udon is the most expensive ($15.95), it was absolutely scrumptious. It is super creamy so be careful for those who are lactose intolerant! It also comes with a fair amount of uni. I recommend getting this dish at least once. The chicken tempera don was whatever. It wasn't bad, but there isn't much to rave about it. The bowl comes with two pieces of tempera chick breasts. The udon itself only comes with the noodles, green onions, and tempera flakes.I have to commend them on having super fresh noodles. That is really what differentiates this place and the udon spots Mitsuwa food court! The noodles were soft and absorbed the flavors of the sauce/soup really well.I can't give this place the full 5 stars because I felt like the meal was incomplete (especially for the price I paid). I wish there was a little more meat and some veggies in the bowl. Don't expect to get much besides the udon & soup when you come here. Overall, I would come back if I was in the LA area, but I would never make the full drive up from OC just to eat this."
1/30/2016,20160130,4,4.25,"This place has the best udon!! The Uni, duck etc. can't go wrong!! We always seem to come here. It's our to go to spot with our friends. You'll have to wait in line for a bit cause the place is so small. It probably only sets about 20 people total. We've had a group of 8-9 before and we took up half the restaurant. Anything less than 4 is fine if you don't want to wait long. If you work in the area and want a good lunch spot then come here! Come every lunch if you want!! I wished I lived closer so I could go all the time."
1/31/2016,20160131,5,4.25,"This place is one of my favorite udon places in little tokyo. I love their uni cream pasta udon and their vongle udon. Vongole udon is only available during the dinner time. My boyfriend doesnt like the taste of uni so he always gets beef udon with beef bowl.Also, their tempura is to die for so try their tempura if you like tempura like me.Sad part about this place is that they dont have private parking spaces so its really hard to find parking :("
1/31/2016,20160131,4,4.25,"4.5/5. Almost perfect.First of all, I LOVE UDON and when I came here for the first time after hearing about the freshly handmade udon, I was SO excited. The udon is thick, al dente, chewy, and just... delicious.Since then, Ive tried many dishes and here is the lowdown:Sea urchin cream udon: I love UNI, and the combination was amazing. The uni cream is very rich, and has a subtle uni flavor throughout. I can only describe this dish as decadence. My go to if Im not not starving because I find the portion a little small.Seafood cream udon: this is basically tomato cream sauce with tiny scallops and shrimps. They skimp a bit on the seafood, but the sauce is delicious.Out of all the soup udons, I have tried the curry, pork belly, and beef. The curry udon base is really thick, but tasty (no spiciness at all). The other ones are great as well. Please note that you can only order double portion for these regular udon. All the specialty ones (with the cream sauce) you cannot order double portion.I find their portion size a bit on the small end so I dont get really full from regular unless I drink all the soup/cream. So if you go with a friend, have one person order double portion and share it!As for the non-udon foods, they are hit or miss. I didnt enjoy the beef tataki because there are whole peppercorns which taste pretty strong if you end up biting down on it. On the other hand, the Kakiage tempura is amazing. It is basically tempura of shredded vegetables put into a giant ball. It goes well with all their udon dishes!If you dont get here at the opening rush, expect to wait an hour. The interior is pretty small and cramped. Large bottomed people may find it difficult to squeeze between the tables. If you are a small party, you may be seated at the bar which is AWESOME because you can see them make fresh udon.Marugame Monzo is located right next to Daikokuya. Often, I put my name down on both lists to see which one opens up first. But I rather eat the udon."
2/1/2016,20160201,5,4.25,"Freshly handmade udon, yes please! I'm happy that I found this gem before my trip here was over! I'll definitely be back on my next trip down here too!! We had the curry udon and the kitsune udon with a soft boiled egg. I saw others around that ordered the tempura, duck, and uni udon that looked yummy too. Our udon was spot on, perfectly cooked, broth was flavorful and tasty, and the large wooden spoon was fun and helpful for the noodles. The soft boiled egg was a nice addition and well executed too! Everyone who worked there that helped us were attentive and nice. I also liked that they greeted all of the customers :) Also, we sat at the seating in front of the kitchen and was able to see them make the udon noodles, pretty neat. Tip #1: There are parking lots near by but we circled the block and found street parking, woot. You may get lucky too, give it a tryTip #2: Japanese Village Plaza is right across the street and you can find desserts after your meal. There is also a Nijiya market if you want to stock up on some Japanese food goodies."
2/1/2016,20160201,4,4.25,"This restaurant gets really pack on weekend nights! You can either park at the meters in front or across the street in a parking garage ($4 after 4 I think.) If it isn't crowded, make sure to sign in and stand near the door where the waiters see you or else they won't notice you signed in. There's a bar seating area as well. This restaurant only lets you dine in and togo your leftovers. I tried their chicken tempura udon, miso carbonara, and udon gratin. I didn't really enjoy the chicken tempura udon, but my favorite would be the miso carbonara. It tastes like chicken alfredo! The udon gratin is huge and good for sharing. The fried chicken tastes just like popcorn chicken nothing special."
2/1/2016,20160201,4,4.25,Unique udon in the restaurant. Especially the miso and seafood ones. The cream is delicious. And the udon is fine.
2/2/2016,20160202,4,4.25,It's my favorite udon place! Beef Udon is the best. The veggi fried ball doesn't taste as goog as it looks tho
2/2/2016,20160202,3,4.25,"Very good food but the service is questionable. If you don't order a huge amount of food, the waitress gets annoyed and it's very obvious."
2/3/2016,20160203,4,4.25,"Coming from a person who is not really a fan of ramen, udon, pho or soupy meals, this place is great!! I've never had this type of udon before.My friend and I came a couple minutes after it opened and there was a wait. A party of 2 and roughly we waited around 30-45 minutes to get seated.The restaurant is tiny and I feel like it is a bit cramped in there. I ordered the miso carbonara, and boy was the sauce super creamy and buttery! I don't usually finish my food at restaurants but I finished this one because it was so yummy. I also ordered the tempura soft boiled egg to accompany my meal. It literally is what it is, but it was a good add on that I recommend.What's so cool about this place is if you sit at the bar you can see the chefs making the noodles, fresh! The noodles were so soft and delicious.I kind of wish there was another type of meat in the miso carbonara, just because I felt like the bacon on the top didn't match the portions of the noodles. The location is just across the street from the cute little plaza in Japantown! Service was great, and I would definitely come here again :)"
2/3/2016,20160203,4,4.25,"There's not that many udon restaurants that I know of, so it's nice to hear there's one right in j-jtown. This is my second time coming here ordering the beef udon with fried egg. Udon is actually not the hardest to make at home, but it's always nice to eat here especially with their fried egg on a cold day. The egg costs extra but totally worth it. The taste of the broth reminds me of my grandma's udon. Service is good here as well. Plus, they give you complimentary hot green tea if you ask. I always say that real Japanese restaurants always include the complimentary hot green tea."
2/3/2016,20160203,5,4.25,Must try these signature udons:Miso Carbonara - Can't explain..just try itUni Udon - Rich and creamyCold Udon with Soft Boiled Egg or Bukkake Udon (double portion available for $2 extra)Not a big fan of Udon but Monzo is good. Fresh & handmade on the spot.Cons:Parking & long lines but worth the hype
2/6/2016,20160206,5,4.25,Very good udon. Flavorful tempura. I had the basic chicken tempura udon. The broth is savory. And the noodles are fresh. I can't wait for my next time here.
2/7/2016,20160207,4,4.25,The wait is a little long so plan on being there for a while. There is a good selection of traditional and non traditional udon noodles. They also serve really yummy pork rice bowls and have a no nonsense demeanor when serving since they are really busy. Would go back again.
2/8/2016,20160208,5,4.25,"After eating at Marugame a couple times, it grew on me. Whether it's cold or hot udon, you will always have a happy belly. As far as the udons go, I have tried so far the squid butter udon, the bukkake cold udon, and the hot duck udon. All of these are all great and different in their own way. They also have some tempura that you can add on the side, which is awesome. I have tried their shrimp tempura and the portion is huge! Its super crunch and flaky. They also have some great dons that I would suggest if you are getting a cold noodle or hot udon with no protein. The negitoro don is very fresh and packed with so much flavor. I like to mix everything in the bowl together so that you get all of the sauce and toro mixed together in the rice. Usually if you go no the weekdays, it is not that packed. However, come saturday for lunch good luck trying to get a table. You'll be waiting at least 30-45 min for seat."
2/8/2016,20160208,4,4.25,Expect the wait to be long. The udon is handmade and is delicious. I got the Miso Carbonara Udon and was not disappointed.
2/9/2016,20160209,5,4.25,"BEST udon I've ever had in my life. Even my friend who doesn't eat udon tried some and said it was good! She ordered a chicken katsu or something for herself, and said that was good as well. My other friend and I ordered the pork belly to start, and that was super flavorful and creamy. I had the squid butter udon. Seriously. SO GOOD. I would go back now and eat it if I could. The line does seem to extend and the wait can get pretty long I think, so I would recommend going a bit earlier to get a seat. The open kitchen provides a great view of the chefs pulling udon! Very cool."
2/10/2016,20160210,4,4.25,"Obsessed with this place! The udon noodles are so soft and the broth is light. The tempura pieces are HUGE!Also, I like that I don't need to hydrate like I'm about to run a marathon before I eat here, like I do with Daikokuya because of the salt content. Overall, great lunch spot, but it gets packed!Only thing is that usually towards the end of the meal, the servers get busy (I try and get there right when it opens so it's usually just getting busy when I'm almost done) and it's hard to even get some water.I do want to come for dinner, though, I still need to get my hands on some of that Uni Udon, but that would put me in a food coma and require a mid-day nap. Not a work lunch option!"
2/12/2016,20160212,4,4.25,"Delicious udon, handmade in front of you.I would avoid the richer, crazier ones and stick to the basics myself the next time- stick to the ""hot udon"" side of the menu instead of the ""signature udons""-- as you get to better appreciate just how good the noodles are as such.Tempura is very good too.Crowded but turnover is pretty good, although there will still be a bit of a wait if you're more than 1 person at peak hours."
2/13/2016,20160213,4,4.25,"Big noodles call for BIIIG bowls.No, udon like this is not for the chopsticks-faint-of-heart. Thick noodles, maybe a third of an inch square in thickness. A little slippery but with the aid of a large helper spoon and slim chopsticks, even I managed successfully. If my grey marbles aren't failing too much, I believe ""Fat Spoon"" was chea for a hot second, prior to Monzo. Guess what? Whole lot o' fat spoons still haunt da place. Doz spoons bee berry useful in eeting deez noodohh.Restaurant has a warm and inviting interior. We dined right at the counter, watching the noodle-maker handle the large white dough, rolling out, folding, chopping precisely, shaking out, separating the udon strands. The back-drop makes for a fun meal. Plus one star for the entertaining noodle show.Beef Udon reminds me of shabu-shabu broth and includes a generous portion of thin beef slices sprinkled with fine chopped scallions. My friend was in the mood for Champon, a creamy colour, mild seafood-flavour soup base. I had a taste and really liked it. Both soups have nice balance of umami and do not seem overly salty.Didn't think I could do an entire bowl, but turns out to be the right amount, as I finished most of the contents. All the toppings, including egg, are tempura battered and fried. Eggplant was about a three-inch thin slice, slivered and deep-fried. There could be better value when it comes to most of the extras, which are small yet cost a couple bucks per. For a 12- to 15-dollar udon bowl, don't you think more such items should simply be included?Still, the egg was perfectly soft-cooked. Yolk is intensely yellow and creamy. I think I grossed out my pal, dunking the egg until its coating came off. Then setting aside the soggy tempura part, I ate just the egg. My diet already consists of too much deep-fried junk.Going on a weekend afternoon was not bad. Place name on the wait list, and it wasn't but ten or so minutes when we were called and seated. Awning is still black like previous occupant, but this menu is much more focused. I think they'll be around awhile.More-ugame Monzo, kudasai."
2/14/2016,20160214,5,4.25,Started with the pork belly rice bowl as an add on to my Mentai squid butter udon. Both were great. The pork bowl was tender and salty. The udon hit the spot. The squid is cooked perfectly. It has almost a scallop texture to it.
2/14/2016,20160214,3,4.25,"It's not that the noodles aren't good; it's just that what you get doesn't match the price.I ordered the famous sea urchin noodles. This was delicious. The noodles had the perfect texture and the flavors were incredible. It almost made up for the fact that the portion was comically small. I now know that I could have asked for double portion for a fee. The server never mentioned that, even though we told him it was our first time. The menu didn't mention it either. I just never would have thought of it because I have a pretty small appetite. But even for me, it was too little food. Another problem is that the dish was so rich and creamy that it actually reminded me much more of an Italian pasta than a Japanese noodle dish. I am all for cultural fusion, but if I just wanted a bowl of Italian pasta, I could get it for a lot cheaper at Italian joints. Finally, I could barely see any sea urchin in my dish, so all I could taste was the cream sauce. Overall, I really enjoyed the dish, but I wouldn't get it again because I don't think it's worth the asking price, especially given the portion size.I also had a few bites of the beef udon noodle, and THAT dish was absolute perfection. I would recommend that dish instead, but with double portion.Service was friendly but inattentive.I would recommend this place, just not its sea urchin dish."
2/15/2016,20160215,5,4.25,"Every time I am in Little Tokyo I see the throngs of people waiting outside Marugame Monzo, so we decided to give them a try. We put our name on the list 40 minutes before we wanted to eat. When our name came up we got a seat right in front of the guy making the udon noodles. He is super fast an whips up a try every ten minutes. The food comes out right after you order it. Negotoro Handroll it cones out with with Daikon Sprouts, Jullianed cucumbers, nori and the Negotoro separately and you make your own Handroll.Mentai Squid butter Udon while all the dishes were excellent this was my favorite Vongole clam Udon the sauce was salty and savoryUni Cream Udon the cream sauce could have used a little more UniScallop carpaccio was delicate with thinly sliced scallops Mixed Tempura comes the two large shrimp asked for some Daikon puree but that is an extra charge Shishamo Tempura was so good with lightly battered smelt and its roe.The reason why the lines are so long is that the food is excellent and consistent.Service was good. Parking is a crazy hard so just pay at the parking lots a the area. The waiting outside is a downer since the side walk is small and there are do many people waiting, so take a walk but get back before your name gets called or you will need to start all over."
2/15/2016,20160215,5,4.25,"BOMB UDONI came here on a Saturday afternoon around 4PM, and we got here just before the madness. Right when we were seated, there were so many people waiting outside lolAnyways, I ordered the Miso Carbonara udon ($12/13 don't remember specifically), and it tasted just like carbonara pasta with a tint of miso. The noodles are actually hand-pulled, so the texture was perfect. Not too hard nor not too soft. Just that perfect balance between the two. I just wished that the miso taste was stronger, but overall it was delicious!!I'm definitely coming back to try the Sea Urchin udon that everyone is raging about! ^^"
2/15/2016,20160215,5,4.25,"Found my favorite udon spot! 4.5/5 but rounding up to a 5.We went on a Saturday night around 6pm, and we waited around 15 minutes before being seated for a party of 2, which was faster than expected. The noodles are freshly made, in-house, and you can see them making it when you sit by the bar. I had the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, and my boyfriend ordered the Duck Nanban Udon, with tempura egg and tempura shiitake add-ons. -Mentai Squid Butter was in a rich, thick, buttery sauce; more of an Asian fusion dish than your traditional udon... but it was delicious! The portion size was a bit small, but enough to feel satisfied. -Duck Nanban Udon was more of your traditional udon. The broth was great, nothing out of the ordinary. The duck, however, was cooked perfectly, and they gave a generous amount (5 pieces!).    The tempura egg and shiitake were also good, but nothing spectacular.The service was great and the food was phenomenal. Though the price is a bit expensive for udon, the taste and the quality make up for it. I would definitely come back to try some of their other signature udon."
2/15/2016,20160215,3,4.25,"In the area and was looking to have ramen next door, but didn't want to wait. This restaurant looked promising with lots of people inside and a long, but shorter line than the restaurant next door. Ordered the mentai squid udon and added an egg. For the price, I expected a slightly bigger portion although it was just the right amount for me. For someone with a bigger appetite, you might need extra noodles. I loved the broth, so would recommend it. The uni cream udon was not what we expected. There were no pieces of uni in the broth at all and just slightly uni flavored broth. There are much better places for uni soba/udon in NYC.I was quite surprised at the lack of service. I'm not sure whether they were just under-staffed that day, but while we were waiting for a table inside, we saw at least a few tables at a time needing to be cleaning and set up for the next customer. It seemed to take much longer than necessary to do this. During our meal, our water needed to be refilled and not once did someone come around to ask if we needed anything or to fill our water glasses."
2/16/2016,20160216,4,4.25,"After a failed attempt to dine at Daikokuya due to a 2 hour wait, my party and I quickly decided on the next best thing: walk next door to dine at Marugame Monzo (20 minute wait)!Known for their handmade udon noodles, Marugame Monzo sure lives up to their reputation. These long, chewy noodles are undeniably delicious and complement the various soups offered at this restaurant.I ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon and it did not disappoint. The luciously creamy base was like heaven in my mouth! It wasn't too sweet nor was it too briny---it was perfection! Chewy udon swimming in velvety sauce...this surely was one of their best dishes. It was, however, a bit heavy so I got full really fast.The Mentai Squid Butter Udon was another enjoyable soup, which was lighter in texture but bolder in flavor.The Champon Udon was really good. I wish I ordered this. It was light in flavor with a broth-like texture and was abundantly filled with veggies and seafood.I wasn't a fan of the Kakiage Bowl but the rest of my party enjoyed it. This is similar to Filipino ""ukoy"", which I've never been a fan of to begin with. If you like tempura-fried veggies and seafood, you'll probably enjoy this.Overall, the handmade udon make the dishes excellent. Wait time wasn't too bad when we came in. The restaurant is small so you're sitting close to other parties. My only pet peeve is the hallway to the restroom was a bit on the dirty side with piled-high dishes (gross) on the cart. I'm sure this is something management can change. On a positive note, our server was knowledgeable and friendly."
2/17/2016,20160217,4,4.25,"UNI UDON IS AMAZING HERE! This place definitely beats the one in Japantown in SF.Got here around 7PM and got seated right away at the bar. It was super nice, we sat in front of where the udon was being cut and made. We ordered:Uni Udon: Loved it, super creamy and had a good amount of uni. Definitely worth the price and it was nice and hot.Squid Butter Udon: Pretty good, had a good amount of squid, this in-between creamy + soupy.Beef Tataki: The toppings and seasoning was good, but the beef was too rough.Tempura Soft Boil Egg: Interesting, not much flavor, I would order this if you were eating it with soup udon for sure!Overall, great experience and would come here when I visit LA again!"
2/19/2016,20160219,5,4.25,"I'm a fan!!! One of THE places to try in LA, and apparently everybody knows because this place is POPPINNNN. Be prepared to wait, or come super early! (Preferably do both)Very small place that doesn't try hard to impress you but still does. First off, ambiance and service. Very dark, cozy atmosphere that honestly makes it a bit hard to move around. Lighting highlights the food and not much else, and be prepared to shuffle across and bump into people should you want to use the restroom or something. Hosts and waiters were really friendly, cracking jokes when appropriate, but not in a try-hard kinda way. Food is great! Caters to a large audience, in my opinion. For the adventurous or those who want something rich, the seafood udon was pretty good. It had a lot of masago, some calamari, and fish fillet. I forgot the name exactly, sorry! But anyways, they got the seafood flavor spot on, it was rich without being too salty, and the udon was chewy without being tough. For those who like a more traditional, simple bowl, the shrimp tempura udon was very light without being bland! Tastes good, but honestly, I would skip this next time, just because I'd wanna try something new and cool :DAlso got to try the pork belly rice bowl. Portion was small, but the price is pretty understandable too, so that's okay. I'm not sure if I was just insanely hungry or something, but this bowl was seriously more than just the sum of its parts! I see some green onions, coarse salt, rice... and some thinly sliced, grilled pork belly. But it tasted SOOO good. Although this has the simple theme going on just like the shrimp tempura udon, I feel like this tasted more special than the udon did. Makes me wanna try making it at home (probably just gonna fail, ponder how they make something so simple taste so good, and then come back here to eat it)! Give this place a shot! You'd be unlikely to regret it."
2/20/2016,20160220,5,4.25,"Sofa King Good!!! Can't loose with any of their dishes- Uni udon #1, Miso Carbonara #2, Squid #3"
2/20/2016,20160220,5,4.25,"Love love love the udon here! Despite the fact that it's hard to find parking sometimes and the long wait, we do not mind. The udon are made and cooked to perfection. My husband loves their tomato creamy udon and I love their beef hot udon. We've tried other places and they don't compare."
2/22/2016,20160222,4,4.25,"Mmmm the uni cream udon!!! So rich and creamy and bursting with uni flavor! The freshly made udon noodles here are the best I've had in the states! It has the perfect chewy texture and you can just taste the freshness! I love their open kitchen.. watching the chef roll the dough and cut the noodles is so mesmerizing and also makes you appreciate every bite of your noodles even more! I tried my friend's udon soup with tempura which comes with a generous portion of freshly fried tempura, light and cripy! The soup base was also surprisingly flavorful for plain udon soup. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other udons!"
2/22/2016,20160222,4,4.25,"Finally got to try this place! My friends and I waited about an hour to be seated for Sunday lunch. I initially had wanted to try the uni udon, but decided to try the seafood tomato udon. The dish was flavorful and hearty. The tomatoes gave the dish a tanginess and the noodles had an excellent, chewy consistency. I tried a bite of the carbonara and the uni udon. If I return again, I'll be going with the udon carbonara. Who can say no to bacon?"
2/23/2016,20160223,5,4.25,"Let's make this clear: I am a ramen person. I love chewing kinky noodles in thick salty broth. Although I would never turn my back on any noodles in general, I have little interest in ordering soba or udon at Japanese restaurants.But this place has made me truly appreciate udon! Before visiting Marugame Monzo earlier this week, I always felt like udon noodles were flavorless and bloated. These were impressively long (over a foot long for each strand) and had real flavor and chewiness that probably could only come from being so fresh, as they are made on site and hand cut in their open kitchen. I also found the fish-based broth to be better than udon soups I've had at other places.My friend and I each ordered bowls with double noodle portions (worth it for the extra $2). He ordered the udon soup noodles with kakuni, which was pork belly that didn't have loads of fat but lots of actual meat that were very tender and reminded me of homecooked stewed meat. I ordered the duck udon soup, which came with five meaty slices that weren't as tender as the pork belly but still pretty good.We also added soft boiled eggs for $1.50 each. Oh my gosh, this turned out to be my favorite part of the meal. They arrived as big tempura balls (I probably need to get out more, haha) and once punctured, out oozed a golden yellow yolk. My best bowls of ramen have never seen a more perfectly, precisely cooked soft boiled egg.Our soups were $12.95 each (before adding the double noodle portions) which was about right, and I had enough leftover soup and noodles to eat the next day for dinner while my friend devoured his entire bowl. I am curious to try their ""signature udon"" items which are soupless dishes with Italian-Japanese sauces such as carbonara and their famous uni butter one.TIP: I ordered plain ice water while my friend got hot tea...and they didn't charge for the tea, which I've never seen at a Japanese restaurant (it's common at Chinese places though). So I wish I had gotten tea as well! We saw the table next to us do the same, with one guy drinking tea and the other with ice water. I wanted to lean over and tell them what I had just learned as they had just arrived when we got our check. But, as my friend reminded me, sometimes people just do not want tea, and you cannot force them to drink tea. And just because they wanted tea last time, does not necessarily mean they want it this time.** In a few months, I will probably forget the joke reference. For those of you who didn't get it, google the PSA video that went viral in England, ""Unconscious people don't want tea."""
2/23/2016,20160223,5,4.25,"Came here for lunch on Sunday around 1pm. We parked at the parking lot on 2nd street for $10. Do not recommend that lot, but we got lazy. We put our name down at 1:20pm on the long wait list.. Probably around 10-12 tables ahead of us, so we decided to come back in 20 mins. We came back around 1:40pm and they had called our name a long while ago, so I say the wait time here is not too bad for a table for 2. We ordered the chicken tempera and the bean curd udon noodle soup. We added two rice bowls for $3, the kariage bowl and fatty tuna bowl. Food here is so amazing.. I'm a huge huge fan of Fukada in Irvine, but this place is slightly better because of the many different menu options they have. Total bill was around $30"
2/23/2016,20160223,5,4.25,"So glad I finally was able to come and dine here after having this place bookedmarked for a long time. I came on a Sunday around 2pm with 2 friends and the wait was not bad at all. Anyway, let's get to the food. I ordered the uni udon, and my friends ordered the curry and shrimp tempura udon. I had a taste of theirs and they were both delicious, but I loved my dish the most. It is pricey, at $16 but I had to try it since everyone raves about it. It did not disappoint. The broth is super rich and creamy and the udon noodles are chewy and so fresh! I love that they make it in house and you can see the workers kneading the dough in front of you. All in all, great service and great food. I will be coming back to try more."
2/26/2016,20160226,4,4.25,"Parking: Parking here is a pain, if you want to just not deal with it, then just park at the valet across the street.Food: Fresh cut udon noodles in front of you, made with well seasoned, creamy uni sauce. Just spells amazing. My friend got the Curry Beef Udon, which was pretty amazing too. Not sure how to compare with authentic udon or of that sort, but eating this blind, I have to recommend this to everyone.Service: Service is in between slow and alright. Somewhat forgivable due to the fact the place was full, but the server made sure to make everything great and was very helpful on which he recommended and liked the best."
2/27/2016,20160227,4,4.25,The udon here was soo good I almost shed a tear. I got the Uni udon while my boyfriend got the zaru udon. The zaru udon is pretty worth it for the price! It was suuuuuper refreshing. The Uni udon was so delicious but the portion is way too small for the price :'( it was literally like two bites. I would come here again but probably not when I'm feeling super hungry. There was no wait because we came right when it opened at 5. The service was really good and the food came out super fast!
2/28/2016,20160228,5,4.25,"Be prepared to wait awhile if you want to come here, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH IT. I've been here a few times, and every time I'd had to wait at least an hour. More recently, I came here 30 mins right after it opened and waited around 45 mins. However, that doesn't really bother me because you can just walk around Little Tokyo for a bit to kill time and come back. I've tried their hot udon, but my favorite thing to get from here is their Udon Gratin ($11.95). Their Udon Gratin consists of udon, chicken, onions, and lots and lots of cheese. It's baked in a pan and is served like that as well. I love the Udon Gratin because of how creamy and cheesy it is. If you like baked stuff or cheese, I would definitely recommend it! If not, any of the other types of udon are delicious as well. P.S. Get the tempura egg as an add on!"
2/28/2016,20160228,5,4.25,"I once read Jonathan Gold's review of this unbelievable eatery and he was right about one thing: get the tempura ginger. It's fantastic.He was totally wrong about the udon. The uni cream udon is absolutely mind-blowing. I prefer it to any Italian style sea urchin pasta I've with linguine or fettuccine. I love the fresh shiso leaf garnish and ikura on top that pleasantly pops in your mouth. If you don't want to wait, because Monzo is immediately packed the second they open for dinner, make sure to get there early. Lunch time is significantly more calm. I recommend sitting at the bar at least once. You get to watch an udon master at work! The fast paced chops are slightly frightening but impressive. If you sit at a table you'll probably find yourself craning to check out the kitchen action anyway!I've brought friends and family here-- never fails to impress. Monzo is also conveniently located a quick walk away from the Goldline Arts District stop. If you feel like getting a drink (before, after, or both!) The Far Bar is on the same block. It's a sign. You've gotta go!"

2/28/2016,20160228,4,4.25,"Didn't expect much from a udon restaurant but this place is one of my faves when I have a crave for carbs! They have about 20 different udon dishes. I personally recommend the sea urchin and miso carbonara! If you're famished and the udon doesn't cut it, their rice bowls are highly recommended as well, esp the fatty tuna one. The customer service is efficient and attentive."
2/29/2016,20160229,5,4.25,"Came here with a group of 3 around 1ish 2pm on a Saturday. We waited almost an hour but we were able to wander around the area and grab snacks beforehand.Environment:Very tiny restaurant, there is bar seating and seating along each side of the walls. Everything looked well maintained and clean. They also have a glass window where you can see the chefs preparing the noodles. Very intimate and casual atmosphere.Food:I ordered the Uni Udon and it was the best udon I've ever had. I've had Uni Udon at one other place in San Francisco, and this one is definitely better. The Udon is very bouncy and fresh. The creamy broth was great. They actually have Uni chunks in there, I wish it was bigger so I can fish it out easier. Not sure why they give such a giant spoon to eat it with. It's not very efficient. They also offer sides to add onto your order. I didn't add anything so I can try it as is and see how I feel and I loved it. Great flavors I didn't need anything extra. There's so much more I want to try. I'm excited to go back.Staff:They were friendly and worked fast. The took our order relatively quickly, our food came out fast, and check came out upon request. It would be great if they can do the text/call before hand to let you know your table is ready. There is no waiting area in front of the restaurant or outside, so standing out there is inconvenient. If they can do the text/call, it would give us the opportunity to walk around and spend time else where before our table is ready. They don't take reservations so this would make things easier if you can at least have an idea when you would get seated."
2/29/2016,20160229,4,4.25,"Atmosphere: Food: Server: Came around 6pm. Waited to be seated for 20+ min. Ordered beef tataki, sea urchin udon, mentai squid butter udon. Everything was so good but I highly recommend mentai udon. Sea urchin udon tasted rather like any other cream pasta and It was hard to find sea urchin in the soup. Would return when in town."

3/2/2016,20160302,4,4.25,"First time having Udon outside of Japan, and was very pleased with the result. I came on a week night around 8 pm and did not have to wait at all for a party of 4. The service was good and the server recommended a beef appetizer, though I cannot recall what it was called. It was seared nicely, and rare internally, and very tasty. I had the hot udon shrimp tempura with a soft boiled egg. The noodles made to perfection, each about 2 feet long. The broth was very tasty. If I lived in the LA area, this would be my go-to for udon. My family also enjoyed watching them make the noodles from behind the glass."
3/2/2016,20160302,5,4.25,"Came on a Monday at 6pm, no wait. Great start!Ordered the uni udon, mental squid butter udon, tempura soft boiled egg, and kakiage. LOVED the two udon. I will have to order both each time as I can't choose between the two. Neither of the dishes felt heavy despite the ingredients. Kakiage was good as a side, but wouldn't say it's a must have.Skip the egg unless you're planning to eat it with the udons or something cause it was incredibly bland. I wouldn't get it again. Not worth it when you can get other tastier tempura."

3/4/2016,20160304,3,4.25,We started off with the fried chicken which was delicious and perfectly crispy. Then we moved on to the sea urchin uni undon. The noodles tasted great as they are made in house. The creamy sauce was good as well but it wasn't spectacular. Seeing all the reviews I thought it was going to be amazing but it fell just short of that. Maybe if we had tried other dishes but this one was just ok. I wouldn't come back for that.

3/5/2016,20160305,4,4.25,"Udon at its best indeed!! You can choose from Uni udon to carbonara udon and everything in between. The unique part is its homemade udon right in front of you as you feast from the bar seating area. You must pick the tempura hard boiled egg on the side of every udon. There's plenty to choose from the appetizer too. Beef tataki was definitely a hit for us. Flavored with pimiento and capers like condiments. Just the right kobe beef taste to your palate. And many more karage to choose from.Be prepared to wait long on a weekend for dinner even as early as 5 when you arrive. Once they call your name three times and no answer then next up gets your table so I guess it was good that many gave up waiting, even better for us as we got seated to try this udon place for the first time. Staff are very polite, Japanese culture at its finest indeed. Highly recommend for udon superb. And yes will come back minus the wait though. At least it was worth it!!!"

3/6/2016,20160306,4,4.25,"Marugame Monzo is located in Little Tokyo near both Daikokuya and the Japanese American National Museum in DTLA. Between both Daikokuya and MM, they certainly attract a large gathering of people waiting in front of their shops eagerly waiting for their party # to be called so they can satisfy their ramen and udon cravings.I came here on a weekend and we immediately noticed the hostess how many people were in our party. Given that there was a little waiting time due to the crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk, we decided to walk over across the street to the Japanese Village Plaza Mall to check it out before coming back to wait some more. After coming back after 20 minutes or so, we were promptly seated in the front seating area where the tables and chairs are tightly close together. From a quick glance of the inside, it looks like your average Japanese restaurant, but the thing that stands out the most is that in the middle area between both dining area is a large plastic glass window that you can actually see the noodle master prepare the noodles in front of you. We looked through the menu and quickly decided on what we wanted: freshly hand pulled udon with sansai tanuki and the other of uni creamy udon/seafood. The udon was superb and I must admit almost as good as Fukada's. The service was quick and efficient in order to accommodate the other people still waiting in line as you're having your meal.Overall, I will return to get my fresh hand pulled udon fix!"
3/7/2016,20160307,4,4.25,"We came early around 11:15am on Sat and waited for open. Restaurant wasn't big space. Our waitress was friendly and fast action to make order, we got Mentai Squid Butter Udon, Sea Urchin Cream Udon, and Tempura shrimp and Soft Boiled Eggs. I am Udon fan, their Udons were elastic and handmade. Mental Squid Butter Udon was a little salty but I like it. Sea Urchin Cream Udon was very creamy with a lot few salmon eggs, but felt oily when we finished it. Overall, we had good experience, will be come back to try different kind Udon. Remind: Avoid wait long time, come early before 11:15am open for lunch, if only 2-4 people in a group."

The broth itself was creamy, delicious and you could taste the seafood. The Beef Tataki was served cold but very good. Meat was soft and tender. Be warned through that they are sitting in what it looks like olive oil for taste. The tempura egg was nothing special though. Just a soft boiled egg covered in tempura batter."

Everyone seems to love the creamy uni udon and I keep hearing people recommend it. I've had it once and if you love uni at sushi you probably wont like it here. The cream base is super rich and overpowers any uni in there and the uni was overcooked. You really get nothing from the uni but the name. One last thing, please please please put more shiso into the shiso udon. I expect more than 1 measly piece of shiso. In fact load the entire bowl with shiso if possible. Other than that I'll probably be back again in a few days."
3/10/2016,20160310,4,4.25,"After reading everyone's recommendations, I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter and my BF ordered the Uni.The dishes did not disappoint and was so good. The uni is a bit on the creamier side and may get to rich and tiredsome after a while for some like me, but the Mentai Squid butter was a bit lighter and very good. A few things we ordered on the side was the beef takaki and the chicken skin. The beef takaki was okay. I thought it would be a little more rare and the slices were a bit too thick. I wouldn't recommend ordering this. It LOOKS good, but the taste is another thing. The crispy skin in Yuzu sauce was pretty good. I would order this again but probably ask for the sauce on the side so I can just dip the chicken skin in it so it can stay crispyThe inside is a bit small and very cramped. Our table was sandwiched inbetween other tables of two and getting in and out was difficult. We would have to move the table to one side to get out so we wouldn't bump into the table next to us. The udon reminds me of Marukame Udon in Hawaii and is probably the only place that comes somewhat close to that. Next time I want to try the curry udon."
3/10/2016,20160310,3,4.25,"Came here to try the popular uni udon. It was okay, I'm not crazy about it, I was hoping for more fresh uni on it to give it a fresher flavor.  The udon noodles itself were really good, I might come back to try the other udon sometimes.  The restaurant is small and loud. The wait was about 1.5 hrs on a Saturday during dinner time, so be prepared for the wait."

The only bummer is everybody else in town knows about the place and there is ALWAYS a line."
3/11/2016,20160311,5,4.25,"Chances are you've heard about their famous handmade udon and you definitely have to try the uni udon because it's one of those foodie bucket list things, but seriously try their pork belly appetizer it's a bit on the sweet side (for me) but it's melt-in-your-mouth delicious, like I'm level 99 full and i still feel the need to finish it. ALSO ALSO ALSO, order their BEEF TATAKI it's perfectly balanced in flavor and surprisingly light. I wake up craving this stuff."

Although the carbonara udon was good, I felt the bacon was quite overpowering (as is usually the case when you cook with bacon).[Decor]: There is a window where you can watch the udon being prepared. Dark wooden tables, floors, seats, and walls.[Atmosphere]: The dining room was a little on the dim side--or maybe the gratuitous use of dark wood threw me off."
3/12/2016,20160312,5,4.25,"I love, Love, LOVE this place! the shrimp tempura udon is yummers, the seafood tomato and mentai butter udon is amazing, but the sea urchin udon tastes absolutely heavenly and its my go to 9 times out of 10. I bring everyone here because you can't beat the quality and taste or the price!"
3/13/2016,20160313,5,4.25,"I love Monzos udon which is hand made in front of you. Their specialty udon are all very unique and delicious. I don't like their normal basic udon, it's a bit too sweet for me but my friends seem to love it. The wait here gets ridiculous as well and it is a very small place right next to daikokuya. Small parties is shouldn't be as bad but parties over 4 will definitely have to wait longer. I think my favorite one is their gratin udon, which is udon with heavy cheese and chicken in thick creamy white sauce. It's absolutely delicious! And my 2nd favorite is their tomato seafood udon, it taste like spaghetti noodles but with udon and more tasty. The must get appetizer is their beef tataki! Super tasty and delicious as well!"
3/13/2016,20160313,3,4.25,"Finally tried the sea urchin cream udon here and it was yum! It kind of reminded me of the creaminess of mac n cheese :) Just wished there was more uni and roe! Luv it when the roe pops in my mouth and it bursts with flava! I would advise sharing this due to the cream factor and ""sharing is caring"" :) Cute lil place; we sat at the bar and got to see the noodle making. The fatty tuna rice bowl was also yum. Can't go wrong with toro! Friendly staff too!"
3/13/2016,20160313,4,4.25,"Their Uni Cream Udon is AMA-ZING. Creamy and delicious in its own right. Good noodle texture. Like other reviewers have stated, they could use little more uni's. Overall, good food and good experience definitely."
3/13/2016,20160313,5,4.25,"Yes, the wait can be long here but the handmade udon is so good. It's pretty cool to sit in front of the dude handmaking the udon. I never knew it was so labor intensive. I recently came here for lunch (first time for lunch) and was sad that they didn't serve the beef tataki for lunch. So I ended up going with my usual of the kakuni udon. In hindsight, I was sort of glad I didn't get the tataki because I was pretty full after the udon. The pork that's in the udon, although upon first glance doesn't seem much in quantity, is actually pretty substantial. I love the pieces that are fatty too..those just melt in your mouth haha. But the star here is the perfect handmade udon."
3/13/2016,20160313,5,4.25,"very much worth the 2 hour wait! if you are reading this review, know that you need to stop reading and go here to save your spot because this line is redonk! this has been the best udon i have ever had, noodles are perfectly al dente, the soup base was savory and had a good amount of content in it as well. I got the curry noodle and although very flavorful, very much yummy. our group did not talk to each other because we were all so indulged in our own udon bowls :)."
3/14/2016,20160314,4,4.25,"I've been to little Tokyo numerous times, but somehow this restaurant never really caught my eye (possibly because of that terrible long line for daikokuya next door?). But boy, am I glad I finally found and tried this place.I came with a friend on a Sunday night at around 6pm and waited for ~40-50 minutes. Once we got seated, things got rolling real fast - I'd had plenty of time to Yelp what to try here before ordering. We ended up ordering the sea urchin cream udon and the pork belly udon. The sea urchin cream udon blew my mind! I'm not exactly sure what's in the sauce (butter comes to mind?) but it was REALLY tasty. And the pork belly was extremely filling! I read a few reviews about the portions being small, and I think it really depends on the udon you order. I definitely felt like I could eat more of the sea urchin cream udon even after we finished the bowl, but the pork belly udon really wrapped things up for me. Anyway, I'm definitely looking forward to the next visit (beef tataki, I'm looking at you!!)"
3/15/2016,20160315,4,4.25,"It was my first time visiting Monzo's the other day and their udon is delicious. I sat right in front of where they were making the udon and the workers were friendly.There were many different types of (basic) udon and specialty udon, so it took me a while to figure out what I wanted because they all look appetizing. so I ordered their Fried Chicken Skin (nice and crispy with the sauce) and the Sea Urchin Cream Udon and it was rich and creamy (not what I had expected from the uni)Overall, they had good service the wait a like 5 mins and the food is great! I will definitely be back to try another udon."
3/16/2016,20160316,5,4.25,"FRESH. FINE. FILLING. FENOMENAL*...I love udon. It's even better when the udon is made fresh, right in front of you. The wait was around 1 hr - this was expected; you should expect the same.The beer was ice cold. The appetizers were the perfect balance of greasy, satisfying, and not-too-heavy. The udon.. oh man!Sea-Urchin Cream Udon - absolutely fantastic. creamy. heavy. excellentDuck Udon - the broth was SO GOODChicken Karagge - delicious. the curry powder adds a nice twistFried Smelt - salty. crunchy. perfect beer partner (curry powder provided as well)Pork Belly - holy smokes, this one really did it for me. flavorful. succulent... I'm salivating while thinking back to the panty-dropping experienceGo with the people you love, the company you enjoy.. and have a beer for me. This place is the tits.*modern shakespeare strikes again; soon to be trademarked by yours truly"
3/16/2016,20160316,3,4.25,"Heard a good amount of people raving about the uni udon so I had to try it! The bowl size definitely tricks you because it looks huge but the amount of food they give you does not equal to it.. You probably get at most 5 spoonfuls of the udon at most. For $15, you're better off eating boiling point and actually getting full from that. Street parking in Little Tokyo is the worst.. so be prepared for $3/hour if you decide to park at a meter! Only upside to this is how they make the udon in front of your face if you get seated there. I got seated at a small table in a cramped corner next to a pole... My friend and I had to slide through a wall and pole to get to our seats. This place is only worth trying once."
3/17/2016,20160317,5,4.25,"Great chewy fresh udon noodles!! I generally doesn't like udon, but I love udon from this place. The udon here are freshly made in a long continuous strand that makes eating more fun ;)My favorite is their uni cream udon and I don't usually eat uni either. It breaks both of my non usual eating item to my favourite! It's creamy and tasty with lots of uni! I ordered this with their fried boil eggs! It's heavenly good.For appetizers, I like their crispy chicken skin. I like how their ponzu dressing made it not greasy and light for a deep fried dish. I also had there beef tataki, it was A-OK. It's large portion, but not memorable. For beer, must tried their kawaba sunrise ale. It's now one of my favorite Japanese craft beer. I do like it better than sapporo and Asahi , it not as dry and easy drinking."
3/18/2016,20160318,4,4.25,"Yes, this place gets busy, but I'm one of the people who thinks it's worth it. I've always been more of a udon person, but Monzo's noodles just make me want to gurgle Homer-Simpson style. Also, their tempura, OH, THE TEMPURA! I've tried their traditional dishes as well as their ""fusion"" dishes, and Monzo never disappointed, other than their serving size being not so generous."
3/19/2016,20160319,5,4.25,"Love this place! 2 things you need for a good bowl of noodle: texture of the noodle and flavor of the broth. This place got both right! I had the mentai squid butter udon and it was awesome! The flavor of the broth was perfect with the fish roe and the squid was perfectly cook! Honestly, I can eat a whole bowl just with noodles and broth! My friend had the Sea urchin udon which I thought was too creamy and rich but that's just me. I don't like creamy sauces. The beef udon was also yummy and light...bit on the sweet side. Would definitely recommend and come back again. Only down side is the wait is ridiculous. I got there at 11:30 am which is when the open and they were already packed and there was already a waiting list... No reservations taken and no take out orders. Ig was a 40 minute wait even though I got there when it opened."
3/19/2016,20160319,5,4.25,"This place is one of my favorites. The noodles were just on point. Freshly made, has that bouncy texture. The Uni cream was so rich and filling. Definitely a place to eat. Flavors are all there. Worth the wait! I also tried the tempura soft boiled egg. Quit enjoyable and a great experience.Totally glad this was one of the places I decided to stop by an eat during my trip across little Tokyo."
3/19/2016,20160319,3,4.25,"I've been to this place twice: Once to have duck nanban udon, and the other time to have curry udon. They were both only so-so. (I've tasted some others off of friends' bowls, and kama-age udon was probably the best and the most authentic of all that I've tasted.) The noodles are pretty good, but nothing phenomenal, and the broth/topping were meh. I have not had the more traditional bowls of udon, but it's been a little underwhelming."
3/20/2016,20160320,1,4.25,"If you want uni, go to EMC or Maruhide. This place seemed to be all the rage, so we had to get in their one hour line. The line that was formed before they opened.Uni Cream Udon - heavy cream with bits of uni. Uni did not have a huge presence here. Again, go to EMC for their uni pasta. Way better.Kakuni Udon - extremely bland. Pork was really chewy and hard. Also came with its very own summer fly.Once this was brought to the attention of a waitress, she did not apologize. Or even offer to take the bowl away. Instead, she said ""that's normal in the summer time."" Oh you mean to say it is OKAY to have flies in your soup?! Good luck passing the next health inspection. Please see picture below."
3/20/2016,20160320,4,4.25,"When I first tasted their Uni Creme Udon, about 2 years ago I thought it was heaven and the best Udon I have had, ever. After repeated visits I have thought less of it but I still think the Udon with Uni Creme Sauce is their best dish. I have tried the Mentai Squid Udon and Curry Udon. Both I thought did not taste as good as the Uni Udon. The beef tataki was OK."
3/22/2016,20160322,5,4.25,"Monzo is the best place to grab a bowl of udon. The noodles are handmade and the signature dishes range from carbonara udon to creamy uni udon. I usually settle for the kake udon, which is the most standard of udons, but that's because I get it with a side of negitoro rice. This is a small bowl of rice topped with tuna belly and mayo. It's absolutely delicious and makes for an awesome appetizer before filling yourself up with delicious noodles.The wait's a bit long, so you should either get there as soon as it opens or during the less busy hours, such as those awkward times between lunch and dinner. It's totally worth it, though. Give this place a try!"
3/22/2016,20160322,4,4.25,"Shit is super fucking dank this udon place makes me super wet!! Although there is always a long ass line before the shop opens, I am willing to stand and wait to eat at this place. I always order the negitoro bowl + the beef udon. I love the presentation of the udon, it's very aesthetic and different compared to other noodle shops."
3/22/2016,20160322,3,4.25,"I am not a fan of uni, but I quite enjoyed the uni cream udon. It is super rich, reminding me of, say, lobster bisque. Also, gets cold fairly quickly. Not cheap at sixteen bucks for a bowl. They also rush you to GTFO when you're done eating so they can turn the table. Four stars if it were cheaper."
3/23/2016,20160323,5,4.25,"This uni udon here is amazing! The uni was so fresh and the sauce was so creamy. The udon noodles are made in house and you can watch the workers make udon through a clear glass while you eat. It was pretty cool. My BF got a tomato based udon with seafood I believe ( I don't remember exactly what it was called) but it was very flavorful and tasty as well. I would totally come back to try some of their other dishes. Though it is hard to find parking in that area, the food is worth the hassle to park. When we went that night, there was no wait so we got seated right away. The servers are also very friendly and check up on you frequently. Highly recommend this place!"
3/23/2016,20160323,5,4.25,"If you want to experience basic AL DENTE chewy and authentic noodles, I definitely recommend the Zaru Udon - dry udon noodles with clear dipping sauce (no broth). If you're feeling adventurous go for their unique dishes - Uni Udon in rich and creamy sauce. Whatever dish you pick, you'll taste the difference in texture of these fresh udon noodles compared to frozen ones!I personally believe Udon and Soba are best eaten dry and dipped in broth as opposed to served in hot/cold broth. This guarantees the al dente texture and you can control the intensity of flavour for each bite. I found the noodles in hot broth dishes to be noticeably less chewy. I got to try the soft boiled egg (gooey yolk!) and pumpkin tempura (so sweet) as well which were both great.Overall, awesome and authentic place for noodle lovers. The little glass room that shows noodles being hand made add an extra touch and uniqueness to the restaurant."
3/24/2016,20160324,3,4.25,"Came here after hearing so many great things about their fresh udon. My BF and I decided to come here for our anniversary to try their uni udon. (We've been craving uni for the past couple weeks). We got here and found street parking at a meter a couple blocks away. We walked over, entered the shop, and were seated immediately.We ordered two ($15 each) uni udon & the dish came out pretty quickly. To be honest.. I don't get what's so good about it. The uni was great, however after a couple bites of it, I just got sick of it. The consistency is way too creamy and ended up tasting too fishy for me. It was good the first couple of bites && half way through it I ended up leaving with a stomach ache. The udon was definitely fresh though. Major props for that. Would I be back..? Probably not since I'm not a huge fan of udon noodles to begin with."
3/24/2016,20160324,5,4.25,"Please eat here if you love udon. Literally soooo yummy.I read the reviews and decided that I had to try the uni cream udon (I am a uni enthusiast).Sadly to say, I don't think it's anything too special.It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again.However, this restaurant makes its own udon noodles and... the result is happy happy customers. The noodles are thick, chewy and perfect! Everything you dream your udon to be. My favorite would have to be the classic shrimp tempura udon.*Note: Do not be alarmed at the size of the shrimp. Seriously, shrimp on steroids.The broth is perfect. You take a sip and ""ooooh"".Parking isn't the easiest but try to find some on streets! Lots of metered parking. If not, there are some parking lots. There is a wait, usually around 20 minutes.Try to avoid coming with big parties because the restaurant is tiny. You'll also be seated more quickly. They have so many unique udon dishes that I'm dying to come back again, soon. Little Tokyo seriously has some of the best eateries in LA :)"
3/25/2016,20160325,5,4.25,"I know Daikokuya next door is pretty notorious in LA, but I was craving some udon since I'm not a huge fan of ramen. We arrived 10 minutes before opening and there was already a line forming. Being tourists from Texas, I had yet to try good udon in the US. We got seated right away and the place filled up fast but did not get too annoyingly crowded. We ordered our food and watched as the chef made noodles right before our eyes... the noodles here are definitely fresh and did not disappoint. Worth the price and the interesting trek to Little Tokyo. Will definitely come back here again next time when I'm in LA."
3/25/2016,20160325,4,4.25,"Waited about 45 minutes for a party of 2 on a Thursday night. I was a little hesitant at first since I'm not a big fan of creamy pasta but I wanted to give this place a try after reading all the positive reviews. I got their signature creamy uni udon and it was delicious, with just the right amount of flavor, not too salty or overpowering with cream. Portions are small and a little pricey. Service was decent. Overall, a good experience."
3/25/2016,20160325,4,4.25,I had the tomato based seafood noodles. It was delicious. imagine a tomato bisque with shrimp. Yum. Why not 4 stars. Restaurant is tiny and always busy. I was on lunch break and could not wait long. I wanted takeout and they refused. So I waited and sat but had to inhale my lunch. This is not a place to go If you ate pressed For time. On the bright side It was so good I ate it all! And it's no small portion.
3/26/2016,20160326,5,4.25,"Uni udon!! Yes it's as delicious as it sounds, looks in photos, and is raves about on Yelp! I waited 1.5 hours on a Friday night but I loved every bite of my bowl of fresh hand made udon :D I left feeling very happy."
3/29/2016,20160329,5,4.25,"This is my absolute favorite place to go for Udon. When there is always a wait.. You know it's good. The udon is made right in front of you! They have an open kitchen so you can see the talented chefs working. I love their tempura soft boiled eggs too! I add it every time. The noodles are perfectly chewy and delightful! My favorite soups are either the miso carbonara udon or the simple, yet delicious, shrimp tempura udon. During lunch you can add a rice bowl for $3! The pork belly bowl is my favorite. The service is always amazing, the staff is kind and quick. They understand that after waiting so long, you just wanna eat! We usually order, get our food, and pay in just about 40 minutes (sometimes less!). they work hard to keep the line moving. Favorite place by far! A must have if you're in Little Tokyo."
3/30/2016,20160330,4,4.25,"They are not joking around about the call your name three times and you're out business, and it's three quick times in a row. They told us the wait would be about 30 minutes, and we would have missed our table if we had come back after more than 20 minutes. The rice bowl add on my friend got was the best part of the meal, a small bowl of rice with some delicious sauces and a raw tuna ball in the middle. The second best dish the three of us got was the Udon Carbonara, which put the guy who ate most of it into a food coma for the rest of the afternoon but tasted like heaven. Two of us had the Shrimp Udon (the normal Udon with two Shirmp tempura pieces) which was good, but not great. I made the mistake of ordering the double noodles, which was way more than I could eat, and I'm a pretty big guy with a big appetite. The broth was less flavorful than I wanted it to be for the first half of the bowl but towards the bottom it was clear I should have stirred it up more. The soft boiled egg add on was tasty, but the tempura coating was a bit soggy when I got it. Lastly, the noodles. They are clearly made with care and great ingredients. But I definitely like the frozen ones I get from the Japanese grocery store more. These were a totally different experience and they lent themselves beautifully to the creamy Carbonara but felt out of place in the soup. I would go back to this place in a heart beat, but would split the Carbonara, get two of the rice bowls, and a few pieces of Tempura to share."
3/31/2016,20160331,5,4.25,"Is it over dramatic to say, ""My life has changed!""? I have been wanting to visit LA to try this place for awhile. My last trip to SoCal didn't afford me the opportunity to stop here. Thank-you work for setting me up in Japantown and walking distance to Marugame Monzo!I came here on a Wednesday night with my friend around 7pm and the wait was approximately 30 minutes. We were seated and I knew exactly what I wanted ""Sea Urchin Udon, please..with a side of soft boiled egg.""My friend had the Curry Udon.My dish was MIND BLOWING! It was creaming. It was savory. And dat egg! It was fried in tempura but was still a perfect soft boiled egg.I wanted more! I could've easily eaten two bowls. Next time, I want to try their butter squid udon..AND the sea urchin again. SO GOOD!"
4/1/2016,20160401,5,4.25,"Forget ramen. I love udon. The variety here is great and so fresh! I've only had this type of udon in Tokyo and once in Hawaii. They make the noodles so fresh and the various flavors are great. We had the squid butter, the cold bukkake and shrimp tempura udon. Also must try the egg. Holy crap those are so good! Perfectly cooked and with a yummy tempura coating. Slluuurrppp!"
4/2/2016,20160402,3,4.25,"I am happy to say I finally tried this popular Little Tokyo eatery. You know a place has a strong following when there's a line of 25-30+ people waiting for it to open. I got there around 11:20AM and was among the first round of people seated. My cousin and I ordered the tempura platter, uni udon, and the mentai squid udon. Out of all those things, I only really enjoyed the mentai squid udon. The tempura was kind of crispy, but nothing tasted good. I've had better tempura at other places. What do I mean by better? The veggies that were fried actually still had flavor. Here...Everything was just bland or just a mouthful of oil.The uni udon was very heavy and the uni didn't taste like anything either. I was disappointed. At $16/Bowl, you do get a decent amount for a person. I wouldn't order this again though.The real winner for me was the squid udon. The broth was light and I loved the taste. They have plenty of roe and said pieces. The housemade udon (sit at the counter if you wanna see the guy make it) was fantastic. I'd order this item again. I think it was $12-13.Parking is somewhat of a pain, if you're not willing to park in a paid lot. The meters will be scarce, but if you go to a lot, there are plenty of spots. I parked in the lot adjacent to MOCA. It was $7, but it's good for all day."
4/2/2016,20160402,4,4.25,"I highly recommend this place for the sea urchin cream udon!It's the only thing I've tried here and I'm not sure if I will ever order anything else because I really, really enjoyed it. The udon is just the perfect texture and the cream sauce is delicious! There were bits of uni in this sauce! The cream sauce, however, may be a bit too creamy for some people. I topped my udon with kakiage and a soft-boiled egg. Keep in mind, however, that it is an egg tempura so it's fried in batter. I was just expecting a normal soft-boiled egg so I was a bit surprised when it came out fried. It was still good, nonetheless.4.5 stars for food but rounded down because of waitlist issues and the price."
4/3/2016,20160403,4,4.25,"First off, it was fairly easy to find a parking spot. There are certain places that are $3/hr which is the area a little closer to the restaurant on a more busy street (I think it was S San Pedro St) and there are places that are $1.50/hr; 2 HOURS MAX by meter (where my friend and I parked on E 3rd St and between OmarSt+Crocker St in front of the Japanese American Cultural & Community Center). If you're too lazy to find a space then there's always a structure on the same street for $10 but I think there's still a time limit and you're getting jipped for paying that much so walk a little! We got the Assorted Tempura and the Pork Miso Onigiri as an appetizer. The sizes for the tempuras were a lot bigger than places such as Misoya. The Onigiri was really good- the flavor wasn't overwhelming so you could definitely enjoy it (don't expect distinguishable pork meat in it though).For the main dish my friend got the Mentai Squid Butter Udon which she seemed to really enjoy. The squid was just about as tender as a fish fillet! To me, the flavor was decent since it was a little too salty. I got the creamy and cheesy goodness Udon Gratin. The cheese baked on top was salty as well but the sauce lessen it a little and the chicken was nothing special but it wasn't bad either.It's a fairly small place with mostly tables of two's so I'd recommend keeping your parties small. If you choose to sit at the bar then you can watch them make the udon by hand! We came right before it got busy at around 5pm on a Saturday and got seated in a jiffy. I'd probably come back to try the Miso Carbonara Udon and Uni!! :-)"
4/3/2016,20160403,5,4.25,"Last night a group of 10 of us were seated in less than an hour on a Saturday night and they even put tables together so we can all sit together which was nice considering how small the restaurant is. I had the tasty miso carbonarra, assorted tempura appetizer, and shared the haikkasan sake with friends. The entre was so tasty and not too cheesy, the tempura isnt overly fried and greasy, and the sake was so smooth. Cost isn't bad for the quality of food. If you're into traditional udon, 5 of my friends had the kakuni udon which had massive and tender and flavorful chunks of pork belly. Don't be deceived by portions! The noodles are plenty filling :)"
4/4/2016,20160404,4,4.25,"One of my go to spots for some Uni udon! This is like One of the few places I can eat Uni from! I love how the noodles are made fresh .. And you can even see them making it! :) Braised Porked belly : thick Pork belly appetizer. The meat melts in your mouth and it's also very flavorful. Spicy tuna bowl: portion is small but with the appetizer it goes pretty well. It seemed like it had a little too much sesame oil mixed in.Sea urchin udon: this is a must! With the different types of food that was ordered, this udon bowl satisfied my cravings! It's creamy, yet enough texture to make it taste that much better! Went on a Friday around 6pm and the wait was about 45 minutes. They don't take reservations. It's a good place for smaller groups!"
4/4/2016,20160404,5,4.25,"Came here on a sat night around 7:30. They have a list where you write your name and how many people are in your party. Then they call your name outside 3 times and if you're not there after the 3rd last call they cross your name off the list and go to the next person. Sounds harsh but it really helps reduce the wait time! You can't bring the menus outside so i suggest looking at the menu on your phone while you wait. They told us the wait would be 20-35 minutes and it was only about 15 minutes for a party of 2. This is a pretty small place so seating is kind of tight but bearable. We ordered the mentai squid ink and wow was it good. It has halibut and little pink fish eggs in it I think. It's not too heavy which I loved and the portions are perfect. I killed the whole bowl. There's so much flavor and it doesn't have a fishy taste. I also had the baby octopus tempura which I probably wouldn't order again because there wasn't much flavor and the soft boiled egg which I liked more. I ordered the onigiri pork miso which I liked. Unlike some rice balls this one had a lot of flavor and a decent amount of pork miso inside. I also had the beef rice bowl which I really loved. Just to note, the beef rice bowl comes in a small portion. I brought some of it home and it still tasted amazing reheated. Best beef rice bowl I ever had. It had a light, sweet taste to it. Nothing tasted heavy to me. First time I ate udon and didnt feel bloated after prices were very reasonable. The tempuras are a couple of bucks each and the udons are $10-$15ish. The beef bowl was $5-$6. Not to mention, the food came out extremely fast for a fully packed restaurant. Waited maybe 10 minutes. I love this place!"
4/5/2016,20160405,5,4.25,"Best udon I've ever had. Hands down. Nothing can truly top handmade udon, especially when it's made right in front of your eyes. The wait here is pretty long though. We waited a good hour before we were seated. This restaurant is across the street from Little Tokyo so it wasn't that bad because we got to walk around the shops and it's always fun to window shop! I ordered the Carbonara Udon and shared a Pork Belly Rice Bowl with my boyfriend. Both were phenomenal. First let's talk about the rice bowl. The pork belly pieces were perfectly seasoned and so flavorful. It may not be the prettiest bowl to look at but the flavors were divine. The slightly salty pork belly eaten with a spoonful of rice is not a bite to be forgotten. Definitely give it a try! The Carbonara Udon was so creamy and rich. It was topped like a classic carbonara with bacon. The sauce was extremely decadent and so luscious. The flavor is hard to describe but it is oh so good. Their noodles are also the perfect texture. They have the perfect bite to them, and a perfect chewy texture. It may not seem like a huge serving, but because of how rich it was I couldn't finish it. Their soft boiled tempura egg is also a real treat! It's still runny on the inside but the egg is fried on the outside! The service was also friendly and super warm. Our waitress made jokes with us and was quick with our orders. Love this place!"
4/5/2016,20160405,4,4.25,"Came in before it opened and there was already a line, but we got seated right at 11:30 which is when they open. We ordered a regular udon no meat, side order of tempura rice bowl along with the udon and pork belly. They have lunch specials where you add a few extra dollars for a rice bowl. I enjoyed my regular udon added some spices in there! They didn't give you any soy sauce to add which was needed for my regular udon. The poor belly I was told was super delicious and it melted in your mouth. There are toppings that you can pay extra for like eggs and green onions. Canned soda was $2 kinda pricey but if you're thirsty you're thirsty.  Tips:Ask to sit at the bar so you can watch the udon being made! Super cool for kids to keep them occupied"
4/6/2016,20160406,4,4.25,"This was my first time here after reading about all the hype over fresh udon noodles. I must say they were delicious, it's so much better than any other udon noodles I've had! The noodles were springy and just a bit past al dente, which is perfect for udon noodles and they almost looked translucent in the sauce. I ordered the sea urchin cream udon and my friend got the mentai squid butter udon. I had a taste of my friend's dish and I actually liked it better than mine. As someone else commented you get cooked sea urchin in the dish which is somewhat unpalatable. I was expecting fresh uni whose silkiness would complement the creamy sauce but you get hard, cooked uni which is very fishy tasting and salty. I would go back and try other dishes on the menu but the sea urchin cream udon was somewhat disappointing for being the most expensive thing on the menu."
4/6/2016,20160406,5,4.25,"*** 666/666 FOR HANDMADE NOODLES***So, I was upset for a moment because my party of 2 was next on the list to be seated, but a couple who was on the list after my party went inside and argued to be seated before us. It just felt really shitty because we had already waited for 30 minutes and that couple got to sit at a table. As soon as we saw this go down we went inside to raise hell and, before we got a chance to complain that these people were after us in the queue, we were seated at the bar. I was upset again because I wanted a table, but then the staff started making noodles in front of us, and I was happy to be seated at the bar. They got lucky with that, but it still felt shitty to see them not give a fuck about the list. I got the uni udon. It was rich and creamy, but the cooked uni chunks thew me off guard. Wish they would balance it out with a little raw uni. I will probably not order this again, not because it was bad, it was actually very good, but because it wasn't as special as I was hoping it would be. I love their noodles and I can't wait to try some of the other broth options."
4/7/2016,20160407,5,4.25,"Where in the world have I been that I missed this gem right in my own neighborhood?! Their udon redefines the word udon for me. . . . so slurpable. So, chewy. Amazing, amazing, amazing. I'll be back soon!"
4/9/2016,20160409,5,4.25,"Best Udon I have ever had. Small place with not a lot of tables, so be prepared to wait a bit. And not a lot of waiting room. But the wait is so worth it. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will your Udon noodles! Service is fast once you get in as they need to turn tables to keep up with the crowd. Give them a try - you won't be disappointed!"
4/10/2016,20160410,4,4.25,"First come, first serve and best to arrive as soon as it opens. We were lucky to get in without the queue, seeing how there's always a long line that interferes with Daikokuya's line (shops are right next to each other). You can see them make the udon from the clear kitchen window across from the entrance. (+) Uni Udon for $15.95 : The udon alone is slightly sweet. The trace of that something sweet comes through when you repeatedly chew through the udon. It doesn't taste like cane sugar, but that could just be me. The uni sauce tastes like a light and creamy alfredo sauce (without the cheese) and slightly bitter because of the uni. I enjoy eating sea urchin and it was nice to see this combination with house made udon.(-/+) Plum Shiso Bukkake Udon $8.95 : Simple, slightly floral from the shiso and umeboshi plum paste. The broth is served cold, a perfect dish if you're looking for something easy to taste in the Spring. Not very filling, best accompanied by a side of tempura."
4/10/2016,20160410,4,4.25,STOP COMING HERE WITH BIG GROUPS you ignorant entitled people! And then getting all bent out of shape that they can't accommodate you immediately.
4/10/2016,20160410,3,4.25,Came here with the bf for lunch today since he's never been but was fairly disappointed. What happened to the good uni udon I had 3 yrs ago?? The portion is so small now and the color of the sauce is no longer that much orangey. Bf finished the bowl in 5 minutes because there wasn't much noodles in there and we weren't hungry to begin with. I wish this place bring back the uni odon I had 3 yrs ago and not skimp out on the ingredients.
4/11/2016,20160411,3,4.25,"Was lucky there's no wait on the Saturday dinner. Drove all the way to LA just to eat this. I love trying all the udon places but I was very disappointed with this one... their uni udon. NO UNI FLAVOR AT ALL nor I see any bits of uni in it. It felt like I was just eating a cream udon with a hint of seafood flavor. The Mentaiko udon is alright but ill say its better than the uni one. More refreshing and can actually taste the mentaiko eventhough it wasn't strong. Udon is on the harder side. Their tempura is a must here! It is fried perfectly and not overly greasy. The Kakiage is not just veggies but filled with tons of shrimps and scallop! I'd recommend you eat this with the sauce they provide for cold udon or ask for some sauce. If I ever come back, I'll prob just order the tempura."
4/11/2016,20160411,4,4.25,"The reason why I love this place is because they make their udon by hand. It's all home made. The udon has a chewy texture. It's not too mushy. It comes out in a big bowl which is a pretty good portion. You will walk out full! You can get a size up if you want. I've tried the beef udon the first time. The broth is flavorful and not salty. My friend had the duck udon which was good too. I tried the uni cream pasta this time around. For people who don't know what uni is, its sea urchin that has a creamy consistency. It's more commonly found in sushi. The udon honestly tasted like Alfredo pasta. Some people say that half way through the creaminess gets you tired of it but honestly I finished my entire bowl by myself. It was that good! The con is that the udon is hand made so it takes a longer time to prepare. The restaurant opens at 11:30AM I would come maybe 10 minutes early because the line already starts to form and if you can get in early enough you can be the first ones seated. My friends and I came in at 11:35AM but we didn't get seated until 12PM. Also there's no seats outside while you wait. They call you 3 times before they cross you off the list."
4/11/2016,20160411,3,4.25,"I expected a lot more from this place. I wanted to try their sea urchin cream udon for so long and I finally did and it was a letdown. Compared to the ones everyone has been posting on here, mine had no uni whatsoever. I paid $16 for just a bowl of udon in cream sauce. Don't get me wrong, the udon had a great texture and I loved the cream sauce. I'm just upset at that fact that I had no uni in my uni udon.Their tempura soft boiled egg however, was amazing. It was lightly battered and the yolk was still a little runny. I was glad I added that to my udon because I would've been really upset with my entire meal.I would come back to give it another try.. if I'm in Lil Tokyo and just so happened to crave udon but other than that, no thank you."
4/13/2016,20160413,5,4.25,"I've had this place bookmarked forever, and it did not disappoint! Since Daikokuya is one of my favorite ramen places, whenever I'd come to Little Tokyo-I'd be there strictly for Daikokuya, and overlooked this gem many times. Also, I did not start to enjoy udon until recently, which is another reason why I'd never really paid this place any attention.I came here for dinner last week, and I loved my experience. I love the large window of the kitchen where you can watch them making fresh udon. We were lucky enough to snag three seats at the bar, and had the best seats in the house. I ordered the beef udon-I loved the clear, flavorful broth, the fresh udon, and thin slices of beef-although I did wish it was bit less fatty. I added the soft boiled egg, which is a must. I also added a piece of shrimp tempura. I may add on some shiitake mushrooms next time. I appreciated the laid back, modern vibe of this place. Service was great! I'll def be back soon!"
4/13/2016,20160413,3,4.25,"I enjoyed the food especially cream urchin udon. But, the wait and the price made me thinking twice to go back. Though they had a waiting list, the customers were not seated in order. My friends and I were a party of three. At least 6 party of two whose names in below ours in the waiting list were seated before us. The server didn't want to combine two tables even though 2 empty tables were next to each other. We waited for one hour and 20 minutes for our table. Besides the waiting times, the waiter made a mistake with our order. It was disappointing experience regardless yummy sea urchin udon."
4/14/2016,20160414,5,4.25,You have to try Sea Urchin Udon. Best udon I've ever tasted.
4/14/2016,20160414,4,4.25,"Been here a a bunch of times, these are the items that are most memorable: -uni udon: a must try. Generous on the uni potion. Delicious but too rich for me. I can eat about 1/2 the bowl. Love the shiso leaf on top. -mentai squid butter: really savory and flavorful, love the combination of tender squid, cooked roe, onion slivers; and dried chili. Def a go to option. -Vongole: I always debate between getting this or the mentai squid. This might be my favorite by a hair. It's really always clean, fresh, and flavorful. Generous on the clam portion. -Cold udon with ume: such a refreshing alternative, great for the summer: _assorted tempura: usually about 5 pieces (1 shrimp, eggplant, squash, mushroom, Shiso leaf) always delicious and crispy! -scallop carpaccio: really fresh, light in flavor. Borderline bland. Why I give it 4/5 stars: -there's almost always a wait. Like 45 mins for a party of 2. 15 mins when's it's ""slow"" -the aren't accommodating, I always want more of the delicious Vongole broth, but they usually decline. -the portion is smallish. Or maybe I'm just fat, it's so good!! My Advice is don't come when you're starving because you will get hangry waiting. But I always leave full and happy, it's one of my favorite comfort food spots!"

4/15/2016,20160415,3,4.25,"Service is good. Food was fine, but sorry, didn't find it that special compared to other udon places. Had the miso carbonara udon and my wife had the sea urchin cream one. I did enjoy the demonstration of making the udon from scratch though!"

4/16/2016,20160416,5,4.24,"Nothing beats freshly made udon. You can literally watch them make the udon noodles in the kitchen. It's a quaint little shop located in the heart of Little Tokyo.This place is busy with good reason. These guys know what they are doing. It's traditional Japanese udon with a modern twist. The must try is the uni udon. If you like rich creamy flavor, this is for you. It's similar to alfredo pasta, but better! So savory and rich. The bits of uni is cooked and not raw. Word on the street is their other udon bowls are also delicious. If you're not feeling adventurous, you can always opt for the more traditional udon options. In my opinion, you can never go wrong with the more traditional options. Some things stand the test of time because they ARE good!You can also add different toppings and sides to your bowl. They give them to you separately and not in your dish which is great. I added seaweed and shrimp tempura. The seaweed was fresh and the added shrimp tempura was one decent sized shrimp.I will definitely come back to try all the other udon bowls."

4/16/2016,20160416,3,4.24,I tried the uni udon but felt it was rather rich but lacking in taste. Perhaps this is just my personal taste preference. The service was great and the atmosphere was happy. Maybe next time I will try something else on the menu.Worth a second try next time I am in the area.

4/18/2016,20160418,4,4.24,"This Japanese udon restaurant is a really good noodle joint in Little Tokyo, LA. We found this restaurant after a Google search for ""handmade noodles,"" and out popped Marugame Monzo featured in the Los Angeles Times. Reading Jonathan Gold's take on this udon joint encouraged us to make the trip from San Diego up to Little Tokyo with my future in-laws. Located on East 1st Street, on the same street as the Japanese American National Museum with the giant Rubik's cube in front, we parked in the Japanese Village Shopping Center parking structure for $10 and walked over. We were lucky and only waited approximately 15 minutes for a seat at the bar. Staff were so friendly and helpful, evening offering a chair to my fiance's Dad, who had a swollen ankle at the time. Service is fast pace here, getting customers in and out. Despite the small space, the front row seats at the bar was exciting. Not only did we get to have a delicious dinner, but we also admired the show in front - the chef rolling and pounding dough to make fresh udon. During this visit, we ordered:Appetizers- Crispy Chicken Skin: my favorite appetizer, reminded me of pork rinds bathed in ponzu sauce. Would be great with beer or sake- Seafood Salad: Deliciously refreshing, the ponzu sauce is not heavy and generous amounts of cold shrimp and scallops- Braised Pork Belly: Tender and soft, just how I imagined- Clams with Japanese Garlic Sauce: They definitely splashed in some sake or rice wine. Really flavorful and freshUdon:- Creamy Uni Udon: Very simple, the broth was rich and creamy- Duck Udon: A little tough, but the broth was clear and savory- Braised Pork Belly Udon: Same Pork Belly as the appetizers, I found it kind of repetitive- Ikura Cold Udon: Great for a hot summer day and fun to assemble and mix your noodles together at your own liking. Thinking back, I realized that each bowl of udon does not have a lot of ingredients, perhaps it is Monzo's artistic way of placing the fresh udon as the center of attention and not excessively overpowering it like certain ramen dishes. The portions are not very big, so either order more food or go out for a snack afterwards. I would recommend this place if you are in the Little Toyko area!"

4/19/2016,20160419,5,4.24,This will always be my favorite udon place in LA! The wait goes by fast so don't be scared of the list. I always get the sea urchin (uni) udon and have someone else order the squid eggs (mentaiko). These two are my favorite off the menu!
4/24/2016,20160424,4,4.24,"Got here around 8pm on a Saturday night, and it was packed! Not a problem since we just signed in and walled across the street to check out all the cute shops :) We got in (~8:30pm) earlier than expected because the people who didn't show up were crossed off the list.The seating was quite cramped, and you can tell they tried to fit in as many in there as possible. It might be a problem to others if they're uncomfortable with sitting so close to other people's tables. There was a view of the kitchen where they make udon noodles, but due to my seating, I didn't get to see it ):My bf and I got the assorted tempura, fried chicken skin, miso carbonara, and sea urchin udon for a total of ~$44 including tax. A bit pricey for what you get. I was filled up well, but my bf was still hungry by the end of his meal.The food was good! I liked that my sea urchin udon was the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever tasted despite not being fettuccine alfredo. The sea urchin's consistency reminds me of that of balut egg.Service was quick, but our waiter kept checking his tablet at our table for 30 seconds between sentences. Weird, but understandable since it was a busy night.Overall, 4 stars. I would recommend this to someone already in the area, but I wouldn't go all the way here just for this."
4/24/2016,20160424,4,4.24,"Although I've seen many posts rave about the uni udon, I don't think the gratin udon gets any love it deserves. Personally, the uni udon didn't taste as uni-ee as it looks. But it does leave a fishy aftertaste. But overall, the food is worth a try because the udon is made perfectly."
4/24/2016,20160424,5,4.24,"Friend highly recommended coming here since they make fresh udon and the reviews were pretty good. I got the udon gratin and my friend got the mental squid butter udon. My chicken Gratin was so delicious all the cheese, chicken, and udon was like gods gift to me that meal, also the udon had that perfect bouncy texture that you want from your noodles . The staff is really nice and the wait wasn't to bad either just 30 minutes at most on a Saturday night. Definitely coming back here to try more udon."

4/25/2016,20160425,4,4.24,"Parking: street or structurePlace: small. You can watch them hand make the udon noodles. There's a small wait. About 15 mins. Service: service is pretty good. Friendly. Food: so we got the duck and the mentai butter squid. The duck soup is a clear brother with hints of roasted duck flavor. About 5 slices of duck meat. Duck was ok. Slightly overcooked. Harder to eat. The squid udon has about 5 pieces of squid meat. The broth taste like seafood. It also had little ball things like squid eggs? The squid meat was good quality. Udon noodles are longgggg. They're good thickness and have a good texture of chewiness. If I could just buy the noodles, it's great! Tempura fried soft boiled egg was unique. Soft boiled egg was boiled perfect. Tempura part is ok. It kinda just falls off the egg. I would probably just get the soft boiled egg. It's a one shot place. I tried it once and that's probably all I needed. Not coming back for anything negative. It just wasn't something I would come back or wait in line for."
4/26/2016,20160426,4,4.24,"Uni Udon (7/10) the freshly made udon was really pleasing to the taste buds. The soup base a on the thicker side which compliments the noodle and uni really well. Although the uni was cooked, it still has quite a fresh taste when served. However, the wait time was 2.5 hours on a Saturday which is pretty normal for this restaurant but to me, the wait time and food correlation was no quite matching up since 2.5 hour wait did not result in some 7 star food that made me shudder in joy. That aside, this is a good place to try out especially for any tourists."
4/27/2016,20160427,4,4.24,"Came here mid-day on a Sunday with the fiancé and his mom. We got seated right away at the bar in front of where they normally make the noodles. I was ready for some noodle making action, but we got super unlucky and no one made any noodles in front of us. I guess it wasn't the noodle making hour.I opted for the more traditional beef udon and my fiancé and his mom ordered the the au gratin udon pasta. I'd probably say that the beef udon here was the best I've had. The udon tasted fresh and had a perfect chew. The broth was also pretty perfect, not a sweet mess like I've had at some other Japanese restaurants. The beef was sliced thin, perfectly cooked, and tender. The au gratin with chicken tasted good,but I don't think I could've handled eating all of it. Personally, I think it would've been to heavy/creamy/rich for me. I think it's pretty cool that they offer italian/Japanese fusion dishes here for variety, but I think I personally would prefer the classic Japanese noodle dishes. I think my fiancé and his mom would've preferred my dish, since it wasn't as rich/heavy as their pasta dishes. Parking was of course a little difficult in this area, but we were able to find something in one of the parking structures nearby. Service was quick and friendly. Prices were reasonable. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a unique noodle experience. I don't think I can think of any other places that make udon fresh like at Marugame Monzo.Overall, we all enjoyed our experience here and will be back for more!"
4/27/2016,20160427,5,4.24,I got the udon soup. My husband got the tempura. This was the best udon I've ever had. The broth was very tasty as well. My husband's tempura was the best that he's ever had. Not the least bit oily. We can't wait to go here again.
4/28/2016,20160428,5,4.25,"This place will always be my udon place. I have been to a couple other ones in little tokyo and ktown but this place will always be my udon place. The noodles are fresh, they make the chewy noodles there and you can watch the men make the dough and cut it with their splicing machine through the clear window. Don't forget to order the soft-boiled egg, jumbo shrimp and scallions for your sides to make the dish even more fantastic! Next time I am here I will try a cold udon! But I always go back to my uni and mentaiko udon."
4/28/2016,20160428,4,4.24,I'm not a fan of udon but this place changed my taste buds to udon. The udon noodles are freshly made which makes a difference with the texture. Must try the sea urchin creme udon and curry udon which is not your typical udon flavor you see in other restaurants.
4/29/2016,20160429,3,4.24,"I'm a frequent visitor to the Little Tokyo area, yet I've never realized that Marugame monzo was located right next to the Daikokuya! The black little cloth sign is kind of tucked away behind daikokuya's bright yellow banner, so I can see how I missed it. Anyways.. A couple of hits and misses about this place. Both times I've been, I didn't have to wait for a spot and was seated right away. Parking can be rather difficult though as you either have to find a spot on the street, or park in a lot :(. The udon noodles here taste fresh and have a nice chew, but the soup lacks dimension in flavor. I do like the tempura here, but the pricing I felt was a little unfair. For example, one piece of fried squid costs the same as one piece of fried mushroom which is $1.50. How is a squid and one mushroom at the same price point? Also the popular miso carbonara udon while good, lacked any miso flavor. Good for those that prefer a heavy cream flavor, but not good for people like me that would have liked to see some miso flavor in the dish."
4/30/2016,20160430,5,4.24,"Marugame Monzo is located in Little Tokyo right next to Daikokuya! Parking is a bit difficult since the only options are either to street park or find pay to park in a lot. Anyways, I came here on a Friday night around 9:20 (they close at 10pm) and for a party of three we didn't get seated until about 9:45ish. The wait was approximately 15-20 minutes. It was indeed a Friday night so I expected there would be a wait anyways. After ordering, I did begin to watch the chefs as they hand made the udon here themselves keeping the udon fresh and chewy. I ordered the Miso Carbonara with a side of soft boiled egg. The udon itself was cooked to perfection but I really really enjoyed everything. There wasn't much miso flavor because the soup was creamy and rich in flavor. I'm drooling right now as I continue to type this because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I might be in love. I don't think I've ever had something so good... But like I said the soup is very heavy and creamy and if you're into light soup udon or miso flavored udon than this would not be for you. The carbonara is topped with bacon as well and although, I'm not a huge bacon fan I loved it with my udon. I thought it was just a great balance of flavors.My friend ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon even though he said he wasn't a big fan of Uni he said it was amazing as well. We also got the beef udon which seemed to be a bigger portion than the others but looked and tasted amazing as well. As a side order I did get a soft boiled egg but I didn't really enjoy that. I don't think it fit well with my creamy miso carbonara so if I came back I don't think I would order that. The price a bit more than any other ramen place but seeing as though the udon is made fresh and the quality of the udon is better than others I think the price is decent and suitable. The service here was very quick and friendly. It was my first time visiting Little Tokyo and trying Marugame but it will definitely not be my last."
4/30/2016,20160430,3,4.24,"Pretty dope concept. I like the fusion of italian/Japanese food, which is innovative and reflective of what LA is all about. That said, I am looking forward to explore the more traditional menu next time I go there, which would be my third time. I am personally a udon lover, but so not having tried any of their traditional udon dishes is a shortcoming on my part. Aside from that, I really enjoy watching the cook preparing the udon from scratch, and being able to watch this process in such an intimate setting. Great place, not necessarily blown away, but if you're looking for something different, I highly recommend it. I just don't think that it measure to the hype of something uniquely exclusive. It's just not on that level."
5/3/2016,20160503,4,4.24,"Summary: A little new-fangled udon shop in Little Tokyo that handmakes their own udon noodles! Go here if you want a rich, warm, and filling meal.**PRO TIP: get a tempura egg with your udon. Trust.**If you're lucky enough to grab a bar seat, you can enjoy your bowl of noodles while watching the chef make the udon noodles. In my experience, Marugame Monzo is busy like every other (good) place in Little Tokyo, but the wait is definitely much better than its neighbor Daikokuya.Marugame Monzo's specialty is its unique offerings, such as Mentai Squid Butter udon and Uni Cream udon. Beware that these specials are all on the heavier/richer side, so if you want something lighter, go for the regular udons. I personally really enjoyed the Mentai Squid Butter udon: it's light and flavorful at the same time, and there are lots of generous chunks of squid.Expect to pay a $15-$20 for your meal. I wouldn't come here with more than 5 people. It's a small place and it can get quite cramped."
5/4/2016,20160504,3,4.24,"Underwhelming. Small, super crowded space and not worth the wait. Doesn't live up to its hype. I had the uni udon & it was nothing to write home about. Lacked flavor and came with a tiny piece of uni so def. not worth the price tag. I've had much better. Also had the tempura - can't really mess that up. Unlikely to return with all the other choices around."
5/5/2016,20160505,4,4.24,"There was a short wait when I came here on a sunday night. Seated at the bar in front of the guy making the udon. was pretty interesting watching the three step process. the gf and i ordered uni udon and curry udon. along with a yuzu, basil and tomato salad... the salad was pretty good but I think I could have made it at home... the mozzerella i think was store bought and I have a hint I know what brand... the sauce is what made it stand out though. so good... The uni udon was not bad. though I don't think there was enough uni in it to justify the price... I probably wouldn't get it again. The soup wasn't too salty nor sweet. was perfect... I didn't realize the soup to noodle ratio would be like 2:1... otherwise I would have ordered double noodles... but it was too late oh well. The curry udon was okay. tasted like a curry ramen just with udon... not bad i guess. service was decent. might come back on a cold night."
5/5/2016,20160505,5,4.24,"I just decided to become their #1 fan!This place was AMAZING, I was completely sold over by their quality, quantity, service, and price! Maybe I am giving them too much credit, but I was blown away by my first visit, as I plan already my next visit!Very fun for the eye! you can watch your udon noodles being freshly made while you wait! Ordered:- UNI UDON (sea urchin) $15.95: i would say the cream sauce pasta with udon! with sea urchin (one of my favorites) This seemed to be the reoccuring photo on yelp, and i can totally understand why! because I am going to add my uni udon photo even though there are many already! - Shrimp Tempura Udon $11.95 : in addition to the uni udon, which seemed to be cream based, I wanted to order the regular soup based udon to balance our meal out. It tasted like any other great udon place! It wasn't phenomenal because it was a very traditional tasting udon, and whenever I crave udon and I'm in the area, I would definitely grab it! especially it being only $11.95 with two amazingly prepared shrimp tempura served on the side. - Fried Chicken $5.95 : I love Japanese fried chicken! it's just different than most! they serve it with curry powder and mayonaise, which might sound weird but its served on the side, so you can just eat the chicken itself (which might be a bit bland)"
5/5/2016,20160505,5,4.24,"Oh man, lives up to the hype. Everything we had here was so good. Really small place with limited seating!All the appetizers we had were delicious.All of the udon bowls were amazing!! Uni was so creamy with chunks of uni; carbonara was creamy with chunks of bacon; beef udon broth was SO clear and refreshing and the beef was so tender. Pork belly bowl was so good!! Thinly sliced pork belly slices packed with a ton of flavor. So good my friend ordered 2 lol. It is a small bowl. The specialty udons like the uni and carbonara are not available in double portions but the regular portion is already enough. My husband ordered a double beef udon which was a huge bowl. Great service and incredible food. Coming back!!"
5/5/2016,20160505,5,4.24,"Handmade udon~ tempura is really nice, queue even before its open"
5/5/2016,20160505,4,4.24,This is the only place I'd order udon noodles from. The udon is house made and delicious. I order the traditional udon noodle soup and my hunny usually orders the carbonara. The carbonara is delicious but very rich. The parking is a little difficult but if you get lucky you can find meter parking. Be prepared to wait if you come during peak lunch or dinner hours. This place is worth a try.
5/6/2016,20160506,5,4.24,"The udon is to die for, I just had a regular udon and added a poached egg. Broth wasn't too salty, nor were the noodles too chewy. Heard the uni udon is really yummy, but passed on it last time around since I thought it would've been too buttery."
5/7/2016,20160507,4,4.24,4.5 Probably the best udon I've eaten! I'm not too big of a fan of udon but this was really good. I got the chicken tempura udon.
5/8/2016,20160508,4,4.24,"Came here on a Saturday at 12:00pm, prime time lunch time. When we went to write our names down, we had 11 people in front of us however we were seated somewhat quickly. The servers here are very friendly and quick to serve. My cousin came here for the first time and had many questions about the menu, the guy who took our order was more than happy to help. I got the mentai squid butter udon, which is filled with seasoned cod roe. For lunch you can add a side rice dish for $3.00 or $4.00 more. I added the negitoro don for an additional $4.00. It's minced tuna with mayo and soy sauce on top. Supperr yummy! For two people who both ordered the udon and rice combo came out to be $35. Definitely would come back, maybe not during a lunch or dinner rush."
5/8/2016,20160508,5,4.24,"I've had this bookmarked for a while but finally had the chance to come when my girlfriends planned a dinner date. The wait was short for a Saturday night. I signed in at 6:30pm and our table for 3 was ready by 6:50. The service is fast and attentive which is why the wait was short. I had the beef udon, my friends ordered the squid butter udon and uni udon. We also shared 1 pork belly bowl and we all enjoyed our dinner! Food was delicious and the freshly made udon was perfect, not too chewy and thick! :)I will be back to try the cold udon because my other friends recommended them over the hot udon. Can't wait :)"
5/8/2016,20160508,5,4.25,Good food and service. My kids also enjoy their food and special baby utensils. Wait a little but worth it. Been here several times. It's always great!
5/9/2016,20160509,5,4.25,"I don't even like udon but this place is so good!I came about half an hour before their closing time. I was going to put down my name but saw a dark line drawn in after the last person on the list. The host came over and told me that that was the last group they intended on taking but still let me write my name down. So sweet!Miso Carbonara - Holy, this was amazinggg. The broth was creamy and the udon was cooked to perfection. It was topped with little bacon bits as well. It was the perfect option for me, not being a huge fan of Japanese food. And weirdly, I enjoyed the carbonara sauce more with udon over traditional spaghetti noodles.Pork Belly Bowl - I got this to share as an appetizer with my boyfriend and it was probably my favorite item that we ordered. The pork belly was thinly sliced and had a nice smoky flavor, I would definitely get it again.My boyfriend ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon which he really enjoyed as well. Everything was on point, including the service. Every server is very quick and friendly, and although we were there around closing they didn't make us feel rushed! Definitely a go to spot whenever I come visit Little Tokyo from now on."
5/9/2016,20160509,4,4.25,"Yummmm! Came here just before 6pm on a Friday and luckily there was no wait yet (hallelujah). I LOVE udon and love that they make their own here right in front of you. I ordered the uni cream udon and added a soft boiled egg. I also love uni but actually think the uni flavor was a little bit overpowered by the creamy sauce, which was delicious. The tempura soft boiled egg was cute, too. I tried my friend's pork belly udon, too -- also amazing. Definitely gonna come back to try the other types of udon, like the miso carbonara!"
5/9/2016,20160509,5,4.25,"Freshly made udon right in front of you. Explains the long line out on the street. I have no complaints -- everything was delicious. Ordered the (unique) and creamy porcini udon. Yum!!! For parents: no high chairs & probably won't have space for a stroller: very small establishment, but they have booster seats & we're very accommodating to our baby. Offered her tiny toddler bowls & spoons! So cute."
5/10/2016,20160510,5,4.25,"Uni Udon :) :) my favorite! Just went there last night and had the miso carbonara and it was just as good. I've always come between 530 and 630 pm and never had to wait for longer than 5 mins for a table ( -_- dont hate me! maybe I'm just lucky with this place) but parking has been a hit or miss. I've learned to park at the japanese village - after 3-4 hours, it's about $6. I figure no matter what, I'll have to pay for parking so I've never looked elsewhere. Service has always been great in the few times I've been here and the food has been spot on. No complaints here :) This place gets my recommendation"
5/11/2016,20160511,4,4.25,"We decided to do a food excursion via Metrolink on the weekend before Cinco de Mayo. We came through Metrolink and arrived at LA Union Station. We walked down to Little Tokyo (15 mins left of Union Station) to come to this udon place. We arrived by 11:15am and there was already a line waiting for the restaurant to open.The place would fit more people than it looks. We were able to get seated despite the fact there were 7 of us. The udon here is freshly made hence it's a bit chewy. I also like the soup base it's more salty rather than sweet like some other udon places. My order was Duck Nanban udon with a side of the pork belly rice bowl. My husband had Curry Udon with a side of the beef rice bowl. My daughter ate OK on the beef rice bowl. It's pretty fatty so I had to really trim off the fats otherwise she would keep spitting them out. My husband loved his curry udon. The curry is more like gravy style but very flavorful. I prefer my curry less gravy so I thought it was just OK to me.My Duck Nanban udon was good I wasn't ""wow"" by it. What wow me more was the side of the pork belly rice bowl. I'm guessing it's probably doused with salt and pepper with sesame oil and scallion sprinkles but yet it's so flavorful and super tasty. If I come here again, this is probably what I'm going to get."
5/11/2016,20160511,5,4.25,"Their udon is comparable to udon from Japan! The noodles taste amazing! It's definitely worth the wait in line. My favorite udon place is in Kyoto and this place is just as good. I highly recommend! Parking is tough in this area, I typically park in the Aiso parking structure across the street since it is not as expensive as the other parking structures in Little Tokyo. I typically get the Shrimp Tempura udon, but I have tried the beef udon and it is good also."
5/11/2016,20160511,1,4.24,"VERY DISAPPOINTEDI have never been so disappointed and embarrassed in my life!!So my husband and I have been coming to this restaurant for over 2 years now, always a good experience although the waiters make you feel rushed, with the exception of the latina waitress (very nice and cordial). I know it's a small place, but you don't have to be so ""rushy""... So a group of 5 of us brought our friend here to celebrate her bday and another friend's promotion; I brought a very small tiramisu cake to cut after. So we ordered, ate, and I brought the cake out and sang Happy b.day.....when all of a sudden a waitress comes over and say, you cannot have outside food here.  I was not aware that we could not bring outside food, well, it was not food, it was a celebration dessert!!! So I apologize and said I was not aware. 2 seconds later, another waiter comes over to the table and tell us, being extremely rude that we cannot have outside food in the restaurant, he stays standing, literally ""over"" ourr table and keeps saying the same thing over and over, my husband asks him, ""so do you want us to stop eating it so you can take it? "" to which he didn't responded, he kept saying that we couldn't have outside food...; my friend, the bday girl, also asked, ""so should we stop eating it? By this time I was shoving the cake in my mouth thinking he was going to pull the plate away....., but wait, 2 seconds later the same waitress that came the first time comes over and tells us the same thing..... To which I stopped, looked at her and replied...""I am sorry, I was not aware, I will never do it again"". I felt so bad, so embarrased, so humiliated.... And more so for my friend that it was her bday.A simple, ""Please be aware that our policy is no outside food, therefore, next time don't do so"" will do.They didn't have to be so rude, so unprofessional, specially when they depend on customers for their business. I know their food is good and they are always packed, but that doesn't give them the right to ruin people's celebrations and embarrass the shit out of you!!! It was totally uncalled for and simply ridiculous. We all felt so bad.... It totally ruined our night and definitely my friend's bday.I love their noodles, but I don't think I will be coming back. Too bad. They definitely need a big improvement in customer service!!!!!!"
5/13/2016,20160513,4,4.24,"This is my first time eating Japanese-Style Udon! Since I'm Korean, I always tried the basic Korean-Style Udon (which I was never a huge fan of). After trying out this place I never knew how different it could be!Came here on a Saturday afternoon during rush lunch hour which wasn't the smartest thing to do.. But since we had time to kill we were down to wait an hour. What makes this place unique is that at the bar, there's a clear glass that displays the chef making Udon Noodles from scratch. It makes the atmosphere more authentic and entertaining. The inside is pretty small but we were lucky enough to sit at bar right in front of the chef! Could not have asked for a better seat.Negitoro Bowl - It is a small bowl that we just shared as an appetizer. It was okay. Wished they had more toro and less mayo.Curry Udon - Good Udon! A little bit salty. The broth is not as thick as you think. It is pretty liquidy but it's not watered down. If you are a fan of Curry then I recommend this to you!Sea Urchin Cream Udon - BOMB! To be honest.. I ordered the Curry Udon but I couldn't get this off my mind. It is pretty creamy but that's the point right? I lowkey wanted to switch bowls with my girlfriend but I resisted myself hahaOverall, I would come here again if I have time to kill. I would probably want try to out other types of udon they have just out of curiosity. But NONETHELESS, It is a pretty cool place to have lunch."
5/13/2016,20160513,5,4.24,"Deep in the heart of Little Tokyo, there lies a small creaky shop-- an udonya. It's often difficult to find, occluded by the line of tourists standing outside Daikokuya, in the midst of this generational ramen craze. Look closely and you'll see a quality not often seen by the masses. Inside Marugame Monzo is a glass that serves to replace a closed door. This glass is meant to earn udon the transparent respect that has always deserved. As dough is tossed, spun, and stretched into elegantly formed rectangular udon noodles, one can finally appreciate the neglected older brother of ramen, that is, udon noodles.Their signature dishes: the uni cream udon and squid butter udon speak for themselves. This rare combination of delectable seafood delights create an immaculate pairing with the hot udon. But it's important to explore the menu in its entirety. Donburis and side items are well worth it in this Kagawan Japanese institution.Ultimately, whether you identify as an udon amateur or an udon connoisseur, Marugame Monzo brings a considerable appreciation to the table. Ramen will phase in and out, but udon will always earn the charming respect as the older, wiser, brother."
5/15/2016,20160515,5,4.25,There are no words that can describe exactly how awesome the sea urchin udon was!! Awesome is an understatement!! It's a definite must try!! My Hunnie hates sea urchin and he even loved it!
5/16/2016,20160516,4,4.25,"The wait for Marugame Monzo averages 45 minutes to an hour, but that wait is indeed well worth the food. To start off, I got some appetizers which included the clams and seared beef. The clams were delicious but has little to no meat. They were even referred to as ""anorexic clams"" by another customer to show the extent of how small these clams were. The beef was lightly seared and reminded me of a thicker cut carpaccio. The peppercorn on top gives it a nice touch of flavor.Now onto the main dish I had ordered, the Uni (Sea Urchin) Udon. This dish comes in a huge bowl, but don't let the bowl deceive you. The broth is a very creamy based broth and reminds me of pasta, and yet it goes well with the udon. There is very little broth, but the flavor is so rich that you don't need much to flavor the entire dish. The udon has a good chewy texture, and together with the broth creates the perfect udon bowl. It's topped with salmon roe, and I wouldn't suggest any other topping as the flavor is seasoned to perfection. Make sure to try this signature dish, although it's a little on the pricey side ($15)."
5/16/2016,20160516,5,4.25,"I had the sea urchin creamy udon. Very interesting, i enjoyed it! Like a uni pasta but the noodles were def udon noodles. Lol I have to say the texture of the udon noodles were pretty awesome. We sat infront of where they made the noodles. Quite cool lol if I ever go back I'll probably try the mential squid butter udon. And we ordered a side order of an fried egg. And i thought it was a sunny side up egg but it was literally a ""fried"" egg lol"
5/18/2016,20160518,4,4.25,"Hand-pulled udon noodles? YES.We came here on a Friday night right when they opened and walked right in - no wait. We ordered the beef tataki, beef udon, shrimp tempura udon, and kakiage.Their udon noodles taste fresh and have a nice chewiness, but they're not too dense. The broth was tasty and had flavor although it was slightly too salty for me. The beef in my beef udon had good flavor also. Overall, their udon was not too heavy and delicious!The beef tataki was decent, and the kakiage was surprisingly tasty. But the udon noodles are what makes this place unique!!"
5/18/2016,20160518,5,4.25,"This is the best udon I've ever had, and sadly everyone else has figured that out too because the line is crazy long. Last time I went to visit, we got there maybe half an hour after opening on Saturday and the restaurant was already fully seated so we had to wait for a pretty long time before we were able to get seated. Luckily though Fugetsu Do is just down the street. Nothing like some pre-udon mochi right? :P I always stick with the cold udon with poached egg because I find it really refreshing, especially with the greated daikon radish. I tried some of my friend's uni udon too though and it also tasted really amazing and creamy. I don't think you can really go wrong here. If you can, try to get seats by the bar too! It's mesmerizing watching them make the udon. Ugh. My stomach is growling now just thinking about the udon."
5/19/2016,20160519,5,4.25,"I know this place is famous for its Uni Ramen, but tbh I love the Udon Cheese Gratin the best!!! The Uni Ramen is good, but definitely not filling, so I don't leave satisfied. The Udon Cheese Gratin takes about 10 min to come out, but if you love Italian cheesy goodness, I would order this. I can't tell you how amazing the sauce, the cheese, and the tempura egg is mixed together in my mouth. I wasn't that big of a fan of the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. Maybe it's because I love cheesiness and it obviously wasn't. The Miso Carbonara was 10/10 as well! It's basically Carbonara Pasta with Udon, which is tastier in my opinion because the Udon offers a chewy bonus to an otherwise ordinary pasta dish.Whatever you get, make sure to get the tempura fried egg!!!!!"
5/19/2016,20160519,5,4.25,Personally favored squid butter udon over uni udon!
5/20/2016,20160520,5,4.25,- homemade udon noodles you can watch being made at the bar seating- recc: shrimp tempura udon. One of the best shrimp tempura I've had. $12ish- large portions - got seated right away on a tues evening.- street parking (if u can find it)
5/21/2016,20160521,4,4.25,"I really enjoyed their noodles. I had their Miso Carbonara Udon and it was delicious. I was happy it was not as rich as it looked, probably because they also use Miso as their base which helps cut some of the richness of the creme. It's all about the texture of their noodles that they make in-house. If you're lucky enough you can be at the counter and watch them make it too."
5/21/2016,20160521,4,4.25,Hard to find handmade noodles. We love watching the udon being made at the bar. I know they're famous for the uni pasta but I found it a bit too salty. We usually get one kake udon so we can really appreciate the handmade quality of the noodles. The staff seem so nice and friendly even though the restaurant is always very busy.
5/22/2016,20160522,4,4.25,"The last time I came to Marugame Monozo was in 2014, it was also my first time trying the restaurant. Recently, I came back to this place because my partner was craving their signature udon.Warning: lines can be ridiculously long so be ready to wait for over an hour. It's probably one of the most recognizable restaurants in Little Tokyo because of the amount of people waiting to eat.We waited for almost an hour and were seated at the bar which is amazing because you get to see them make the noodles from scratch! My partner got the squid udon while I decided to go with sea urchin udon with a side of kaikage. I remember that the first time I went here I was a bit disappointed b/c the food felt a little bland aka it needed more seasoning.This time around, the flavors were delicious and were seasoned properly to reinforce the subtle notes of flavor of the creamy uni. The kaikage was okay, it was a little sweet for my taste but went well with the creamy udon sauce. I wished there were a tab bit more noodles in their serving b/c my noodles ran out but I still had a good amount of sauce and uni. Definitely, would recommend this place to friends but provide a caveat of the long wait I do think that an hour wait would be my max wait time, I don't think a longer wait is justifiable. The ambiance is great b/c the people who come here really enjoy their food. Service was pretty good."
5/22/2016,20160522,4,4.25,"Very cozy Japanese place great food,, easy parking across the street, helpful & attentive staff."
5/22/2016,20160522,5,4.25,"This place is too good! Service is good, fast. Place is clean (much cleaner than Daikokuya beside it). Everything we tried on their menu was very tasty. Very impressive. Already told family and friends about it - it's tempting to keep this good thing to myself - but nah! People should know and let Marugame do their thing and keep churning the unbelievable udon and everything else."
5/23/2016,20160523,5,4.25,"Yippee! So excited to have finally tried this place. Waiting about 25 min on a Saturday afternoon for an early dinner and it was packed! I ordered the Uni Udon and my friend had the Beef Udon, and both were delish. I think the beef would be my go to if I went back. I'd probably add a few extra goodies to the already broth. The udon noodles were cooked perfectly and was a cross between soft pillowy and chewy heaven. They have a very basic drink menu. We got a bottle of the yuzu thing they have on the first page of their menu. It was a little too sweet to my liking. Big props to the gentleman who was rolling out fresh udon. He was on a roll!"
5/24/2016,20160524,5,4.25,"No words can describe how delicious this place. This is probably my third time coming here. I get excited thinking about even coming to this place.Parking: street parking around little tokyo, it gets really hard to find parking sometimes so be prepared to walk a few blocks.Service: Waiters are nice and very attentive!Food: The uni udon is so creamy! I love the flavors and they all really go well together. I forgot the name of the udon I got this time but it was damn cheesy! If you're a cheese lover like I am you'll def enjoy this dish! I also always order an extra fried egg as well to add into my udon. Overall: 10/10 would come again"
5/25/2016,20160525,4,4.25,"I'm going to be honest guys, this place is a total gimmick but it's well worth it. You wait an absurdly long time just to get in. Once inside, the place is so small and cramped. The gimmick here is that the udon noodles are made fresh in front of you. However, after taking that first bite, it makes everything well worth it! The soups/sauces the udon noodles come with are so savory and delicious. Parking can be a pain, I suggest parking at The Japanese Village and walking over. It's literally across the street."
5/27/2016,20160527,5,4.25,"Love this place. Food is Great! I tried the Mentai, Carbonara and Sea Orchin on their specialty, all were delicious. Service is great. Been here four times, Two times I brought my niece and my nephew. Server were very accomodating....Definitely come back and recommended this place to my family and friends."
5/27/2016,20160527,5,4.25,"Handmade udon noodles is a must try! The udon was delish, and I will definitely come back for more!"
5/27/2016,20160527,4,4.25,Just landed in LA and decided to get some yummy Uni Udon. No wait. Sat at the bar. Ordered beef salad and scallop salad as appetizers. Super fresh ingredients. Friendly staff.
5/27/2016,20160527,5,4.25,"Wow! That's all I can say! The friendliest most accommodating service EVER, even late at night near closing. And their udon soup was so good. I'll be returning as much as I can as a thank-you. Best!"

I got the kakigage (onion ball) but I was surprised to find it full of shrimp. I will come back though!!! Just for the plain noodles!!"
5/29/2016,20160529,5,4.25,"I love this place. I always wished I live closer. The wait tends to be pretty long but my tip is to go about 30 minutes before they open. Anyhow.... The food food food. After coming here a few times, I've decided my fav is the mentai squid butter udon! It's flavorful, light, and the squid is amazingly soft. Their sea urchin uni cream udon is the most popular choice. Don't get me wrong, I love that too but it's gets a bit heavy after the first half. They put a generous amount of uni in the dish. During lunch, they have a special where you can add on a rice bowl with your udon purchase for $3-4. It's a great deal cus their negitoro bowl is deliciousssss. The ikura bowl is more disappointing. There's barely any ikura or salmon roe in there. Now the toppings, definitely give the soft boiled egg and shrimp tempuras a try! If you like to watch people work, this is THE place to be cus the bar area allows you to see the chef in action, making their handmade udon!"

5/29/2016,20160529,4,4.25,"We arrived right before open to avoid wait; it was well worth it. The service was lot quicker and nicer comparing to full opacity. We ordered Nori (boiled egg), Miso Carbonara Udon, and their uni udon. Creamy as usual except the miso...not so miso, but rather too cheesy for those who can't have too much of those, and we don't like the beconish type; felt like having one of those white souce from can food except much creamier taste. Or else I'd give it a 5 star since i love the egg and the uni; the quality is very consistent."
5/29/2016,20160529,3,4.25,I like this place the setup and service is good I tried the beef with the red pepper that was good and it was made quickly so I'll be going back to it again

I'll admit, I was attracted to try this place out because of the fact that they make their own noodles. But honestly, the udon was not special. I've had plenty of udon and this was no different. The place has their advertisement (handmade noodles) down thus the lines. I would not come back for my udon fixes."

5/31/2016,20160531,4,4.25,"My boyfriend and I arrived at 10:45 because I was warned that there would be a very long line when they open at 11:30 AM. Multiple family members recommended this restaurant so we made it our first stop of the day. This restaurant is unique because you can't find their broth anywhere else. The seat urchin was is very flavorful but my only complaint is the diced sea urchin. I feel like they should have tasted so the customers can actually taste the Uni. The miso carbonara tasted like Italian pasta lol. Picture yourself in a Italian restaurant eating penne and carbonara. Now picture the carbonara as a more viscous broth and replace the penne with udon and bacon. This is exactly what to expect for miso carbonara. Since the broth is Rich, they don't add a lot of toppings. Every shrimp tempura and soft-boiled egg is available for an additional charge. The broth is filling for a petite individual, but men may need an additional rice bowl be full. I would recommend this place to any choice because you can't find this broth anywhere else."

6/3/2016,20160603,4,4.25,"The udon noodles are so fresh, soft yet firm, and delicious! I got the beef udon soup and the broth was a little too sweet for my taste. Also tasted oddly heavy to me for an udon broth, but my BF said it was fine to him. I really dislike heavy broths, so to me, this was a heavier tasting light broth that was not my fav I guess. Also, you get a ton of beef!I also got a double portion for $2 more which I would not suggest unless you're like dying from hunger. I'd say get an appetizer and a normal sized udon; or don't get any appetizer and get a double portion udon. You definitely don't need anything to accompany the double portion! The sides are pretty cheap, all under $1.50. Chili oil was only like $.50! PS: don't be fooled by the long waiting list! My name was like 10th on the list and I got called in like less than 20 minutes later. Overall, I'd return but maybe try a different kind of meat because maybe the beef made my soup taste a little heavier. Udon is my favorite type of noodle and the udon here is perhaps like my second favorite udon ever!"
6/4/2016,20160604,3,4.25,"I was excited to try this place out since my friend suggested it and since my favorite udon spot is Marukame in Waikiki, who also in-house hand makes their own noodles.  I was stoked to find a place like that in L.A.I've been on a search for a bowl of udon that can compare... Thus, this place was suggested...The noodles were good, but the broth was bland... I love my food hot, so when I saw our bowls of udon arriving with steam rising, I was expecting it to be hot.  Right?  Wrong.  It was very lukewarm or to my expectations, cold... I still don't get it [scratched head], how does loads of steam rise, and it's not even hot?"
6/5/2016,20160605,5,4.25,"Since I saw so many posts on Instagram, I decided to give this place a try. I came here on a Wednesday afternoon, right at the moment when they opened at 5pm. I was expecting a wait out in the front of the restaurant, but there was only a party of two. Since there was no wait, we were seated immediately and we looked over the menu. My friends and I all ordered udon from the signature dishes portion of the menu. I got the mentai cream butter udon, and let me tell you.... I was on cloud nine. Anyways, the mentai cream butter udon is a cream based dish, with shrimp and squid, with of course udon, topped with teeny tiny squid eggs. I absolutely loved my dish. It was really filling. The cream wasn't too heavy, however I wouldn't drink it as a soup. But the udon noodles were perfect. Since they are homemade and cooked to order in the restaurant, you can certainly tell by the taste and texture. The shrimp and squid were a good amount, if anything, more than I would expect/ ask for. And the fish egg just tied everything together. My friends also enjoyed their dishes, the mentai squid butter and the udon gratin. The service was excellent and a plus for having such a well kept restroom! I like how they have a full length mirror and a really cool sink. But that's besides the point of this review, haha. But I can't wait to be back to try more bowls of udon!"
6/6/2016,20160606,4,4.25,"Went with 6 other friends and they let us know when our table was ready. Some of the best service I've seen. They were very polite and seemed to want to help us, especially since most of us hadn't been there. I ordered the udon gratin and it was pretty heavy but I'm currently eating it as leftovers and it's really good still. The boyf got a shrimp tempura udon and the shrimps were giant. I also got a soft boiled egg and it had tempura around it. We also had beef Tatake and the caprese and normally I hate undercooked anything but the tatake was great. I ate many of the caprese cheeses as well. Would come back."
6/6/2016,20160606,3,4.25,"Lucky enough to not wait too long. Ordered the Uni Udon. The cream was absolutely delicious. The uni was small and there weren't many pieces. I'd rather have fresh uni than cooked uni because of the texture. Good food. However the not worth the price (and if I had to wait, definitely not worth the time)."
6/7/2016,20160607,5,4.25,"If you want to go to this place for lunch, make sure you arrive at least 15 minutes before its opening time so you don't have to wait too long! Last 2 times I've been there, there was a line outside with people waiting for it to open. Even on a working/regular Monday!!Highly recommend the Mentai Squid Udon and requesting to sit at the bar if you can!!"
6/7/2016,20160607,4,4.25,Came here for lunch with my cousins and was sat right away. Service was fast. I ordered the Uni udon and was not disappointed! The sauce was very creamy and was loaded with uni! my only complaint would be the wooden spoon (ladle is more like it) that is served with the bowl. It was a bit awkward trying to eat with it. I literally felt like I was eating with a ladle.
6/8/2016,20160608,5,4.25,"We came here on a Wednesday for dinner. We had to wait for about 30 minutes with 4-5 parties ahead of us. We both ordered the Uni Udon and it was amazing. There was a lot of flavor in the broth and the handmade udon had the right texture and consistency. The uni pieces were a bit small, but there were a lot of small pieces in the dish. It may not look like a lot when it gets to the table, but once we finished the bowl, we were full and good for the night."
6/8/2016,20160608,4,4.25,Ate the sea urchin udon & beef tataki appetizer and now I taste salt. My lips are parched like I been swimmin in the ocean. 3 hours later & no amount of beer can cure these parched lips... I loved it but I think I shouldn't have drank all the sea urchin sauce. Was I supposed to do that? The flower was delicious too
6/10/2016,20160610,4,4.25,"I absolutely love noodles and pasta, especially slightly thicker ones. When I heard there was a place in Little Tokyo in Downtown Los Angeles that makes homemade udon noodles, I knew I had to pay a visit. The queue to have these scrumptious noodles is usually pretty ridiculous. People tend to swap between Daikokuya next door and Marugame Monzo, whichever noodle shop would take them first. I've been for both lunch and dinner and the lunch rush isn't as bad as the dinner rush. The menu is pretty much the same, but the lunch menu lacks one of my favorite appetizers: the beef tataki. The restaurant isn't anything fancy. It's actually simple in fact. When you arrive, you put your name down on a clipboard and wait patiently to be called to be seated. If you look directly to the end of the restaurant, a clear window is seen where you can witness the chefs making the udon by hand. NEGITORO BOWL (UDON COMBO + $4.00): Fatty Tuna Chopped with Green Onions Over Rice. Sweet Sauce with Mayo. At first glance, I was kinda turned off with all the mayo that was on the dish, but once you mixed everything together, the dish came together nicely. It was like a spicy tuna roll deconstructed, but tasted way better.KAMAAGE UDON ($7.95): Hot Udon from ""Kama"" boll pot, hot broth dipping style. I thoroughly enjoyed my udon. I loved the dipping broth that came with it. It's very similar to a dipping sauce for soba. It wasn't overly salty and was seasoned nicely. The dish comes with ginger, tempura flakes, green onion and radish for you to season your broth to your liking. I finished it like a pro and probably could've ate another!MY FAVORITE DISH. SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON ($15.95): Hand Crushed Sea Urchin Cream Sauce Udon, Topped with Ikura (salmon egg). This dish is rich and delicious. The uni isn't overwhelming, just having notes of uni coating your palate with each bite. The cream sauce is not too thick and coats the fresh udon well. The ikura adds a nice salty flavor to the dish. It's definitely not a diet dish by any means. Who cares though? It's yummy, creamy and oh so tasty!Overall, Marugame Monzo is a great alternative to the very popular ramen. There are many options where you can order something light with a clear broth or something more satisfying with a cream sauce. The wait times can be annoying but I seriously believe it's worth the wait. Lunch and dinner menus vary slightly, but you can still get the same udon noodles at both hours. On a side note: they only open for lunch from 11:30am-2:30pm."
6/10/2016,20160610,5,4.25,"Very good udon. The udon was freshly made and the prices are reasonable for a rather large portion. Although my friends and I had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, service was lightning fast. After I ordered, I went to the restroom and came back out with my food already served."
6/12/2016,20160612,4,4.25,"This place wasn't on my radar whatsoever, but apparently it is my friend's favorite place to go to in Little Tokyo. And considering she is from overseas, not about to object about her choice of dinner location. Yes, even if one of my favorite ramen places is literally next door.Although everyone here seems to be all about either the sea urchin cream udon or the miso carbonara udon, I was in the mood for something a little less lighter and a little more authentic.So the duck nanban udon was my choice. You can tell the difference when they make their own noodles (and yes, you can see them make them in the kitchen if you sit close enough to it), because their noodles are FANTASTIC and had the right amount of texture. Broth was light yet flavorful. The duck itself was cooked very well and they keep enough skin on each slice for just that extra bit of flavor. Kinda wish there were a few more duck slices, but that's about my only gripe. Overall, really good.One more note: STRONGLY suggest the beef tataki. It is freaking amazing."
6/13/2016,20160613,5,4.25,"Very, very good udon. I had the duck udon. The noodles were perfectly chewy and flavorful, and the duck meat was delicious as well. If you can, try to get seated at the counter, as you can watch them make noodles."
6/14/2016,20160614,4,4.25,"This place was pretty good. For the appetizer, my party ordered the Beef Tataki which was delicious! As for the udon itself, I tried a variety of different broths because we had a party of 6 and all let each other taste their broths but my order specifically was the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. It was tasty but after eating most of it I was getting tired of it. The service was lacking a little here. They weren't very nice and didn't refill the waters when we ran out. It's a small place so there's not really an excuse for not being attentive considering they had a good amount of servers present. Would be 3 stars but because of the food, I just can't justify that so 4 stars it is."
6/15/2016,20160615,4,4.25,I thought this place was closed when I arrived because the walls were kind of tinted black and there was a banner over the entrance door. But I liked the hole-in-the-wall vibe. So I came here for one thing and one thing only: the sea urchin udon ($15). I had an amazing experience with uni pasta before so I was very excited to try this.The udon came out pretty quickly and my friend and I split this. I'm glad we did because the creaminess would have been a little too much if I had eaten the whole thing. It was still really good - it wasn't too thick or creamy. You can tell the noodles are handmade because they are so soft and fresh. I also loved the bits of uni pieces because it added a nice chew factor. I asked for chili oil to spice up the flavor but it was an extra 25 cents or something. I stuck with the spicy seasoning they had on the table instead haha. Don't wear fancy clothes when coming here because the noodles are really long and you might splash yourself with a few drops of the broth.
6/17/2016,20160617,5,4.25,"Probably the best udon I've had in LA. They specialize in fresh homemade udon in both traditional and modern styles.I came in for lunch and got their Mad Tiger special ($12) with an added Beef Bowl on the side ($3). Although it fills up quickly, if you get there right as it opens, there's no wait to worry about.The beef bowl was good but unspectacular. It's not something you'd want to order on its own, but it makes a decent addition to a bowl of udon.The udon here is terrific. The noodles are the perfect consistency and are bouncy without being chewy or starchy. The flavorings are excellent as well. The Mad Tiger is a cold udon special for the summer and comes with spicy ground pork, Chinese chives, green onion, nori, katsuobushi (bonito flakes), a soft-boiled egg, a tsuyu-type broth to pour on, and grated ginger on the side. It's a bit like tantanmen, with a great mix of Japanese flavors with Chinese spices. The Chinese chives add a bit of crunch and texture, and all the flavors meld together to make a dish that's complex, a bit spicy, savory yet refreshing, and packed with umami. Absolutely perfect.The Uni Udon here is a favorite as well. It's packed with sea urchin taste and creamy without being heavy. I also recommend the Duck Nanbankan Udon, which is a more traditional udon broth with duck and green onion.Basically, if you want good udon in Little Tokyo, Marugame Monzo is the obvious choice. The prices are normal, the quality is top-tier, and the only downside is not being able to decide which of the awesome options you want to try. Also the long wait times."
6/17/2016,20160617,3,4.25,"I like what this place does with making udon unique yet still providing the traditional style. Noodles are skillfully-made, not too soft but still have a bite to them. The soft-boiled tempura egg is amazing.My only complaint is in their inability to follow through on accommodating requests for preparation without meat. I have been here twice in the past week, and asked if they can make a dish without chicken. They said yes, but if they said that they couldn't because a sauce is pre-made or whatever the reason may be I totally would have understood and ordered something else.Unfortunately the first time I went my first dish had chicken in it, which I didn't realize until I bit into it. The replacement was fine and delicious. I figured that was just a fluke, and my second visit would be different. Got the same dish, and upon almost being finished with it noticed there were a few pieces of chicken in it. Just disappointing, it's a busy place and they are getting orders out quickly but I would like it if the attention to detail was a bit better. At least the server noticed that and asked me if they put chicken in it, which I appreciated that she realized that and apologized. Service is great here. I'd still go back but probably order another dish."
6/18/2016,20160618,5,4.25,"Udon made from scratch, doesn't get better than that. The udon is made fresh right in front of you. It's mesmerizing to watch while you wait for your order..I ordered the Udon Gratin which is a white sauce base with ALOT of cheese. I explained this to my boyfriend as the fettuccine Alfredo... But with udon. Guess you can call it Udon Alfredo.. Lol. It's layered with some onions on the bottle followed by chunks of chicken and udon with the white sauce and topped with a tremendous amount of cheese. It was really good but got really heavy towards the end.My boyfriend ordered the sea urchin udon. His was very creamy as well and surprisingly, not as ""seafoody"" tasting as I imagined. I thought it'll be a bite of the sea every bite because of the uni.. But I barely tasted the uni rather the very rich and creamy soup. The thing to applaud for is the udon. It is so fresh and springy! I would come back and back again for the fresh udon if it wasn't so far for me. It can also get pricey too, about $10-16 for a bowl of udon, but the quality of the udon is very much worth it."
6/19/2016,20160619,4,4.25,"-- 37/100 reviews for 2016 --Woah, what? I thought I've written a review for Marugame Monzo but I guess I haven't! Staffs are all friendly but finding parking can be pretty difficult. I usually park in the Japanese Village Plaza and by the time I leave, I usually pay like $10 for parking. If you can find street parking or parking for cheaper, hats off to you! Some people park at the plaza with Starbucks and Yogurtland, not sure how much it cost.When coming on a busy night, go in, write your name down and stand outside to wait to be called. DON'T CROWD UP IN THE DOORWAY because the place is pretty small.Wait can go anywhere from 20mins to over an hour depending on your party size. The udon are made fresh to order and they even have a chef making and cutting the udon right in front of the window. Mentai Squid Butter Udon (5/5)This is my all-time favorite udon because I absolutely love cod roe and this dish is absolutely filled with cod roe! The broth is not thick so it doesn't require a rice bowl to balance it out. They give a few pieces of squid but it is pretty filling.Uni Cream Udon (5/5)My boyfriend's all-time favorite with its rich and creamy flavors and pieces of uni. Goes well with a rich bowl once you're done with the udon to finish the rest of the thick and creamy broth. Negitoro Fatty Tuna Bowl (5/5)One of the best rice bowls. A scoop of fatty tuna over a bowl of rice covered with mayo and green onions. I normally don't like tuna but I really enjoy this dish. Worth the try!Tempura Soft-Boiled Egg (4/5)If you're a fan of runny egg, this one is a must try! One you break the egg, you will be amazed by the runny-ness of the egg. The only downside of this is that the tempura itself has no flavor so you should dip it in your udon and then eat it."
6/20/2016,20160620,4,4.25,"The one and UNI place I will eat udon at! Lol. Jokes aside, this place was so good! I went here for a late dinner with my bf right before they closed so we were able to skip a long wait time. We ordered the uni udon, miso carbonara, and beef tataki. The miso carbonara got tiring after two or three bites because the sauce was heavy. The beef tataki was underwhelming as well. Ours was cooked longer than it should have. Pictures on Yelp show that it's more of a medium rare but ours was more on the medium side which made it taste really dry. Maybe it's just cause it was the end of the day? BUT, the uni udon did not disappoint. It was the best udon I've ever eaten! I've had a really bad experience with udon in the past and have refused to eat it since. After giving this place a try, I'm hooked. The noodles were handmade and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of chewiness. And the broth was so creamy and flavorful but not overly done. YUM! Service was quick and friendly, and the food came out fast too. I'll be back!"
6/24/2016,20160624,4,4.25,"Awesome place! It's a little cramped in the space, but the food is great. You can watch the udon being made from scratch if you sit in front of the window to the kitchen. I had never tried cold udon before, and I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Cold Bukkake Beef Udon: ($11.95) Stringy pieces of beef, with green onion, daikon radish and udon noodles. Super good! Had lots of flavor and still felt light. The noodles were perfect.Pork Belly Rice Bowl: ($5.45) A simple favorite. Cooked pieces of pork belly with green onion and rice. Simple and tasty. Overall, a nice place next to the Japanese American National Museum, Daikokuya, and other Little Tokyo favorites. Reasonable prices and great food!"
6/25/2016,20160625,4,4.25,"I was so excited to finally try this place !! We came on Thursday around 8 and there was still a good 15 minute wait for a table of 3! This place is super popular so definitely expect a wait.As other yelpers mentioned, this place is known for their fresh, hand-made udon. I looooovedddd the udon! It tasted slightly chewy which I prefer and I could really taste the freshness !!We ordered the squid butter udon (4/5)- a little lighter dish compared to the uni udon. Had good size pieces of squid and the broth was delish!!! Curry udon- (3.5/5)- came with a huuuuge bowl of curry sauce! Definitely order this if you like curry, however I can see this dish getting tiring if it's the only thing you eat. Good thing we all swapped off and shared !Uni udon-(4.5/5)-I didn't order this but I got to try some and it was my favorite !! you have to be in the mood to eat creamy noodles! The broth is pretty creamy but also flavorful! I think that getting two dishes and sharing is the best because I tend to get tired of eating the same thing lol! But I would definitely come back as long as the wait is not ridiculous! I would avoid this place on the weekend haha"
6/26/2016,20160626,5,4.25,This place def lives up to the hype about the UNI PASTA !!!!!! I never even had Uni before and I know it's an acquired taste from what ppl say. So I was def hesitant but life is too short to not live. I went for it and let me tell you. It was one of the best dishes I ever had in my life. I couldn't stop craving Uni pasta for the next several days. I think it might be a problem ? My gf that was w me also tried their other signature dish mentai squid butter and that was also very good. Tip: arrive early like an hour after they open you should be good because after that def expect to wait a good 30 min or more. Happy tummy.
6/26/2016,20160626,4,4.25,"Tasty pretty good but, there is limited seats. The udon is not that filling but, you don't want to be a fat boy."
6/27/2016,20160627,4,4.25,"No lines on the weekdays during lunch. Parking is a pain, but if you park in the garage across the street, you can buy something at the plaza for validation.I came here with my coworker and was seated immediately. I ordered the Uni Udon, which was savory and very much exceeded my expectations. They could've put more Uni in the bowl, but the amount of udon was juuuust right. Unfortunately, my coworker didn't feel the same. He ordered a bowl of udon + rice bowl and was still hungry after, so he ordered ANOTHER bowl of udon. For such a large bowl, Marugame could definitely fit a larger portion size."
6/27/2016,20160627,4,4.25,"Not much of an udon eater, but I do love noodles and these were definitely worth the wait. Came on a Sunday around 6:30 and waited about 45 minutes, this is expected as the place is fairly small. I ordered the Uni Cream Udon with tempura soft-boiled eggs. The creamy broth mixed with the fresh homemade udon and uni was delicious. I probably could have at another bowl in the same sitting. Would definitely come back again next time I'm in town!"
6/27/2016,20160627,1,4.25,"I love this place (especially the uni udon) and have been a regular patron for a long time BUT the guys working the front tonight (Asian guy with slicked hair) was annoying AF. We first walked in and said our party consisted of 4 adults + 2 babies. He asked if we were all here. I said yes and he asked the same question again. Maybe because he didn't believe me(?). Then he offered us a table with 4 chairs... We have 6 human beings in our party. Why TF would you give us 4 chairs? Then he said we would have to wait. So I went outside with the rest of my party to wait. Wait wasn't too long. This guys started to wave his finger to call us in while not even making an attempt to come to the door. Having a 3 YO and a 6 MO babies the wife asked if we can take the booth. And he said we'd have to wait more... Then we asked if we can take the booth that was just on the other side and his response was a simple ""no, you have to wait more"". It was a simple request with a simple solution. Then he ""started to point fingers"" towards me saying how I declined the first offer at that same booth... But when he offered the first time there were 4 seats and then he table next to us left which opened up 2 more seats! Maybe my math is bad but 4+2=6. Or he was just having a bad day and bleeding out of his genitalia. WTF?! I thought. I left the party there to dine without me. I wasn't that hungry anyway. I'M NEVER GOING BACK. Train your employees right if you want my money ever again."
6/27/2016,20160627,5,4.25,The udon was amazing. This place came with more normal udon as well as heavier options with pasta and cheese. Everything was to die for. I had the pork udon which was nothing short of incredible. The flavor of each ingredient was perfectly balanced and everything mixed together well
6/28/2016,20160628,5,4.25,"I've been here many times.And I've never been disappointed them. Simply all foods are bomb, Friendly servers with great service. I'd definitely come back again!!!!!!!"
6/29/2016,20160629,4,4.25,"Damn you Monzo!! How am i ever gunna eat that frozen supermarket Udon now!? Its probably a 5 star joint, maybe even 7, but ill wait for one more experience before i take it to that level.Honestly, the thought crossed my mind: maybe i should write a (selfish) one star review and say its soooo terrible, in hopes that there wouldnt be a line down the block next time i go! But that aint me, im not gunna politic on some nonsense for my own attempt at selfish gain! Although it appears this is the norm within the current world we live in! Ya never gunna see Seven on Fakebook, Instagraham Cracker or any of that 'look at me' self-absorbed selfie BS. Where you will, undoubtedly, see ya boy Seven is at the Marugame Monzo, time and time again! Open one up in SD!!"
7/5/2016,20160705,5,4.25,"One of my favorite places in little tokyo. This place almost always has a wait, but it's so worth it. The uni cream udon is so good.. and I don't even like uni. I'm usually very put off by the texture of uni by itself, so I will never eat it sushi-style but this dish is just amazing. The tempura soft boiled egg is also a great touch.I tried a few other udons there and they're all pretty good, but I think the uni cream is definitely the best. Their rice bowls are decent too and I love how they make the udon right in front of you."
7/7/2016,20160707,4,4.25,"3.5/5 starsCame here on a saturday night ~9pm & waited only about 20minutes - not bad considering how busy next door Daikokuya wasFOOD: -uni cream udon: wow I was expecting more. The cream of the pasta & the uni was way too creamy, which is what I expected. BUT the creamy sauce and uni, which is normally already creamy, was just not complementing at all. I expected the flavors to go well together, but the creamy sauce was just too much that I couldn't taste my uni. I would say give it a try though, as it appears to be one of the more popular dishes-curry udon with soft boiled tempura egg: now this was delicious!!! Japanese curry, which is on the sweeter side, definitely hit the spot for me. recommend trying!! Overall, the udon noodles are very delicious here & would come back to try other dishes if I was craving udon."
7/7/2016,20160707,5,4.25,"Came here because this place has been on one of my friend's to-do list for three years. My friends waited outside for a table for over half an hour... I arrived late, so I only had to wait about five minutes. (Muahaha...) There's always a line for this place, so be prepared to wait. Once we finally got in....I was in love. I love uni, so naturally I went for the UNI CREAM UDON. My friend ordered the MENTAI SQUID BUTTER UDON.I thought both were amazing dishes. The udon noodles were perfect!! Not too soft, and perfectly chewy. The udon noodles were just really on point. The Uni Cream, I thought really lived up to the hype. I could taste the uni flavor in the cream. There were bits of cooked uni in the sauce. The cooked uni bits themselves didn't hold much of the uni taste. The texture of the uni bits was grainy and dry. Even so, I enjoyed eating the tiny bits of uni in the sauce. Mentai Squid Butter I thought was also very good. My friend thought it was a little too salty, which it definitely IS salty... but it is still very delicious. My group of friends split our noodles family-style, so the saltiness was bearable. If I had to eat the whole dish by myself, perhaps I would find it a little overwhelming. BUT, since I shared, I thought it was the perfect amount. The cod roe bits were so flavorful. I can't imagine coming back here and having to choose between Uni Cream or Mentai Squid Butter. I would always have to get both from now on. Another friend ordered the pork belly rice... and that was really yummy too!! Everything here is so good! This place does udon right!! Totally ruins udon for me if I eat it anywhere else. Damnit. That's the risk you run when you experience EXCELLENCE. Everything else will be a little ""meh""."
7/9/2016,20160709,5,4.25,Wow!!! Oh my god.This place is seriously making my mouth water again just thinking about it. We came here with friends for a total group of 4 on a Thursday night. Unfortunately I didn't factor in that Anime Expo was going on so it was more packed than usual. It took us about 1.5 hours to get seated but it was definitely worth it. I ordered the beef udon while my boyfriend got the plain and my other friend got another one I forgot.There is seriously something magical about the broth here. It's so light yet hearty at the same time and packed full of flavor and yet so simple. They also make the udon fresh here so it's got an amazing chewy consistency that's superrrrrr good.Definitely definitely come here.
7/9/2016,20160709,5,4.25,"One of my favorite restaurants in Little Tokyo.  I've tried the shrimp tempura udon, the sea urchin udon, and the mentai squid butter udon. The mentai squid butter udon is my favorite. Very creamy and light.  Always craving for this dish.  The sea urchin was great, as well.  Definitely the best restaurant for udon I've ever been to."
7/10/2016,20160710,3,4.25,"Place was small, but expected since it's little Tokyo. The udon noodles are good I mean you can't beat anything hand made, but the broth was in my opinion to bland I had to add pepper or salt to make it even bolder. I'm not a udon expert by any means I just feel like the broth was a let down, I ordered the Duck Udon, but to me it tasted like pork. for five people and three beers we paid $88, not worth it. Maybe for some this place was great but I'll just save up and try the real thing once I land in Japan."
7/11/2016,20160711,5,4.25,"Marugame Monzo is the best in the udon game! While the decadent signature udon bowls like the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and Carbonara Udon get all the hype, the simple ones are the tastiest! I've had the Curry (pretty rich in flavor), Wakame (a little too plain), a veggie one (can't remember the name but it's awesomely delicious!) as well as the cold udon. While I wish the portion were larger, the cold udon was a knock out! The udon was obviously super fresh but the cold enhanced the chewy goodness even more. Really simple, light & delicious! I do always have to get a side of tempura egg though. While it's a tough call, I think Marugame is better TANAKAYA in Tustin (but of course Marugame doesn't have soba)."
7/11/2016,20160711,4,4.25,"I came around 1pm on a Monday and there wasn't a long wait. I got soft boiled egg tempura, baby octopus tempura and sea urchin cream udon. I was really impressed by the udon and soft boiled egg tempura. The sea urchin flavor was subtle yet flavorful. I think even people who wouldn't normally enjoy sea urchin would be able to like this. The noodles are made here I believe and they had a pretty good texture. My bff had the duck udon with a beef bowl. He was really satisfied with his food as well. I had a taste of his duck broth and it tasted pretty refreshing. It wasn't anything too salty and had good flavors to it. I can't wait to return to this place in the future."
7/11/2016,20160711,3,4.25,Fresh made Udon...... Food was ok. I had the clams udon but I try my friends sea urchin udon and that was really good. A little pricey.
7/13/2016,20160713,5,4.25,I like udon.... this place has some of the more extensive udon menus in the Los Angeles Area.  I would also say that this is one of the best places for udon in LIttle Tokyo.  The place that is better is in Lomita in South Bay (udon is even better IMHO).  Parking is tough here. I'd bite the bullet and park valet at Miyako ($8) during lunch hour.
7/13/2016,20160713,5,4.25,Best udon in town. period. Its also super cool to watch them make the udon noodles fresh right there. Add the tempura egg to your udon!
7/14/2016,20160714,5,4.25,"Monzo is amazing! My girlfriend and I came here a Thursday for dinner and we were seated immediately. I ended up ordering the gratin while my gf got the sea urchin noodles and we also got tempura eggs.The gratin was amazing! It was suprisingly light, but very creamy. The udon noodles were addicting! Biting into these noodles was very satisfying. The sea urchin noodles were pretty good too. However, its hard to taste the sea urchin unless you eat the actually sea urchin at the bottom if the bowl. Probably not worth the hefty price of $15. The tempura soft boiled eggs probably doesn't taste as good as it looks but it is still pretty good. There is a light crisp around the egg and a gooey inside. If I ever find myself back in LA, this is definitely the place I'll come back to see again."
7/15/2016,20160715,5,4.25,"Worth every single hype! I tried the mentai butter squid as well as their uni udon. Legit! They don't allow Takeout orders, but if you order it there and pretend not to finish it, they'll gladly provide a To-go cup for you."
7/17/2016,20160717,5,4.25,"Monzo is nothing short of amazing. There are few places I would drive an hour for dinner, and this is one of them. Inside this small but quaint restaurant, you'll immediately notice these highly trained chefs hand crafting these delicious udon noodles behind a wall of glass. The precision and passion these chefs put into making these noodles is a spectacle in itself. This restaurant boasts a wide array of different noodles, from traditional udon dishes to modern takes on classics. From cold dipping noodles to cheese baked udon, there's guaranteed a dish for everyone. Personally, I ordered the sea urchin uni udon, and was definitely not disappointed. The broth was the perfect consistency, and each bite boasted the freshness of the sea urchin. The service is top-notch; they were quick, courteous, and very welcoming. The only recommendation I would give is to come early! The place is very popular and the wait can get torturously long."
7/18/2016,20160718,4,4.25,"UNI UDON!Yup, that's what I said! This place specializes in all types of udon madness which is super fun. As soon as I saw the uni udon, I knew that's what I was getting. It's so rich and buttery....mmm! It was good but very rich. Prepare to be super full. I also felt like the uni on top wasn't super fresh. The noodles were good but not hand-shaven.I also tried some of the rice bowl with crispy seafood on top. It's not what I would expect at all. The seafood is kind of spiralized and then fried. It's pretty cool and tasty!I really like the variety of udon here. The wait is a little long but they are super nice and I would come back!"
7/18/2016,20160718,5,4.25,"Mmmmmm their uni udon is just to die for. I've ordered it twice now, and it was even better the second time! I have to get their uni udon every time I come to Los Angeles. Their udon is so soft, it's amazing. If Daikokuya ever has too long of a line, just shimmy over to Muragame Monzo (they open 30 minutes later).This place gets a line fast, so either get here early or be prepared to wait."
7/19/2016,20160719,3,4.25,"+/- THE FOODI was so stoked to come here after hearing great reviews about this place. The waitress recommended the uni cream udon and a bunch of friends and I decided to try it. It definitely didn't wow us and it reminded us of heavy alfredo sauce. My friend's squid butter tasted better than the uni cream udon. Despite the fact that the udon is freshly made, we couldn't' really tell the difference between fresh udon and plain ol' packaged udon. The only plus was that the udon was pretty filling. My friend also ordered the pork belly to share and that was pretty delicious. The pork belly cubes are pretty large and they give quite a lot of meat."
7/19/2016,20160719,5,4.25,"This is my absolute favorite udon spot. I love that you have the option of seeing the noodles made right in front of your very eyes. This spot is rather small in size, but the ambiance is really nice and traditional. The noodles are perfectly springy and chewy, and all the different dishes I've tried are to die for!Cold Udon w Soft Boiled Egg:I love cold udon, and this was no exception! The broth was light but still full of flavor. It paired really nicely with the creamy runny egg, and the katsuobushi that's place on top. I love that the broth comes on the side so you can gradually pour it in as you go.Oroshi Soy Sauce Udon:I love the soy sauce base in this broth. The saltiness contrasts really well with the slightly sweet daikon that's generously grated into the bowl. Sea Urchin Cream Udon:This one one of the dishes they're more well known for. The sauce is quite heavy but so satisfying. The rich sauce is full of uni flavor, and I love ordering a little bit of uni on the side to go into the dish. This dish is definitely not guilt-free, must definitely a must try!Pork Belly Rice Bowl:This rice bowl is simple but sooo good. The pieces of meat are so juicy and fatty. There's plenty of green onion placed on top to make this don really refreshing. Even though it's a pretty decadent bowl, I feel like I can keep on eating it. Ugh so good."
7/19/2016,20160719,1,4.25,Terrible restaurant made me wait for an hour their stupid rule for people together is stupid they should change that stupid rule to let the people come in. The other time when they thought we didn't know Japanese monzo waitress's was wrong letting his friends come in very easily. This restaurant may be the best but for those who want come may not. Don't ever come to this restraint cause it was terrible not letting us in to sit.
7/22/2016,20160722,4,4.25,"Handmade udon noodles were delicious and made right in front of you. We came in before diner rush so we were seated fast. Staff was very friendly and attentive, food came out fast. We had udon noodles with shrimp tempura and the beef tataki appetizer both were good but you can't go wrong with the noodles."
7/23/2016,20160723,5,4.25,"This is absolutely my favorite udon spot. It's freshly made and you can see inside the window, the portion seems small at first but since udon noodles are so thick, it's very filling. The udon gratin was absolutely delicious. It was very creamy and cheesy and came with cubed chicken breast pieces. The squid butter one came with pieces of squid which were so tender and delicious. It was definitely worth eating this in 102° weather."
7/23/2016,20160723,5,4.25,"Definitely one of the best udon places in town. Worth the wait! Be there early if you can, their uni udon, tempura egg and tempura shrimp is a must have..... Soooooooo delicious, can't wait to come back again."
7/26/2016,20160726,4,4.25,"I love Marugame Monzo. I love it so much! Why? Because I LOVE UDON!! I've been to Marugame Monzo numerous times with different people. Each time I go, I like it THAT much more! The interior of the restaurant it nice...but cramped. It's nothing fancy but you don't go there to be fancy...you go there to eat AMAZING in house UDON noodles. In the back right corner of the restaurant you see the people making noodles by hand and everything is delicious. Everyone raves about the uni udon...it's not for me. My absolute favorite dish there is the clam udon. I don't remember the exact name but it's clean has tons of clams and is just so darn good. One of my visits I went there with 3 other friends and we all tried different signature udon dishes and still...the clam udon was my favorite. I think moving forward that is my go to dish when I eat there. The last time I went, I ordered the Duck Nanban Udon which was good. The duck was flavorful and tender, the broth as usual was spot on. It was just at least to me...not as great as the clam udon. ...now I want udon..."
7/26/2016,20160726,5,4.25,The wait was so... Long... On a Saturday at 2pm but it was SO WORTH IT! I loved loved the uni udon. Definitely get that over everything else. Next time I'll have to try a few of the other udons too!
7/26/2016,20160726,4,4.25,"It's a long wait and there's not really anywhere great to stand, but man is the food delicious. I can't say I disliked anything I tried of the Uni pasta, Carbonara, Beef Udon Soup, and Seafood Tomato Pasta, but the best dish was most certainly the Squid Butter Pasta. I'd love to take my family here maybe on a weekend for an early lunch so we won't have to wait in line."
7/27/2016,20160727,5,4.25,"This is the real traditional Japanese kitchen. I grabbed the udon soup with seaweed and it was delicious. Next time I want to try the creamy soup. It looks amazing. There is always line, so I suggest to go there in the weekdays. Weekend it's crazy."
7/30/2016,20160730,5,4.25,"Can I say this place is my favorite restaurant in Little Tokyo? Noodles are handmade and literally the chewiest best asian noodles I've ever had in my life. It's that delicious. The portions are also huge and filling, especially with the cream based sauces (the spoons are also giant, so in the photos, the servings look tiny). Of course, had the uni udon--which was so flavorful, had lots of pieces of fresh, delicious uni. The cream is thick and rich, flavored just right, and even though it's very heavy, you don't get tired of it. But you want to finish this bowl quick, before the noodles get too overcooked. Each minute is a chip off the perfect fresh chewy udon texture. (Also, for those lactose intolerant--the hit wasn't that bad! Halfway through, I totally forgot my lactaid and then took one. Usually if I did this for froyo or ice cream, I'd be a goner for the rest of the day. But even immediately after or hours later, completely fine!)Cause it's also summer, also tried the Cold Udon with jidori poached egg. It comes with grated daikon (radish), bonito flakes, soy sauce, and the most perfect oozing poached egg ever. What an interesting meal! I've never had cold udon before, but it's absolutely delicious. The texture of the udon holds definitely better as it doesn't get overcooked fast and stays chewy. So good. Also, this place is for everyone. Whether you're getting an udon dish around $7 or go fancy and get the $15 uni udon, you'll still get premium noodles with fresh ingredients.The waits are SO LONG, like usually 45 minutes for either lunch or dinner on a weekend."
7/30/2016,20160730,5,4.25,This place is known for their very fresh and handmade udon. They are also very unique because they have creamy pasta udon in addition to their hot and cold udon. I have tried their gratin udon as well as the curry udon and both did not disappoint. The udon is very al dente and simply tastes amazing. The one thing you must be warned about the hot and cold udon is that it is not the most filling dish but the creamy udon are very filling.
7/30/2016,20160730,5,4.25,Best Udon in LA. There's so many options i never know which to get but i'm never disappointed. I just wish the wait wasn't so long.
8/1/2016,20160801,4,4.25,"Considering the 15 min wait first time I was here, this time's 1.75 hour wait in the scorching LA heat was a LITTLE uncool. But you know that stupid mindset ""oh I've been here for half an hour already, might as well wait a little longer"", yea...I hate that.We were so hungry during our wait we went to snack on the many wonders Little Tokyo had to offer, so we were actually pretty full by the time we were seated. Having ordered the mentaiko udon last time, I knew I had to get the Uni udon. The noodles were chewy, sauce was rich, but had way less uni than I thought. Given the slightly higher price, I might just get the mentaiko again next time because the umami was the same in both dishes. Overall, nothing to complain about the food! Just wish the wait time was a little more bearable :( I'll be back for the for the other menu items next time (but cream is always the death of me, we'll see)."
8/1/2016,20160801,4,4.25,"I'm a very gassy person and normally release a relentless burp or... ventilate from other orifices, if you will--when food is good. And I'll tell you, I pumped out like a Snorlax after 7 Razz Berries after trying there Curry Udon (served with pork regular and green onions). Being from the Bay Area, there's very limited amounts of self-made udon along with curry udon. But this place was absolutely refreshing; the curry wasn't gravy like most places, thus making it more closer to broth and allowing the flavors to be more noticeable. The udons are as expected: soft and bountiful. The atmosphere is relaxed, dim lighting that illuminates each table as music ranging from deep house to j-pop plays in the background. Parking is somewhat a nuisance as the parking garages are across the street. But if you're lucky to find street parking, it makes this place fairly accessible. If you're looking to find closely authentic Japanese food with portions that could feed two and variety from extremely casual with deep house to j-pop music in the background. to rice, I ask of you to check this place out."
8/2/2016,20160802,5,4.25,"Their udon is as good as the hype.I got the uni udon and cold udon w/ soft boiled egg. Both were amazing. At first bite, I thought they were just like any other udon. It's udon. It's just noodle in a bowl. For a moment, I felt silly for waiting in line and paying 15 bucks for a small bowl of noodles.Then it got better. Better and better with every bite. When I was done w/ mine, I was licking the bowl clean. Granted, their portion is on a smaller side and I was pretty hungry. Don't expect a full on American portion here. So when I was finished with my food, I felt like I wanted just few more bites to feel more satisfied. Maybe that's why so many people order a side of rice bowl or appetizers.Uni udon could be more uni-er (I love uni), but it's still very good. Even if uni wasn't part of the ingredients, this dish would've still been one of the better cream sauce noodle dish. But I think I loved the regular udon more. It had tenkasu, katsuobushi, and other usual udon toppings. It was absolutely delicious. I came here on a Saturday few minutes before noon, and waited only10 minutes. Food came out very quickly and we were out of there in less than 30 minutes. This place is definitely a must try if you love udon or noodles in general. If you don't, don't come here. There are enough people in the line."
8/3/2016,20160803,4,4.25,"When I found out that Marugame Monzo serves hand-pulled udon, I had to drag my friends here while we were visiting LA.One of my friends and I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. The other friend ordered the Miso Carbonara Udon. I also got an order of Kakiage to go with my udon. I enjoyed everything that I ordered. The noodles were long and chewy and the broth wasn't too salty. The Kakiage was nicely fried; I loved the shrimp and scallop pieces in it. My friend who also ordered the Mentai wasn't a big fan of it. She said it was too fishy for her. To be honest, the smell and taste of it can be overwhelming if you're not used to eating fish. I got a chance to try my friend's Miso Carbonara and it tasted exactly as you would expect Carbonara pasta to taste. There's nothing special about it.If I get the chance to visit LA again, I will definitely come back here!"
8/3/2016,20160803,5,4.25,"Marugame is always a treat every time I come. And I've been coming back regularly for the past two years! The only drawback is wait times since it's such a small restaurant...You'll always see people hanging around Marugame Monzo and Daikokuya right next door. There's also several parking garage options around Little Tokyo that are a pretty short walk away.This time we got here 40 minutes before closing and on a Tuesday night, so we waited less than 10 minutes before we were seated at the bar area. I like being able to sit there and watch them make the udon noodles! And I can't believe I have to say this, but since I've been charged at other places around here the hot tea is free! Thanks for staying true Monzo My friend wasn't all too hungry, so we decided to split one of her favorites: the seafood tomato cream udon. I also ordered a negitoro bowl, or fatty tuna with a sweeter sauce and mayo + green onion and nori on top. Though there wasn't a lot of fish, the size of the bowl in comparison was perfect. I devoured it all way before our udon even came to the table. I had never had the tomato cream udon before, but it was just as delicious as Monzo's standard. The sauce was creamy and tangy and complemented the seafood nicely, and wasn't too heavy to top it all off! The seafood wasn't of the best quality, but the real champion here were the perfectly chewy udon noodles and expertly made sauce. Trust me, order any udon and you really can't go wrong! The service is always friendly and attentive here, even despite being extremely busy at all times. Sometimes it can be hard to flag them down, which wasn't the case in this particular experience. The prices are all fair for such delicious, quality food. See you next time, Monzo!"
8/5/2016,20160805,5,4.25,"Merugame Monzo is without any doubt, one of the most beautiful udon I've ever had in life. Highly known for their creative take on Japanese udon; the Sea Urchin Cream! Almost crazy, but yes, it was surprisingly delicious. The subtle hint of uni swimming in a creamy sauce compliments the chewiness of the hand-made udon. Absolutely a rare beauty.I noticed that a lot of people ordered the jidori tempura eggs and I must say, it was another one-of-a-kind item that they offer: crunchy on the outside and runny goodness on the inside #textureplay. The tempura shrimp was quite spectacular as well; huge and crispy we ordered the second round.Merugame Monzo is certainly not disappointing in any way, from the homiest space to the beautiful food, supported by friendly service. This is unquestionably one of the most memorable and best meals I've had in Los Angeles and I can't wait to be back!"
8/5/2016,20160805,4,4.25,"Ambience: 4/5Cost: 5/5Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Sea Urchin Cream Udon, yummooooo! The udon is made right in front of you, carefully crafted by master udon chefs and beautifully cooked by the chefs for just the right bite. The sauce was so creamy and decadent, and my bowl was infused with seafood flavour via the large pieces of uni throughout the dish. It's definitely on the heavier side and it would be nice if they had a half portion so that I could have tried other things as the rest of the menu looked great."
8/5/2016,20160805,4,4.25,Mentai squid butter udon was pretty good. Luckily we only had a 15 minute wait. But they seriously need some better AC in there. Or maybe they don't want people lingering around.
8/6/2016,20160806,4,4.25,"Get there before it opens. Arrived on a Tuesday at 11:15am & there was already a line forming. By the time we got in at 11:30, the place was filled! We sat at the counter to watch the noodle-making. Very entertaining! All 3 of us ordered the same thing - curry udon. Don't know why we didn't try other dishes. We also ordered the shrimp and squid tempura. Totally worth it! Service was friendly, but rushed during their busy lunch hour.The noodle bowl is big enough for 2! Their house made udon was tasty and very filling. The curry was ""ok"" and included thin pieces of beef (like you'd find at beef bowl). Next time, I'm ordering something that will allow me to really taste the noodles. Price is moderate. For the amount of food you get, it's totally worth it. A lot of people ordered the creamy udon dishes. Looked good, but can't do all that cream. Street/meter parking or park in structure across street & get validation from a purchase at the plaza.  I would definitely return to try other dishes."

8/7/2016,20160807,4,4.25,"This was our second time at Marugame Monzo. We arrived 15min before opening time on Sunday and there was already a line. There's usually a wait for this popular udon shop, but you can just put your name down and browse around Little Tokyo while you wait.WHAT WE ORDERED:* Shrimp Tempura Udon - broth was tasty, udon noodles were chewy, but could be chewier.* Side of Soft-Boiled Egg - egg yolk was runny as it should be, but not a big fan of the tempura batter around the egg.* Extra Jumbo Shrimp - the order comes with 2 shrimp tempura, but they're so crispy and delicious, we had to order another one to make it 3!OVERALL:Not as good as the udon we've had in Japan, but probably the best place for udon that we've tried in CA. There's a lot of hype over their signature udon dishes, especially the Sea Urchin Cream Udon, but I've haven't gotten myself to try that yet because it looks a little too heavy with the cream. Almost every other table ordered it, so maybe I'm missing out. The classic udon dishes are pretty satisfying and delicious though, so don't rule them out. Their udon is handmade and you can watch the master udon maker going away at it behind a display window, which adds to the experience."
8/7/2016,20160807,4,4.25,"Small location but was able to get seated within 5 mins. We were a party of 3 and probably got it right before the dinner rush. Ordered 3 udons and the negitoro don. The noodles were perfectly al dente and fresh! My favorite was the sea urchin udon. Creamy and rich, but not overpowering or too heavy. It doesn't scream sea urchin, but it was still great flavor. I wish they weren't so skimpy on the roe that comes with it. The tomato seafood I didn't care for. It jus reminded me too much of an Italian pasta. It had plenty of seafood in it though. The butter squid was also really good. It was the closest to a regular bowl of udon noodle soup. It had a nice seafood broth. And I LOVED the negitoro....a little too saucy, but the toro was fresh and plentiful mmmm"

8/8/2016,20160808,4,4.25,Great traditional Japanese noodle or fusion noodle like udon carbonara. Must also order the crispy fried chicken skin.
8/8/2016,20160808,5,4.25,"Can I just say if dreams had a taste, it would be this Miso Carbonara?The udon is super soft and handmade right in the shop. There's clear glass by the bar seating area if you want to see the chefs hand make these wonderful noodles! The bacon in the dish is cooked perfectly for the dish, still pink with some softness/tenderness to it. I love crispy bacon but it would definitely not complement the noodles! The miso is very subtle and adds some depth to the dish since egg and cheese can taste kind of plain. The sauce is thick enough to cling onto the noodles but light enough to not be too heavy. I don't feel bad at all after eating it. I've been here twice, and if I lived in LA, I think I would definitely go once a week. The only problem would be having to decide on trying new dishes or getting the carbonara!"

Boy, was it worth the wait.The restaurant is small, tables are cramped together, and it's definitely warm inside (my boyfriend was sweating a good deal by the time he was done eating). Service was quick but friendly.Their duck nanban udon was also tasty, albeit a little bare looking. Their uni cream udon, however? To. Die. For. I cannot express how delicious it was along with the freshly made udon noodles. If you ever get the chance to come here, definitely give it a go!"

If you're lucky enough to sit at the counter, one of their chefs will knead, roll, and cut fresh batches of udon right before your eyes! It's very interesting--almost therapeutic--to watch them work.While I love ramen, sometimes I prefer the elegant minimalism of udon. The sea urchin cream udon at Marugame Monzo is heavenly. If you're feeling something a little bit lighter, then I recommend the duck udon, which is bathed in a dashi-based broth. Whatever you decide, it'll be good, and I think you'll become an udon convert if you come here too!"

8/13/2016,20160813,5,4.25,"This udon far exceeded my expectations!!! My sis dragged us here to try their hand-pulled udon made fresh on the premises, which sounded good until I heard about the Italian twist. She had been dying to try the gratin udon, an udon dish filled with cheese (sounded weird to me too) and chicken, that lived up to her high expectations. My bro ordered the miso carbonara udon which he thoroughly enjoyed as well. I'm not as adventurous of an eater and didn't have much of an appetite that day so I went for the shrimp tempura udon that was a safer, but nonetheless amazing, choice! The noodles were cooked to perfection (you can really taste the freshness) and the broth was very flavorful. I really loved how there weren't a bunch of veggies infiltrating my soup, unlike with most udon bowls at other restaurants which give you more veggies than noodles (y'all know what I'm talking about). The shrimp tempura pieces that accompanied my bowl of udon were just the icing on this delicious udon cake (sounds gross but I promise it was exactly the opposite). This udon is definitely worth traveling for; it's the best I've ever had! Try arriving before opening to line up outside bc it does fill up fast during the lunch rush."
8/13/2016,20160813,5,4.25,"Love this place!!! You can see them make udon right front of you. We came 4 people. Everyone order something different. I get to try it all. I have to say the food here is outstanding! I ordered Uni Udon. It was good, really really good actually, creamy, full of uni. Although next time I would order udon with fresh broth so I can taste the freshest of the udon. Our waiting time was 45 mins but there was a little Tokyo mall across street from there. We was able to walked around, listen to live music-karaoke style, many little cute shops, lots of people dress up with Japanese costume walking around...it was entertaining."

There is a bar area and just a regular dining area. At the bar area, you can actually see the chefs hand making the udon noodles in front of you behind the glass window, which is pretty cool. The dining area is cramped and it was warm, but it was worth it for the food.For the food, it just melts in your mouth. I ordered the shrimp tempura udon and seriously, it's so good. It comes with 2 shrimp tempura on the side and the udon itself consists of a miso base with tempura crumbs and green onions. I also tried the uni udon with a creamy base and it's equally as delicious. This is one of the best udon that I have ever tried and if you are in the area, definitely try this place."

I would highly recommend both!The wait was kind of long, especially since we came at 3pm and the wait was still 30 minutes. Luckily, it was definitely worth the wait!I'd definitely come back multiple times if it wasn't so far, but if I ever find myself in Little Tokyo, I'll definitely put my name on the list before exploring the rest of Little Tokyo."
8/16/2016,20160816,5,4.25,"It has become a tradition that Saturday brunch after Friday partying will consist of udon. We saw reviews that this place has handmade udon and thought we should give it a try. The restaurant itself is very small, and if your name is close to being called, you should wait inside. The kitchen looks as if it takes 1/3 of their building, and you can see where they make the udon from anywhere you sit in the restaurant.The staff are friendly and efficient. I had the mentai squid butter udon. AMAZING. The soup was almost entirely made up of roe and was very tasty. The udon noodles are very long and a bit difficult to get a good grip on, but I enjoyed the fresh texture. I am definitely bringing more friends here!"
8/17/2016,20160817,4,4.25,"Ordered the plum shisho bukkake cold udon. So oishii desuI wasn't that hungry coming in so it was a bit difficult for me to finish; the portions are fairly generous and price is not bad at all. I'd recommend not adding ginger because ginger sucks.They handmade the noodles and they are very chewy (jjjol git jjjol git - in Korean, lol). Service was pretty good and the water tasted better than other tap water that we've been served recently in the city."
8/17/2016,20160817,3,4.25,"Had high expectations since everyone seems to rave about it plus I always see a line forming outside whenever I drive by. Anyways, dropped by on a Sunday around 2:00PM. Waited for about 20 minutes.On to the food...Roast Duck - Dry and well done. Not a fan.Shishamo Tempura - Smelt fish tempura. Over fried to a point where some parts were crunchy.Beef Tataki - It was okay. Nothing specialMentai Squid Butter Udon - Way too much butter. Could not finish most of it. Noodles were overdone but the flavor was okay minus the butter.Cold Plum Shiso Bukkake Udon - Had a taste of my friends. Refreshing and great flavor. Noodles were wonderful unlike mine.As for service, it was okay except for the fact that 2 female servers were talking about how it was super hot in the restaurant/kitchen and they were both sweating. One went as far as explaining that her entire back and thighs were wet with sweat in Japanese. Not something I want to hear while I'm eating."
8/17/2016,20160817,4,4.25,Always a pleasure coming to this place. The only draw back is that is crowded and there is a wait to be seated but the food is always great. My favorite recommendation is the mentai cream udon. It's simply tasty and fresh. Special my if you like seafood.
8/17/2016,20160817,4,4.25,"The miso carbonara udon is SO good. The pork belly/bacon is perfectly cooked and flavors the sauce/soup just right - it's a nice blend of creamy, smoky and salty. This is the only thing I get so I can't comment on the other items. Portions are decently sized and the udon is prepared fresh in the store, which you can see through the kitchen window."
8/18/2016,20160818,4,4.25,"They only do udon, and they do it well. Small space, but it turned over pretty quickly during lunch - we were seated after only a few minutes wait on a weekday. We tried 1 traditional and 1 ""specialty"" - hot udon w/duck, and the miso carbonara udon. The carbonara was just as rich and indulgent as you would expect, and I liked the creativity (figures that noodles and sauce would translate well from Italian to Japanese!) The duck was super simple - noodles and duck slices - but well executed. They also have cold udon selections, which we didn't have a chance to try. Perfect for summer!Definitely order a few tempura sides to eat with your udon - the soft boiled egg is pretty awesome."
8/18/2016,20160818,5,4.25,It's a must go place to eat for udong. It's fresh made and made right in front of you. Their food is very very nice. Be warned this place fills up fast and there's usually a line to get in.
8/19/2016,20160819,5,4.25,Great food... The noodles are so good! I had the beef udon which were delicious. The proportions were huge but very satisfying. Great and quick service as well. The space is small so just try to get cozy.
8/19/2016,20160819,4,4.25,"We ordered 'Miso carbonara udon' for lunch. The place is moderate in size and the place seems to be quite popular in neighbourhood. The food arrived sooner than we expected and the chef really cooked us up delicious udon! We also ordered some sides as recommended by them, and it made a good combo with udon."
8/21/2016,20160821,5,4.25,"FOR FIRST TIMERS (like me today) NOTE: This place is easy to miss, but it's next to Daikokuya. Both restaurants are really busy so the lines look like it's just one long line, plus Marugame Monzo's tent is a dark color and not as noticeable. Even though there is a line outside, don't forget to go put your name on the waiting list inside!The wait isn't as long as it seems and the service is extremely quick. I tried one of their most popular udons, the uni one! It was very good, but after eating half of it, the creaminess of it got to me and I was full already. It's topped with a few uni pieces and salmon roe, which complemented the sauce very well. The noodles were just PERFECT. I also tried the pork belly rice bowl, which was really good! The rice was the best rice I've ever had and the pork belly had a simple salty taste to it. It was different! I recommend it since it's only an additional $3 with the udon.Can't wait to come back to try their other udons! Their prices are extremely reasonable as well, I was surprised! :)"
8/22/2016,20160822,5,4.25,"This place was amazingly amazing!!!! The udon noodles were so soft and fresh! It didn't taste preserved or packaged at ALL. I got the miso carbonara, and it was super savory! It's a creamy soup base so don't expect to be drinking the reminded me of pasta, but more soupy. The flavoring was somewhat of a creamy miso soup? It's tasty favor will hit you right when you take the first bite. Everything about this place tastes so fresh and like it was made personally by the chef!"
8/22/2016,20160822,5,4.25,"Small shop. You have to wait probably at least 20-30min. But you have to wait. I don't care how long...Food: Sea Urchin Udon: The signature dish here. Looks small but its enough to get you satisfied. Its flavorful and the sauce is perfect. Negitori Bowl: Such a great side rice bowl to have. Must get along with any udon plate.Overall: Cool Japanese spot to go to. Don't be imitated by the line, you have to put your name in the front desk and then just wait outside. Don't leave just be around."
8/24/2016,20160824,5,4.25,"Udon know what you're missing out on. I love this place! Definitely worth the half an hour+ wait that is to be expected for dinner. I usually get the bukkake udon with mentaiko (which is cheaper than the shiso mentai udon) and a side of negitoro bowl. They offer the negitoro bowl for $4 instead of the usual $5.45 for lunch, provided that you order udon as well. Trust me, it's worth it. The combination of the negitoro, mayo, and the sauce is divineAnd if you're feeling extra hungry, go for the soft boiled egg and red ginger tempura."
8/27/2016,20160827,5,4.26,"If you are looking for a noodles place then you have to try Monzo. It's next to Daikokuya so sometimes you can miss it since everyone waiting tend to block the entrance. But don't let everyone fool you, Monzo has a line too. So you can't really tell who's waiting for who. If you have a small group then I would suggest to set at the bar so you can see then hand make the udon noodles. Even though the dough is already made it still a good sight to see them cut them. And since it's an open kitchen you can watch the other chefs making all the dishes. Kitsune udon - the hand made udon with their broth, oh man my mouth is watering! Curry udon - delicious and one of my go to Cold udon (plum shiso or with grated daikon and special soy sauce) - perfect dish during the summer Udon gratin - if you like cheese then you gotta try this! So many options, honestly I have a hard choosing when I come here. And they are all very delicious. The service is good and quick. Yelp 100 Challenge (52 out of 100)"
8/27/2016,20160827,5,4.26,"If you're hung over, feeling a little under the weather, or have a cold that won't go away! Order the beef udon. This broth is the fountain of youth and their ladle is the holy grail which holds the rebirth of your energy. All you have to do is drink it and you'll be baptized in their udon cult. If you're coming on a weekend night be prepared to wait at least 45/1hr wait. I ordered the Uni Udon and my friend had the beef udon. Totally different in their own respect. Uni Udon was fresh the broth was a little creamier, but not too heavy. The beef udon broth was amazing. Tasted very meaty and fresh, but not too salty. I highly recommend the squid balls as an appetizer its like a Japanese portos, ball but better! enjoy"
8/28/2016,20160828,5,4.26,I love sitting at the udon making bar -- it makes everything taste so much more authentic! I've tried 3 different udons and I've liked them all!
8/30/2016,20160830,5,4.26,"My favorite Udon joint in J-Town. Worth the wait in my opinion and their negitoro bowl is the freshest I have had in the area. I wish they had more seating, definitely love coming here, never have been disappointed."
8/31/2016,20160831,5,4.26,"GOOD for any occasion.. If you are craving noodle soups especially UDON, you have chose the right restaurant. So we came on a Tuesday night which is a pretty good time right now as school started so the wait is not too long. We waited for around 30 minutes with four parties ahead of us and got seated which seemed fairly quick. You do have to wait outside (Japanese restaurant culture?), but its okay because the food is worth waiting for and you can talk to the people outside. So onto the food, my table ordered two shrimp tempura udon, a kakuni udon, and a beef tataki. The udon comes in a pretty large bowl and the shrimp tempura is probably the biggest I've seen yet. The udon soup broth is perfect, light and flavorful. The beef tataki is delish, great sauce and really tender beef cooked and prepared to perfection. Will be back in the near future."
8/31/2016,20160831,5,4.26,"OH. MY. GOSH. Fresh noodles... so good - and that's coming from someone who isn't a fan of udon. I don't hate it, but it's not something I crave. However, since my visit to Marugame, I think about (their) udon all the time now. I had the uni one (don't remember the name). All others at the table had other varieties of udon soup - all super tasty."
8/31/2016,20160831,5,4.26,"Never taste udon like this place. I'm so impressed their house menus. We ordered Miso carbonara and cream mushrooms and it was amazing. Great flavor and nice staff,fast service. Highly recommended for everyone!!!!"
9/1/2016,20160901,5,4.26,"Best udon ever. The part that I love (and most people do) is that you get to see the udon being made! If you sit at the counter, you get the front row seat. I've been here 3x for dinner on a Saturday and the line for this place is usually around 45-60 minutes. The place is small so you have to wait outside, which also gets busy since Daikokuya has a long wait too. There's a few bars and places to walk around in the meantime to have the time pass. I've gotten the Hot Dragon Udon, Shrimp Tempura Udon, and have tried my friend's Mentai Butter Squid. The tempura I made sure to get on the side so it wasn't soggy. The Hot Dragon was delicious, it wasn't too spicy (but then again, I can handle spicy well). The Mentai is very rich in flavor and I was surprise I liked it since I don't normally like squid.You cannot go wrong here! I'm not the biggest fan of udon, but I would never turn down a trip to Marugame Monzo!"
9/2/2016,20160902,3,4.26,"We waited a hour on a full stomach(thankfully) and a large Milk + T in hand. We were excited to see the fresh udon made in front of us since we seated close to the bar area. But I had to say this is one of the most average udon I had in my life. It seems like they make the udon and then they serve us package ones. We got the highly recommended uni cream udon and one of the regular soup base udon with seasoned bean curd and scallion. Yelp in the west coast has been a disappoint to me when it came to asian cuisines. The udon here did not have a bounce texture when I bit in to it. The texture was like your local chinese lo mein, I never had udon like this, I don't know if i can even call the noodle udon, more like japanese lo mein. Now, on to the sides. I ordered the shitiake mushroom and seaweed. One will think that the side will be in the udon. HOWEVER, the shitiake arrived as a tempura, and the seaweed was sliced in to thin strips. In, all the past udon I had, my seaweed came in sheets and my shitiake was not fried. Not to mention we have already order a tempura appetizer. Overall, I will not be returning. I wish I could had gotten my hour of waiting back. Came Full, Left... with my hopes and dream of the best udon sitting in the bowl."
9/3/2016,20160903,5,4.26,"I went to this udon shop with a couple of friends while I was visiting LA. Best Udon I have ever tasted. I got the sea urchin udon. It sounds weird, but it's very good."
9/4/2016,20160904,5,4.26,"We found out about Marugame Monzo in a few articles about best restaurants in LA. When we finally came here we loved it so much we came 5 weekends in a row. The restaurant is literally a whole in the wall, but those are always the best! Try to avoid busy times as the wait can get pretty long. Sundays at 2 pm is when we always come and we always have to wait about 15 min (not bad at all), plus parking meters are free on Sunday which is always a plus. If you can, ask to be sitted by the kitchen so you can see the udon being made- pretty cool. My favorite dishes are the udon gratin: to die for!!!! Super cheesy and extremely flavorful, and the miso carbonara: just perfection."
9/4/2016,20160904,4,4.26,"First time having Japanese udon and I must say I was impressed! The wait was a bit long, but I can say that this was well worth the wait unlike the ramen joints next door. They hand make their noodles fresh and you can watch thru the window as you eat. Staff was awesome and very friendly."
9/5/2016,20160905,4,4.26,Came here on Friday with a friend. Didn't realize how popular the place was. I had the uni udon and my friend had the other seafood one. Only downside is that the wait takes forever but the food was great.
9/8/2016,20160908,4,4.26,"I grew up in Japan so I have a pretty high standard for udon, but we saw the reviews and figured it was worth a shot- it met all of our expectations. There was a huge crowd outside, but it seems like they move people pretty quick because we got seated after only twenty minutes. The food tasted very fresh and authentic- they even make the noodles in the restaurant for the diners to watch as they eat. I got the curry udon, and it was so good, the pork belly just melted in my mouth. Definitely worth the trip downtown!"
9/9/2016,20160909,5,4.26,"Best udon I've ever had :') Located right next to Daikokuya. There's always a bunch of people waiting outside for the two, but they're both totally worth the wait. We ordered both the sea urchin cream udon and the mentai squid butter udon. I LOVE the sea urchin cream udon (also known as uni udon). It exceeded my expectations and more! It was creamy, flavorful, and filled with uni! The creaminess was perfect and the flavor wasn't too overwhelming from the uni. They also add salmon roe, which I didn't really think complimented the uni, but it's there to add a salty factor. I also got to try the mentai squid butter udon and the squid was so soft and the broth was light. The noodles are also homemade as you can see the guy pulling noodles through the window. He even stopped and smiled for us when he saw us taking a picture. Love this place!! Definitely up to the hype."
9/10/2016,20160910,5,4.26,"Marugame is one of my FAVORITE places to eat in LA!! YO GIRL COMES HERE AT LEAST 1-2X A MONTH LOL the udon is bomb, the rice bowls are bomb -- what more can you ask for?? And the wait is never too long -- if you see a long line outside, it's most likely for Daikokuya LOL After seeing all the reviews giving Monzo less than 5 stars, your girl just had to come to the rescue and defend Monzo LOLOL SO HERE IT GOES: A lot of people who try Monzo for the first time try their signature udons, like the uni udon and miso carbonara, but I don't think they realize how creamy and rich it comes out to be. The flavors are really really tasty, but you can only eat so much of it before it becomes too much!! So order at your own risk!! If you're down for something creamy and heavy, go ahead and order it, but if you want something light, I advise you order a simple udon + a rice bowl ~ they have a lunch combo where you can add a rice bowl onto your udon dish for ~$3-4 instead of paying the full price for the same sized bowl they use for the lunch special ~ OR maybe you can do halfsies and have one person order a signature udon and the other person order a simple udon/rice bowl combo so you get the best of both worlds ~~ heheMy friends who order the signature udon dishes leave the restaurant feeling unsatisfied, but my friends who order a simple udon dish + a rice bowl leave the restaurant FULL, SATISFIED, AND LOVING LIFE ~~ just sayin' ~I think I've tried 10+ of their udon dishes and 4+ of their rice bowls here, and I always get one of the simpler udons, like the kake udon (it's only $6.95... I mean, what a freaking steal) or one of the cold udons, along with a rice bowl (usually the pork belly rice bowl)!! The pork belly rice bowl is so simple and bomb ugh they put something in the rice but it's freaking amazing and not too heavy!! If I want a creamier, savory rice bowl, I'll go with the negitoro bowl nom nom nom I always leave this place so damn satisfied LOL I freaking love it hahahaha Monzo you have my heart ~"
9/10/2016,20160910,5,4.26,Two words. Uni Udon. I'm typing this so I can find this again. Whenever I'm in little Tokyo this is a mandatory stop for me. Let the review begin. You're going to wait!!! The wait for this place is crazy. I don't think I've been here and it not be busy. I'm not the type of person to wait in crazy lines but did can for this place. I come here for the Uni Udon. Really good! For some the soup maybe too rich but It's great for me. With a tempura egg on the side it makes for a perfect meal. It's a bit heavy so look for something else if you want a lighter meal. The noodles are so good and hand made!
9/11/2016,20160911,5,4.26,"I dislike udon so when I say Best Udon Ever, that says a lot. I love noodles but udon is hardly the craving. My cousin suggested this place when I first visited LA. I was hesitant at first and frustrated that we were waiting 1.5 hours in line for this? Can udon really be this good? Oh yes, it was that good and every time I come back to LA, I got right back in line to eat here. In fact, I felt like it was my moral duty to share this with my boyfriend at the time. So I did! I have tried several appetizers and udon dishes here and honestly, everything was umami delicious. This place taught me the true meaning of umami and what it feels, smells, looks, sounds, and most importantly, tastes like. The broth to the udon noodle soups are very flavorful and the star to each bowl was of course, the freshly handmade udon. The noodles are made in house and I got lucky once to sit at the counter to see all the action take place. My ultimate favorite dish here is definitely the sea urchin udon. It's so delicate, creamy and flavorful. And the sea urchin oh my! It's so delicate, fresh and melts in my mouth. I would have never thought sea urchin would pair well with cream sauce but it works. It's like the Japanese version of really good carbonara pasta. Out of curiosity, I first tried a couple of spoonful from my cousin's bowl. Out of stubborness, I pretended that it was only ok. Now every time I go back, I order it for myself!Parking in J-Town LA is terrible. I recommend garage parking, and even with that, you have to be a little aggressive. But once you find this little shop and wait the line, it's totally worth it! What's nice is Daikokuya, the most awesome ramen shop, is right next door! You can put your name down for their wait and then walk around to work an appetite again. When it's time for you to be seated with them, noodles round two!!"
9/14/2016,20160914,3,4.26,"Hmmm...I don't know what happened here. The waitress recommended the yuzu sake drink and the yuzu cold udon and both were not good. My husband's mountain mushroom cold udon was better. The noodles and ingredients were quality tho, so I think I will give this place one more chance and try the hot beef udon."
9/14/2016,20160914,4,4.26,"We were seated quickly, had our order quickly taken and the food came out in the next 5 minutes. I ordered a cold udon and it was a bit on the small side and considering I don't eat much and was left hungry, this place probably wouldn't fill up someone with a regular appetite. The service was accommodating since we ended up adding another person to our table last minute but he did mention that they don't normally do that. I'd recommend coming here for a quick and relatively affordable meal if you're in Little Tokyo."
9/16/2016,20160916,5,4.26,"I will never get tired of their uni udon. Squid ink pasta is pretty darn good too, but expect to be very smelly for the entire day. The parking situation is very inconvenient, and you're likely going to have to pay at an outdoor lot. Across the street, there is an indoor lot next to the plaza that validates parking, but only the restaurants there will validate your ticket. But parking aside, the food is great, the building is rather small and cramped, but still a nice restaurant. The portions are a bit small but the pricing is fair. If you're an uni lover, I'd definitely give the uni udon a shot"
9/18/2016,20160918,5,4.26,"The uni udon was an incredible and memorable dish i will remember for a long time, yes it's that good!! The fresh udon made on the premises are flavorful with a great texture which the dry form don't have. The richness of the creamy uni sauce and udon are a perfect match with a hint of ikura. Will be back when in socal the next time, worth the wait!!"
9/20/2016,20160920,5,4.26,"Really unique udon that's made right in front of you.It's pretty good udon but I wouldn't come here for the plain udon.I'm sure my palette just isn't accustomed to notice the excellence in expertly hand-made noodles but I wouldn't wait for this place to try just the plain kitsune udon. I would, however, try all the specialty udon because it's really really really good."
9/23/2016,20160923,4,4.26,"We came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed! I think we waited about 45 min for a party of five. The restaurant itself is tiny so gets packed fast! I wish we got seated in front of the people making the udon but we were able to catch glimpses from our table. It was super cool watching them doing their craft, pulling and rolling...no wonder their udon is so tender. Once of the guys also saw me taking a picture and even stopped to pose so I could get the perfect shot!Beef Tataki: I loved this! I usually hate raw beef like steak tartare but since the sides were a little seared and there was also this wonderful sauce poured ontop, I didn't get the raw-ness flavor I hate from those other dishes. The sauce really took this dish home for me.Uni Cream Udon: Wow, very creamy as expected and the udon was firm enough to chew yet it melted in your mouth after. I'm glad the uni wasn't too strong because it can get fishy after a while. This dish did get a little heavy after a few bites because of all the cream, but nothing I couldn't handle! There was also roe on top, which really didn't add anything to the dish at all.On average, the udons are around 15-16 bucks, which is soo pricy. But, if you look at the ingredients like uni or squid, I kind of understand why and plus the restaurant is located in DTLA/Little Tokyo where every other restaurant has a hefty pricetag. I would love to come back here to try all their other unique udons!"
9/24/2016,20160924,3,4.26,"This was hyped up too much for me, especially the Uni udon. It was definitely delicious but expected more. There wasn't as much Uni taste as I expected. Without the hype, if I just stepped into the place without knowing I would probably give it a 4 star.Texture of the udon and chewy-ness was on point."
9/26/2016,20160926,4,4.26,Came around closing time and they were able to get us in within an hour. Got the cheesy udon and it was delicious! Never though cheese chicken onions and udon goes so well together! Their pork belly rice bowls were good too. It's awesome being able to see the chefs make udon from scratch..right in front of you! Will come back to try other udon dishes!
9/27/2016,20160927,5,4.26,Simple yet so delicious.By far the best place in LA to get Udon and maybe the only place to really specialize making it.TIP: Get the Negitoro Rice Bowl along with your udon. You will not be disappointed!The waits can get long.
9/28/2016,20160928,5,4.26,This place definitely changed the udon game for me. I always thought udon was udon until I came here. The Uni udon and the squid mentai udon are on point - so flavorful and unique. I recommend getting different types and sharing amongst friends
9/29/2016,20160929,5,4.26,"Nothing beats fresh handmade udon! We ordered their uni udon, curry udon, the white wine clam udon, and a couple of appetizers. They were all very good! The clam udon was my favorite one, love it! Definitely worth the long wait, not to mention it's a pokemon go stop which makes the waiting time much more fun!"
9/30/2016,20160930,5,4.26,"This is my third time here. So far all the dishes I've tried were really good. I love udon in general and I've had friends recommend this place. Last time I came here I had the seafood tomato and cream. It kinda tastes like spaghetti but really smooth and the udon is fresh. The takoyaki comes with broth so you have to eat it right away, unless you like it on the soggy side.I think my favorite is the sea urchin. It goes down really smooth and goes really well with the udon.My least favorite one might be the mentai squid butter because after eating half way, it gets kinda salty in my opinion. It was still good though. They also have people making the noodles in front of you and you get to watch how they prepare your food through glass if you get the bar seats. Overall this place is now one of my places to go to if I'm in the mood for udon."
9/30/2016,20160930,4,4.26,"The bowl is huge. No, it's gigantic. For a little bit of extra $ you'll get double the size of udon noodles. For me, this place is pretty authentic and I feel comfortable eating here. The Beef Udon bowl I ordered was enough. The service is friendly and quick."
9/30/2016,20160930,5,4.26,"Told a friend I was going to downtown to explore and she recommended this place. I am glad I went. Tucked next to daikokuya, I hear that sometimes the lines blend together. I had finished a lot of morning exploration and got there around 10:30. By 10:50 there was a line of 8 or 9 deep. Other reviews said it gets to be an hour long at times. The interesting things about this place is that they make their own noodles and cut it in front of you. You get to see the process and it explains why the noodles are chewy, firm and delicious. I settled with a standard bowl of udon, pork belly bowl side and a tempura small octopus. The total was around 11 - 12 dollars, which is unbelievable. It should be noted that this was part of a lunch combo. The broth was a twinge saltier than I would've liked but the inclusion of the tempura flakes and chives/green onions (not sure which they used) made it hearty and flavorful. The pork belly had a slight drizzle of some quality sesame oil that really brought out the pork flavor. If you've every had korean pork belly, it was the exact same flavor but the cut was thinner. The thinness made it soft and tender, and with the rice made for an awesome side dish. The tempura baby octopus was a lot of fun and was pretty tasty even if octopus isn't your go to protein choice.Next time I hope to try some of creamy, signature, or cold udons. But my first experience definitely has me wanting to go backTLDR - great udon, good prices (if you come for lunch), they make it in front of you. Lines can be long at times"
10/1/2016,20161001,4,4.26,"I wanted to go to little Tokyo for lunch, co-worker wanted noodles, what a good timing!? After we arrived the area, we saw ramen shops and noticed this one udon place. Well why not, udon we went. Since we got there right before 12, there was no wait at all and we got our seats right away. When we walked in, we were greeted by a guy behind the glasses making udon noodles and it was quite a show. I guess all the noodles were hand made on site to ensure the freshness of their udon. If you are able to find seats in front of the glasses, do it so you can witness the magic.We got regular udon with fried tofu and buttery udon with squid covered in cod roes. We also got a side of soft boiled egg and kakiage which was a deep fried ball of shreeded carrots, onions and seafood. The udon texture was great and broth was tasty. It was a shame there wasn't enough broth for the buttery squid because it was very thick, tasty, and made me crave for more. Kakiage was delicious and fried just right. I would suggest to get it at any given visit. The soft boiled egg however was a waste. Bland and tasteless even though it was made perfect. Do not get that. On my previous visit, I have also tried the sea urchin udon and believe it was an over hyped item. It was expensive, the uni portion was small, and the udon tasted water down with no trace of sea urchin flavor. Not worth of the ordering in my opinion. Overall thought, if you love udon, you should go to this place for sure. If you don't know what udon is or having neutral thought about udon, try this place and you might be a udon fan after."
10/2/2016,20161002,5,4.26,"Finally got to eat here! The wait wasn't too bad either. From experience, I feel like dinner rush is later in the evening so to beat the wait come around 6pm or just before the sun goes down. Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($15.95): At first glance, the portion size may make you question the price, but it is actually a decent portion well suited for a dish so rich & creamy. The uni was buttery and not fishy at all. The noodles were al dente for perfect bite & chew to them. However, the broth really made the dish for me! It was the perfect consistency; thick as to coat the noodles, but still light enough to sip with each spoonful without being too decadent.I will definitely be back & possibly during lunch to get the lunch special add-on of a ""don"" (rice bowl) to any udon for an additional $4!"
10/3/2016,20161003,4,4.26,"UNIII UDON! Although it's a bit expensive, at $16 a bowl, it was so delicious and definitely worth trying! It's perfectly creamy and the consistency of the broth is perfect; not too thick and not too thin. I didn't find it overly rich and decadent as creamy dishes can get sometimes. The noodles were perfect as well, with just the right amount of bite. I also got the soft boiled tempura egg but it was just okay. Nothing special. Bf got the mentai squid butter udon and he really enjoyed his dish. I liked the pieces of squid in it! They were really tender. Uni udonnn; do it!"
10/4/2016,20161004,4,4.26,"If it weren't for the wait, I'd eat here so much more often! Came here on a Sunday around 1:30pm and luckily the wait was only ~30 minutes so we decided to stick around. Their udon selection is amazing! The best comfort food on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I usually get either the mentai squid udon or the uni, which are both amazing, but this time I opted for a classic udon with duck. I wish the duck was juicier but it was a bit on the dry side, which was disappointing...other than that, the broth and noodles were flavorful and chewy. The takoyaki (original style) was the perfect appetizer. My friend had the special - hot dragon udon and she loved it. I'll definitely be back for the uni/mentai squid udon!"
10/5/2016,20161005,5,4.26,"The uni cream udon is no doubt the best udon I've ever had. The base reminds me of alfredo sauce, which I enjoy very much. The noodles were delicate and absorbed the flavors of the creamy base throughout. Although uni is the focal point of the dish, the unsung hero of the dish was definitely the ROE--just bursting with robust flavors!Moreover, the tempura soft boiled egg was a disappointment. I've had it both deep fried and naked--it's absent of seasoning. Not worth it. The wait has consistently been around 30-40 min when I'm with 2 or more people. The service was okay. Overall, the uni cream udon is definitely worth the wait as well as the price!"
10/8/2016,20161008,3,4.26,This place is definitely overrated. It might be because I'm not that big a fan of uni and noodles combined but I've had some of their other udons and they were all really unimpressive. They tasted ok but not worth the long wait.
10/9/2016,20161009,4,4.26,It is right next to Daikokuya. The sea urchin creamy Udon is the best. Their shrimp tempura is really big and tasty.
10/10/2016,20161010,2,4.26,"I'm obviously in the minority in terms of my experience at Marugame Monzo. I don't like leaving 1 or 2 star reviews but I feel like I have to mention one of their dishes. We decided to get the famous Sea Urchin Cream Udon and I wanted a spicy dish to complement the creamy uni udon so I ordered the Hot Dragon Udon, which they were advertising in the store as part of their summer special.Until this moment, never have I ever had to return a dish back to the kitchen because I was so utterly disappointed in it. I'm not picky with my food at all and I'll always just eat what I get even if I don't like it but this Hot Dragon udon was practically inedible. It's basically a ""hot"" udon dish with a ""spicy"" broth, bean sprouts, chives, and ground pork. It wasn't spicy at all and the broth was literally just oil and water. I don't know what went wrong here but the broth was lukewarm and seriously gross. I couldn't swap dishes with my bf because he also didn't like it. The handmade udon noodles were soft and had a nice texture but the broth just killed it. The server was nice enough to take the dish back after talking with the head server. I ordered the Curry Udon instead. Honestly, I'd lost my appetite at that point and the curry udon did nothing to help me find it again. It was too salty and I would have rather eaten it with rice than the udon noodles. We had such high expectations for this restaurant and I was so sad that everything I ordered was continuously disappointing.Honestly, the uni udon was what pushed this review from 1 star to 2. It was very buttery and creamy and I totally think it deserves all the attention and the hype. Although there were only small pieces of uni, the udon noodles were consistently soft and absorbed all the cream sauce deliciously. I would have given this place five stars if I'd eaten the uni udon only and if I'd never tried the two other dishes.Thankfully there was no wait when we got there at a little past 4 p.m. on a Sunday. If I had to wait in that long of a long line for my meal and was let down that much by the food, I probably would have lost faith in udon noodles altogether. Anyway, besides the uni udon, I think this place is seriously overrated. Just be aware that what works for the majority may not work for you."
10/10/2016,20161010,5,4.26,"Came with GF on a Sunday around 530pm and there was a wait which is normal for a restaurant in LA. It wasn't too bad just 15 minutes! Was seated and we ordered right away. After ordering I noticed behind the glass window they are making the udon from scratch! This was a good sign.. usually when I hear udon, I think of instant udon noodles but nope they make their owns fresh here!I had the hot dragon udon($11.50)and she had the sea urchin cream udon($16). I enjoyed the broth of the hot dragon udon, it wasn't too spicy nor bland. So good that I cleaned by bowl empty. The sea urchin cream udon was also good! It wasn't too creamy and thick. Would definitely come back again!"
10/11/2016,20161011,5,4.26,"THIS PLACE IS FREAKING AMAZING.My roommate and I came on a Wednesday night around 6:30, and we were seated immediately. I'm so sad they don't do ToGo orders or else I would've brought some for my parents.The place is on the smaller side so the spaces are a bit tight, and there is semi limited seating. If you sit at the bar area, you can watch people make the udon by hand.I ordered the Sea Urchin dish, while my roommate ordered one where it's like vegetable and seafood broth. Both were hot dishes. I know I mentioned the restaurant itself for small, but there was nothing small about the portions. My roommate and I thought we were gonna die from how good they both were. Both dishes were flavorful, but not in the way where you're stuck swallowing cups and cups of water.I genuinely wish I came to try this place sooner. Parking sucks, but it's LA. Nothing new. I'm def interested in trying out the Torrance location!"
10/13/2016,20161013,4,4.26,"The entrance was very low-key, but Yelp would help you figure it out! My group all got the creamy uni Udon. It totally was like an Udon Alfredo Pasta mash up. It was very good, very creamy. I definitely would have it again. It was heavy on the stomach too! I felt that everyone in the store pretty much all got the cream uni Udon soup."
10/14/2016,20161014,5,4.26,I've been wanting to go here since JKF made a video at this place. It was fucking amazing. Best Udon I have ever eaten. It had a very unique light flavor. I got the Uni Udon and fried chicken appetizer. Omg so good. I wish there was a place like this in Norcal
10/16/2016,20161016,4,4.26,"Great:-The udons especially the uni and carbonara- pork belly bowl- nice serversNot so great:- no high chairs. They only have booster seat which dont help when u have a little one you need to buckle in for safety. It was difficult to eat so the place is not that great if you have little one, although the staff was nice and accommodating to try what will work best for us, I still think they should invest in high chairs. I'm sure they sell it in craigslist for less."
10/16/2016,20161016,4,4.26,Its a little small and depending on when you go it can be a little bit of a wait. I never really craved udon noodles until I came here. Now this place is the only udon I crave. The broth is amazingggggg it is not too salty or to bland the perfect amount of flavor. It is perfect! Noodles are cooked just right!
10/17/2016,20161017,2,4.26,"Parking is horrible, but then again it's downtown la, what do u expect. Should've parked in the $6 lot but somehow ended up paying $12 in a garage :( Wait was super freaking long! And honestly it is way too hyped up for me. The wait was NOT worth it. We waited about 45 minutes on a late Saturday night. Luckily there's a lot to do In the area, but there's not much space in the front of the restaurant, so it's just a whole bunch of strangers sardined togetherWe finally got seated. Party of 5. And everyone wasn't impressed. With the high reviews, long lines, and praises we had high expectations. Sadly, we were all disappointed. Three orders of Uni udonOne hot dragon udon One tempura Uni One beef bowl I had to add soy sauce, lots of green onions, and pepper to mine to make it good. The Uni tasted kind of bad. But the quality of udon was really good. I asked for ponzu sauce and they didn't have it :/ The beef in the beef bowl was too sweet. I would say yoshinoya is way better. Service was good, friendly, and fast Side note on service... I asked how much longer the wait would be, and the waiter was as vague as they come. ""10 minutes, maybe more, maybe less"".... Umm. Ok All in all. Not coming back. & I can speak for the other 4 as well. Better off ordering plain udon and sprucing it up myself at home."
10/19/2016,20161019,5,4.26,"Weird that I haven't written a review yet for this place. I came here many moons ago back when daikokuya used to be popular... this place used to not have a line. Pretty crazy to think back to those times... my group used to think we had discovered some crazy secret... I mean how could there not be a humungous line for Murugame Monzo? Sure enough... our little secret was discovered and now this place is always packed. I've had everything on the menu thus far. It's all amazing. Actually, I'd stay away from the char siu bowl as it's just not as great of value as everything else is."
10/19/2016,20161019,4,4.26,"While this was a great meal, my experience has degraded with longer wait times, and at times seemingly rushed food/service"
10/20/2016,20161020,4,4.26,"I've never really been to a restaurant that was all about the Udon until Monzo, but I'm definitely glad I tried it. FOODThe noodles are made right in front of you where everyone can watch. They all seem so pro at what they do and everything is seemingly an intricate and well thought out process.The Duck Nanban Udon was good, but I wasn't blown away by it or anything. It did have that warmth and ""chicken soup for the soul"" feeling to me and I'd like to order it if I was sick or it was snowing outside. But in Los Angeles, I wouldn't hold my breath for that snow. What I ordered was: Cold Udon + Kakiage + Shiso + Baby Octopus + Shrimp Tempura. I prefer cold over the hot especially with the summer quickly approaching. The Kakiage here is pretty good, and I was so tempted to order another. I heard the Baby Octopus was really good too. I just love that I'm able to order something and customize it in my own way because I feel like I have very very specific taste.SERVICEThe waitresses here are sooo nice and in their own way, kinda funny too. They're fobby Japanese women and that just makes this Udon joint even more authentic. They're pretty helpful too in case you're a newbie when it comes to ordering. ATMOSPHEREI love it. It's clean. It's modern looking. It's tasteful. You can watch the dudes make your noodles from scratch. There's like even a bar for you to sit at to watch it up close. I love when noodle shops have bar seating or counter seating, however you wanna call it. Simply put, the place looks legit."
10/25/2016,20161025,5,4.26,"I ordered the uni udon my first time coming here and have never ordered anything different. It is rich and creamy, more like a pasta, and so satisfying. The udon noodles are fresh and chewy. I've tried a couple different things depending on what my bf orders, but I will stick to the uni udon."
10/28/2016,20161028,5,4.26,Yea!!!the first time eat this I think so in my life is top 1 so awesome omg
10/28/2016,20161028,5,4.26,"I don't eat Udon often, so I am certainly not the best judge, but if satisfaction was the name, Marugame brought its game. Go for beef Udon for light flavorful broth and generous amount of beef. For something rich and creamy, Uni Udon is calling for a date. If you are sensitive to rich cream sauces, consider sharing or something else, but it was not too bad for me. Wish there was a little more uni to spare in this poor man's life. The pork and salmon roe rice bowls were not too shabby, but it was barely enough to get these taste buds tantalizing."
10/29/2016,20161029,5,4.26,"my favorite restaurant in little tokyo. come for lunch and just forget about getting seated during dinner. the sister restaurant, monjiro (torrance) is unfortunately not as tasty as this location. uni cream udon with pork belly and rice set FTW. also awesome-- your standard ten udon w/ side tempura (yay for the shiso leaf). the scotch egg tempura thingie was tasty but not necessary. the beef over rice is as deceptively simple and delicious as the pork belly. fresh udon really makes a difference-- not as starchy and heavy as non-homemade versions. seafood carbonara is amazing as well. skip the karaage-- nothing spesh.i really wish this place expanded-- it sucks having to wait hours on end (especially next to daikokuya's own queue) outside. amazing food."
10/30/2016,20161030,4,4.26,"I had a huge breakfast and so did not try their ginormous udon bowl. Instead I had the tuna rice bowl and pork miso nigiri. I really like the portion variety they have.The nigiri is super salty, which can be good or bad depending on your preference. I kind of like it as a snack, and it's a huge, satisfying triangle of rice+miso pork for under $2. (3.5 stars)The tuna rice bowl was nice! Small bowl packed with rice, soft raw tuna mush, sprinkled with seaweed, and drizzled with the sweet creamy sauce usually found on takoyaki. If you get this as a side, I think it's $4-4.50 and if not as a side $5-$5.50. (4 stars) This was exactly the light lunch I was looking for, and I find that rare!"
10/31/2016,20161031,4,4.26,"Wait was about an hour on Sunday night around 8pm. Service was slow. Duck udon- the duck was surprisingly tough. The udon and the broth were great though. Beef bukkake- this was quite refreshing. The shaved daikon added a subtle flavor to the dish. The beef was sukiyaki style, thin and flavorful. The udon noodles were chewier in this dish than in the hot duck udon.Very delicious place."
11/1/2016,20161101,4,4.26,"Uni udon, the presentation was beautiful. The broth was very creamy and flavorful. Udon is made fresh in house behind the bar. While the Uni flavor is not for everyone, it is definitely something worth trying."
11/2/2016,20161102,1,4.26,"Came in a few weeks ago with my friend for a dinner. Everything was good but the service. Our waiter made us very uncomfortable saying we're pretty and we should be out partying. Before we got our food the waiter whispered in my ear saying my underwear is showing, then said out loud but it's nice tho. I never felt more uncomfortable in my life, I was too embarrassed to talk to the manger. The waiter was a Latino male with a hoop earring. I will never come back to eat here again."
11/4/2016,20161104,4,4.26,"My husband and I had been craving udon since we took our honeymoon to Hawaii. We live in Virginia, which has a significantly smaller Japanese American population and essentially no udon. So a trip to this spot when we came to LA was a must. We came on a Thursday night around 8 and only waited about 30 minutes or so for our table. Hostess was very gracious and reassuring that we wouldn't have to wait too long since we were just a party of two.We ordered assorted pickles, a large portion of kitsune udon, a bowl of cold plum sauce udon, sake, and an assortment of tempura. In short, it fulfilled a long awaited craving with gold stars. In particular among the udon I really enjoyed the pumpkin and shrimp. Egg needs to be eaten in udon for more flavor. I did notice that the broth in our kitsune was a little weaker than we are used to making it but still the real deal.Wish we could come back every week."
11/5/2016,20161105,5,4.26,"I visited J-Town in the evening for the first time and found the night life full of young hipsters and all crowded around this restaurant. The family wandered in and put our name down, as no reservations are taken. Two hours later, our name is called, and thus begins our journey into the world of udon. Now mind you, ramen has been all the craze over the past few years, generating quite a buzz of contention with tsukemen entering the ring as well. Throw in an old relic from my past, and you've got quite a fight between what is the best Japanese noodle to eat. This location seems to have a Japanese cuisine, but with Italian and French influences thrown in to make the offerings a notch above the rest. The tradition Udon, is a thick noodle with maximum slurp appeal. Traditionally served in a broth, Marugame Monzo breaks with tradition. The hand made noodles are exhibited in production every so often at the back of the restaurant, with crowds forming, watching the master udon chef make the noodles from scratch. Next, the sauces, which can be in a broth, or in my daughter's case, an gratin. When trying the first time, like us, order the squid balls, which actually squirm with the bonita flakes moving with the steam; very delicious! Being health conscience, I chose the clams in white wine sauce, which reminded me of the Little Door Next Door in West Hollywood. Too bad there was no dipping bread, as it would have been quite good. Service is fast and efficient, except for the wait before entering. the workers know their trade and do it well, with friendly smiles, and a most humble personality. I will certainly come back during the week for lunch, and maybe beat the crowd before lunch!"
11/11/2016,20161111,4,4.26,"Uni udon, chicken skin tempura! They make their own udon in the back. Chicken skin tempura was bomb! Taste like fried fish. I want to try the octopus tempura next time. Sunday 730pm for party of 3 is a 45min wait. We went to far bar (same block, 5 stores down) to grab a drink and wait. Be a cautious listener when server calls out group names because it's crowded and sometimes loud outside.A non-dairy udon dish is spicy red udon hot soup. Very mild spicy. Soup was good. Taste like instant ramen packet spices but without the crappy msg hangover after feeling. May try another opt next time. No parking. Street meter or public parking lot."
11/17/2016,20161117,5,4.26,The uni pasta is excellent. The uni cream sauce pairs nicely with the hand made udon noodles. The tempura is also one of the most fresh and crispy I've tried. Never have I been disappointed with a soggy tempura that clearly was sitting for a while. They always fry to order and somehow make it extra crispy.
11/20/2016,20161120,4,4.26,Delicious handmade udon! I tried the creamy sea urchin udon and the fried chicken skin. Indeed it was creamy and amazing. It was delicious and quick service. The servers were nice as well. But the wait time was pretty long even on a monday night. A table for 3 people took 35 minutes. Looking forward to going back to try other things!
11/21/2016,20161121,5,4.26,Love the sea urchin udon. Love looking at the cooks making udon in front of me through the windown pane in the middle of the restaurant (get a spot where you have a view of it). The noodles are so fresh and hearty. Such a great place to eat at! Highly recommend it.
11/25/2016,20161125,5,4.26,"SUPPPERRR FRESHHH!!!! Came here during lunch time. I had heard this place gets real packed. Lucky for us.... for a table for 7.. we were seated within 10 minutes of checking in. We didn't get a table but was actually seated at the bar. (It was actually better for us since the bar was more spacious. Plus the kids were entertained). I liked how you can watch them make the noodles fresh. My kids especially liked watching the guy cut the noodles and roll it out. Although there was a glass between the kids and the kitchen, the guy was really nice and friendly. I think that although he was working making noodles, it made him happy knowing the kids were entertained and happy to watch him.Service was good. Although there was a flaw. Since I did get seated near the back... the servers did talk a LOT about their personal lives. I know work places can become comfortable but it makes it uncomfortable to hear about your marriage problems *eek!* I may have kids with me but it doesn't mean I can't hear my surroundings. Although service was good and on point. Its still a place of business and those servers were very unprofessional putting their personal problems out on the table for customers to here at a place of business. Although I am giving 5 stars for this place.. thats just a small complaint I have about this place.The food was delicious. I had never been here before but was recommended by a friend to try this place with warnings the lines to eat here can get pretty long. Although I can't remember the name of my order... I just know I ordered something baked off the specialty menu. It was super cheesy but it was just enough where I could tolerate the cheese. Really delicious, heavy and savory. The udon noodles were super fresh.. So would I come back despite my small complaint? Yes I would. Why? Food is just THAT GOOD and THAT FRESH"
11/25/2016,20161125,5,4.26,"Husband and I love this place. Easily one of our favorite places in little tokyo. The udon noodles are consistently delicious and chewy. There's always an udon dish thats perfect for my multitude of food moods. Hot, cold, light, healthy, heavy, fatty, whatever it may be."
11/30/2016,20161130,4,4.26,"They're known for their uni pasta, and I admit, it's very good. The pasta is handmade, and the taste proves it. The uni, however, is kind of dry..hard? But I would order this again. Good atmosphere. Servers are very nice and attentive. If the line gets long, you have to wait outside"
11/30/2016,20161130,5,4.26,amazing udon! always come here on rainy days and love the home-y feel.
12/3/2016,20161203,4,4.26,"Came on a Thursday night with four people and the wait was about 30 minutes, seemed like forever though coz it was way too cold outside and the place was too small for us to wait inside.Ordered the uni creamy udon that everyone else recommended and it certainly did not disappoint! Creamy, wasn't too heavy, and did not have the bad seafood smell so it was a great dish overall. They also had mentago (fish eggs) on it which was more than just decorations, it was very tasty too, and wasn't too salty like many other places were. We also had the karaage (fried chicken) and it came with five pieces, wasn't bad though I think they use a special batter so the fried part was very soft. Also ordered the tempura which again, the batter was smooth. Their menu are a little pricy though, ranging from 9.95 to 15.95+ for a bowl of udon, but the taste is really good though so definitely worth it.The only few things about this place was parking and restaurant setup. Only street parking, or paid parking lots but that's with every restaurant in this area, the restaurant is small and cozy which is fine, but the way they set up the tables was just too crowded. Bumped a few shoulders just to get to the restroom, so you can imagine how much more restricting it felt while dining. Overall though, it won't stop me from coming back, good ambience and good food."
12/4/2016,20161204,5,4.26,"Came here on a Thursday night after a trip to the Broad and did not have to wait at all! We ordered the tempura, beef udon, and the uni udon with a tempura soft-boiled egg. Tempura: hot and crispy! (it's pretty hard to mess up tempura)Beef/Uni Udon: It was hands down the best udon I've ever had! The soup of the beef udon was very flavorful and thank goodness not sweet like some other places that I've had. The udon noodle's texture was perfect and bouncy. And the uni udon, was sooo good. The sauce was light but also very flavorful. This is actually the first uni noodle dish that I've ever finished all on my own because they sauce is usually way too heavy for one person to eat a a whole bowl of. Tempura solt-boiled egg: The egg was okay, not very flavorful I would probably just prefer a regular egg or none at all.I will definitely have to come back next time (and every time) I'm in town!"
12/4/2016,20161204,5,4.26,"After a 50 minute wait, got sat and served pretty quickly. I ordered the beef udon. Broth was delicious, nice bonito flavor. Beef was very good. considering its the same cut of meat you get at beefbowl, you're getting it perfectly cooked. I also ordered the kaakiage, the seafood tempura, which is also excellent. Servers are very busy and don't stop much at tables, but are very responsive to being called over, so don't be patient and wait for them to be not busy. One of my family members ordered the mushroom in cream sauce udon and got sick(this is not the name of it) but I had a great experience. My mom went again the very next week."
12/5/2016,20161205,5,4.26,"This little gem is a great place to eat at! Right next to a very popular ramen restaurant, this too has a long line as well. We had about 7 parties ahead of us, but got in super quick (less than 20 minutes)! I hate waiting, so 10/5 for being quick! The ambiance is a cute restaurant that resembles many noodle shops, but what makes this place fascinating? THEY MAKE THE UDON IN FRONT OF YOU (if you sit near the kitchen)! 10/5 experience. I ordered the Mad Tiger Udon ($11.95) and boy was it DELICIOSO ! I don't really care for Udon noodles and still don't, but the brother was flavorful and with the bean sprouts and green onions they add in, omg it's just heavenly . I added in some of the chili powder for an extra spicy component and let's just say it was . The noodles weren't soft or too chewy and was the perfect consistency! 5/5 My friend on the other hand ordered the Curry Udon, which was okay. If you like Japanese curry, then that is your way to go!! The soup was thick and to my liking. I definitely think this is a great pairing if you order any of the tempura and dip it in the curry! I can't leave out the service. I am a real stickler with service and they were on point. 1. There wasn't a long wait 2. The food didn't take long to order 3. Our waiter was a cutie, props to you slim guy with the glasses All in all, regardless if I don't like Udon noodles, this place is a 5!! Give it a try and try the Mad Tiger Noodles (if you can handle a little kick)."
12/5/2016,20161205,5,4.26,"Let me begin this review by saying I love that the restaurant is right next to daikokuya. Both places usually have really long lines and both places have stellar Japanese food, so what I do is I put my name down on both places and the first place to call me gets my money for the day, I know that's pretty clever.Anyways, the udon here is pretty awesome. Like they purposely have a glass window just so you can see them make the udon noodles by hand. Of course, every review here l is gonna tell you to get the sea urchin/uni udon or the squid matei which is pretty good and creamy I guess but that's not my style. My gf always get that cause she's into that stuff but I usually go for the udons with real broth and not just cream cause what you think this is? Souplantation? Nah fam. I'm here for some juicy meat broth that was slowly crafted by the chef. I always get the duck udon with extra portion for only 2$ more so it's worth if you eat a lot like me. You can't get that for the signature udons like sea urchin tho. Also, try the beef tataki if you haven't before but I wouldn't suggest getting it too often. Definitely get it if you're feeling balling, like financial aid just direct deposited yo bank account balling, jk it's only like 20$ lmao but definitely not bang for the buck. It's pretty expensive for a couple slices of meat. Overall it's a pretty tasty authentic Japanese udon place, even tho the chefs rolling my udon are Mexican and not Japanese but that's alright. Gracias arigato, hola konichiwa, don't matter, same difference. still tastes great to me, no matter what nationality rolls them hot hand made udons boiiiiiiii. Enjoy and have a good day, thanks for choosing my review yelpers!"
12/5/2016,20161205,5,4.26,"Was here a little over a week ago, stopped by after the Auto show at the convention center. The wait, on a Sunday afternoon, was about 30-35 min. But the food and service was worth the wait. We shared assorted Tempura, We had the Hot Dragon Udon noodles, little bit spicy but very good large portions, and Ume shiso Udon, more then enough to satisfy your appetite. Will be back some time, for sure."
12/8/2016,20161208,5,4.26,I'm not usually a fan of udon but this place was great. The wait was annoyingly long but the food and excellent service made up for it. The beef udon was bomb~~
12/10/2016,20161210,5,4.26,"Best Uni pasta I have EVER tasted. It's very filling because it's very creamy. At first I thought the portion was small served in a huge bowl, but after eating it I couldn't finish.. So definitely worth it! It's one of the pricier items on the menu, but definitely one of the best. I love how they make the udon right in front of you. Makes you enjoy and appreciate the meal a lot more witnessing them make it in front of you. It proves how fresh their noodles are. Nothing says more fresh than making it right in front of your eyes! Great idea for making the wall a glass window so we can watch all the magic of making udon noodles. It's actually pretty cool! Definitely expect a wait when you come here. I've been here twice now, and both times they were super busy. But it's okay, I'll wait for their delicious noodles!"
12/10/2016,20161210,4,4.26,"Yum! Came here to try their famous Sea Urchin Uni Udon. This dish was really good! I like having variety so it would have been perfect to share this dish with someone (especially since it's on the heavier side) and order another entree to share. Definitely try this!! My boyfriend loves it and craves it all of the time. There was no wait for this restaurant when I came at 5 PM on a Sunday night. At around 6 PM, this place was packed with a wait list. Be prepared to wait!"
12/11/2016,20161211,5,4.26,"Came on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving for lunch. There was a bit of a wait (20 min) which I didn't think was too bad at all. We ordered the takoyaki to start. I ordered the uni cream udon with a tempura egg and BF got the squid butter udon. The takoyaki were good, nothing to complain about there. THEN CAME THE UDON. I was worried that the uni cream udon would be too rich, but I didn't find it that bad! Loved the flavor of it. The noodles were to die for, cooked perfectly with the right bite. I love eggs, but found the tempura egg to be quite bland =( not worth having it as an add on. I would skip it. Halfway through our bowls, me and the BF switched so we could try the other dish. OMG. THE SQUID BUTTER UDON IS WHERE ITS AT. So flavorful and the squid was super tender. MUST GET!Service was quick!"
12/12/2016,20161212,3,4.26,"This place was great to try for the first time and really cool they make the noodles in the spot ! But not coming back just because it was "" OKAY "" The service was not to good , it was our first time and we had a party of nine but the waiters didn't seem to be to happy helping or answering our questions ! More of a frustrated look ! Next , the noodles were amazing but the sauce is wack ! There was no flavor what so ever . I tried all the dishes from our full party of nine and two out of nine plates were good ! That's a bad percentage to me . Worth the experience , so try it out . If you have question go with someone that knows and has been ,"
12/13/2016,20161213,5,4.26,"Simple and SweetUdon is all you need to know when coming here. That is their main focus and all you need to worry about is which bowl you're gonna get! Its a hint of fusion but at the end of the day its still very much traditional Japanese food.The udon is superb! It is chewy and firm like it should be but not too firm and they absolutely nailed it! I tried what i heard was popular, the udon gratin and i was not disappointed. for 11 dollars, you literally get a dish that can feed two. It was creamy and the pile on the cheese for you so if you're lactose intolerant, please do not order this for the sake of your health. My friends their entrees as well and they looked quite good! The kakiage and shrimp tempura were also delicious and pretty cheap considering the size ($2.50 and $1.50) As for everything else, the ambiance was nice and the waiters were very friendly! The thing that sucks is parking around here. You can do street parking (if you're a LA native you know this is a joke) or you can park in the village parking (Monzo does not validate it). Worst comes to worst Uber/Lyft here?"
12/13/2016,20161213,5,4.26,Great handmade udon! They make it fresh all day behind the large glass window. I've tried several of their udons and they're all awesome. My favorite would have to be the classic beef udon.The only downside to this restaurant is the wait. The place is very small with limited seating and there's always a huge waitlist so expect to wait a while if you go during peak meal times.
12/15/2016,20161215,5,4.26,I have traveled the world in search of good food and this is the only restaurant that has surprised the Heck outta me. I can't speak of anything else on the menu because I can't get past the Sea Urchin Udon in a cream sauce. The first time I tried it I thought my taste buds died and went to heaven. It was so good in fact I was sad and mad because I inhaled the dish so fast and wanted to lick the bowl clean.Thank you Daikakuya for being super busy and forcing me to eat here. I have found nirvana.
12/15/2016,20161215,4,4.26,"My group got Duck Udon, Shrimp Tempura Udon, Kakuni Udon, and I got a Chicken Tempura Udon. The udon here is really yummy and the serving sizes are definitely big! The service was pretty fast. While the udon we got were all super yummy, all the broths tasted pretty similar to one another; I definitely would come back but to try one of their specialty udons instead. I didn't think the Chicken Tempura udon was anything special though in terms of flavor, but the noodles are just so crunchy and good.The wait here is shorter than Daikokuya next door. Be sure to stand next to the door, because the employees don't shout very loudly when they call your name. Also, make sure your whole party is there when they call you otherwise they won't seat you!"
12/16/2016,20161216,4,4.26,"I came here a couple nights ago on a double date. We waited about 45 minutes to be seated, which apparently is pretty normal for this place. Luckily it wasn't too cold of a night. There isn't any indoor waiting, so everyone stands outside waiting for their name to be called. Once our name was called, we were immediately shown to our table. There's a good amount of seating. It isn't a huge restaurant, but it was bigger than I expected. Shortly after sitting down, our waiter came to our table. Everyone was ready to order, so he immediately took our orders. I ordered the shrimp tempura udon, my girlfriend and her friend ordered the beef udon, and my girlfriend's friend's boyfriend ordered the seafood udon. We all enjoyed our meals. The broth was tasty, and I loved that the noodles were handmade in the restaurant. The shrimp tempura is fluffy and perfectly cooked. I'm not the biggest fan of udon, but this place was good. The service is average. Nothing outstanding. They don't check in on you, so it's difficult to get something from the waiter. Parking isn't the best in this area. I parked in the John Aiso lot, but there's also some street parking."
12/16/2016,20161216,1,4.26,"Beware!! If you are not happy with your ordered dish, you're out of luck. Spoke to server and asked for something else. I was told, I would have to pay full price for another dish and ""exchanging food if you don't like it is an American policy."" Wow!! If I am not mistaken, Marugame Monzo is in America and making sure your customers are satisfied is called good customer service."
12/16/2016,20161216,5,4.26,"Delicious! Went here on a Friday around noon. The wait was about half an hour, but worth it. Freshly made udon! If you're in a rush, best to come by yourself or in pairs. They seat you in order of the number of seats that become available per table. Though you may arrive first, other parties of one or two may get seated first. It's a small cafe-like space with maybe 30 or so seats total. We ordered the specialty udons. Both the uni and the squid butter udons were on point. Udon was so good and the sauces were creamy. You will not be disappointed."

12/19/2016,20161219,4,4.26,"I had seen pictures of the Sea Urchin Udon prior to my visit to LA and knew I had to come here. There was a little bit of a wait but that's how you know the place is good right? The udon was delicious with a generous portion size (probably enough for two people to share because I couldn't finish it). I also ordered a tempura egg, which was not one of my favorites as it was kind of tasteless and I could feel my arteries getting clogged. Can't wait to come again nonetheless."
12/20/2016,20161220,3,4.26,"Marugame is a place to go if 1) you feel like having udon 2) the line for daikokuya is too long and 3) you like creamy pasta/uni. This place serves some solid udon at a decent price, but udon by itself is essentially lighter and not as soul warming as a bowl of rich brothy ramen next door. Also, their specialty is this creamy uni udon, but I am sadly becoming more lactose intolerant and also can barely handle seafood so I did not order their signature dish. I tried the beef tataki and a plain udon. The tataki had great presentation, and nice flavor. The udon was better than most udon I've had, but did not have me salivating nor did it leave me wanting more. I'd only come here again for lunch, but I generally find that going out for udon isn't really worth the time or money."
12/22/2016,20161222,4,4.26,"Hopefully one of your friends can get there early and jot your name down since there's always a long wait. Just like Daikokuya expect at least 30 minutes. Can't come here starvin like Marvin who's about to pass out when your stomach is swallowing you inward.We were lucky and our friend had arrived 20 mins earlier than us and had our name down so we waited only 10 mins by the time we were seated.We ordered the beef udon, uni udon, and cold udon. The cold udon was the best!! The noodles are so delicious and chewy since they're made fresh in house. When I tried the cold udon soba, the noodles were on point with the soba soup. The uni udon was good, but obviously on the heavier side. The beef udon was my least favorite. Think Yoshinoya beef with udon in a soup that's kinda oily and soysaucey. Ended up being too heavy for me. Pretty good noodles I must say!"
12/22/2016,20161222,3,4.26,"I love eating here. My boyfriend and I have been coming here for the past 4 years now, and it's our favorite udon place in LA. The noodles are amazing and almost every different type of udon dish I've tried was very good. The reason I give it only three stars is because the portions of the food has gotten smaller and smaller over the years. My favorite go to udon is the uni cream pasta but the last few times I have been here there is hardly any uni in the pasta. There used to be scoops of uni in the pasta and I have old instagram photos to prove it and now it's just little specks of uni. Very disappointing, and for a dish that costs $16 I expect more than just noodles and cream. Please bring back the old portions!"

The wait is usually pretty long if you arrive around 7:30-8pm, but the wait is totally worth it! To avoid the crazy crowed outside, I usually just go to the bar down the street and grab a drink, but the line is never unbearable! I recommend either the curry udon or the uni udon which tastes like fettuccini alfredo with a Japanese twist. The noodles are very fresh and for a little entertainment, you can see the crew kneading and cutting the udon, so you know it's fresh! I would recommend coming here early if you're with a large party. It can get a little tight in there. Also on week days, they have a short break period in between lunch and dinner. They close at 2:30pm and open up again at 5:00-5:30ish, but are open all day on the weekends! Won't ever stop coming here!"

Also, this place seems to always have a line (like the ramen place next door), but we waited about 30 mins when we came. I'd just say to stay away at high traffic times like weekend and weekday peak dinner times. You probably still have to wait, but it will probably be shorter. The first struggle I had here was what to order. Everyone raves about the uni cream udon, but I don't like uni and I don't like cream-based sauces very much. What then? Not as many of the reviews talk about the non-creamy types of udon. After much deliberation, I decided to get the Vongole udon, as it was one of their special udons and I really wanted to try one of those (it comes with white wine clam broth). Also, it has clams in it and clams are delicious! They were also offering a Hot Dragon Udon which looked pretty good, and a Kinoko Cream Udon (full of mushrooms) which looked really good to me too. One of the other people in my group got the uni cream udon, because he likes both uni and cream based sauces. We also got a pork belly rice bowl and the jidori tempura eggs to share. I personally thought that the Vongole udon was decent but I'd order something else next time. The udon noodles are so good though, the texture of them is springy and amazing. Also, the uni cream udon was absolutely delicious. It is kind of an indescribable flavor, but it was really quite good. I think if you're someone who doesn't like cream-based sauces much, it might be a good idea to get a cream-based one to share with someone, and then one with clearer soup. That way, you can try more of the udon dishes and also not be overwhelmed by the cream-based ones (which are very filling). The pork belly rice bowl was also really delicious - I'd recommend trying that as well. The jidori tempura eggs were interesting, but I don't know that I'd get them again. The crunch and the texture of the egg were interesting, but it was pretty flavorless and I think I'd like to try some of the other sides they have on the menu. I'd definitely come back here again, and try some of the other udons. I get the feeling that are other very delicious udon dishes on the menu! Which means that I'll have to visit a few more times to figure out which one I like the most. I'd like to try some of the other cream-based ones, and then also maybe the more regular ones like beef udon. Also, it's really cool to see the chefs making the udon right in front of you!"

Portion is pretty big, so don't order too many sides. We also got the octopus and egg tempura and they're good too. One disappointment is their iced green tea is canned tea, not real green tea. Line already formed before they open. We came 10 minutes before they open and we were lucky to get the last first seating table. If you don't get the first seating, the wait is another 30-40 mins. When we got out, the wait list is already 1 page."
12/31/2016,20161231,3,4.27,"What I've ordered: Uni Udon, Carbonara, Curry Udon, Beef Udon. I came here recently again and noticed that the portions have become noticeably smaller! It was disappointing, especially after waiting for over an hour. The wait was not worth it IMO. Parking is metered and can be found on the street or in the garage."
1/1/2017,20170101,5,4.27,"I'm more of a ramen lover, but booooooy is this place a game changer! /foodI've tried several dishes from Monzo and they never disappoint! First and foremost, you HAVE to try the braised pork belly (appetizer) At first I was hesitant about it, but as soon as you see it- or better yet, smell it- your mouth will water! The first bite is literally an explosion of umami. UghHhhh pure bliss. They have the best tempura ever. I always have to add on some shrimp tempura, mushroom, and nori! They're always crispy and add a great crunch to whatever udon you decide on! It always goes well with my beef udon / shrimp tempura udon.The carbonara udon is literally not even udon. Like a thick pasta. A beautiful, thick pasta with pork that descended from heaven. The cheese gratin udon is not even an udon. It's like a gooey, hearty, cheesy main course with a side of noodles. The amount of cheese will drown your tastebuds - but hey, i'm not complaining! It's better to share this dish with others too as the amount of cheese might get a tad bit overwhelming. /wait-timeSo far i've been pretty lucky when it comes to getting seated. My boyfriend and I usually come when it opens and there's barely anyone. However, the place does end up getting filled by the time we're finished with our meal. We came in during a rush hour PLUS it was raining, but the waitlist went by pretty fast and they're usually on top of cleaning tables and whatnot./parkingWhenever I go Little Tokyo, I usually park in one of those parking lots near the RIF LA shoe store (on 2nd Street). Parking has a flat rate of $5 if you go after 4PM on a weekday, I believe. I usually like to walk and shop around the stores before and after I eat at Monzo, so I find the parking location very convenient"
1/2/2017,20170102,4,4.27,"It can be both a blessing and a curse that Marugame Monzo is situated right next door to the ever so popular ramen spot Daikokuya. This creates a massive wait outside on the sidewalk, but on the bright side, you can put your name down on the wait list at both places and see which one calls first like we did! The wait on a Thursday night was about an hour. We started with the pork belly appetizer. For around ~$6-7, this dish came with 4 huge pieces of pork belly. Soo meaty and delicious! Super worth it for the price.I got the uni udon. It was tasty! However, coming from SF I'd have to say the uni udon at Udon Mugizo back in Japantown SF is comparable. I kind of wish I tried another udon since I can get pretty much the same thing in SF but I wanted to see for myself if this would be better. It honestly is about the same! I also added a soft boiled egg for $1.50. Didn't realize it was supposed to be tempura battered. Disappointingly, it was not runny at all and was extremely bland. I tried a bite of my bf's curry udon and it tasted good. Nice and spicy curry flavor.We were lucky enough to be seated directly in front of the chefs making the udon. Their noodles are made in house and it was awesome being able to watch them make it! Service was quick and efficient, and our food came out in a timely manner."
1/2/2017,20170102,4,4.27,"Udon here is somehow very creamy, most off the dishes here are all about creamy. I like the services. It just gets so packed throughout the night. Its an hr wait average if u r lucky. They open at 5 but ppl already waiting since 430pm so eventhought u come at 5, u still gona end up waiting for an hour to get in."
1/2/2017,20170102,5,4.27,"UNI UDON. I'm honestly not a fan of uni on its own but when you mix it with noodles/pasta the combination is so delicious. The noodles here are made from scratch, you can see the chef in the back making them. The noodles are such great quality and al dente. The ""soup"" is a heavy cream base so it's more of a pasta styled Alfredo type dish. It's a subtle and creamy dish and I would recommend it even if you're not a fan of the uni.Great restaurant in little tokyo. The line is pretty long but it goes by fast. I'm definitely gonna check out the other dishes!"
1/2/2017,20170102,4,4.27,"The wait was long because this is a popular spot. The udon was pretty good. You can definitely taste the difference in their udon being hand made right there vs. other places. The sea urchin soup base was good. The first few bites were good, but because of the creaminess, too much of it destroys the satisfaction you have in the first few bites. Also they don't have several plates, such as the beef tataki, during lunch. Those are served after 5pm. It'll be better if they serve those during lunch too."
1/3/2017,20170103,5,4.27,"If you like creamy dishes, definitely try out some of the signature udon dishes here. We came on a Friday night around 6:30pm, and the wait was about 1.5 hours. Located right next to Daikokuya, the crowd of people outside the 2 restaurants was pretty crazy!We ended up just walking around Little Tokyo and grabbing some happy hour drinks at a bar nearby to pass the time. We ordered the: + Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($16.95): SO, SO DELICIOUS!! But I'm hesitant on if it's worth $17. While I'm really glad I got to try it, I think it is a bit overpriced. The udon noodles are hand made in front of you and are very high quality. They're perfectly chewy! You're not given too much sea urchin in this dish though. But the fish eggs add great flavor that complement the creamy sauce and the noodles. + Miso Carbonara Udon ($12.50): This was unfortunately very bland next to the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. It tasted like any other carbonara pasta you can get. The only special thing about it was the udon noodles themselves. + Tempura Soft-Boiled Egg ($1.50): This was rather bland. I love the concept because I absolutely LOVE soft-boiled eggs, but it didn't impress me too much.Overall, if you're lucky and don't need to wait and love creamy dishes, definitely give this a try!"
1/3/2017,20170103,4,4.27,"Listen I do not like uni. It's frick'n gross. Nor do I like ikura salmon eggs. Both of those just freak me out.. However this is the SECOND time I've ordered the uni cream udon at Marugame Monzo and slurped it right up bc it's so good! It's just really really heavy.. Which doesn't make sense bc it's a soup! Well not exactly soup.. It's like a nabeyaki udon and fettuccini alfredo had a baby.. To be honest I wasn't too enthused to come here the first time.. Like an udon shop? It seemed kind of boring esp since my in laws make the best nabeyaki udon in the world.. But nope. These bowls of udon are unlike anything I've had before.. I haven't eaten at every restaurant in Lil Tokyo but I'm working my tummy around and this place is definitely a must.. You'll find a better meal here than it's overhyped neighbor to it's right if you ask me.. Anyway back to the uni cream udon.. The cooked uni (unlike raw) I like! And I can't eat the ikura on it's own bc it's too fishy but one egg in a spoonful of udon is just enough flavor.. Esp with a torn piece of shiso to cut the creaminess.. Next time I come I'm gonna ask for a shiso leaf on the side.. It just takes your bite to the next level.. it's so refreshing! But anyway I really enjoy this dish.. And it's so unique!Hiro got the clam udon which is phenomenal.. I often will go for clam linguini when we eat Italian but this puts all those to shame.. like I know this is not clam linguini but it's the best damn clam linguini I've had lol.. the broth is suuuuper flavorful with the wine and the tons of green onion.. the clams themselves were very fresh.. last time we had the mentaiko squid butter udon which was good but the clam is much better.. Both times we came here we also got the fatty tuna rice bowl which comes covered in a teriyaki like sauce and Japanese mayo and seaweed.. So good! Super heavy but good!I love the ambience in here too.. Especially how you can see one of the line guys front and center behind a glass window hand making all the udon noodles.. Rolling out the dough SUPER evenly, which as an amateur cinnamon roll baker I know is tough to do.. and then cutting all the noodles with measurements by eye.. That's skill.. It's fun to watchThe only thing that I don't really appreciate about this place is that if you're not there when the host calls your name to seat you, they'll move you to the bottom of the list.. Like so we were quoted 30 min and walked around a bit and came back in 25, and our name was crossed out and when we told the host and he was like ""Dude where were you bro"" and sat 4 other ppl before us.. Which lucky for us I guess the wait wasn't super bad by that time.. But like when we first got there these 2 ladies were really mad that they got moved to the bottom bc the wait was way longer.. I mean I guess I could understand if you were terribly late but if you were there by the time you were quoted wgaf like relax.. There's a lot of cute shops to fill your time while waiting for your table they should be considerate.. No one wants to wait on the side walk for half an hour in the cold for their table to open up bc there's not enough room to wait inside.. Anyway, I feel like that's really bad customer service.. Oh actually one more thing I don't like is the spoons. Lol!! You get a MASSIVE bowl of udon here so naturally your spoon is massive too.. but the broth in the clam udon is too good to give up like I wanted to scoop as much from my bowl that I could but the spoon is too rounded like so when you only have a couple of inches of soup in your bowl, you're not going to be able to get at it with your spoon bc the curve of the spoon is too pronounced and the spoon itself is too fat lol.. The regular, thinner Japanese soup spoons with the flat bottom would be much better. I'm laughing at nitpicking this but it's valid. Like the spoon should be functional down to picking up the last drops in your bowl. But it's fine I'm just greedy lol"
1/5/2017,20170105,4,4.27,"In terms of udon, there are only two places in Los Angeles that's worth going to: Marugame Monzo in Los Angeles and Oumi Sasaya in Lomita. However the fact is the texture of the udon here is slightly better than that of Oumi Sasaya's which I will explain:Food: Duck Udon with OnionsThe udon at Oumi Sasaya is good make no mistake; it is chewy, firm and is not saturated with the broth at all. However, the udon noodles at Marugame Monzo is of a higher quality in terms of its texture: it is firm too but it is slightly chewier than the udon at Oumi Sasaya which makes it more wholesome to eat. The broth here is light and very flavorful. The pieces of duck could be more tender but when you have a broth like they do here, usually the duck is cooked for a long time to make the broth therefore it's a case of you win some but lose some at the same time. Price:The bowl cost $16 which is the same price at Oumi Sasaya; therefore I'd say the price here is fair. Ambiance:No frills or whistles here; it's simply a mom and pop shop that is small, cozy and humbly decorated with people lining up all the way out the door.I highly recommend coming here if you're a fan of udon; you won't regret it."
1/5/2017,20170105,5,4.27,The BEST udon I have ever had in my life. Nothing can beat handmade udon made right before your eyes. The sea urchin cream udon was so creamy and rich in flavor! Could have used a bit more sea urchin but besides that overall I would highly recommend this one!My other friend ordered this squid sautéed in this butter sauce that was so rich in flavor that wanted us having more and more.These sauces paired with handmade udon was to die for. I honestly suggest for them to open multiple stores cause I would most definitely come by all the time.Only downside about this place is parking sucks and the wait time is pretty long but I would recommend at least trying the place out once!
1/5/2017,20170105,4,4.27,"Somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. What can I say, udon't wanna get between me and my udon. For my first impression of LA grub, Monzo did it good. Got in line for this place at 4:30 and was already third in line for its opening at 5:00. By the time that ""Closed"" sign was finally flipped to ""Open"" the line had already extended to butt into next-door-neighbor Daikokuya's. FOODBegin the pig I am, I ordered negitoro appetizer and the squid udon. Sadly, the udon came out practically the same time as the negitoro appetizer, which led to alternating eating between the two for fear the noodles would become lukewarm and less appetizing. For $6 the negitoro is easily sharable between two to three people -- a big scoop of toro, served alongside sprouts, cucumber slivers, and six pieces of dried seaweed. Make your own wraps! Wasn't amazing but the portion size was bigger than anticipated.Now I don't know why people are talking about the price point of the udon here. $12~ for more pieces of squid than I can count, cooked with hand-made udon and drowned in cooked smelted eggs. This is splendidly crafted food, for a more than acceptable price. The pieces of squid were tender and although I was initially wary that the addition of butter would destroy the delicacy innate to Japanese cuisine, the recipe incorporated the fat in a thoughtful way that ultimately enhanced the flavor of the noodles without overpowering the dish. It added a nice body that was much appreciated in this cold January weather! My only complaint was that the udon was actually not as chewy as I anticipated. But I think the other aspects of the dish still left me impressed.SERVICEPrompt and polite. They are obviously used to such a busy customer base, and handle orders speedily, all while refilling my tea cup multiple times. (No hot water, only hot tea.) Nothing to complain about here, only familiarity and warmth and lilting Japanese-accented English.This one's a keeper, LA! Don't lose it!"
1/5/2017,20170105,5,4.27,"This is the only restaurant I will eat at when visiting Little Tokyo. Heck I'm writing this as I'm eating here right now! My two favorites are:- Hot Dragon: Great for you spicy lovers out there. Don't expect burning hot spice, but an enjoyable, good amount. This is my go to udon every time I come. I like to add lots of chili flakes to really amp up the spice. The broth is very rich and flavorful, and the ground beef and bean sprouts complement the udon so well. The portion is also pretty big as it leaves me feeling really full. Highly recommend this! - Udon Gratin: I get this when I'm in the mood for something creamy and cheesy. Definitely try the Uni Udon first if you want something creamy since it seems to be the most popular, but if you're not a big fan of Uni like myself, then I highly recommend this one as well. Because this udon is rather rich, the cheesiness and creaminess can become overwhelming so I recommend sharing it with a friend. It's served in the same dish that it's baked in so it'll always come out piping hot with the cheese golden on top and nice and gooey once you dig in. The chicken is very moist and the onions add a delightful slight crunch to the udon. Along with the superb food, the service here is fantastic as well. Despite the place constantly being full of customers. the staff always try to serve you as promptly as possible. They are very attentive and sweet, making the experience here even better! Delicious food, great service, and wonderful atmosphere all for an affordable price. You will not regret coming here! Tips: This place almost always has a long line. I usually come 10-15 minutes before it opens at 5 on weekdays, or else be prepared to wait at least 20-30 min. I recommend sitting at the bar if you can to watch the noodles being prepared. Also, parking is quite a challenge, but I usually park at John Aiso Parking Lot, which only charges $2 for the first hour and always has parking. It's not far from Monzo too. Just have to cross the street and go straight down. However, I believe that after the first hour or two, the price doubles for every additional hour, but don't quote me on this. Great place to park if you just want to come and eat."
1/6/2017,20170106,5,4.27,"We have been here to eat a handful of times but this will be our first written review. We don't return to many restaurants unless because I often have much critique as a former chef. For us, the fact that we continue to eat here speaks highly. Fair warning, the wait can be lengthy which often times a sign of good food. It's located in a bustling area downtown in Little Tokyo. We arrived at 2:45 on Sunday afternoon and waited 15 minutes for a table. They request you write your name down on a list just inside the door and wait outside to be called. Names are called quickly as tables turnover at a rapid pace. The dining room has simple furniture making it easy for them to clean and flip for another seating. The focus is easily directed towards the exhibition kitchen where action is a constant. The udon is handmade in a viewable location and attracts the wandering eye. The food is simple, handmade noodles served in a variety of bases. Options on the menu range from extra creamy to bold and spicy. We shared two specials, the Kinoko Cream Udon and the Hot Dragon Udon. It was lunchtime and apparently they don't serve their house-pickled vegetables during the day, but we have had them before and they are fantastic! The Kinoko was served with a variety of mixed mushrooms in a rich creamy sauce. The sauce lacquered and stuck to the noodles with ease. This provided a balance between the perfectly cooked starch and the heavy, fatty sauce. The Hot Dragon provided opposing flavors. The udon was served in a spicy pork broth and topped with stir-fried bean sprouts, Chinese chives and spicy ground pork. The spicy and bold broth served as a excellent compliment to the handmade noodles. I enjoy aromatic, flavorful and strongly seasoned foods so this was an excellent choice for me! Overall we had another joyful experience and decided it was appropriate to share. We will definitely return again! Hope this review is helpful!"
1/8/2017,20170108,4,4.27,"The sea urchin udon that I usually order was sooo good,the hot and dragon udon was a little bit salted that normal,its hard to find a street parking and always a line outside."
1/8/2017,20170108,5,4.27,"Love the chewiness of the freshly made udon. Today I had the Ume Shiso which was perfectly balanced combination of sour, salty and slightly bitter favors. Loved the pork belly on rice too!"
1/8/2017,20170108,5,4.27,"Such delicious udon, I got the udon grati, melted cheese paired so well with the homemade noodles! 10/10 reccomend. One of my favorite meals ever! There will be a wait around .5-1 hr on Saturday night"
1/8/2017,20170108,5,4.27,"We had the uni udon, fried chicken skin, pork belly udon, and the baby octopus on the stick. All is a must try and the service was wonderful! Will return back when we're visiting LA again!"
1/9/2017,20170109,4,4.27,"This place solely focuses on different types of udon!It gets really packed, especially since their next door neighbor is also insanely popular.I came here solely to try their unique fusion udons and it did not disappoint; their portions are also very filling.Uni udon: Probably their most recognized dish from IG. The sauce was very rich and creamy, however the uni taste was masked. There were very tiny amounts of uni ""chunks"", so it if you're new to uni this may be a good starting dish to try. Carbonara udon: Tastes exactly as it sounds, creamy pasta with udon substitute. They added a good amount of bacon to the sauce.We also ordered a side of a fried soft boiled egg, not something you commonly see on the menu. The egg could have been runnier but definitely would compliment udons that aren't super creamy."
1/9/2017,20170109,5,4.27,"amazing food, good luck with the wait i recommend you get here early."
1/14/2017,20170114,4,4.27,"Long overdue and mistakenly overlooked. Went here in June 2015, and I was reminded of this place after looking at my old Instagram photos. Went here for my birthday, because I wanted to watch the udon chef create the udon noodles, which is a feature at their restaurant... a viewing window visible from the dining area.That's a nice treat while waiting for your food to come. It's a small place, but nice and clean. The udon servings are huge, perhaps meant to be shared? Not sure because it comes with one soup ladle. A huge one, in fact. We ordered a very basic beef udon, saving the mentai for my next visit. We also ordered the fried chicken skin, a side of tempura soft boiled egg and a little seafood birdsnest. We had a nice dinner because the food was delicious and presented nicely, and we got to watch fresh udon being made. I'd go again definitely to try the other famous udon dishes and for that chicken skin. Good lord, that was good!I don't remember if the service was good or bad. But I do remember wanting to come back soon, so it must've been decent."
1/15/2017,20170115,4,4.27,"The only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is how the server was serving us wouldn't let me share my meal with my kid. Since they don't serve kids meal.... and it would be a waste of food if i had to order them each 1 extra order. Never had this problem anywhere else. But other than that, the food was super delicious and that was the best udon i ever had"
1/16/2017,20170116,5,4.27,"Found out about this place through Instagram....shout out to @dinela. Next thing you know it my friend took me here and I was lucky enough to sit at the bar area where you can see them make the udon noodles. I ordered the Miso Carbonara and let's just say I was tempted to lick the bowl it was that good. Came back again this time with family. Unfortunately it took some time to be seated. I suggest coming in a pair of 2 to be seated faster. But anyways my family loved it. My brother especially liked the 6$ bowls, got to try it out next time I go."
1/18/2017,20170118,4,4.27,"Haha raining day = hot soup day and this place has been on my bookmark for awhiles now and am so happy that I finally have a chance to try this place out. The place itself is quit small but they do pack a lot of tables in here and there's also seating along the side of the kitchen so you can watch as your food is being prepared (see pics) it was pretty packed at 6:30pm on a Wednesday night but lucky us we didn't have to wait. By 7:30 the place was completely full and wait line started to form!On to the food and wow they have so many creamy udon selections...I'm definitely coming back to try more. But for this time we ordered: Sea Urchin Cream Udon, (a must here) Mentai Cream Udon, fish tempura, and takoyaki. Wow I can't rave enough about the hand made udon or the cream sauce that comes w it. The cream in the uni udon taste like roasted garlic and butter and the cream in the Mentai udon taste more like just cream. But when you combine the two like I did...wow perfection lol. I'd seriously lick the bowl clean if there weren't so many people around lol. The only complaint was the wimpy portions of uni we got and the tiny shrimps and scallops that came w the Mentai udon. But nevertheless I definitely want to come back for more! The takoyaki was crispy on the outside which was a lil diff from usual but we thought its a bit expensive for three pieces. The fish tempura was really good!Overall: if you love creamy food then this place is a must! I'll be back!"
1/18/2017,20170118,4,4.27,"Just got back from Japan and needed Udon. This doesn't disappoint. It isn't cheap, and is tightly packed, but the food is excellent. They have a ""Bukkake Udon"" I wasn't man enough to try it; the tempura udon I did have was excellent, and the tempura was perf."
1/20/2017,20170120,3,4.27,"Marugame Monzo is right next to Daikokuya, so you have the choice between authentic, fresh udon or ramen with these neighboring businesses. They do not take reservations, and the wait is usually at least an hour. Although there is a line out the door, you need to enter inside and write your name down on the list at the host stand before you wait in line.+ NEGITORO DON: This is a pretty hefty appetizer as a bed of rice topped with fatty tuna, green onions, and drizzled eel sauce & mayo combo all over. This was my favorite of my meal! Even though they are known for their udon, I think this dish is definitely a reason I would come back. If you are not a fan of mayo, I would not order this dish. ~ MENTAI SQUID BUTTER UDON: The squid was cooked very well and was not too chewy or overdone. It had the consistency of a soft fish, which was amazing! However, I did not really like how buttery this dish was. Yes, I realize I ordered the BUTTER udon, but I felt like the taste did not belong in a ""udon"" dish. I basically tried to eat the udon with the squid without the liquid, because I didn't drink my broth at all. Because of how I felt about this, I didn't even want to try my friend's seafood tomato cream udon. He said it was like normal pasta but with thicker noodles. Although they specialize in their hand made udon noodles and have a wide variety in their udon offerings, I did not really enjoy it. If I were to return and endure the wait, I would probably go with their traditional options and get the negitoro don again."
1/20/2017,20170120,3,4.27,"It was okay.Maybe because I'm not the biggest sea urchin fan... Or have had it enough to say that I enjoy it so much, but the idea of this place is pretty chill. Udon noodles in place of pasta for certain dishes or you can enjoy regular hot/cold udon dishes here.I only see myself coming here again if a friend wanted to try... Other than that, I think I'll have to pass."
1/21/2017,20170121,5,4.27,We crave the shrimp tempura udon and make the drive to LA several times each year to enjoy lunch and shopping in little tokyo. Be prepared to wait during busy times because you aren't the only one who wants this yummy food. :)Watching your noodles being freshly prepared is exhilarating!
1/22/2017,20170122,5,4.27,Great udon. The only udon I have had but it's great. The wait times are very long ~1 hour. But the Far Bar next door is the perfect place to grab a drink while waiting for your table.
1/23/2017,20170123,5,4.27,"The only reason I've been to Monzo only 4 times instead of 100 is due to the understandably long lines that begin to form way before the restaurant opens. In my past experiences, I've ordered the mentai cream udon, sea urchin udon, and pork belly over rice. I'm not a huge fan of udon generally but the only udon I find myself craving is the one served at Monzo due to their rich creamy broth and magical flavors. The pork belly served here as part of a combination in their lunch menu is also amazing, I highly recommend ordering that with your udon and I guarantee you'll experience the most sublime, out-of-body food coma experience."
1/23/2017,20170123,5,4.27,"Hands down the best thing I ate on my LA trip. I'm not the hugest fan of udon, sometimes I find a bit bland but these specialty udon are out of this world. We were a little afraid of how long the wait would be on a Saturday night when we rolled up at around 6:30. We put our names down and had 7 parties in front of us and were ready to wait. Surprisingly, we only waited about 15 minutes. The service is very speedy and they get you in and out quick. My party and I all decided to get the specialty udon. My friends has the miso carbonara, uni cream, and I got the tomato seafood cream udon and oh mannn, was it good. It wasn't just any normal tomato cream sauce you'd get at an Italian restaurant definitely had some sort of tangy broth added to it. The seafood included scallops and shrimp and the sauce was plentiful. Both my friends enjoyed theirs immensely as well. One thing to note is that the uni udon is a smaller portion and a higher cost and the miso carbonara was a little on the smaller side compared to mine. I'll be back one day for sure-~"
1/24/2017,20170124,5,4.27,"Love this place! My daughter and I were craving Udon, so I reached out to some trusted Yelp friends for suggestions, and it was unanimous... Marugame Monzo in Little Tokyo! When I heard they make the Udon by hand right there, I felt pretty confident that this place would be legit.We have made the trek from the Valley to Little Tokyo 4 times in 14 days for this Udon which A) makes us regulars...the staff is already saying, ""see you next week,"" when we leave... and B) Should give you an idea of how good this place is. I'd say it's pretty easy to like Udon, but Marugame Monzo takes it to a whole other level!Several reviews mentioned the long wait times, and this has been the case. On Friday or Saturday night you can easily be waiting for an hour. If this scares you away...good! LOL!!! You write your name on the wait list, and then you can take a walk, but if you are not there when your name is called, they scratch you completely off the list. They close at 10pm and around 9:20 they will still let you on the list with no guarantee of being seated. We also learned that when it's late, a lot of people on the list have bailed so it can move fast. One night around 9:45pm there were over 10 parties on the list ahead of us...none of them were there! It is a pretty small place with several tables, plus bar seating that looks into the open kitchen. They actually hand-make the udon noodles fresh right there. If you are lucky enough to sit at the bar you can watch them roll out the dough and cut it into long stands of udon goodness! The first night we both got the Kakuni Udon. This is a hot udon soup with a light broth and huge chunks of really good Braised Pork. The pork has a slight sweetness to it and I was very happy with this dish! Then the table of 6 next to us, all ordered the Vongole Udon and I had serious food envy...LOL The next time I did get the Vongole Udon and this is my favorite so far! Udon in a light seafood broth and topped with about 10 good sized clams with the shells. This is a ""Wow"" dish for me! A generous amount of clams, on top of the handmade udon noodles, plus the broth is amazing. There is a hot red pepper in the broth which gives it just a slight kick. I literally drink it all! I also had the Uni Udon. This was excellent as well. The broth is like an uni bisque. Very thick and creamy with great flavor! The soup is topped with a small leaf garnish and fish eggs. My only complaint is that I felt like it was missing substance without any pork or seafood...so I added Shrimp Tempura. Speaking of which...my daughter LOVES the Shrimp Tempura Udon. This is in a light seafood broth with 2 large pieces of Shrimp Tempura on the side.For sides I have gotten the Shrimp Tempura which is amazing... Soft Boiled Egg Tempura is great, but ask for some salt to season it. The Steak Tataki is just OK. A generous portion of sliced rare steak. A little bit of work to chew, but not a deal breaker. Overall this place is a great value! I think the Uni Udon was the most expensive dish we tried at $14.95. Usually the 2 of us get out of there for around $30. A lot of people park in the structure for the outdoor Japanese Mall half a block up and across the street. We park in the pay lot a block behind behind the restaurant. Enter the lot from Judge John Aiso St. It is always pretty empty they charge a flat $6 or $7 dollars. If you get there after 8pm the attendant is usually gone so it is free."
1/25/2017,20170125,5,4.27,"This place is so good! We came here on a Saturday around 3 pm and waited for about 45 minutes. So, yes it was quite the wait but the food was definitely worth it. I don't remember the exact name of the dish I got and it was a special so its not listed on the regular menu but basically it was Udon Noodles with mushrooms in a creamy mushroom sauce and I added a soft boiled egg. It was delicious and the noodles tasted very fresh. I loved how you can see them making the noodles in the back of the restaurant. My kids both had the traditional Udon Noodles and they said it was good and they ate every bite. The dining area is small so it does feel a little cramped but the food more than makes up for that. So if you are prepared to wait for some amazing udon, this is your place."
1/26/2017,20170126,5,4.27,"first off, I can't even begin to describe how much of life has to be altered to be Vegetarian/occasionally Pescetarian. The most crucial modifications comes to view most especially during exploration of international cuisine. it's alarming how many soups are pork or beef or chicken based! That being said, Monzo's base for the soups are made of vegetable or fish! So come one, come all, because being vegetarian/pescetarian no longer means you can't have soup!My absolute favorite dish, though, is the Uni Udon (aka Seafood Cream Udon). The freshly made udon noodles are just perfectly cooked and they do not skimp on the uni!TIP: there is a long wait on the weekends, so to avoid the long wait, come super early for dinner or come for lunch."
1/27/2017,20170127,4,4.27,"Yummy udon place in Little Tokyo! I have been to Marugame Monzo three times so far. The wait can be a bit long, especially during busy times like lunch + dinner, so I highly recommend coming early to beat the crowd. The restaurant is also very small, so they can only seat so many people at a time.The first two times I went I got the sea urchin cream udon which is SO GOOD! I'm not even a huge seafood lover, but I loved their sea urchin udon. Unfortunately last time I went I had an allergic reaction and my lips got a little puffy so I may be allergic to sea urchin :(I went back recently with some friends and decided to get the carbonara udon instead. It was a nice, indulgent alternative for the sea urchin since it still had that thick, creamy broth like the sea urchin, just with bacon instead. That might be my new go-to dish at Margume Monzo.Service is decent. They will try to kick you out if you've been sitting there too long after your meal because the wait gets so backed up that they need to turn around tables as soon as they can.Parking sucks since it's Little Tokyo. I always park in a garage nearby that's $10. Good luck finding any street parking."
1/28/2017,20170128,4,4.27,"We came on a Saturday night. The wait was 25 minutes for party of two. Parking is tricky and we opted for a valet across which was 15$. We ordered the uni udon and mentai udon, plus chicken skin and clam appetizer. The udon is good and the soup broth is rich. I would say it's better than what I had in Westwood. Nice staff and attentive service."
1/29/2017,20170129,5,4.27,"I always have to wait at least an hour to eat here but I would happily do it again and again in the future. Parking is a nightmare. You have to find street parking (come on, parking karma) or pay for a parking structure. I usually park in the Yogurtland/Office Depot parking lot and buy something small to validate parking (but it still costs a dollar or two to park).This is a tiny udon noodle place in the Little Tokyo area. The dress code is very casual. Tables are squished very close together so tuck your elbows in unless you're trying to knock out your neighbor.The udon is made fresh here daily in their kitchen in the back area (it has glass windows so you can see the chefs working away). The most popular dishes are the creamy uni udon and the squid butter udon. Both are amazing in their own way. The uni noodle bowl is creamy like an alfredo sauce. The squid butter is savory in a brothy kind of way. The uni can become overwhelmingly creamy, though, so you may want to get the uni and the squid butter and split them with a friend. The udon noodles are always chewy and cooked al dente.I tried the tempura and soft boiled eggs and I would NOT recommend these. Just stick with the udon noodles and skip any overpriced add-ons and you won't go wrong."
1/31/2017,20170131,5,4.27,"Food: Before and after going to Japan, this place is still, hands down, my favorite udon spot. This place is probably as authentic as it gets. They literally make the udon noodles right in front of you, as the noodle maker stands behind a clear glass with a view of the kitchen. It's pretty intriguing being able to see the process of making fresh udon noodles. Ultimately, I've drive different types, but my palette has always been in love with the uni cream udon. It's rich creaminess is just absolutely amazing! I've tried a lot of different uni dishes, but this by far, stills wins #1. Service: The servers are always wonderful. They greet you when you come in. They're quick and efficient. They pay attention to when you need any other service or refill. Out of all the times I've been here, I've never been dissatisfied - even on bush days. Ambiance: The ambiance is beautiful. It's not too fancy, and is very clean from what I had experience. It is a small location, but nonetheless, I feel nostalgic every time I go inside because it reminds me of places I've been to in Tokyo."
1/31/2017,20170131,4,4.27,"I've been here a few times and have liked it every time! It's usually pretty crowded, so definitely come early if possible. You can see them making the udon inside if you're lucky and it's a good way to pass the time while you're waiting. As for food, I prefer the cold udon, but I've tried the others when my friends order them and I've never disliked them. Definitely a go to if you're craving noodles or udon."
2/2/2017,20170202,5,4.27,"Oh my what a gem this place is. My friend and I only waited for about 10 minutes. We were seated and immediately offered drinks. The staff is really sweet & attentive. I got the curry udon and my friend got the sea urchin, both were delicious! We also had the pickles and thee monzo caprese. Overall, definitely recommend this place. The drive and wait are definitely worth it. The servers are so nice, they kept asking us if we wanted more tea/was everything okay. Definitely going back !"
2/3/2017,20170203,4,4.27,"This place is legit. Hand cut udon you can observe From the window and it's delicious. Most of the staff is friendly but the last time I was here the waitress is rude as hell. She no longer works here. Wonder why? Be prepared for a wait. I see people putting down names here and at Daikokuya (next door) and seeing which one hits first. I prefer this place. Highlights: - Uni udon, creamy and flavorful. My go to. - traditional beef/shrimp udon, classic and done very well - Fried chicken skin, delicious as an appetizer. - Pork rice bowl, get it with your udon. Just do it."
2/3/2017,20170203,5,4.27,"Wonderful experience. We sat at the bar so we got to watch the noodles being made as we ate. The wait staff was good at their jobs. The food was delicious. I ordered the pork belly hot udon I don't even have words for how delicious the pork belly was. If i had to find something negitive it wpuld be that the place is small, but no biggie."
2/4/2017,20170204,4,4.27,"Went to go eat this udon place yesterday because a friend recommended it. We arrived at around 6 so it was a short wait but by the time we left at 7, the line was really long! Would recommend going earlier to avoid the long line.Ordered the beef udon, udon gratin, and the pork belly donburi. Their service is really fast and we got our food in less than 10 minutes. The pork belly donburi was really flavorful, especially with the shichimi, and the pork flavor seeped onto the rice so it was well worth it!The beef udon had a sweeter soup base than I expected but the noodles were very chewy and the meat was a great addition to each bite. My friend had the udon gratin and he said it was an interesting experience. It's an udon dish with a creamy sauce, topped with cheese and chicken, and baked. It was definitely something different to try!"
2/4/2017,20170204,4,4.27,"Came here after doing a tour with the LA Conservancy. I was starving and was dreading the inevitable wait to get a seat. Family was in from out of town and wanted to come here, so I had no choice but to brace myself for that wait.It turned out to be a 20 minute wait, not too bad. Once we ordered, the food came out fairly quickly. Our party ordered takoyaki, beef udon, and shrimp tempura udon. We wanted keep our order simple and straight to the point, so the fusion udons were not on our radar. Besides, things like butter, sea urchin roe, etc. just didn't sound very appetizing paired with udon, at least not for me.The takoyaki was too greasy. Hubby thought the shrimp tempura was greasy as well. To be honest, I didn't notice whether the tempura was greasy because I literally inhaled it, I was so hungry. I did pay special attention to the udon noodles. Would the fact they were handmade really shine through? The good: the noodles were perfectly al dente and had a nice texture.  The freshness was definitely there.The not so good: Hubby thought they were bland and I could see his point. The flavor didn't have that wow factor. I didn't care for all the tempura chips in my udon, either, especially since my noodles already came with shrimp tempura on the side. It made the broth too oily. I would have preferred some egg or kamaboko instead.Other family members loved their udon, however. Loved it. So my four star rating is an average across four people. I'm being inclusive in my rating, ha! I don't think I'd return, mostly because I really dislike having to wait so long to get a seat. Also, the place is very small, so you are sitting pretty close to other customers which is just awkward. I do wish I could have seen the noodle making in action but only people seated at the bar had that option."
2/4/2017,20170204,5,4.27,"I always bring my food loving out of town visitors here because it's always a hit. Typically I hate Asian fusion food, but Monzo has that perfect balance where both Italian and Japanese styles of cooking are not overwhelming in the same dish. They also have dishes that are packed full of flavor or dishes that are light and delicate in flavor, yet no less delicious. This is all before you take into account the fresh house made udon.With popularity comes the downside of long waits during peak times. I usually will come here if I can get there before 6pm to avoid the 1+ hr wait."
2/4/2017,20170204,4,4.27,"If you are craving good Udon. I definitely recommend going to this place. Their udon is ""teuchi"" udon - meaning hand made udon. I had Mentai Squid Butter Udon, Sea Urchin Udon and Porcini Mushroom Udon. They are all really good. I would like to try regular Udon next time."
2/5/2017,20170205,4,4.27,"The restaurant is very small and quaint. Sometimes you'll feel a little squished at the tables as they are in close proximity. I prefer to sit at the bar because it is more spacious and you get to see the workers make the udon right in front of you! Squid butter udon is to die for. The squid is so tender and soft. The broth, noodles, and squid go so well together."
2/5/2017,20170205,5,4.27,One of the BEST handmade undon noodles EVER!!!Love the cream broth soup with mushroom!
2/6/2017,20170206,5,4.27,"Originally when my gf suggested we should try this place, I thought it was just a fad and the part that you can see the chefs making the fresh udon in front of you was just to create hype but after having eaten here so many times in the past year, it really is one of the best udon restaurants I've ever been to. The texture of the noodles is amazing and the variety of flavors makes me want to keep coming back to try something new. So far my favorites would be the Mentai Squid Butter, Uni Cream, and the Miso Carbonara. The prices are fair considering the portions are pretty large. The place is a bit small so expect a wait if you are going during dinner time! And if it's a cold rainy day, also expect to find me there as well!"
2/7/2017,20170207,4,4.27,"Came by on a super rainy Sunday. The place didn't open until 1130, when we arrived, we were shocked to find the freakish long line of ppl already waiting there! We didn't expect that especially since it was so rainy. How early do ppl come to wait for this place? It must be a sign that its hella good. We arrived when it opened, but we waited a solid 45 min before we got seated -_- We literally were standing outside in the rain, plastered against the storefront window to avoid being wet lol. It was soo cold, wet, and windy outside, I was so jealous of the ppl inside eating. By the time it was our turn, I was just relieved and glad to be inside.Ordered the curry udon with tempura soft egg, my companion got their signature uni udon with the egg, along with the beef bowl. I have to say, the udon was perfectly chewy and delicious. The combination of curry and crispy soft boiled egg was comfort food at its best, warmed me up completely. The only downside here was the wait. Wished it wasn't so crowded...but it is Little Tokyo, should've known better :/"
2/7/2017,20170207,5,4.27,"This place is so good!! You put your name on a waitlist and when they call your name 3 times and you don't hear it, then you are crossed off the list! Because some groups didn't hear their names being called, we didn't have to wait long to get in (5 minutes). I got the duck udon and it was the most tastiest udon ever! Love it."
2/8/2017,20170208,5,4.27,"If you want fresh udon, this is the place to go. I got their uni udon and the boy got the squid udon. Both were really good. Handmade fresh noodles being prepared in front of you. The uni udon had the perfect creaminess to it that it was almost like a pasta. Inside is relatively cramped inside, but that's expected for a place in Little Tokyo. The line gets pretty long during peak hours. They have tables and bar type of seating.Service was really good. My water was refilled at least 3 or 4 times. What can I say, when a dish is packed with really good flavor, I drink a lot of water. Overall I was really impressed with this place and would come back to try the other udon. I think the one thing I was just okay with was the pork belly and rice we got as an appetizer. I thought the pork belly was going to be crispy or prepared in a different way."
2/8/2017,20170208,5,4.27,"So....my cousin has been raving about this place for awhile now. I didn't have time to check it out on my last trip. So I made sure to make time for udon this trip. First, there was a wait. We didn't wait too long. But it was totally worth it. My friend and I went there when we weren't super hungry yet knowing there would be a wait. So we put our name on the wait list. We waited maybe 15 minutes tops. We weren't sat in front of the place where they made the noodles. But pretty close. We got to watch them make the noodles. It's so cool that the udon noodles are super fresh. I couldn't decide what to order along with my friend. So I asked the server. And she suggested, I get the duck udon. And I could add a piece of tempura chicken because I was debating between duck or tempura chicken. My cousin also told me I had to add in a tempura soft boiled egg. Omg! So gooood. When the udon came, it was the perfect portion size. The broth was my favorite. I would drink that up. And I am so happy I got the duck udon. It was so yummy. I am happy, we finally made it to check it out. I definitely will recommend Marugame to any of my friends visiting LA. This is a must try in Little Tokyo. It's definitely a different experience and I love that you can see your noodles being made fresh. I loved the egg in the udon. That's a must add!"
2/8/2017,20170208,5,4.27,"I had the squid udon. I was disappointed when I saw the fish eggs cooked in the broth expecting that they would be hard and dry. The fish eggs were smooth and added great texture to the broth. The squid was tender, not tough. Hands down the best thing I have ever tasted. Absolute perfection."
2/8/2017,20170208,5,4.27,"Finally found a great udon shop in LA. My heart is happy. Came on a Friday around 1 with the bf and had to wait about 10 minutes, but nothing to complain about. Mentai squid butter udon was amazing. The squid meat was tentacle free and not too tough. The broth was nice and light, with little squid eggs throughout which I didn't mind at all. The noodles, i believe, are handmade and are perfectly chewy. I also ordered a jumbo shrimp tempura. They are not lying when they say jumbo! It was very crispy and I wish I could have tried their other tempuras.My boyfriend had the miso carbonara and said it could have had a little more miso flavor, yet was still enjoyable all the same. It's one of their more fusion dishes, with an alfredo-like sauce rather than broth. Sounds a bit weird, but it works!The only thing that was a bit uncomfortable was how close together the seats were. You may as well be dining with the people next to you as you can hear every word they are saying, but for the great food I do not mind. Marugame Monzo does not disappoint!"
2/9/2017,20170209,5,4.27,"BEST UDON OF MY LIFE!!! Noodles are so fresh and chewy and their specialty broths are one of a kind. Udon can't get any better!SEAFOOD SALAD: Started with this to get my veggies in. The salad is topped with a generous serving of seafood. In fact, the entire dish is pretty big, which I was surprised about given how affordable it was. UNI BROTH UDON: I'm not a fan of uni, but the uni broth here is to die for. It's on the heavier side as its pretty creamy, but the uni flavor has a nice kick AND it tastes super fresh. Who knew uni broth would taste so fantastic?SQUID BUTTER UDON: I ordered this and was so glad I did! This broth was lighter than the uni broth and tasted amazing. Was the perfect amount of heaviness and still packed a punch. The squid also tasted really fresh. Overall, I highly recommend this place. Plus, all the dishes are really affordable! Perfect dish for a cold day..or any day really!!"
2/9/2017,20170209,3,4.27,This ia 3.5 stars. We had ordered tempura and it was greasy. The udon we ordered was okay. The udon is fresh but other than that nothing spectacular. The service was fast but not the best... We had sampled our friend's uni udon and it was good. Too bad the champon udon we had was not very good.
2/12/2017,20170212,5,4.27,yuuuuuuuuum ! Always a delight! Wait wasn't too long this time. This time I added squid tempura to my udon.
2/12/2017,20170212,5,4.27,"So delicious and fresh.Shrimp Tempura Udon-not too heavy, flavorful, and simply delicious. Miso carbonara- thick, rich, and ""dank"" good balance of flavor. Chewy noodles with salty bacon and creamy carbonara is a good mix.Dragon noodle- omg super delicious. Very unique and umami.I'd also highly recommend the soft boiled eggs-they're lightly fried in a tempura batter. So beautiful with the broth.The service was superb and quick. I'll definitely come back soon and work the menu."
2/14/2017,20170214,5,4.27,"Excellent Udon!The Noodles and Broth were amazing!I had the Calamari and Dragon Udon, it was so good I went back a second night!"
2/14/2017,20170214,4,4.27,Came in on a Tuesday for lunch mostly because I walked into Daikokuya and saw the Cash Only sign and walked right back out and I was hungry and saw a bunch of people walk into Marugame Monzo and followed them in. I was seated immediately which was awesome and got a good look at the menu. I got the beef udon which was really good and the beef was seasoned like gyudon meat separately from the broth which made it just a tad too salty for me to drink all the broth but that's a personal preference for me at least. The noodles were bomb just like all the reviews say and a must try if you like udon.
2/16/2017,20170216,5,4.27,By far the best Udon noodle restaurant I've ever had. The line pours out the door but luckily my party had waited for only about 10mins upon opening for lunch. It is well worth the wait for daily hand made udon noodles. Tried the curry udon and the noodles surely are out of this world. Great texture and taste. You can totally tell the prime difference from a packaged udon from an asian market. The curry broth was creamy and seasoned perfectly. My wife had the sea urchin udon which she loved but i'm not a big fan of it for my taste. Portions seemed a little small but they do offer double for $2 more. Parking is hard to come by since everything is either walking distance or finding on the street. Definitely a one of a kind place with fresh ingredients and top quality. Highly recommended for soup lovers.
2/16/2017,20170216,5,4.27,"Yes, there is a wait. No, they don't take reservations. The space is tiny, but the menu is mighty. Everything looks So delicious! If it's your first time, definitely get their specialty--sea urchin udon. You won't regret it. Perfection."
2/18/2017,20170218,5,4.27,"We were visiting the Little Tokyo on a weekend getaway to Los Angeles when we came across this Udon shop across the street from the main Tokyo Village. There was a long line of people waiting to be seated; always a great sign!!!Put the name down and the air was about 40min. We were seated ahead of time. You can watch the chefs, through the glass walls, making fresh noodles that is served in large udon bowls to the customers.We ordered the curry udon, beef udon, tempura udon and one of their specialty seafood tomato udon. Every one of the soups was flavorful with a very delicate flavor. I have to admit the tempura udon was my favorite as there was the great flavor of soup, the fresh noodles and the fact that they served the crispy fluffy shrimp tempura on a separate plate so that the crispy tempura is preserved. Will definitely be back to this amazing shop."
2/18/2017,20170218,4,4.27,"My sister wanted to try this place because they are known for their handmade udon. We came on a saturday afternoon and this place was packed. We waited about an hour to an hour and a half before we got seated. The place is relatively small and there is also a bar. I ordered the takoyaki and mentai squid butter udon. The takokayi was just right. It was not undercooked or overcooked. I have been to multiple Japanese restaurants where the takoyaki just falls apart when you bit into it, but this place makes it perfectly. The only issue I had with the takoyaki was that the octopus was super tiny. It did not feel like it had any octopus at all, but it was there. I personally did not like the mentai squid butter udon. Although the soup was very good, they didn't really fill up the bowl. Compared to the other udon my siblings ordered, they definitely got a lot more soup than I did. The udons were perfect! I loved it! The squid was cooked nicely. It had a good chewiness, but not too chewy that you couldn't shallow it. They also put a lot of fish eggs in the udon. At one point it really felt like I was just drinking fish eggs rather than soup. Overall, I think this place is great, dispute how I felt about the udon that I ordered. I would come here again to try something else on the menu."
2/19/2017,20170219,5,4.27,"Great customer service! They explained that after calling your name three times they'd cross you off, but they still let us in despite being a little late. Food is good and surprisingly well priced! I got the udon Gratin, which was some sort of pasta styled udon, somewhat unexpected but still a great option! My girlfriend got the sea urchin udon, which has an incredible broth and beautiful presentation. Highly recommend! Expect to wait 30 minutes on a weekend"
2/20/2017,20170220,5,4.27,"Came during lunch hour and there was already a really long wait time. We counted 17 names before us so we decided to take a walk around to kill time and came back an hour later. There was still 7 people left so we decided to walk around a little more before coming back 20 minutes later but they had already called our names and went through around 5 more names. Fortunately the guy was super nice and said he wouldn't be able to seat us right away but he would seat us after calling a couple more people (THANK YOU).We ordered the sea urchin udon (per yelp suggestions), beef udon, and a cold udon that was on the special menu (I can't seem to remember the name; spicy dragon?). I'm usually not a big fan of udon and only enjoy the ones I've eaten in Japan but this was amazing! My Canadian friend I brought raved about the udon and complained about Canada not having something as amazing as this. I can see why the wait is so long. Even with the long wait, I look forward to coming back and trying out the rest of the menu."
2/20/2017,20170220,1,4.27,"Four words. Udon in Spaghetti Sauce.The wait and price is not worth it! We ordered one of the special Udon's - seafood tomato cream udon and the uni cream udon. We thought we were in for an exotic treat but it ended up just tasting like udon drenched in packaged fettuccine sauce. The portions were also tiny, though they disguise it by placing it in a huge bowl. Skip the line and avoid eating at this restaurant if you're not a fan of eating something you can easily make at home for half the price."
2/20/2017,20170220,4,4.27,"We got here right when this place opened on a Sunday and was able to score a seat in the first seating. Which was incredibly fortunate since then we would have had to wait a decent amount of time, especially as a party of 6. There are local parking lots and metered street parking in the area but it's also incredibly close to the Little Tokyo Gold Line station which is what I used to get to the restaurant.Everyone opted for something different. I got the miso carbonara udon which was incredibly flavorful. It is definitely rich and you will be full after the meal. The homemade noodles were the best texture and cooked to perfection. Other favorites at the table were the uni cream udon and the udon gratin which was original. Even though the regular udons are good (like the beef one at the table) the consensus was to try their signature ones since they are incredibly unique. Add a don buri for $2 if you're still hungry and you're set! I would definitely come back and try other items!!"
2/21/2017,20170221,4,4.27,"Waited like 1.5 hours only to have the guy estimate the wrong time for us and then skip our name on the waitlist, SO MY PARTY WAITED 2 TIMES. Despite all this, the food lived up to the hype, so 5/5 if I wasn't so impatient and wishing I got seated when I put my name down THE FIRST TIME. Started off with the fried calamari which was pretty standard with a zesty sauce, although I wish the portion was a little bit more than like 12 ring pieces for ~$7 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I got the mentai squid butter udon with a flavored egg and fish cake, both toppings were FRIED which didn't say from the menu (please put fried for fried toppings!). The soup was saturated with fish eggs which really defined the flavor of the udon. The squid itself was, as in the name, creamy and buttery. I highly recommend my order, the miso carbonara, and the uni udon. I had the privilege to try all 3 and everything is just so different from traditional udon but in a good way. If you have time, try to get seated at the bar to watch the guys make the udon so that you get even hungrier from waiting from the constant never-ending long-ass line."
2/21/2017,20170221,5,4.27,"Go there early or else be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes to 1 hour during peak dinning hours (6:30PM-8PM). The restaurant has an intimate setting with table and bar seating overlooking the kitchen. I just love love love their cold udon with mountain yam, the udon is cooked to perfection and has the right amount of chewy-ness to it. I tried their curry udon the other night and wasn't as satisfied. The curry broth was slightly too salty for my taste. The service staff is always super friendly and efficient with the orders."
2/21/2017,20170221,5,4.27,"Oh my god. The Sea Urchin cream udon was so good! It was $15 and the portion was much smaller than I expected but it was so good, I think its worth it. The lines are usually always long. The only thing that was slightly uncomfortable was that if you sat at the two tables next to the windows, you WILL encounter hungry people waiting outside staring in at you and that was uncomfortable to be stared at by the people waiting outside while you eat."
2/21/2017,20170221,3,4.27,A friend wanted to go on a double date and suggested this restaurant. The restaurant is very cramped but only took 15 minutes to get a table. After looking through the menu I decided to get the beef udon. They serve it in huge bowls and the noodles were nice and thick but the broth had no taste and was room temperature nearly cold. Not worth the drive and hassle for parking. I've tasted better udon at other restaurants. On the plus side their takoyaki was delicious! It was crunchy on the outside and nice and gooey in the inside.
2/21/2017,20170221,1,4.27,"I am fairy upset about this place. As this place had been recommended by bunch of people. I expect to see, and taste uni if I order uni cream pasta. Not some garlic butter sauce with few low quality uni on top. I would be much happy if the udon noodle was better but it was mushy and blend. Not worth of money, time. Not coming back"
2/22/2017,20170222,5,4.27,Best udon in LA you see them making the udon fresh right in front of you on the counter. Recommend coming here for lunch. They have a special for lunch where you can add a rice bowl for $4 more. Get the negitoro bowl if you like fatty tuna. Whenever my gf wants curry udon we come here
2/22/2017,20170222,5,4.27,"Delicious. It's definitely worth the wait to grab udon here! It's reasonable for LA prices, udon noodles are handmade and chewy. There are so many different flavors of udon both hot and cold which is super nice for the seasons. It's an additional plus for being able to add on a bowl for anywhere between $3-5 based on the bowl. I had the curry udon which I loved and also tried the kakuni udon (DELISH) and the Hot dragon udon which is one of their specials - this one was definitely spicy and at my upper limit of spice level, still very yummy. Will definitely have to try their various tempura items next time (that tempura soft boiled egg...omg yum!)"
2/22/2017,20170222,5,4.27,"Great udon and rice bowls. The negitorodon is BOMB. Both the cold and hot udon are great. Stay away from the cream and butter udon unless you like super heavy food.If you can, grab a bar seat to see them make the noodles. They kind of cheat because the knife is spring loaded, but it's still fun to watch."
2/22/2017,20170222,5,4.27,This is my go to place for uni udon! Be prepared to wait in line.
2/25/2017,20170225,4,4.27,"OVERALL (4.5/5):- The wait time will probably be significantly longer than the time it'll take to order and devour your food, but it's worth the wait!I came here with a friend on a Saturday around 2 PM, and had to wait an hour or so. Don't let the huge waitlist break your heart though, because many parties give up and leave before their names are called.While Kochi (on La Cienega) is my favorite udon place in LA, this place is a close second and would've been a 5/5 if Kochi hadn't raised my standards for udon so high.FOOD:While the broth/sauce of a bowl of udon is obviously important, what takes the cake for me are the noodles. At Marugame, noodles are made by hand, and you can really taste the freshness. These are completely opposites of the weirdly white, rubbery ""udon"" noodles in the refrigerated aisle of Nijiya. These are chewy, firm, and asking to be loudly slurped. The fact that no two noodles look the same is further evidence of the handmade deliciousness. Now, in terms of the broth:- Wakame Seaweed Udon (4/5): If you're looking for something light yet belly-warming, this is your best bet. Its clean flavor is savory and satisfying, and allows you to experience each udon to its maximum chewiness. At just under $8, it's reasonably priced and left me plenty full.- Champon Udon (5/5): If you are looking for something (somewhat) healthy but aren't willing to sacrifice flavor, get this. The broth is light yet rich, with a unique umami that I've never experienced. A quick Google search told me that the broth is traditionally made from cooking down both pork and seafood, which explains the incredible depth of flavor. They also add the perfect amount of sesame oil and black pepper--just enough to enhance the flavors of the broth, but not enough to overpower them. There's also a good balance of protein and vegetables in the bowl. They are pretty generous with adding shrimp and bay scallops, which were a tad overcooked but still delicious. The veggies were fresh, tender, and slightly charred to bring out their sweetness. This has become my go-to order!SERVICE (4/5):No complaints here. They took our orders very quickly, and our food arrived within 10 minutes. After such a long wait, this was a huge relief. AMBIANCE (4/5):- Small store without a ton of seating. Tables are pretty close together so prepare to get cozy. - You can watch chefs make the noodles!"
2/25/2017,20170225,5,4.27,One of the best Japanese meals I've had in LA. We've come here twice and I still want more. The creamy udon is absolutely delicious and a unique experience. The regular udon soups are also excellent - add the tempura soft boiled for a delicious treat.Skip the beef tataki appetizer (it's the only thing I didn't really care for) but get the braised pork belly - huge chunks of pork smothered in a tasty sauce.Get a seat at the bar and watch the fresh udon being made in front of your eyes.It's small and easily gets crowded so come during off hours or be prepared to wait for a bit.
2/25/2017,20170225,3,4.27,"Overrated and pretty much underwhelmed for the sea urchin cream udon. I can see why people loved it years ago because it probably had more pieces of uni instead of fish eggs. The sauce was so subdued for my taste. I like the fresh seafood taste of uni so I'm really sad it was more creamy than uni. The noodles were al dente and probably the best I've had but honestly I prefer ramen. I highly recommend you don't go on a Saturday night, waiting nearly two hours in the cold just added to the negative experience. The mentai butter squid udon however was pretty good (choose this one, it's better and not as heavy). I also added the tempura soft boiled egg and it was pretty bland and being fried didn't really do anything for me. I prefer tea eggs because they at least have some flavor. Funny thing is the negitoro bowl appetizer was my favorite thing out of everything I ate. If they made a entree size portion of it, just take my fuc*ing money rn. To add to everything, the portion was hella small...the bowl was just big. The deception, I just cant....Basically, I won't return unless it happens to be less poppin. I'm gonna stick to cheap and good shinsengumi for ramen, I realized I'm not much of an udon lover. Pros: efficient service, quick orders and food arrives fast.Cons: long wait, overrated, and overpriced (around 15.95 udon +1.50 egg + 5.95 negitoro bowl) Tldr: not worth."
2/26/2017,20170226,5,4.27,"There's always a long wait for this place but after eating here I can see why. The food comes out quickly, especially the rice bowls. We ordered the negitoro rice bowl, mental squid butter udon, sea urchin cream udon, and hot dragon udon. The cream udons were filled with flavor and the noodles were tender. The negitoro rice bowl was very saucy and quite small, but it was good appetizer.You can double your portion of udon if you order from the hot/cold category, none of the other categories."
2/26/2017,20170226,5,4.27,"Food was awesome, very well priced. The wait was totally worth it. We had the uni udon and the cold ikura udon, both were so great. Service was great and quick. I would definitely go back."
2/27/2017,20170227,1,4.27,Took my time to check this place out. I signed in waited more than 30 min and when I went back inside to check they had scratched out my name. I made the staff aware of the issue and after waiting for another 5 minutes they started seating other folks. When I inquired again they told me to go back to the end of the line. There's no reason to support a business who treat their customers like this.
2/28/2017,20170228,4,4.27,"We came here on a Friday night just shortly after it opened at 5pm. The place was already full. Luckily, there was one table available as we walked in.As we placed our order, I was hoping to see one of the Chefs make the hand made Udon they are known for but unfortunately it didn't happen. Hopefully, on the next visit.Our food arrived a few minutes later. I ordered the Kakuni Udon which comes with Pork Belly. The udon and broth was delicious but I wished I had more udon. It seems that they charge for everything here, even ginger which you usually get for free at sushi restaurants. I will definitely come back and try their Uni Udon!"
2/28/2017,20170228,5,4.27,"This is a bold statement from me....but this has thee best udon I've ever had in my life, granted I've never been to Japan but these guys make it here fresh. The squid butter mentai udon and the uni cream are hands down the two best items on the menu! So good! The plating and utensils are esthetically pleasing and the food was delicious. Must return here again when I visit little Tokyo area in LA."
2/28/2017,20170228,5,4.27,"Line was long, but it was worth the wait. I got sit right outside the kitchen to see how they made the noodle, so it was also entertaining."
3/4/2017,20170304,5,4.27,"What's not to love about this place? Fresh chewy udon noodles and broths that are beyond your normal ""one broth fits all"" soup from a sushi restaurant. We waited about 10 minutes for our table at 8pm on a Friday. I've heard the line can be long but we lucked out! We tried 4 different soups and all were unique and delicious. The duck udon was great with delicious seared duck on top. The wakame udon had a rich seaweed flavor. The tempura udon was delicious with crispy tempura bits in the bowl and two large tempura shrimp on the side. And finally, the pork belly udon was also delicious...very tender and flavorful! Also, pay the extra $20 and get double noodles and extra broth."
3/5/2017,20170305,5,4.27,This might be a very strong statement coming from me but this is the best udon I've had in my life granted I've not been to Japan. What makes it the best is that fact that the chef prepares fresh udon right in front of your eyes. I ordered the red dragon signature udon with a side of chili oil (highly recommend if you can handle the heat) and tempura chicken. The broth itself was full of flavor and was spot on but what sealed the deal for me was the noodle itself. The noodle was so fresh and it could literally melt in your mouth. The chicken was also delicious with the right amount of batter and chicken ratio.10/10 would recommend. I would definitely not recommend going to the restaurant during peak hour because the wait could be 60 mins +
3/7/2017,20170307,5,4.27,"There is always a wait here T-T I think it is probably the only ""hand made"" udon in Little Tokyo DTLA and you can really taste it in the chewy noodles. There is alot of street parking as well as parking lots that you can pay for nearby. None of them are validated so make sure you read the signs on how much it costs. Had the following: Beef Tataki : it was okay.... Nothing amazing or special.Uni Udon: SO good! Definitely on the creamy heavier side!Squid Butter Udon: Very refreshing udon soup base and more of the ""normal"" type of udon! I recommend that you get two or more different types of udon and share it with your friends so that you can taste all the different kinds of udon available here. I have tried the cold udon before too (just cant remember which one) and those were delicious as well!"
3/7/2017,20170307,5,4.27,"The udon here is absolutely phenomenal. I'm more of a ramen girl, but I decided to try something new so I came here with my friend. We came shortly after opening on a Sunday and there was no line. We got seated very promptly and our food arrived within 10 minutes. We got takoyaki, which only had 3 servings. I got the mentai squid butter udon and my friend got the mushroom cream udon. I really liked mine, and I think the only suggestion I have is to maybe give more broth? It can also help the saltiness of the dish. My friend's udon was so creamy, almost like alfredo pasta, and she enjoyed it as well. I like how this place offers many unique options. Perhaps I'll come back to try other dishes! I love how perfectly cooked the noodles are--not too chewy and not too soft. The prices are quite reasonable as well."
3/7/2017,20170307,2,4.27,The food at this restaurant use to be authentic when the original owner was in the kitchen. Now the food is prepared by cheap labor which deteriorates the quality and authenticity of traditional Japanese Udon.
3/8/2017,20170308,4,4.27,Awesome fresh udon spot in Little Tokyo.+Texture of the noodles is spot on. It's the right amount of chewy and the right thickness perfectly cooked.+Hot broths are delicious and light+Creamy broths like the uni one are perfect for those who like a richer taste+Big portions. One bowl is definitely sufficient+Great Service-Long waits at peak hours-A little pricey for noodles but you are paying for the labor and quality.
3/10/2017,20170310,5,4.27,"There is always a wait, so it's recommended to come when it opens or closer to close time. Personal favorite is their sea urchin udon and MUST TRY THEIR PORK BELLY RICE BOWL. Everytime I come I get two of those to go. The seafood salad is also really great but I think they only offer those at night. Their udon noodles is super legit with an authentic texture. 100% must try"
3/11/2017,20170311,5,4.27,"Best udon spot I've ever been too. The noodles are made fresh and in-house. You can even watch them make them. The chewiness of the noodles along with the savory broths make for a memorable meal. The servings are HUGE. I loved the uni udon, which had a very creamy texture if like that. The other broths we had were delicious and light.We really didn't have to wait that long on a Friday evening (15 minutes for a party of 3). If that's not usually the case, you can always put your name down and make a quick walk around the Japan Town shopping area and come back!"
3/12/2017,20170312,5,4.27,"Why did it take us so long to try this place??? My sister's place is less than a 5 minute walk from here! When she moves to Pasadena next month, it won't be as easy peasy to get here. (Super sad face). I'll just have to take the Metro from Pasadena to get my udon fix! Marugame Monzo's udon is pretty darn amazing. Simply the best udon I've had in the US. MM specializes in a kind of udon that hails from Marugame, Japan, and you can watch the noodles being rolled, stretched, and cut in front of you behind a glass picture window if you take counter seats. Yes, there will be a line and a wait to get seated during peak dining hours just like its ever popular next door neighbor Daikokuya, and Shin-Sen-Gumi Ramen which is just around the corner on Central. We stood in line on a Monday at around 11:15 am, 15 minutes before opening. The whole restaurant filled up with the lunch crowd maybe about 15 minutes after opening. Expect a long wait on weekends and holidays! I had the Mentai Squid Butter Udon which was recommended by my friend Lorelei S. who is a lover of all things Japanese. I was not disappointed. I loved it. It had seasoned fish eggs, tender squid pieces in a butter sauce with onions. It was light and tasted of the ocean. lf you love seafood, you can't go wrong with this dish. The udon noodle itself was excellent too. Perfectly cooked and very tasty! My husband had the Hot Dragon Udon which had a milky paitan broth with spicy ground pork, bean sprouts and nira. It was medium spicy and very good too. Not as interesting as my udon bowl, but quite good if you're not a seafood lover. We also ordered tempura--2 pieces of shrimp, 1 squid and 1 eggplant. The shrimp and squid were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I'd probably pass on the eggplant next time. In retrospect we probably should have just ordered the kakiage tempura. That would have been enough. I ordered way too much! How I wish that we had something as good as Marugame Monzo here in the Bay Area! I'd stand in line anytime just to have a wonderful bowl of udon once again!"
3/13/2017,20170313,5,4.27,"My conversion from ramen addict to udon connoisseur has reached full speed now that I've sampled the fare at Marugame Monzo, the gold standard for udon in LA, and I take back everything negative I've ever said about udon!I had been reluctant to try Marugame Monzo because I knew they were famous for their signature udon with mentai cream or uni butter - things I wouldn't be able to enjoy with my dairy allergy. But, perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that Marugame Monzo also serves a number of traditional iterations of the dish. The kakuni udon featured thick, fatty pieces of pork belly that didn't quite melt in my mouth as I would expect from something braised, but that were still tender and, more importantly, delicious. The sides of tempura were fried to perfection with the just the right amount of crunch. If you're not a fan of soggy tempura, then definitely consider ordering your favorite items on the side. If anything, I would probably nix the squid ($1.50) and go for another piece of pumpkin / kabocha ($1) or jumbo shrimp ($2.50). My friends were both satisfied with their choices - ankake mushroom udon and beef udon with a side of baby octopus tempura ($2) and chili oil ($.50). If I were hungrier, I would have ordered the double portion for an extra $2 just so that I could enjoy more of the handmade noodles. Everyone noted how affordable the prices were, especially considering we had recently eaten at an udon place on the Westside that was charging $2-4 more for similar dishes with less satisfying ingredients.NOTE: All of the udon uses fish-based dashi, so this restaurant is definitely not suitable for strict vegetarians or vegans. There are, however, a few things you could cobble together, including sides of vegetable tempura and an appetizer salad. This would not be a substantive or ideal meal though.Even as the restaurant typically has a waiting list, you won't have to wait too long until your name is called. This is likely due to the number of tables they manage to pack into the small restaurant as well as the nature of eating udon - it's not a multi-course meal that requires hours and hours. Although being seated at a table would have fostered more fluid conversation, I enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the staff roll and cut the noodles. It's probably a smart business strategy to emphasize the labor involved in making the delicious, chewy noodles - the undisputed star of the meal.Credit cards are accepted, but you cannot use more than two per party. If you would like to split the bill in an uneven way, the servers will likely ask you to tell them how much you would like to charge to each card. Since this is Little Tokyo, parking is tough, but I typically park in the Judge John Aiso Lot around the corner. That garage can get pricy if you're planning to spend the day in the area, so definitely consider flat rate lots if you're going to be in Little Tokyo for more than 2-3 hours.P.S. Hope you like(d) it as much as I did!"
3/18/2017,20170318,4,4.27,"I've only tried their beef udon and pork belly rice bowl. They were both really well made. The udon noodles had a firm, chewy texture and the broth was pretty rich (a bit too greasy for me). I'm giving this place 4 stars because they are really good at their craft, although I'm not a big fan of udon noodle soup in general. Next time I gotta try the uni udon, which is what they're known for."
3/19/2017,20170319,5,4.27,Ugh I love this place so much. When I first went my friend got the Tomato cream and I got the Uni. If you eat those together they make the perfect combination!!! A cream with a tomato ugh perfection. Now I just get the tomato cream because it's really hard to find GOOD tomato cream pastas nowadays. The price is dank and the food is good. The wait is worth it and the shiitake tempura is pure evil. It makes you want to eat more and more LOL. I went here about 5 times and I still love it. If it wasn't for the 1 hour wait I would come here at least once a week. But for now I'll keep it at once a month!
3/20/2017,20170320,5,4.27,"Found out about this place through Instagram....shout out to @dinela. Next thing you know it my friend took me here and I was lucky enough to sit at the bar area where you can see them make the udon noodles. I ordered the Miso Carbonara and let's just say I basically licked the bowl. Came back again this time with family. Unfortunately it took some time to be seated. I suggest coming in a pair of 2 to be seated faster. But anyways my family loved it. My brother especially liked the 6$ bowls, got to try it out next time I go. Perfect for raining days and cold nights."
3/21/2017,20170321,5,4.27,"This is by farrrrrr my favorite udon place. No other udon place even compares. Actually though. This place is cheap and good. All of the food here is delicious so anything you get won't taste bad. The udon noodles are made by scratch. The sea urchin udon is the signature dish here and is a must try. Dipping the tempura into the sea urchin soup is delicious and everyone should try it. If you are lactose intolerant like me and you forgot your lactase pills, there are plenty of other dishes! The beef udon is solid but the soup really gives it the edge. It's savory but also has a side of sweetness to it that makes you want to drink the entire bowl. If you want a rice bowl, the negitoro bowl is the signature bowl here and it is amazing. It's made with poke, mayo, and seaweed. There's normally a line for this restaurant but you can always walk around little Tokyo if the wait is too long. Either way, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
3/22/2017,20170322,5,4.28,"Safe to say that this is my favorite udon place in California because of the restaurant's authenticity and quality! I really like how customers can watch the kitchen hand make their famous udon from the bar window seats. The wait can get a long depending what time you go, but if you miss the host/hostess calling your name, they are willing to hold your spot for a few min after they call. Something I really appreciate because there is so much to explore in Little Tokyo. I've tried almost all of their udon menu options and my favorites are the uni udon (of course), beef udon, and seafood cream udon. The beef soup is light and savory and the seafood cream udon isn't as heavy as their other cream based menu items. I also get squid tempura every time and like to enjoy it by dipping it in the udon soup or sauce. I recommend trying the negitoro bowl in addition to their tempura! I had the soft boiled egg tempura once and was a little disappointed because it was more plain than I expected. TBH, I am a little scared of ordering udon at other Japanese restaurants because Marugame Monzo has set the standard for me. Overall, an amazing Japanese restaurant, definitely a must stop in LA!"
3/22/2017,20170322,5,4.28,"This was my 1st time having Udon noodles. I had the Tempura Shrimp Udon which was served with 2 huge pieces of shrimp. My wife had one of their mixed seafood Udon specialty dishes that was fantastic. We arrived at 6:00pm on a Wednesday night and had a short wait. But I noticed a small line forming outside after we were seated. But the line moved fast as the service is fast and it's not the type of place for a 3 course dinner. Parking is a problem, but we did find metered street parking a few blocks away on Central Ave."
3/23/2017,20170323,4,4.28,"I love well made noodles. Worse. J'adore slurpable well made noodles and at Monzo you get just that: house made slurpable udon (you can sit at the counter and see the kitchen and noodle making in full swing), umami broth and beautiful bowls you can raise up to your lips and finish the rest of the soup. Ahhhhhhhh! The noodles? They are soft, firm supple not as chewy as what I prefer but still very very good. They have hot and cold udon, they have seafood, they have vegetarian options. Monzo serves serious udon. The uni cream and mentaiko are well regarded but let that not distract you; there are other versions more appropriate to your liking possibly.  I didn't have my lactase pills so I tried the mentaiko (cod roe, popular in Sardinia & Sicily also) and loved it. We also tried the clams in miso garlic broth and that was fresh and delicious. I do want to come back and try the other udon soups here. It's easy to sit here mesmerized, watching the udon chef make noodles until you realize the check comes to accommodate the long line outside. It's cool, this is a small place so be aware that they are in high demand and wait times can extend. Visits: 2 and more to follow.Tip: I've never had Marugame Monzo udon and it was very nice to have. In Japan, udon is generally more chewy, about the same thickness as what's served here. I still like this udon for its soft and supple qualities.  Parking if you want to go to a lot is $7 (entrance on Judge John Aiso St) or $10 across the street in the mall parking lot."
3/24/2017,20170324,1,4.27,"We were waiting for a friend who drove 2 hours to meet us here. We switched out 1 person and all ordered more food, yet the hostess came over and told us we could not order more. What kind of business does this. Bad business ethics. Terrible customer service."
3/24/2017,20170324,5,4.27,"Went with 6 other friends and they let us know when our table was ready. The wait was kind of long especially outside. We tried not to block traffic on the sidewalk. Some of the best service I've seen. They were very polite and seemed to want to help us, especially since most of us hadn't been there. I ordered the udon gratin and it was pretty heavy but I'm currently eating it as leftovers and it's really good still. The boyf got a shrimp tempura udon and the shrimps were giant. I also got a soft boiled egg and it had tempura around it. We also had beef Tatake and the caprese and normally I hate undercooked anything but the tatake was great. I ate many of the caprese cheeses as well. Would come back."
3/25/2017,20170325,5,4.27,Delicious Udon noodles! Try sitting at the bar to watch how they make the noodles! It's truly mesmerizing. Service is quick and efficient. The servers are kind and attentive. We came right at 4:50pm right before they opened at 5pm and there was already a line. Recommend coming early to avoid the crowds and long lines. The sea urchin uni and udon au gratin were amazing! Just wish they would have more hot sauce options.
3/26/2017,20170326,4,4.27,"I've been wanting to come here since I heard they are the best udon in town and to try their uni pasta. This place is small restaurant situated in Little Toyko and two doors down from Daikokuya. Me and my friends came on weekday night. It was not crowded at all and we were seated quickly. I ordered two of their signature udons, the sea urchin (uni) udon and udon gratin, which I shared among my friends. I have heard great things about both dishes and try them all since I was there! Both dishes were fantastic! Both were very creamy, very rich in flavor and the udon was very chewy. The uni pasta had pieces of uni in it and didn't make the dish fishy at all! I also added a tempura soft boiled egg to my udon because why not. ;P The udon gratin was also amazing! And I'm so glad I shared this dish because eating both the uni udon and udon gratin would have been rich-creaminess overload! The gratin has a layer of cheese on top and in the dish itself has udon, chicken and onions in it. And my god, the cheese just made this dish an ample of flavor! Both dishes were so filling and very heavy because of the cream sauce. The dishes dish definitely reminded me of fettuccine alfredo because of how creamy it is but obviously WAY better! Definitely can't compare.My friends ordered the Negitoro rice bowl, Plum Shiso Bukkake Udon and Beef Udon. I didn't get to try them but my friends said it was all delicious! Next time when I come, I need to try just their classic hot udons. What I also like and think is so cool about this place is that you can see them making the udon at the back of restaurant so you know you are getting fresh delicious udon!"
3/26/2017,20170326,5,4.27,"Ummm bombCame here on a Saturday afternoon around 12. the wait was already an hour long :(I got the Udon Gratin and my boyfriend got the Shrimp Tempura Udon which I insistently regretted after trying his soup! Don't get me wrong the gratin was good it, very cheesey which didn't run inside me too well. The shrimpy tempura Udon soup was light, but pack with flavor. The noodles was is made freshly in front of you as you wait for your food the guy is rolling it out. The noodles was nice and springy I will defiantly come back, but this time I'm going to get the Beef Udon uuummmmm.."
3/28/2017,20170328,3,4.27,"Had really amazing udon in Hawaii and I was craving it so when we were in the area, I had high hopes for this place. We had the uni udon and the dragon udon. The noodle itself was nothing special (the noodles we had in Hawaii was so amazing). The uni sauce was extremely creamy, almost like alfredo sauce, which I wasn't a fan of. The broth with the dragon udon was better but again nothing special. I probably won't be back."
3/29/2017,20170329,5,4.27,"CARBONARA UDON. Nuff said.I came here about 20 mins before their opened for dinner on a Tuesday. To my surprise, there was a small crowd gathered around the entrance waiting for them to open their doors. Despite the crowd, I was seated right away at the bar area. I loved sitting at the bar because I had a view of the chefs making fresh noodles through the window. I knew what I wanted without looking at the menu (thanks Yelpers!). I ordered the carbonara udon and a side of shrimp tempura. At first I was kinda like, wow thats expensive for ONE piece of shrimp tempura... but when it came out i was like DAMN that shrimp is huge! #worthitThe carbonara udon was simply perfection. I thought I would need some other protein in it besides bacon like chicken or something, but it turns out I didn't care once I started eating it. It is super creamy and savory and the noodles are just cooked perfectly. The shrimp tempura was again HUGE and was delicious. I savored each bite and became sad when I finished it all.I dream of this place and I can't wait to go back! See you there!"
3/29/2017,20170329,5,4.27,"I love this place so much. It's an absolute must when you find yourself in Little Tokyo!! I always gravitate towards the Miso Carbonara Udon but whatever you get -- bible, it will not disappoint. The sauces, in lack of a better word bc my brain has failed me, from everything I've tried have always tasted great and it's even more fantastic because you don't get tired of the taste. The noodles have this really great texture where the they resist just enough to retain their shape but cut like butter when you chew. I've tried a handful from their menu and I highly recommend miso carbonara or their uni (if you're into that). Tip: Unless you get there right when it opens, there is usually a wait anywhere from 5-30 minutes but I promise the wait is worth it! Also they do NOT validate."
3/31/2017,20170331,5,4.28,"We ate here for the first time, bringing all three kids. Inside is packed with customer, and since Im bringing 5,4,2 years old its easier.If you are bringing babies with stroller it'll hard.Wait time about 15 minutes, the moment we sat down, they took our order right away, and they provide the kids bowls and utensils. Which is awesome.Servers are very friendly. They took our orders fast, and the food came out fast!And its such A DELISH! I know I always prefer udon than ramen, but this is sooo different type of udon I ever taste! Freshly and handmade udon so the taste is very fresh, melts in your mouth sensation!!!!I ordered Uni Cream Udon nyuuummmm!!! Tasty! My 5 yrs old loves it too! Hubby ordered Hot Dragon Udon which when I taste the broth, it was tasty and spicy. He loves it.We ordered the beef bowl rice for rest of the children and they like it as well!Will come back!"
3/31/2017,20170331,4,4.27,"I'm not the biggest udon fan, but the stuff here was pretty decent. If you can take the senseless wait, then you'll be rewarded. Flavor is good, portion size above average. Service was better than expected considering how long the wait was."
3/31/2017,20170331,4,4.27,Food is fantastic. Wait sucks. A few times they been closed due to water pipe issues. Fried chicken skins are only on the dinner menu.
3/31/2017,20170331,5,4.28,The best udon in LA hands down! I ordered the beef udon and it was packed with flavor. You can also taste the freshness of their udon noodles since they're made in house. I highly recommend this place if you're craving for udon!
4/1/2017,20170401,4,4.28,"Had this place bookmarked for soooo long and was finally able to try it. My friend and I came early to avoid the dinner rush, we were seated right away. The place was small but the service was fast and efficient. We ordered the nigotoro handroll for appetizer, it was pretty much DIY handrolls, it was pretty good. Was able to make 5-6 small hand rolls with the amount of ingredients we got. We also ordered the uni udon and a shrimp tempura udon. The uni udon was rich and creamy, noodles were cooked perfectly. Im not a huge fan of uni or udon, but it was really good! The shrimp tempura udon was okay, a little too plain for me. I probably wouldn't order it again."
4/1/2017,20170401,4,4.27,I am not the biggest fan of Udon noodles. I actually thought they serve Ramen as well which wasn't the case. It wasn't a big deal since we already waited for almost 30 minutes. As you can expect at lunchtime the place is packed but once you're in service is really quick. I got the squid udon which I think is quite popular. There were large pieces of squid even though the portions aren't huge. The food was quite tasty and it is really nice to see how the noodles are made right in front of your eyes. I like restaurants where you can see how stuff is actually being made.The menu has plenty of options: some traditional japanese dishes and appetizers. I think there's plenty of chooses to pick from.I think it's a no brainer if you like Udon.
4/2/2017,20170402,5,4.28,"Ate here with two friends last week. We stood at the door with some others, waiting for them to reopen at 5:00 and it was worth it! The fresh udon noodles are amazing. Got the chicken tempora as well, and it was nice and light and crisp. Loved that we could sit at the bar and watch our food be made. And drink refill service is on point here!"
4/2/2017,20170402,5,4.28,"We have learned our lesson here with the long waits and try to come a few minutes before opening. There's usually a line already, but at least you have a better chance at getting seated than later on in the night. If you have a big party, they usually separate you (small space inside) You can wait, but might take a very long time. Be sure also to have your entire party present or they won't seat you. I like sitting at the bar because you can watch the chefs hand make the udon noodles. Our favorites are clam Vongole, seafood cream udon, uni udon, and miso carbonara. I've never gotten the more soupy udon dishes, but I've never heard bad things about it from my friends."
4/3/2017,20170403,3,4.28,"I've been a couple times now and we've ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, Curry Udon, Pork Belly Udon, and Champon Udon. Here's a quick review of each:Mentai: A bit too fishy/seafood-y flavor for me but the person who ordered it, loved it.Curry: The broth is a bit too thick but great flavor. It can get nauseating trying to eat all of it though.Pork Belly: Not worth the price. You only get four chunks of pork belly which were mediocre.Champon: Not worth the price. It's basically udon with vegetables.Overall, average food and experience. They're supposed to be known for their udon noodles but it's nothing you can't get elsewhere. TIP: Get there early...long lines happen."
4/3/2017,20170403,4,4.27,"Delicious and will definitely come again! I got the beef udon, but the other ones are great too! The staff is friendly and accommodating. My only issue would be the long line, but I guess that's expected at such a popular place! There's a line even before the place opens, so I recommend getting there even earlier to avoid waiting even more!"
4/5/2017,20170405,5,4.28,"I love this place!!The wait to be seated is fairly long because the inside is fairly small, but it's worth it! My boyfriend and I typically wait around 40-50 minutes.I really like getting the Dragon udon with the spicy ground pork bowl. I recommend trying the Kakiage on the side! It's only $2.50 and it's really good. It's kind of like a thinly sliced fried tempura and seafood cylinder?? It'll make more sense when you see it, lol."
4/5/2017,20170405,4,4.28,"Really good place for a quick udon spot! I absolutely loved how they have hot and cold noodles, and I got the bukkame cold udon. My friends ordered the beef udon, the sea urchin, and uni! The broth is absolutely delicious, and the udon itself is sweet and chewy :)I wish the portion sizes were a little bit bigger though. One bowl doesn't satisfy if you're really hungry! Nice waiters and chill ambience!"
4/6/2017,20170406,5,4.28,"I'm usually not a huge fan of udon, but this place has ways of making me go crazy for their chubby housemade noodles. Though I've never had their traditional style udon, I can vouch for their signature dishes. Their unique in their own way and I highly recommend any person to stray from tradition and give them a shot. My personal favorites are the uni and squid butter udons! The uni is creamy and full of flavor and the squid butter has little mentaiko eggies and a seafood buttery flavor. They sounds weird but if you're a fan of any of these ingredients you're sure to be wowed.And I can't forget to mention their tempura. It's light and crispy. As a lover of eggplant, I always get their eggplant tempura ($1/piece) which is ah-mazing. The baby octopus tempura ($2) was well worth a try. On weekdays, they do have a gap between 2:30PM to about 5?PM but they still let us sign up our name at 2PM. It took about 20 minutes for our group of 4 to get seated. Service is pretty average and the restaurant, though small, is cute and traditional looking.I'd drive all the way from OC (tbh it's not even that far) to eat their udon. It's only the best!"
4/7/2017,20170407,3,4.27,"Was here on a Saturday night, around 21:15, and, gee, it was busy! My friend said this place was good, so we waited. We were told that we may not make it in since last call was not too long away. So, if you want to eat here, definitely get your name on the list way ahead of closing!After waiting it out, the host informed us that we would be seated, but we needed to order ASAP. I looked through the menu but decided to go with the uni udon, which sounded good.Due to the busyness of this place, I was not expecting great service. However, people who sat after us, were given their food. My friend and I were confused for a while. Similarly, the chefs were also confused. They literally forgot about us. Womp womp.We got our food after moments of confusion. The noodles were really good. It was definitely due to the fact that they make it fresh. However, I was not impressed with my overall order. The soup base seemed watered down. I surmise it is due to the rush of getting our food out as soon as they could. We got discounted for the delay, which was nice.Overall, it was okay. I would definitely give it another chance and get there well ahead of closing."
4/7/2017,20170407,5,4.28,Everything here is really good. You really can't go wrong with most things on the menu.* Recommend any of their signature dishes.* Always order or share a Tempura dish (chicken/shrimp)+ Quick to get your food out.+ Everything is made fresh+ Super yummy food of course+ Everything is generally so good nothing really stands out or needs to be highlighted.+ JUST COME!!- Long waits
4/7/2017,20170407,5,4.28,"Probably one of my favorite udon places!! Their udon is so fresh that I can't go back to other udon restaurants haha! I usually get the uni udon which is sooo good! It's creamy & soupy & everything good! They don't give thaaaat much uni but it's enough! I've also gotten the lamb/beef udon and it was equally as good. The soup is not creamy, it's more broth and actual sippable soup! So good! I always request the bar area because I like to see them cut the fresh udon! YUM!"
4/7/2017,20170407,5,4.28,"I really enjoyed the udon here. I came with a friend to meet up for food near little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles. For an appetizer I ordered the slow cooked pork belly which was simmered in this delicious sweet sauce and the meat was so tender and supple. I also ordered the traditional udon with chicken tempura. I loved the noodles. The best part of Monzo is that the noodles are authentic-----you can watch them make the noodles from the kitchen and it's amazing to watch. The restaurant is small but that's the best part about it. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff are incredibly nice, friendly, and attentive. I felt very well taken care of and I really enjoyed my food. After I left and explored little Tokyo with friends. The shops closed down I had to use the restroom so we returned to Monzo and the restaurant owner remembered me and my friend from before. I asked to use the bathroom and let him know I was there before and he waved his hand with a ""girl, go use the bathroom it's not that serious"" attitude hahahha. Nice from beginning to end. Would come here again. If you find yourself in downtown LA you should definitely stop here for delicious authentic Japanese food and cozy atmosphere."
4/8/2017,20170408,3,4.28,"Had the miso carbonara udon and I would say it's just okay. Nothing spectacular, luckily we waited less than 5 minutes on a Saturday at lunch time. The sauce was pretty heavy and rich and I couldn't really taste miso. However, the texture of the udon was perfect. Portions were kinda small for the amount you pay. PARKING TIP: park at the Aiso street parking garage (Yelp the address). This restaurant is only a 2 minute walk away, and it's less than $5. Save the time from driving in circles!!"
4/8/2017,20170408,4,4.28,"The broths for the Duck Nanban Udon and Seafood Creamy Tomato Udon as well as the thick udon noodles were delicious. Soft boiled egg yolk was appropriate consistency. For what was offered in the udon (broth/sauce and noodles), it seemed like something that could be made at home (albeit not from scratch noodles). Just expected more for the price."
4/9/2017,20170409,5,4.28,You can't go wrong here if you want good udon!Uni cream awesomeVongole awesome.This is my first review on yelp and I wanted to give it them because they never disappoint :)
4/9/2017,20170409,5,4.28,"One of the best Japanese restaurants in LA.Loved the food, specially they're fresh hand made noodles."
4/9/2017,20170409,5,4.28,"Their uni udon! So bomb. :9 Their udon are made fresh and right in front of your face if you sit at the bar lol. My bf and I usually order their uni udon, pork belly rice, and another appetizer (usually tempura or takoyaki) to share. All are pretty good! We haven't been adventurous and try their other udons...we just love uni too much lol. Best to go during odd hours or else you would have to wait for a long time during lunch/dinner."
4/10/2017,20170410,5,4.28,"We had to try the Uni Udon and luckily we were able to get a table before closing. I've had a previous bad experience with Uni Nigiri at RA Sushi so I was nervous about paying $17 for Uni Udon. After the first bite with the giant spoon I knew it was totally worth it. It is creamy, with fresh Udon noodles and was not at all fishy that I lowkey anticipated lol! There was a hint of sweetness that I'm not sure is from the fresh Udon or the creamy soup base. We also had their calamari and edamame which was really fresh as well. What I enjoyed most about visiting is although we were there almost an hour after closing their service was still on point without the pressure of us leaving for closing. The Uni Udon was really fancy LOL, I felt dizzy and content and really enjoyed it. But honestly I would consider the dish one not to eat so often so it doesn't lose it's magic lol."
4/11/2017,20170411,4,4.28,"Love this place has a good varaity of udon to choose. Their sea urchin cream udon is a must try if you love sea urchin. I tried their ikura oroshi udon since I live cold udon and ikura so this is a perfect udon for me.I also recommend their negitoro bowl, just add $4 for a small bowl combo with udon."
4/11/2017,20170411,4,4.28,"I found the sea urchin noodle dish to be a bit of a gimmick. It was enjoyable, but it didn't really feel inspired or clever. The cheese sauce overwhelms the delicate taste of the uni. It tastes pretty much just like a slightly weird take on fettuccine alfredo. Not great, the portion size was a bit small, and a bit expensive for it's quality. Not recommended.The more traditional beef udon soup I had was far better. It's easily the best udon soup I've ever had in Los Angeles. The meat was savory and rich. The broth was tasty, and the noodles had a nice texture.The pork belly rice bowl I had was alright, but I didn't love it. The taste was good, but not great, and the portion of meat felt a bit skimpy on the pork belly to rice ratio.Service was good."
4/12/2017,20170412,5,4.28,"My friends told me that if I wanted to try ""good and authentic"" udon, it would be in the small cultural plaza of LA, Little Tokyo. We got here around during lunch time and we got seated pretty fast. Places were filling up because it was rush hour. Me and my friends all tried the Miso Carbonara Udon, which is one of the signature dishes. Included inside the miso carbonara udon was pieces of bacon and its flavorful yet rich carbonara sauce. At first glance, I was skeptical on this place because I was crazy to think that I would pay $13 for a ""small"" bowl of udon based on the pictures. Well, the pictures definitely didn't do its justice. It looks MUCH better in person. The servers brought in the bowls, and they were huge! To top it off, it came with a huge spoon to finish all of the sauce with it. Now getting down to the flavor and texture of this udon. This place pretty much convinced me that I would have to come back here again if I wanted to try udon. You can add some spices to your sauce, but I left the sauce alone because I thought it was great on its own. The sauce was light and rich to complement the fine soft texture of the noodles. It was very creamy which I enjoyed the most. Flawless in my opinion. After seeing that my bowl was empty, I was pretty sad that this journey was over already. I would definitely come back here again if I'm ever near Little Tokyo and craving udon. 5/5"
4/13/2017,20170413,5,4.28,"Love this spot! I always come here on a rainy day in LA or if I have a friend that's never tried udon, I bring them here! Been coming here for a few years now and it never fails to disappoint me."

4/16/2017,20170416,4,4.28,"First time visiting Tokyo town and my first time here . After what seems like a forever 2 hour wait, we finally got a counter table for 6 people ! phew, and I thought we had to wait another hour. I ordered the uni udon from their signature page . First bite, the flavours burst in my mouth . The soup was thick and creamy but honestly, after the 10th bite, my mouth was numb and the flavours got a bit too much .The boy tried their other signature udon, squid ball fish roe. Omg this was amazing ! the clear broth was a much refreshing choice as compared with the uni and those squid were made to perfection. How do you ever get the squid to such perfection ? . I would definitely come back again for this dish ."
4/16/2017,20170416,4,4.28,"I'm obsessed with 2 things: good noodles and uni. When my friend suggested this place because of their uni udon, I was completely sold. Even with an hour wait, I didn't mind. It was a Friday night so to be expected in Little Tokyo. We put our names down and grabbed an appetizer in the area and walked around the area. When it was FINALLY our turn, we immediately ordered. Between the 3 of us, we shared the tempura appetizer and 2 bowls of udons. The portions are massive for the price. Now, let's talk about the uni udon. h'ooohmahgah, where do I begin? It was creamy. The udon was perfectly chewy (hand made, wutt??). The broth was perfectly season. The bits of uni were fresh and so tasty. What's there not to love. However, I don't think I could have finished the whole bowl by myself and was glad we shared. It's extremely rich. To balance this out, we got the mentai squid butter udon. I didn't think I liked mentai until now. The butter broth was light and a great balance to the uni udon. The squid was cooked perfectly. Everything went together so well.The service was quick and efficient. Waters were kept full, the food came reallll quick, and so did the check. I'll definitely be back!"
4/16/2017,20170416,5,4.28,very good food for a cheap price. really nice staff

The items are always so delicious and filled with flavor. I love the tempura egg, i get it with any order. The uni udon and tempura udon are my favorites. The one thing I hate is the wait.... although it is without a doubt, worth it!"
4/16/2017,20170416,5,4.28,"The sidewalk outside of Daikokuya is even more crowded now but the hordes seem to be waiting for udon more than ramen. Came here on a Saturday night around 5:30 and despite the constant crowds, the wait was fortunately less than half an hour. Hubby ordered the mad tiger, I ordered the hot dragon, and the child got the shrimp tempura udon. Best udon in LA! The noodles are thick and chewy and have a nice firm bite to them. My husband loved his dish, which was served cold - I had a taste but am not a huge fan of cold noodles that are served with that fishy sauce. I loved my dish, which had a nice heat to it - the pork made it filling but it wasn't too heavy. Child seemed to like her dish as well, and the shrimp tempura were huge.We had prime seating at the counter and were able to watch the noodles being rolled out and cut. Kind of funny that the servers were all Asian while the kitchen staff were all Hispanic, but I guess that's par for the course in LA."

4/17/2017,20170417,4,4.28,"You'll wait in line longer than you'll inhale and savor the food. Fatty tuna in a ball on top o' some rice with the J mayo drizzle and other stuff in a small bowl -- ya start with 'dat one. If you like, try the fried chicken skins which is like pork rinds but chewy with some citrus soy. The takoyaki octopus balls nothin' to write home about but they go down just fine. Then, while others at you're table aren't looking because they're distracted by the noodle maker in the kitchen window, lean over and taste their bowl of noodles -- a mushroom feast, hot dragon spicy something, carbonara style -- and then make sure you build a fort around your own bowl of sea urchin noodle. Damn, damn good. All of it."

4/21/2017,20170421,4,4.28,Lunch time is usually the best time to come or else unless you come early for dinner expect a wait. This is my 2nd time coming last time I got the beef curry udon and it wasn't bad nothing special about it. This time I wanted to try a specialty udon and went with the miso carbonara. It was like having carbonara just with a hint of miso flavor. The udon noodles were cooked well and I also got a side of pork belly bowl which is an added 3 dollars with their lunch special combination.  Overall food and service were good. I had jury duty so I was in and out in about 35 minutes. I would probably go back just to try something different like the uni udon.
4/21/2017,20170421,5,4.28,This udon was so good! The customer service was great and the food was delicious! My friends and I picked it on a whim and were seated right away. Our food came out hot and ready to go! The servers came back multiple times to check on us and were very accommodating when we needed to split the check. Five stars!
4/23/2017,20170423,5,4.28,"They make their own noodle which is rare and fun to watch. Also, its fresh. I enjoy eating the sea urchin udon. So tasty!"
4/24/2017,20170424,4,4.28,"Tasty delicious udon.I got the beef udon and added Kakiage and Shrimp tempura. the Kakiage was a bit greasy. But, overall great flavor.The Squid Butter udon was delicious, esp with extra dried seaweed topping!Don't be intimidated by the wait. We were probably 15 names down on the list and got seated within 20-25 min of showing up."
4/24/2017,20170424,4,4.28,This place gets crowded even on the weekdays. They open at 11:30 am I suggest you coming during their opening. Food: I had their uni cream udon. If you like creamy seafood pasta you'll probably like it. It's sort of a Japanese twist on an alfredo sauce? Their rice bowls are so-so. Vibe: The restaurant has a smaller floor plan but offers a nice view of the kitchen where they make the noodles and food. Its small but thankfully doesn't feel cramped. 4 stars for the udon and kitchen view
4/24/2017,20170424,2,4.28,"Tried the mushroom cream udon. Tasted great, not what I originally wanted. It would have been nice to try the curry without any meat. Except I was told to order the curry and remove the meat myself. I thought I was going to a restaurant to pay someone else to prepare my food. Service was friendly, just not accommodating at all. Food is good."
4/26/2017,20170426,5,4.28,"This is my go to place for udon... flavors are really yummy and love the mixed veggie tempura. The best part is the udon is made at the restaurant, thus the reason the noodles are so good! Given all the tempura options, you also don't have to go crazy on the udon and can get a basic kake udon. Or if you want more flavor the niku or kitsune udon are worth a try."
4/26/2017,20170426,2,4.28,"Love the food, don't get me wrong. I went with my family on Sunday to try out the Udon. It was super. We waited for one hour, but they really accomodate our party.Then, we took our friends today. We know that it will be busy probably, so we went early and waited for 20mins. Before that we went out to get boba to kill time. Once we got in, the server really gave us a hard time. First, the stroller, either folded or outside. Second, the server wanted to take our wife's boba tea. Third, we wanted to split the bill, the server said no. Fourth, there was no line outside, every 15 minutes the server asked are you done? are you done? are you done? It is not even 30 minutes yet?Fifth, we ordered plain kake udon, it came with everything...4 stars for food, should be 5, but the service super sucks, we did not enjoy the food.Service super bad, we won't be coming back on any Wednesday. 1/2 star only...Thanks but no thanks.You don't deserve even 10% tip."
4/26/2017,20170426,5,4.28,"Oh man was this place the best. VERY. VERY. good udon. If you're feeling adventurous try the sea urchin udon (uni) or even the gratin or carbonora! The amazing thing about this udon place is that they have udon you wouldn't normally think udon to be so it's worth the try. But if youre not so adventurous then try the beef udon, it was delicious, traditional, and hit the right notes for me. I did try the steak tataki and although good, would probably skip next time. Prices are average but parking sucked. If you have time after, try venturing into Little Tokyo around the corner to make your parking worth it."
4/27/2017,20170427,5,4.28,"It's all about the uni udon! Usually I'm not really into creamy pasta or noodles, but this was so delicious that I didn't want it to end. If you're lactose intolerant, it's worth talking a couple of pills for. This restaurant is definitely on the must try list. Can't believe I didn't discover this place sooner, but for sure I'll be back for more uni udon deliciousness."
4/27/2017,20170427,3,4.28,uni udon: creamy .... a bit to creamytakoyaki: seems like a flavors missyservice: friendly. Come back? maybe.
4/28/2017,20170428,4,4.28,"Super delicious place for udon - with handmade noodles. Located in little Tokyo so you'll likely have to park in a paid lot. We parked in a paid lot on Judge John Aiso Street and 1st (parking was $1). We went exactly at 11:30 when it opened and were seated immediately. If you go during lunch, you'll likely have to wait to be seated. Service was fast when we went. We had Beef Udon for about $12 and Curry Udon for about $10. We also had a small pork rice bowl on the side. The rice and pork was delicious. The udon is made in-house and you can definitely taste the difference. The noodles are soft and the brother is flavorful. The Curry is pretty filling as the curry sauce is thicker than the regular Beef Udon sauce. Really delicious."
4/28/2017,20170428,5,4.28,Delicious food and fast service. I got the beef udon and the broth was to die for! I sat by the kitchen and watching them make the hand made noodles was great. Definitely a must try if you like Japanese food. I am definitely going back!
4/29/2017,20170429,3,4.28,"I think this place was over hyped as we were given the wait time of 30 minutes it actually almost took an hour to get seated. So by this time I was already super hungry. I ordered the miso carbonara since I'm from out of the town and it was listed in the speciality item I'm thinking it's going to be good. Once I got it, it wasn't as I expected and it was thick and not very soupy... not my idea of udon soup. It was like Japan Italian fusion food... if you're up for that kind of stuff."
5/1/2017,20170501,5,4.28,"Went during Coachella weekend where a half of LA was missing and still had to wait in line but after finishing my meal, it was easily worth the wait. It was confusing to see the wait line because it was right next to Daikokuya which also had its very own extensive line. ProsUdon: The reason why this place is worth the wait was for their udon alone. The noodles are freshly made and it's the texture of the noodles that kept me wanting more. It's soft yet al dente giving you a nice chewiness. Mad Tiger Udon: I liked this way better than the uni udon. The salty and spicy minced pork really had a strong kick and evenly spread through out the cold noodles. There was so many flavors from the spicy pork, there really wasn't need for the cold dipping broth. The poached egg also added some creaminess to the noodles. It's one of the few options for spicy noodles which really does give it off a lot of heat so another recommendation if you like spicy dishes.  Sea Urchin Cream Udon: If its your first time, I recommend ordering their highly talked about uni udon. The warm uni melts in your mouth like butter. Because the sauce is a super rich cream base, I'd suggest sharing it or adding vegetable tempura on the side."
5/1/2017,20170501,4,4.28,"I absolutely loved this place. I don't normal go for Udon, but the flavors were amazing. The uni doesn't really have big chunks of uni in it, but it tastes great. That's the one that I would order again if I went, but I also tried another flavor I can't remember all I can remember is that it was really fishy, which I love. The portion wasn't enough that I was able to take some home, but very filling. I've been itching to return again!"
5/3/2017,20170503,5,4.28,"My favorite udon place ever ! My favorite is the sea urchin udon but this time I tried the kake udon with the pork belly bowl. It was a good combo. The line here gets pretty long though, so I would recommend going on a weekday if you can. Service is great and the food comes out really fast. You can sit at the bar too and watch the workers make fresh udon noodles infront of you. This place is seriously amazing"
5/3/2017,20170503,4,4.28,"I love love this place!! It's dinner and a show!! Just kidding, they have a open window kitchen where you can see the chefs make the udon right in front of you. Pretty neat to watch when slurping up their chewy and creamy udons.Now this place has a bit of a wait time if you don't get there early enough. But it's worth the wait, you won't get fresh udon anywhere else in the LA district( well at least not that I know of currently). But this place is so yummy their choices range from traditional udon to luxurious cuisine udon style. My favorite so far is the tomatoe creamy udon, it's almost like eating a homely pasta noodle soup but with chewy udon bathed in a wonderful,hearty, and thick tomatoe soup. You gotta give it a try if you want something easy to start off with. The decor in this restaurant is very rustic yet modern giving it a very sophisticated atmosphere to dine in. I mean the price doesn't just come with the meal, the experience and the environment are included as well.I'm craving this place just writing the review for it. Overall, I really enjoy this place the only con would be it's kinda small and it's in the Little Tokyo district so parking can be a pain. I suggest riding the metro and saving the trouble of finding parking. Hope you enjoy the food as much as I do!!"
5/3/2017,20170503,4,4.28,This place seems to be hip and new. I got a spicy cold udon and a spicy tuna bowl. I came by myself so it was easy to get a seat at the counter. The food was good the price a little high.
5/5/2017,20170505,5,4.28,We went for lunch on a Friday and wow this place was packed. We ordered their signature Mentai Squid Butter Udon which came with creamy broth but not overly rich. Great balance and squids were very tender and of course their super fresh udon noodles which is made from scratch. We also got their Negitoro bowl and Ikura bowl. It didn't disappoint. Both were very delicious and fresh.The service was impeccable. They really know how to respect their customers. This place is not very big so they will inform their customers to wait outside so that customers who are sitting near the entrance can enjoy their meals with peace.
5/5/2017,20170505,5,4.28,"I love this place so much. It's an absolute must when you find yourself in Little Tokyo!! I always gravitate towards the Miso Carbonara Udon but whatever you get -- bible, it will not disappoint. The sauces, in lack of a better word bc my brain has failed me, from everything I've tried have always tasted great and it's even more fantastic because you don't get tired of the taste. The noodles have this really great texture where the they resist just enough to retain their shape but cut like butter when you chew. I've tried a handful from their menu and I highly recommend miso carbonara or their uni (if you're into that). Tip: Unless you get there right when it opens, there is usually a wait anywhere from 5-30 minutes but I promise the wait is worth it! Also they do NOT validate."
5/5/2017,20170505,5,4.28,"Awesome food! Even as a vegetarian I would love to come back. Noodles are freshly made and have a nice bounce. Flavors are well balanced and presentation is worth of a dine in restaurant. Every bite of the udon makes me think of the song ""bounce back"" :p"
5/6/2017,20170506,5,4.28,"I love udon and thus it only makes sense that I love Marugame Monzo and their freshly cut udon dishes! They have a great selection of udons that's prepared in a variety of ways; cold, hot, or even baked! Due to my sister's recommendation, I ordered their Udon Gratin and at first I thought the portion was small but once you get going the creamy sauce and cheese and juicy meat really fills you up with the soft smooth udon noodles! It is a little heavy thus I was thankful that my family had some of it as well. I also ordered the Cold Udon with Soft Boiled Egg. I love cold noodle dishes as they are simple and light. The Bukkake was simple with freshly grated daikon radish, green ontions and tempura flakes but the soft boiled egg made the entirety richer when mixed up with the cold broth. This would be especially perfect for a hot day!Now just thinking about it really makes me wish I was in LA again so I can stuff my face with their delicious udon! I would definitely recommend this place and would I would love to try their other dishes!"
5/6/2017,20170506,5,4.28,Amazing udon - hand made udon that you can see from your table. Service is great but super crowded. I recommend trying to go either early or late - he wait is usually an hour plus. But it is good stuff!
5/7/2017,20170507,5,4.28,"I find it extremely difficult to queue for any kind of food in LA. There are so many amazing restaurants. However I did wait 45 minutes to try their noodles. I was not disappointed! We ordered the curry noodles and a yummy ramen dish. I also love that you can watch the kitchen staff through the glass making homemade noodles. So delicious, but I'll try going back closer to opening!"
5/9/2017,20170509,4,4.28,"This place came close to Marugame Udon in Hawaii. The wait can be long but it is worth it. Udon are made fresh inside the restaurant.  We got Curry Udon, Hot Dragon Udon, Shrimp Tempura Udon and Cold Udon. They were all delicious. I love the texture of the udon. I just wish the broth was bit hotter. Overall, not a bad spot if you are in Little Tokyo and craving for quality udon."
5/10/2017,20170510,5,4.28,"This is honestly the best udon I've had outside of Japan! My friend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. There was a wait, but it wasn't too bad considering it was 7 PM on a Friday. We only had to wait ~10 minutes. I ordered the hot dragon udon which was taipan spicy broth. The noodles are super chewy and good, and the broth is also on point. It's not too thick and fatty, and the spiciness of it balanced out well. I think the udon noodles are made in house because they're super fresh and chewy. The wait is pretty bad but it's because it's a small and super popular restaurant. An option while you wait is to walk around the area - it's cute and you can have a pre-dinner snack! I am a big fan of the mochi ice cream close by."
5/10/2017,20170510,5,4.28,"Been here several times and it's definitely one of my favorite places.They have a good range of different udons so if you're craving some italian fusion creamy ones, I would highly recommend mentai squid butter or their or sea urchin udon. My personal favorite is their curry udon with an extra tempura egg .Their rice bowls are also pretty tasty so if you are extra hungry, it might be worth adding a small rice bowl.I've only gone here during weekend lunch hours, so I have no idea what it's like all other times. However, on the weekends, it's pretty packed so be prepared for a wait unless you come early or really late."
5/10/2017,20170510,4,4.28,Texture of udon was perfect. Uni cream had very trace amount of uni. A bit overpriced for quantity and quality. Tempura was solid quality. Beef bowl was very tasty.
5/11/2017,20170511,5,4.28,"Dear Monzo,I'm so sorry I didn't enjoy my first experience here. I've been waiting to update my review for the longest time, but I wanted to try you again and again so I can thoroughly re-write this. MONZO U R SO GOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDD!!!!!Can you forgive me for being disappointed on our first date? I was so naive a year and a half ago but now that I'm visiting you again, you always leave me wanting more. I can't get enough. Your Negitoro rice bowl is a freaking 100/10. It's soooo creamy and delicious and I always always always have to slow myself down when I take a bite. I shared you once, but never again. You are not to be shared, EVER. In fact, my only con is that I wish you were bigger. I can eat like 5 of you and never be satisfied. You are so good and I will never forget how amazing you are. Your Kakuni udon is simply amazing. The broth is light and fragrant, the udon is fresh and chewy and the pork is THE BEST I EVER HAD. It's savory and fatty, but it doesn't feel like you're eating a chunk of fat. It's just enough. Combine this with the rice bowl and boy, you complete me~Your Kake udon is pretty decent. Even without meat, you can still enjoy the broth and udon. It's a perfect combo with the rice and doesn't leave you bloated. I came here with my boyfriend (I'm sorry Monzo) and he ordered the uni udon. I guess he's the uni expert because he loved every bit of it. I got to sample some and it was even more delicious than I remember, but maybe that's because I can only handle so much rich flavor. I also wanted to add that we each got our own rice bowls because homegirl did not want to share.Monzo, if you wait for me, I will visit you more often. I will wait for you (literally). If you forgive me for not liking you the first time, I promise I will treat you right."
5/12/2017,20170512,5,4.28,"I have been here twice now and got the tomato cream seafood udon both times because it was so good the first time I couldn't stop thinking about it. The udon noodles are perfect. The sauce is perfect, too; it's better than any Italian food I've had. It has just a hint of seafood flavor instead of being overwhelmingly seafoody, and they struck the perfect level of acidity (low) and tomato flavor. It's like a work of art.The first time I went with a friend who got the duck udon. It was... not great. The udon noodles and broth were good but boiled duck is kind of gross. I really like fat but the fat on this was unappetizing in texture. Not sure what we were expecting but I guess we thought they would crisp or render it before putting it in the broth. Nope. Can't recommend the duck udon.The second time I went with my husband, who got beef udon and said it was better than he had in Japan!Their tempura is amazing. I will probably try a new kind of udon next time and load it up with tempura.However, their eggs are SUPER bland and that surprised me given how good everything else tends to be. I got a tempura egg and it just... had zero flavor. I really love eggs but it was flavorless enough that I would not bother ordering it again.The brand of canned green tea they offer has a nice flavor.There was a wait both times we came (weekdays during lunch), but we quickly were seated at the bar. It's not the most comfortable place to sit but you get a good view of the guy who makes the noodles behind the window, so it makes up for it. I hope we get to sit at a table one day though."
5/14/2017,20170514,5,4.28,"Great culinary experience. The food was so well flavored and fresh. The Udan is made fresh in the restaurant. My lunch was delicious. My husband was hesitant to order these new food options but loved the food. He selected extra Spicey hot udan and loved it. We waited in line over a half hour. We usually are never willing to wait in line. However it was worth the wait. I ordered the Sqiud butter Udan and I'd order it again.The service was excellent, cheerful and respectful."
5/14/2017,20170514,3,4.28,"First time customer. While my sea urchin udon was good & different from most udon noodle dishes I've had in the past, it's not worth waiting for hours or being subjected to the strict rules of this restaurant. I arrived when they were just opening on a weekday, so didn't have to wait long. Definitely wouldn't wait hours or deal with the parking as other reviewers have mentioned."
5/17/2017,20170517,4,4.28,"This place is the bomb...- Fried Calamari -- Nom Nom 100%- Hot Dragon Udon -- Spicy & tasty- Sea Urchin Udon -- Creamy & yummyService -- Attentive & friendlyUdon -- Perfect texture and freshThis place is getting full easily since it's not a big restaurant. I would suggest to come here before 12 during lunch time or be ready to wait at least 30 min. Try their additional menu rice bowl on lunch special. The only thing i complain is the white wine....it comes in a very small glass and very less, this is the reason why i give 4 stars instead of 5."
5/17/2017,20170517,5,4.28,"Delicious hand made Udon from scratch, I loved the sea urchin Udon, soft egg tempura and shrimp tempura, I would need to go back to try the tomato seafood Udon, really reminded of japan, wonderful friendly service"
5/18/2017,20170518,4,4.28,"Good quality, house made udon! They have some strange dishes, like creamy uni and butter squid. They reminded me of alfredo sauce. I also saw some girls eating mac n cheese styled udon in a baked pan. Super strange but maybe it's a trend?Since I'm from Chicago and never get quality Asian food, I stuck with the classics. I got the duck udon and it was perfect. Duck cooked nicely, a few green onions, and a nice clear broth, all to compliment the hand pulled udon. Comparable but not as good as the ones in Honolulu (best udon ever, per Yelp. check it out!)."
5/19/2017,20170519,5,4.28,"I have heard great stories about Monzo, but I was not expecting the udon to taste so delicious! The soup was rich with flavor, and the tempura was nice and crispy. Two thumbs up for Monzo."
5/22/2017,20170522,4,4.28,"Craving some Japanese Food? Then definitely come here! This place is located in Little Tokyo, therefore parking is either a blessing or a curse. You have options of parking in a structure which you have to pay for, or if youre lucky you can find metered street parking. The location itself is pretty small but they pack lots of people inside and get through tables quickly which is nice. I came with a party of 3 so we only waited around 10 mins for table. We ended up getting seated at the bar and what was cool is you can see the workers making the noodles fresh. We ordered some calamari and takoyaki balls as appetizers and I ordered the carbonara udon as the entree. The calamari was really crispy and flakey which is what I love. I hate when its just soggy and too chewy. A drip of lemon and a dip in their sauce is perfection. The takoyaki balls were pretty good too and even contemplated getting some more but i resisted for the main course lolNow the udon!! It came and smelled amazing! The noodles were thick and pretty much melted in your mouth cause of how fresh they were! The base was very creamy and it went perfect with the green onion. I wish I ordered a egg instead of seaweed since it seemed to have went better with the dish. It was plenty of food and I finished satisfied! Definitely a place worth checking out! Theres so many different options to try here!"
5/22/2017,20170522,5,4.28,"Came here around 8 on a Saturday night and waited 1 hour for a party of 4. I had the mental squid butter udon. I liked it a lot. Very fishy from the fish roe but not heavy since the soup didn't have heavy cream like the uni udon or the carbonara udon that my friend ordered. I was also very happy with the tender pieces of squid in the dish. The toro rice bowl was also delicious as a side (very small portion). I could eat 4 of those easy. Someone from our group ordered the bukkake (non-sexual) beef udon served cold. He said it was strange that it was cold. But if you could get over the fact it was cold, it was good. Service was good. Would consider coming later closer to closing to avoid the wait."
5/23/2017,20170523,4,4.28,"Came here during a Little Tokyo adventure for a double date. My friends are the foodies of foodies, so they like to surprise my partner and I with food places. I have never had udon before, so I was neutral about coming here, but Marugame Monzo was a pleasant surprise. After having the Sea Urchin Udon with Uni Sauce, I'm sold. The sauce was delicious, and the bowl had just enough to satisfy me. Only downer is definitely the price, as this is one of the most expensive items on the menu at about $17 a bowl. Service was appropriately responsive, and while there is typically a long wait outside, we were inside within 15 minutes for a party of 4. I honestly do not anticipate coming back here because of the drive and I don't think I'd be craving this too much, but I am happy with my experience!"
5/26/2017,20170526,5,4.28,"Marugame Monzo puts crack into their udon. I swear they do, even thought, they make their udon at the store, I'm sure they sprinkle some before they serve it to you.With that being said, just be prepared for 1 hour wait. The staff is very attentive and diligent. The food is so good. I love glutenous noodles and Marugame just delivers. It's very different from all the numerous ramen bars in Little Tokyo. The soup they serve with their udon is slightly salty ---that umami, mouthwatering experience. So far, I've tried the mushroom udon and the cold udon. I didn't like the cold udon as much."
5/31/2017,20170531,4,4.28,"I was craving noodles one cold day and found Marugame Monzo on Yelp. With all these reviews, I knew that I had to try it. This place is located in Little Tokyo and anyone knows how hard it is to find parking here. With that in mind, I took an Uber here. It was Sunday afternoon, past lunchtime, so I was hoping that that the wait would not be too long. The wait ended up being about 20 minutes, which was not too bad. As I waited to be called up, I was looking at the menu and it was SOOOO hard to decide what I wanted. The restaurant itself is very small and I actually wanted to be seated at the bar, so I can see them make the fresh noodles, but no luck. I did get seated at a table very close to the bar so I can see them work. After changing my mind a bazillion times, I finally decided on the chasu pork bowl and side udon. The waiter asked what type of udon I wanted, which I got confused for a second and I had thought that a side udon was just udon noodles in broth. But, he told me that I can choose any type of udon and I ordered the curry udon. When I got the food, I realized that he had misunderstood me and that he thought I wanted udon with a side of rice. But, since I was hungry, I decided to eat it. But, that was WAYYYY too much food for me. The curry udon was really good, I loved the noodles and the taste. My chasu pork bowl was a little disappointing as the pork was not as tender and there was almost no flavor to the bowl. Ultimately, I was glad that the waiter misheard me. Overall, a pretty good place if you are craving udon. This place does get crowded pretty quickly so try to come when not busy to avoid the crowds."
6/1/2017,20170601,5,4.28,"If you have the patience and time to wait, it's worth it! Please don't leave the area because if they call you and you're not there, you lose your place in line. Don't yell at the employees because you left and you lost your seat. It's rude. This place makes fresh udon noodles. Their broth is perfectly savory but not too salty. There's even a vegetarian udon with vegetarian broth on the menu for those who want it. I tried about 7 different types of broths and noodles and loved them all. There's something for every udon mood. When I want something different and creamy, my favorite is the seafood mentai. When I want something more ""traditional"" I like the hot beef udon. When it's hot, I like the cold bukkake udon. Their dinner menu has a braised pork belly appetizer and that's one of my favorite pork belly dishes."
6/1/2017,20170601,5,4.28,"Luckily my friend and I arrived early, as there was already a line forming outside of the restaurant prior to opening at 5! We requested to be seated at the bar, where we had a clear view of the udon preparation. The price of each bowl ranges from around $8-$17 (about average to pricey) depending on the order. They serve mini bowls and add-ons as well, which pair greatly with the noodles. After debating between the signatures & hot udon bowls, we both ordered the beef udon with a soft-boiled egg and kakiage (vegetable tempura cake) on the side. Broth (5/5): Served HOT (though I have to admit, it cooled down pretty quickly because we took a million pics for the gram before actually tasting the broth. But that's on us). The first thing I take note of when my bowl of soup noodles is served, is its temperature. In the past, there have been instances where I've eaten ramen or udon where the soup is slightly warmer than room , the way it should be; however, this was pleasant to the taste. The flavor becomes much more apparent (and maybe a little saltier than expected) when the broth cools down, the reason for the importance of having hot broth. Noodles (5/5): Texture was on point-- which would be obvious, given that these are freshly handmade and does not leave a grainy feeling in the mouth after eating. Meat (5/5): Thinly sliced, perfect balance of lean beef with an even thinner layer of fat in between for the flavor and chewiness. Oh, and the noodles to meat ratio for this specific bowl is excellent. SOFT-BOILED EGG: DONE. RIGHT. For those who know me, you know I'm all about eating eggs. The creaminess of the yolk was a great complement to the chewy yet soft texture of the beef. Kakiage: I appreciated this side-dish because of its tower-like presentation and that the vegetables were shredded, adding the perfect amount of crunch while having noodles. I was contented by the baby shrimp and scallop pieces added on top of the squash and sweet potatoes. I would order this again. I would love to come back again soon, but will definitely go for a signature dish (oooh oooh uni you callin' to me) and order a mini bowl as well!"
6/1/2017,20170601,5,4.28,"I usually don't like udon because it's so plain. We ordered two bowls of udon to share amongst three. We also ordered a pork belly rice bowl, squid tempura, octopus tempura, and the softboiled egg tempura. I was pretty excited to try to the softboiled egg tempura because I felt like if soft boiled eggs are delicious why not add a crunchy layer of also delicious tempura? Every tempura thing we got was very oily, wouldn't recommend getting the tempura. However the udon was delicious. The noodles are freshly made, you can see them rolling it through the window of the kitchen.  We got the creamy uni and the squid with fish eggs. The broth was so complex, it really paired well with the udon noodles. It was really delicious and very reasonably priced. :) great value! BTW they don't take reservations, will not seat you unless your whole party is there"
6/3/2017,20170603,5,4.28,"Try to get there before they open because there is a line. Service is quick and staff are attentive. Also, the food comes out pretty quickly and it tastes good. The only downside is that the tables next you you are a little too close."
6/3/2017,20170603,4,4.28,Great fresh udon. Perhaps I'm biased because I love udon noodles but its a good place to eat.
6/4/2017,20170604,5,4.28,"Be prepared for lineups. We arrived on a weeknight around 5:30pm and there were a few people in front of us, and the line only got worse as the evening went on. Fortunately we were seated within about 15min at that time. General point about the udon: I'm not familiar with udon, I've had my fair share of ramen though. These udon noodles are hand-made and you can watch it being sliced and prepared through a glass viewing window from the dining area. Fresh udon noodles are a life-changing experience to eat - they're thick, chewy, and hypnotically deliciousHot Dragon Udon: Damn son, this is rich and savory and filling! It isn't too spicy, it's a well balanced pork broth. Mentai Squid Butter Udon: I've never had a broth like this before, it's crammed with little eggs that add an almost crunchy texture to the broth. I can also taste butter and milk so it's a creamy broth, but not overly heavy, it's balanced just right. There are some restaurants that are life-changing for me, and Marugame Monzo is definitely one of them. It's a step up from ramen, that's for sure. Udon is such an underrated dish in the USA and I'm sure it'll continue to catch on. I long to come back and sample their other many delicious-looking flavors."
6/5/2017,20170605,5,4.28,"My go-to for udon and worth any wait. I highly suggest trying their Shrimp Tempura Udon or the Udon Gratin for a delectable twist. The shrimp udon has their basic broth and noodles with two pieces of tempura on the side. Their tempura is cut butterfly-style and is perfectly fried. It's sweetness and crunch complimentary to the handmade noodles. The gratin has a cheesy, rich base. It's extremely savory with pieces of chicken and the satisfying cheese strands with almost every bite. It's baked and so amazing to the taste. The service is great. They check on you often and are quick at fulfilling your requests. When entering the establishment you are welcomed by an intimate place and a large window of the kitchen where you can see the cooks rolling, cutting and creating their popular noodles."
6/5/2017,20170605,5,4.28,"The first time we came here, they sat us right in front of the window where you can watch the chefs make the udon. That's what first sold this place to us. Then the food came and it was amazing! We have yet to have a bad meal or have bad service here! Every time we come we try something new and it is always amazing! Some of my favorites are the hot dragon udon (yummy spicy broth, spicy ground pork and crunchy been sprouts) the udon gratin (warm cheesy udon with chicken) seafood tomato cream udon (creamy tomato udon with a lot of yummy shrimp and scallops) and side orders of tempura eggs and tempura eggplant! This place is a must if you visit little Tokyo!"
6/5/2017,20170605,5,4.28,"They make the udon in front of your face! So fresh! This place is always poppin'. I usually try to get here about half an hour before they reopen midday for dinner and the wait is not bad. Even if I had to wait a long time, I would, because Monzo is THAT good. So far I've tried the miso carbonara, the mushroom udon (forgot the actual name, sorry), the cold udon and the mentai squid butter udon. None have disappointed me. Flavors are so consistent. Noodles are thick, chewy, and soak up all the flavor of the broth. If it's your first time, I'd go all out and for a signature udon. Their signature broths are hella creamy and dense, but they are comfort food and are so delicious. Some of the creamier udons can be a bit salty, but nothing water won't fix. Portions are great and the quality is there for the price you're paying. The appetizers are pretty bomb too. Try the eggplant that's drenched in some kind of sweet tempura like sauce. It's amazing. Also, please be considerate and not sit around/chat after you're done. Eat your meal and leave so you can allow others to enjoy the experience as well. The layout of the restaurant is so that you can get a quick fix and leave. There's limited proximity between you and other consumers too so it's not somewhere you really wanna chat up a hot date at, lol."
6/7/2017,20170607,5,4.28,"It's worth the wait! Trust me! The restaurant is small so you'll have to wait outside until your table is ready. Also, they don't have a parking lot so you'll have to find street parking or park in the lot across the street. I've gone to the Marugame Monzo in Las Vegas and it was so good that I had to go to the one in LA!The Sea Urchin Cream Udon is hands down my favorite! I ordered it when I was at their Vegas location and I ordered it at this location. Definitely A MUST! The tempura is really good and so is the negitoro wrap! Marugame Monzo has an extensive menu! There are plenty of options from cold and hot dishes. I can't wait to go back to try different things on the menu, but honestly, I think I'll end up ordering the same things again because it's THAT good!"
6/7/2017,20170607,5,4.28,"This is the best udon and tempura I've ever had!!! I really enjoy the classic clear broth udons (pork belly, duck), but they are famous for their creamy options (miso carbonara, sea urchin). Whatever you choose, the fresh udon has an amazing mouth-feel and an al dente chewiness. The tempura sides (shrimp, soft-boiled egg) are so amazing they almost steal the show. It is a perfectly light, crispy tempura that is not too oily.If you are trying to pick between Monzo and Daikokuya, please understand they are quite different from each other. I love them both in their own right, so just figure out if you want classic ramen (daikokuya) or classic/outside the box udon (monzo)."
6/9/2017,20170609,5,4.29,"Normally not a huge fan of udon but this place is amazing! I've had the Dragon, Squid Butter, and Champon Udon and all were delicious. Get the Dragon Udon with the mini tempura rice bowl. Mini is misleading because it's a generous stack of tempura that you should soak into the udon broth after devouring the house made noodles. Worth the wait!"
6/9/2017,20170609,5,4.29,"As real as it gets and the only place in Little Tokyo actually worth the wait...better than the majority of the udon spots I've eaten at in Japan. Top notch curry udon, and some of the best fried chicken I've ever had!"
6/10/2017,20170610,5,4.29,"The udon here is phenomenal because you can watch the staff make it by hand. It's extra soft and tender. Staff is also very nice here. Their to-go containers for perfectly in cup holders!However, the wait can be insane, especially around lunch. I even came 9 minutes after they opened and there was already a 10 minute wait. It doesn't help that their store is really small and can't fit many people. You gotta sign your name on the clipboard they have inside in order to be put on the wait list and they call your name.So far, I've had the Creamy Tomato Seafood which is like an udon pasta sitting in thick creamy tomato broth with onion, bits of shrimp and baby scallops. I wish they had garlic bread because it would go really well with this dish.The vegetable signature udon dish was a kind of clear broth with lots of diced veggies (cabbage, carrot, onion) and some mushrooms. It's okay, nothing to write home about.The tempura shrimp one is a basic udon clear broth bowl with 2 crispy tempura shrimps on a separation plate. It's alright, pretty basic.My favorite though is the butter squid because the squid is super tender and soft. It's like biting into a squid marshmallow. Broth is rich too.The only con other than the wait is the portions. Not to be sexist, but it's a comfortable to pretty full portion size for a petite girl. Guys with big appetites might not get full like my brother. It's​ about the same size as 2/3 of those white styrofoam to-go boxes, not filled to the top."
6/10/2017,20170610,5,4.29,"This place is THE place you want to go to for some gourmet AF udon. We waited maybe less than 30 minutes on a Saturday for lunch which is so good and so SO worth it for the food we got. We had the fried calamari and takoyaki as appetizers and they were gone within seconds! The calamari was so soft to chew and I don't know how they fry it but it felt so fluffy (?). Takoyaki was great as well. Not straight-from-Japan / the one you had that one time in Harajuku kind of good but v good nonetheless. Then our party of 3 decided to each get something very different from one another on purpose. We had the miso carbonara, hot beef udon, and cold bukkake udon. The carbonara can be kind of heavy and super creamy but the bacon and noodles were cooked perfectly. If you're craving a nice twist to the tradition udon with soup, this is it. The beef udon was good but somewhat not out of the norm? The bukkake is very refreshing and a good contrast carbonara. Service is pretty fast and good. Parking is.. well LA parking. Expect to pay like $10 but hey, this udon I think is worth a try."
6/10/2017,20170610,5,4.29,Omg...I love love love this place!!! Tried to go to ramen at first but ended up here and can I say best thing that happened that day! I'm not a huge udon fan but man...this place made me a believer! I got the squid udon and my husband got the uni. We ended up switching only because I wanted to eat a little bit of both! Must try! In fact I'm craving it right now....mmmmm nom nom
6/11/2017,20170611,4,4.29,"First time trying this place, it was really good but the amount for what you get versus what you paid for was too small for me. I tend to have big mouth so I prob could have finished within 3 bites. I took the most little small bites I could to savor the taste cuz it was pretty good. I ordered carbonara udon and the creamy soup with the noodles went well together. Overall, pretty good but do not expect a handful amount of food."
6/11/2017,20170611,5,4.29,The preparation and craftsmanship that goes into the creation of the perfect Udon is nothing less than impeccable and a rare treat in the heart of the City of Angeles.
6/12/2017,20170612,4,4.29,"The handmade udon here is a treat. It's super cool to walk on in to see someone making fresh udon...and there is always someone making fresh udon since they go through so much of it. On a warm day, a bowl of fresh cold udon will hit the spot. The udon is a lovely chewy and soft texture, and the accoutrements help showcase the udon rather than mask it. Walked in with a couple of friends for a late lunch on a hot day while a parade was going on. The restaurant wasn't too busy but had a healthy number of people eating. Service was quick, friendly, and efficient. Everything was well done. Would be happy to come back."
6/12/2017,20170612,5,4.29,"The duck udon is a must! This place always has a decent wait, so it's better to go in small groups during non-peak hours. However, their house made udon noodles are fantastic and once you do get in service is great!"
6/13/2017,20170613,3,4.29,"This was my first time having udon, and I guess I shouldn't have ordered the Udon Gratin, which was equivalent to eating mac and cheese with udon noodles. I found the dish extremely heavy and oily, there was literally pools of oil collecting on every surface and crevice of this bowl. It was good, but I could only eat less than 10 bites. I would stick to one of their more classic dishes next time."
6/14/2017,20170614,5,4.29,Hidden Gem!I'm actually not a fan of Udon noodles but my friend kept raving about this place. Right when you walk through those doors you could see the authenticity of the restaurant. I Recommend coming before rush hour because this place is fairly small and it gets packed super quick. I came with a party of 4 and the wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't bad at all considering we came around lunch time. We requested to sit at the bar so we could see the chef's in the making. Freshly handmade Udon noodles?! No wonder this place was so packed!FOOD:Uni Udon- Of course I had to try their Uni udon which is one of their specialties. Very creamy and rich in flavor and they give you so much Uni! The noodles itself was perfectly cooked! Surprised I actually enjoyed this dish. The pricing wasn't even that bad especially for the amount they give you!Crispy Chicken Skin- YUMMM.. It was soo good but I had to stop myself from eating more LOL..
6/14/2017,20170614,1,4.29,"Server was incredibly rude, waited for over an hour and a half until being fed up with waiting, even though i was higher on the list. Told him twice that we were skipped, ignored again. Extremely undeliverable."
6/15/2017,20170615,5,4.29,Stopped by for lunch. Walk in to put your name on the list - it is worth the wait! We only waited less than ten minutes. I recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch the chefs hand pull the udon noodles. It was like getting an extra show with your meal! I had the totally vegetarian udon and ate the ENTIRE bowl right up. It was amazing! Can't wait to go back to try the rice bowls.
6/15/2017,20170615,5,4.29,"This place's udon was amazing. Everything from the broth, meat, and noodles were spectacular. I had the sea urchin udon and the beef udon and it was dumb lit! The sea urchin udon kind of tasted like pasta and the beef udon was pretty good. The noodles' texture was grade-a."
6/15/2017,20170615,5,4.29,It's so good! My favorite udon place. You can watch the guy make the noodles fresh through the window at the table. Definitely coming back :-)
6/16/2017,20170616,4,4.29,"I'm not really a fan of udon, but Marugame Monzo was pretty good! I prefer ramen over udon.When we got here in the morning, there was already a line down the street. I didn't realize how popular this restaurant was. Apparently, people go crazy in Hawaii for it too. We lucked out with getting seated. There were two women in front of us whose entire party wasn't there in line so they got skipped. My party of 4 took the last four available seats at the bar. I ordered the tempura udon. It was okay. Like I said, not really a fan of udon, but it wasn't bad. It wasn't amazing and mind blowing either. I liked sitting at the bar because we were able to watch the food being cooked and the noodles being handmade.Price is a big high, but that comes with the Japanese culture and beliefs. I wouldn't line up and wait hours in line for this restaurant. If you changed this to shabu, that would be another story."
6/16/2017,20170616,5,4.29,"The Udon Noodles are excellent here, some of the best. The egg and squid are very good and the noodles are made fresh in front of you. Serve big portions. One of the places you need to go to when in Little Tokyo."
6/18/2017,20170618,5,4.29,"My favorite Udon in LA. The sea urchin is so rich and creamy and is unlike anything ive had out of a bowl of udon before. The lines are sometimes several hours long, I strongly suggest going here between 2-5pm which is when they seem to be at their low point customer wise."
6/19/2017,20170619,4,4.29,"Been wanting to try this place out for a while and it was finally my first time here and omg, the uni udon was so good!! (Didn't get a picture because I just dug right into my bowl when I got it) it was the perfect amount of creaminess and the right amount of udon to finish and not feel like you're getting tired of the flavors. My friend brought me here to try it and he got the seafood tomato cream udon. That one was really good too and it had little scallops and shrimp in his udon. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up eating my bowl and some of his LOL! I would definitely come here again but I probably wouldn't know which udon to choose because I'd want to eat both :')"
6/19/2017,20170619,5,4.29,I love this place. It never fails me! I don't have a favorite becuase almost every udon bowl tastes amazing. I'm on a mission to try every bowl! The calamari is great with every bowl and the draft Asahi tops off every meal! You can taste the uniqueness and love that goes into the udon. Plus there's a great show to watch through the glass. I never remember to take a picture becuase I'm too excited to eat it. Maybe I'll remember eventually.
6/19/2017,20170619,5,4.29,The uni udon is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Can't stop thinking about it even after I moved to the east coast.
6/20/2017,20170620,5,4.29,"SO GOOD! THE WAIT IS WORTH IT!It's next to a popuoar ramen place Daikokuya (might spelled it wrong. Sorry!). Both side had a long wait. For Monzo, I had 5 or 6 names before me and it took around 30-40 minutes? Finding parking is annoying because it's either fight for street parking or pay extra at parking lots. We were lucky and found a street spot really fast. We got seated inside by the booth and got to watch the noodles being handmade! Pretty cool!Sea urchin udon is a must try! Really rich and creamy. It was a bit too small for me but if you wait a bit, you'll notice that the richness of the dish will leave you satisfied. Not full but not starving either. The uni seemed baked a bit or something because it's more dry and had a smokey taste. So for those who likes uni with a less seafood taste, then this baked one is perfect for you. Service : server was nice and friendly. Came to refill water and smiled at us lot. Great eye contact too. Food come out at a fast speed so you don't wait too long. Interior / exterior : located across little tokyo. Very small looking from the outside and dark as well. But once you walk in, it's dim but with lanterns lighting everything up. There's a booth area where you see the ramen being made. I feel like that's the best spot because there's the most space. The place is pretty small so many of the tables are close to each other. Overall, the uni udon was amazing. Really love the food and the service was great too. I definitely recommend trying Monzo!"
6/21/2017,20170621,3,4.29,"What if I said it? A little overrated... i ordered the cold udon with egg and it was better than their spicy soup udon. The udon didn't taste as fresh as udon from Hawaii. The texture and bounciness wasn't there. Their pork belly bowl was bland, also a bunch of rice underneath. Beef bowl was okay, but I needed to use their chili seasoning for five coats. My egg in the cold udon was peeled poorly and was just a regular egg! It wasn't the tempura egg that I looked forward to. We also ordered takoyaki, only three pieces. Was good but definitely did not change my opinion. Total around $35, I didn't think it was worth my wallet."
6/22/2017,20170622,5,4.29,"We need more Udon places like Marugame - or at least more Udon places because there definitely isn't enough of them!Marugame is located next to the popular Daikokuya ramen place in Little Tokyo. We came here on a Saturday night for dinner and I was expecting some kind of insane wait time because it was a fairly small place, but surprisingly not! The total wait time for us was around 40 minutes.My friend and I ordered the most popular dish - the Sea Urchin (aka uni) Udon - and the Vongole Udon. The Sea Urchin Udon's broth was like a bisque and it was AMAZING! If you haven't tried uni before and love seafood, this is a good intro to it! The rich broth mixed with the subtle taste of uni was a great combo. I only wish that they had more uni in the bowl since there were only pieces of it, but still fantastic nonetheless. The Vongole Udon was just as good - the boiled clams with a savory white wine broth had excellent comfort food vibes. Both meals were an excellent portion that left us satisfyingly full without going into a food coma, and wasn't crazy expensive. I think I may have found my new favorite spot in Little Tokyo!"
6/23/2017,20170623,5,4.29,"My god, this place exceeded my expectations. With its high ratings, I thought I might be easily disappointed. I've never been as big a fan of udon as ramen - typically I try to go to Daikokuya next door, and all these years I've skipped over trying this place right next door. I am SO glad that we got impatient of waiting for Daikokuya and decided to just go here instead! THIS IS THE BEST UDON I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE. I had never known udon could taste so good. I am a newly converted fan. We ordered the uni pasta - the sauce was so creamy and delicious, and even though I myself am not a huge fan of seafood like uni, the udon noodles in that sauce still tasted wonderful to me. We also got the beef udon - the soup was so flavorful, and the udon noodles had the perfect amount of soft chewiness. Taking some back as leftovers, they still tasted great the next day! The service was also super fast and pleasant."
6/24/2017,20170624,4,4.29,"I've been here a few times and I have tried enough dishes to have a regular routine of what to order. I lean towards the speciality udon dishes because I feel like that's what makes marugame, marugame. Below are my top 2Sea urchin udon: It is a creamy sauce with bits of uni with a subtle uni taste. Overall my favorite dish here. Squid udon: it is a buttery yumminess where all I want to do is slurp the broth! Each spoonful of the Broth is filled with squid eggs and butter! I also think it's a nice touch to see them make the udon on site through the window. FYI: For some reason I always order the tempura egg because it sounds so good! But I always forget that it's underwhelming."
6/24/2017,20170624,4,4.29,Udon here is very good. For udon with soup we always get the clam ones . For dry udon the ikura ones are surprisingly refreshing with just udon /dashi/radish/green onion/ikura! The uni ones I think is a bit too creamy/heavy though
6/25/2017,20170625,5,4.29,"I tried the butter squid udon! It looked really weird at first, but it tasted pretty good. Definitely a first for me so I liked that not only did I try something different and new, but it was actually pretty good. A little on the salty side, but still good. I also had the seafood salad. Trust me. I'm not a big seafood fan or a salad fan, but it was goooooood. The dressing was really good!! I wanted to ask for the recipe. (Tell me!) The parking in this area is always difficult, but it's ok. I just pay for parking at any lot that's available. The line is also very long, but I would say it moves quickly."
6/25/2017,20170625,3,4.29,"Great experience, but not impressed w the food. We had braised pork belly, creamy uni Udon, and the mixed seafood Udon. It definitely isn't something I would crave for. Both of our dishes were creamy based. Perhaps, if I return, I would try the soup based one."
6/26/2017,20170626,4,4.29,"This was one heck of a cheat day...I love carbs and udon is right up there in my top five cheat day carbs. Hubby and I arrived just a shade before 11 when the line for Daikokuya right next door was forming. MM doesn't open until 11:30 so we went to browse around. We lost track of time and by the time we returned (5 minutes before opening), the line for MM had gotten long. We would have missed the first round seating cut off if we hadn't agreed to squeeze three people onto a small two-top right next to the entrance.I'd been here before (not sure why I didn't review it) and was really looking forward to their in-house made noodles. I didn't remember being super impressed with the uni udon last time but we just had to get it again. I also got the mentai squid butter udon while brother got the ume shiso udon and hubby got the udon gratin. If you're doing math, you probably realized we got four dishes for three people. NBD!This was lunch and we did hear a nearby table with MM veterans asking for double portions of the noodle so the portions were definitely manageable. Fave was definitely the ume shiso, not just being it was cold and it was freaking hot outside. Ume shiso is definitely one of my favorite flavor profiles ever. Hubby's gratin was very cheesy and rich of which I wasn't a huge fan. The uni udon was good and better than I remembered and my mentai squid was nice and light. We also got a small salad (good) and one each of their soft boiled egg and their tempura soft boiled egg. The eggs were cooled well but you pretty much had to mix it into one of the udon dishes to get any sort of flavor.Service was nice and mostly on the mark. They even set up a water station because it was so hot outside for all the people waiting.Nice lunch, maybe a little hot indoors but not too shabby."
6/26/2017,20170626,5,4.29,"This place is so good! Love their noodles. You cant go wrong on any of the items. Literally! I had the duck udon and chicken skin. My friends got the uni udon, beef tataki. Everything was delicious!"
6/26/2017,20170626,1,4.29,"The food is good, no doubt. Definitely no Marukame but considering that you would have to fly 5 hours for that, this is pretty decent for something local.My review is totally based on the customer service and the lack of professionalism from the really short Asian boy with the curly hair that was working as a host on the afternoon of June 25, 2017. Let me tell you, this child has a temper, defensive, raises his voice, throws a fit, and likes to cause a scene. As the host, he was the face to this restaurant.I was seriously dumbfounded by his behavior. I couldn't believe this was any commercial establishment. I swear I was literally waiting for his mother to come in and pull him by the ear to stop his tantrum. Who hired this little twit? We had put our name down like everybody else. We were on the second sheet, first column #7, and they were barely calling the names on the first sheet 2nd column. There were tons of names in front of us. We estimated that it would be good to check up on an hour. So we went to the grocery store to buy chips and drinks to hold us off. Came back and sat at the lottery store three stores down.It was a very hot afternoon. There was little shade left in front of the restraurant and I felt it should go to the older people waiting in line. Watching all the young kids take perfectly good spots from the older people was atrocious. This older lady was sitting in between stores on a stair looking burnt and defeated. Kids were standing in front of her blocking the draft that would've been coming her way. So we decided to wait further down and one of three of us would come check periodically.My first encounter with him was after waiting an hour plus already. I had asked about how much longer for my name. He immediately got defensive and said he doesn't give out times because he doesn't want to be held responsible and all these other excuses that I could barely understand. I'm like whoa chill out. Just wanted to know when to check back jeez. But I let him know that when we called someone gave us an estimated time of 30 to 40 mins which we already knew was a lie, but the point is, that monzo does give out times. Like a child, he said it ""wasn't me."" I can't stand when a company doesn't work together in unison. Acting like they are separate entities. At this point there were 9 names ahead of us.So my friend went to go check shortly after me. I called her crazy for checking because I was literally just there. After a while she came back furious saying that our name got called and we got scratched and that he told her to wait in line again. WTH. literally 5 minutes went by.. No joke. How does 9 names disappear in 5 minutes??Apparently many names before us had given up so it went by fast. But even when I went to check only one name had been scratched off after us. That means he just called our name no more than a few minutes ago.. If not seconds. So i went over to tell him that we are still here and to not scratch our name off. He said you weren't here when I called you. I said obviously but that was only 5 minutes ago tops and we shouldn't have to wait in line again. He kept saying he had to think about it. There's nothing to think about. We're here, we've been here. Its almost been 2 hours. He ARGUED with us, customers, that people behind us in the list have been waiting a long time. I told him duh we know, we've been waiting longer since we're higher up on the list. He ARGUED/yelled more asking where were you guys when I called. Frankly that's none of your business but we were three shops down avoiding the gawd damn Sun. What a little fucking retard. He had nothing. Kept arguing for no reason other than to argue. He said he had to think about it. I told him I'll give him 5 minutes to ""think"" about this life altering question. And as suspected to save his face, he took one table, then took us next.This behaviour is unbelievable. How do children like him get a job in customer service. Here's a tip kid.. Next time, you answer like any other prefessional restaurant worker does.. ""Sorry we missed you. We had called your name and you weren't there at the time but we'll still try to accomodate you."" that way you still get your little jab at the customer. you don't argue with customers son."
6/28/2017,20170628,5,4.29,"Long line, even longer wait, but so so worth it. Be ready to wait at least an hour during dinner hours. Once inside the place is small and crowded but the food is amazing. Their butter squid specialty udon is amazing and don't forget to get a tempura soft boiled egg with it. The butter squid isn't the least bit overwhelming and it is so savory and the noodle texture is amazing and the right amount of chew"
6/28/2017,20170628,3,4.29,"Their menu are different, interesting, and worth trying. Especially when they make their own udon. Love how the waiter kept his calm cool friendly smile throughout the whole time being that extremely busy. We tried the uní and curry udon. It's a bit too rich for us."
6/29/2017,20170629,1,4.28,"Food was good but no way in hell would I come back! The host (line monitor) was outright rude and unprofessional. Food just taste that much more shittier when customer service is poor. Prior to arriving, we called to check for an approximate wait time and was told 30-45mins. Signed in and checked on our status periodically. We waited 2hrs or so and was delivered the most horrendous customer service. Our names were crossed off the list because he counted 3 Mississippis and we didn't respond fast enough. Therefore, we had to wait in line again. That's a part time job! I mean, if any human being has that kind of time to camp directly outside their door in the scorching heat and a crowd of people and have the host yelling and arguing with you then more power to you."
6/30/2017,20170630,5,4.28,"WOW!! And WOW!!!!! Took my partner here for her birthday, she picked the place of course. My nephew joined us. First time eating at Marugame Monzo, and what a fantastic surprise!! Sunday at dinner time, we waited about 45 minutes on the list. Waiting outside was cool, lots of activity to watch on the street, and easy conversation as we waited in Little Tokyo. They called us in and it was ON! Great food, everything fresh and tasty! No regrets coming here, as every dish our table ordered was fantastic. My fave was anything pork belly, it was like eating a meal made by the angels and desired by the Devil himself!! Go there, GO NOW!!"
7/1/2017,20170701,4,4.28,"I looooove the udon here. I always get the mentai squid butter...hard to stray and try something different when it always hits the spot. I have been here a handful of times and I am always satisfied. The last time I came my noodles were a bit soggy so I was a little disappointed, but usually they are on point. There is often a long line, but they get you in out and pretty quickly."
7/2/2017,20170702,5,4.28,"Brief Review: Absolutely delicious udon. Great service. Handmade udon that you can see being made while you eat. Time of Review: Saturday, 6/24 at 12pmPositives: The Uni Udon was simply amazing and probably one of the best udons I've had in LA. The broth was slightly sweet and was lightly creamy texture but not to the point that if felt like cream of mushroom soup. They also don't skimp on the sea urchin meat. Overall the soup had subtle but complementary flavors. The Kakiage was basically a fancy fried onion cylinder (doesn't sound appetizing but it is!). The dish was lightly fried and not heavily breaded like an onion ring. It's a little difficult to pick apart with chopsticks but I would also recommend this dish as well. My date and I sat in front of the staff as they made the udon which was a nice touch (don't worry it won't get in your food there is a glass window). Negatives: My complaints are mainly logistical. The wait can be a little long (about 40 minutes in my case), but I think it's worth the wait. Parking is pretty horrible in Little Tokyo if you want street parking, but if you don't mind the pay lots, it's not bad at all. Cost: $17 Uni Udon, Kakiage $3 (I think)Tips: 1) The wait can be a little long. I put my name down around 11:35pm and was seated around 12:10pm. They have a strict wait policy, and so don't wander around too long. Transportation: It's in Little Tokyo. So take a little more time for parking. It's not a hard place to find since there's usually a huge line between Daikokuya and Marugame Monzo. Service: GoodParking: I would recommend the Aiso Parking Lot. It's pretty reasonable around $5 I think. If you want free parking, you might have to walk from the Arts District ~15 minutes."
7/2/2017,20170702,5,4.28,"My go to place for udon! Again another fusion restaurant.Baked cheese udon is a bit heavy. Worth trying once but if you're with other people have someone else to share a traditional udon (noncreamy broth) with. The cheese can be overwhelming if you don't love love that much cheese. They also have traditional udon, which I think aren't too heavy. You can ask for the meat on the side if you find the beef adds too much fat to the soup. The cold udon is amazing is a hot day. I always go for one with grated daikon (japanese radish).This place definitely gets crowded on weekends. Beware of crowds on weekends at peak eating hours. Cor that same reason it can be hard to get a table for parties larger than 4 at peak hours."
7/4/2017,20170704,5,4.29,"I highly recommend this restaurant if you've never been a handmade udon place. The line can be a bit long, so try going during off hours. Parking is always a bit hard in Little Tokyo. I would try to park at one of the $5 or less parking lots. Price is a bit pricey, but I think it's well worth it! One of those places I would take visitors to when they're visiting LA ."
7/5/2017,20170705,4,4.29,"I don't like to wait for more than 30 minutes for food. Really don't! However, this place was so worth the wait for their fresh hand made udon. My friend and I tried the creamy urchin udon and the curry udon with pork belly. The broth of the creamy urchin udon was a thick, gravy-like broth with a fair amount of seafood flavor. The mixture between the creaminess and a hint of seafood was perfect. It was one of the most unique, yet delicious broth I had tried! This udon was one of those dishes where you had the first bite and you kept wanting to have more until there was none left. This udon deserves 5/5.For the curry udon, the poke belly was outstanding. Every piece was very tasty and tender! The curry broth was flavorful but I could tell there was too much of MSG in it. (Just a bit too much!) My theory when it comes to trying out a new place is to try a popular dish first! If they have delicious popular item, then the rest would be good and vice versa. For those who do not eat udon regularly, curry udon is a featuring dish at most udon place. You just can't go wrong with it! At Marugame Monzu, the curry udon is about 4/5. If you plan to go here, go early! It is not fun to wait under the sun around this time of the year. Btw, they have free water with lemon where you signed in for seats. Cheers!"
7/6/2017,20170706,4,4.28,"MARUGAME MONZO is on 1st street of Little Tokyo in DTLA. Their noodles are daily freshly made and hand pulled. The lines outside of the restaurant is indicative of the quality and freshness of the pasta. There is an open kitchen so you can watch as they roll the pasta dough eventually being cut into udon noodles. They offer hot and cold options as well as appetizers and salads. We tried the Bukkake beef cold noodles and the ooey gooey goodness of the Udon gratin. I will definitely have to go back and try one of their hot udon, especially their Uni udon. Service was patient, friendly, and fast. The only problem was that it was hot as heck! The staff apologized for that as something was wrong with the AC. It was bearable but it definitely prevented one from having an all 5-star experience!There is a parking lot behind restaurant (entrance on Temple) for $8 and parking in the Japanese Village Plaza parking structure for $10. Street parking (metered) is difficult and requires a lot of patience unless you have great parking karma."
7/7/2017,20170707,5,4.29,"I ate here two times during my trip to LA during the 4th of July weekend. Both times were great-- there is a wait, of course, but I never found it to be that bad once the place opened and things got moving. They are very efficient. I got the Kitsune udon both times, as I am vegetarian and I didn't feel like going for the vegetable ramen (more expensive), though I did get several add-ons of tempura eggplant and pumpkin. Really good! The other members in my party got different items each time and were satisfied, as well.An added bonus was that the first time my group went, we were seated in front of the kitchen window, where we could see the udon being made."
7/7/2017,20170707,5,4.29,"This place is fantastic, I cannot lie! Udon is not my favorite noodle but Marugame Monzo made me a fan. The uni udon was creamy and filling as are their other dishes but I always have room for a pork belly rice on the side. I don't know what it is but the thinly sliced pork is cooked to salty perfection and topped with scallions (not my favorite either!) but it all disappears into my mouth! There is always a line for this place so you might have to wait but it's worth it, especially if you get a front row seat to the masters at work making udon behind the glass."
7/8/2017,20170708,5,4.29,Great spot for handmade udon. Flavor right on point and udon is absolutely delicious. Friendly service makes this place a pleasant experience that you want to come back again and again.
7/8/2017,20170708,5,4.29,"went here on a sat around 1pm and had to stand in line for 20+ mins, which doesn't sound so bad, but considering that it was 99 degrees F outside, is testament what people will put themselves through for monzos noodles.the udon, which is made on site by hand, is really the star. normally, factory udon will sit in my stomach for days. sometimes weeks. but monzos gives me none of those troubles. they have a wide selection of soups n toppings, and you can ask for veggie friendly options/stocks and even no msg. since it was so hawt, my dining buddy and i both had cold beers and cold udons. he had the shiso mentai while i had the sensai udon (lots of japanese forest veggies). both were excellentthe waitstaff said the beef udon (cold/hot) is one of their best sellers as is the uni. portions arent huge so if youre hungry, you can upsize the noodles for $2 (which my dining buddy did. i added a soft boiled egg). the bill, before tip, was ~$38restaurant was a little on the warm side (but definitely better than outside!). staff was friendly,service was quick. try to get seats by the counter so you can watch the noodle master at work!"
7/8/2017,20170708,5,4.29,"Really delicious udon, and you get to see them make it in front of you. The place gets crowded, but that's typically most restaurants in LA. The cold udon noodles, Bukake, were my favorite."
7/9/2017,20170709,5,4.29,"It took me 2 tries to finally get in here and see what the raving reviews were all about. The wait for this place is definitely no joke especially if you go during peak lunch or dinner times on weekends. Come during off hours like 3pm on the weekend for short wait times! Parking here is tricky as usual but we just parked in the Little Tokyo Mall parking structure right across from Marugame next to the Miyako Hotel (max of $10 on the weekends). Once we finally got seated after about 30 minutes (came at 2ish on a Saturday), everything after the wait was relatively smooth and quick! Our orders came out in like 5-10 min. We ordered a Cold Udon with Soft Boiled Egg (which is a bukkake udon with an egg) with a mini pork belly rice bowl on the side (~$9 + $3 for the mini bowl) and, of course, the infamous Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($16.95; seemed a little pricey but it ended up being pretty worth). If you order any udon, you can get a mini rice bowl on the side of your choice for $3-$4! First taste... I was actually so happy and pleasantly satisfied that I couldn't stop smiling for a long ass time. The sauce in the sea urchin cream udon was one of the richest and thickest things I've personally ever eaten and is probably all the reason I need to want to come back here. I'm normally not a big fan of uni, but mixed in with the creamy buttery goodness of the sauce, it was the perfect fusion flavor. Can confirm this is a MUST TRY if you come here (like all the other reviews say)!!! On top of that, the pork belly in the rice bowl was also probably one of the most delicious pork bellies I've had (subtle flavor with a slightly crispy texture). Bf's cold udon order was also very yummy and a refreshing choice for the summer if you don't wanna sweat. All of their udon noodles are fresh, thick and soft! Overall, if you can't already tell, I'm a huge fan of this place now and its long lines and reviews are all well deserved. Definitely check it out if you love udon, Japanese food, or are just curious -- it's worth it."
7/9/2017,20170709,5,4.29,This is the best place for udon in LA. They make all their noodles at the restaurant. I have tried 5 or 6 udons and was blown away by their uni udon. Even their side dishes were all high quality and taste. Highly recommended. This time I tried the beef. The noodles have the perfect texture and taste
7/9/2017,20170709,4,4.29,Parking: there's a parking structure across the street for little Tokyo. $10 for Saturday Sunday. No time limit. Read signs for details though. There was a good amount of empty space for us. Line wait: put your name down and walk around town. We had about 12 parties in front of us on a Sunday around 2pm. So we sat back in little Tokyo for a good 45 mins before we went back. Got called about 2 mins after. Food: first timers should def try the sea urchin (~$16) or the squid udon. Depending for your taste and mood. The urchin is creamy and sweet almost. Balances well with the texture and taste of the urchin. The squid is a lot lighter and the soup of the udon is addicting. Waiting for the food doesn't take too long.
7/9/2017,20170709,4,4.29,"Amazing udon. Get the miso carbonara if you don't like uni! It is just as buttery and delicious. They have tempura chicken which is kind of funny, but different! Tastes good for $1.50 a piece. The fried chicken comes with Japanese mayo for dipping, yum! I have yet to try their regular hot and cold udon dishes. Knocking one star because the wait is ridiculous. Expect a 1-2 hour wait in the evenings. If you come on a weekday around 2, the wait could be shorter. Once you sit down, you are intimately next to other guests which can be quite uncomfortable."
7/9/2017,20170709,5,4.29,This is the best place for udon in LA. They make all their noodles at the restaurant. I have tried 5 or 6 udons and was blown away by their uni udon. Even their side dishes were all high quality and taste. Highly recommended. This time I tried the beef. The noodles have the perfect texture and taste
7/10/2017,20170710,5,4.29,"Great hipster place with wonderful homemade noodles and great Euro-fusion sauces. I had the carbonara (yummy) and my wife, the clams. I only wish they had my fave traditional udon, Nabuyaki. But the food was delicious."
7/10/2017,20170710,4,4.29,"As soon as I heard handmade udon, I had to check this place out! And was I satisfied? The uni udon and cheese gratin udon were so delicious. Both are pretty heavy so I don't suggest ordering both. The cold udon with soft boiled egg is really good as well. You know that an udon is good when a plain cold udon tastes good! The rice bowls are good too, it complements the simple udons (regular hot udon or the cold udon). This place gets packed so either be prepared to wait or going at an odd time. I choose to go at 5:00 PM during the weekday to beat the dinner rush and the wait time is shortened by a lot. There are a lot of parking structures in the area. I always walk around Japanese town after dinner to digest and then grab dessert in the area."

7/11/2017,20170711,5,4.29,"Approaching this restaurant, there is a massive crowd circling the entrance. The wait is around an hour. We walked around little Tokyo to kill time, but came back after half an hour. Good thing we did, because our name was called early! She told me there is usually minimum 1 hr wait usually, but I guess this time we got lucky.Food here? Absolutely delicious. Friend and I tried the uni udon and the tomato seafood udon and were blown away. Though it looks like alot and its very rich, it was actually a pretty perfectly sized portion. I am an absolute sucker for noodles and I loved how you could also watch how the noodles are cut and made. Inside its cute, cozy, but also trendy. The noodles which thick and juicy and the sauce was super rich and tasty. I don't think I could have too much of this at once because it is so rich, but it was well sized.Definitely would come back if I was in the area.

7/12/2017,20170712,3,4.29,"Really high quality fresh udon, grab a seat by the bar if you would like to watch them cut the noodles by hand. My fiancé truly loves the Sea Urchin Uni Cream Udon. I find the flavors to be very heavy and obviously creamy but he a cult following of others absolutely love it. I personally love their Pork Rice Bowl, super flavorful albeit smaller portion since I believe it is supposed to be an add on dish or a side. Do avoid their fried chicken, overly oily and fatty, served with mayo and curry powder. Not the best kara-age by any means. Always typically a wait here, do your best to arrive early. Hard to tell if the crowd is waiting for Monzo or for the next door Daikokuya. Regardless, no rsvps here only your typical name on a clipboard situation."
7/12/2017,20170712,5,4.29,"This place has plenty of non-traditional udon choices. I'll just highlight the miso carbonara udon in my review. It's broth less and comes with creamy sauce and bacon that makes for a very rich and flavorful bowl. The udon are long and thick and have a perfect consistency when bitten through. Whenever I come to Monzo, I have to fight a huge urge to get this and have any of their other equally awesome dishes. This place tends to have quite a wait for good reason."
7/12/2017,20170712,5,4.29,"Amazing place for udon! Great experience being ae to watch the chefs make the homemade udon through the window. Came on a Tuesday night around 8:30pm and there was about a 20 min wait, but it was well worth it!"

7/13/2017,20170713,3,4.29,"I love their udon and the variety of options in the menu, but I don't think that it balances out the amount of waiting and the price. I do like coming here whenever I have an udon craving - usually it always satisfies my need for something super savory & soup-y, or creamy and hearty. I also like the portions! I highly recommend trying one of their specialty dishes if you are a fan of udon already and it's your first time. Their noodle quality is excellent and you can watch them make it, too. I like the uni cream udon, but just warning you that it's pretty heavy/rich and you might need to sip on a soda while you eat it...LOL. My favorite is the mentai squid butter udon. It's very savory, and the broth is delicious. I also like that it doesn't have too much of a fishy flavor. My friends frequently order the miso carbonara udon as well. There is no parking lot, so it is up to you to find street parking or find a lot and pay. Service was good as well, and the interior feels cozy but not squished. It's right across the street from the plaza so I always like walking around to the shops after eating or grabbing dessert nearby. Overall it's definitely a place to try if you haven't yet. However, it's not my go-to udon only because it's just a tad bit expensive and the wait is way too long to eat whenever I want to. I mean, it's good and I don't mind waiting for really good food, but I ain't waiting 2 hours for just udon."

The soup was really creamy. The noodles were CHEWY. like CHEWY. And it bounced back with every bite. That's how fresh it was. What does sea urchin taste like you may ask. The texture is sort of like wet briny creamy with no particularly strong flavor except for salty. Ikura is like popping boba except it's salty instead of sweet.

My wife had one of their mixed seafood Udon specialty dishes that was fantastic. We arrived at 6:00pm on a Wednesday night and had a short wait. But I noticed a small line forming outside after we were seated. But the line moved fast as the service is fast and it's not the type of place for a 3 course dinner. Parking is a problem, but we did find metered street parking a few blocks away on Central Ave."

7/15/2017,20170715,3,4.29,"Their taste is medicore.. watching staffs making their handmade noodle seems entertaining from outside though. Its not bad. Its not easy to find street parking as anyone been to Little tokyo would know, paid parking is available on the other side of the street.There's always some wating right in the meal hours. Casual place to meet up with friends."
7/16/2017,20170716,4,4.29,"Ran into a lucky leprechaun that granted us only a 15 minute wait here. Gotta admit, it was a late lunch at 2pm on a summer Saturday.. but still. Parking tip: park at the little tokyo plaza across the street. Buy some pastries and get your parking validated. Would you rather spend $7 on parking? Or $7 on free parking AND additional food? Not a tough decision here, folks.Alright here's the breakdown +1 star for the handmade noodles and live show at the bar+1 star for having uni udon in general +1 star for the uni udon's delicious broth +1 star for being unique and not-another-ramen-shop+0 star for having a weak fan blowing at your sweaty customers who willingly chose to eat hot soup on a hot day. Like who does that? ;)+0 star for meh seafood tomato udon. Just get the uni udon like everyone else says. This is one of those times to be a follower, not a leader. Now, carry on."
7/16/2017,20170716,4,4.29,"Compared to its neighbor, Daikokuya, the wait isn't nearly as long and the interior is much nicer. The wait time varies; solo diners are usually seated within 5 minutes but everyone else may wait up to an hour especially during peak hours. The udon is some of the best I've had, and I highly recommend their ""Miso Carbonara Udon"". Warning though: they don't allow outside drinks; I brought in a boba milk tea once and they took it away, returning it only after I was done with the meal. That was a little annoying."
7/16/2017,20170716,4,4.29,"I have never been a huge udon fan but this place has changed my mind. The squid butter udon and the uni udon are both amaze, albeit super rich and coma inducing. I love the squid texture contrast to the noodles. I wish I could say I've tried other things but maybe next time.The only problem with this place is the insane wait. Both times I was here, I waited for more than an hour. The restaurant is small and so when they tell you it's an hour, it's not going to be 45 min, it'll definitely be an hour. Luckily the neighborhood offers lots of cute shops to meander in and out of while you wait."
7/16/2017,20170716,4,4.29,Sea Urchin Udon is the best. To me it tasted like a Japanese version of Fettuccine Alfredo with Sea Urchin. Watching staffs making fresh Udon was entertaining. The only thing I wish they improve is the temperature inside the restaurant. It was really hot and humid. Clearly the AC needed maintenance or it was turned off.
7/16/2017,20170716,3,4.29,"Can only base this reveiw on the signature uni udon, which was small in portion size and a bit overpriced IMO. The uni is crumbled into small fragments so you don't get that nice cool texture that cold uncooked uni provides. Would've probably preferred that over an uni infused cream, which was a bit overly rich, but I guess I should've known that prior to ordering. That said, the udon is of great quality and it's kinda cool watching the udon master rolling up and cutting the noodles right before your eyes. Expect a long wait however."
7/17/2017,20170717,5,4.29,"Great udon- lines are long so if you dont like to wait in this heat, try to get there a little before their opening hour. Note that they dont let you sit until everyone in your group is present. Parking- forget the street parking hassel and use the aiso parking garage which is in 2min walk distance. If not, Staples parking allows one hour free parking with purhase."
7/20/2017,20170720,4,4.29,"Not sure why my first experience here was so off, but this time, I can safely say that I am a fan of Marugame Monzo. I managed to get in right before closing time and I was surprised at how full the restaurant still was. For starters, I got the Agedashi Eggplant. This dish stood out to me since I am used to seeing this dish presented with tofu. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! The eggplant was nicely grilled and had a wonderful flavor to it that went well once dipped into the sauce. I also liked the generous heap of daikon on the side. I also got the Mushroom Salad (the portion was larger than I expected). The mushrooms were cooked nicely and had lots of flavor to them even when eaten by themselves. I liked how the tomato provided a fresh flavor to the dish overall. Finally, for my main meal I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. I loved the texture that the fish eggs added to the dish. The sauce was also rich and packed with flavor.I would highly recommend ordering the Squid Butter Udon and Agedashi Eggplant if you happen to stop by here. I hope I get another opportunity to come again in the future!"
7/21/2017,20170721,5,4.29,"Got lucky and came right before opening and got a table without a line. Food was amazing, noodles are handmade in front of you! We tried carbonara, was so yummy. Definitely want to go back to try over dishes. We also got tempura, it looked awesome but didn't have much taste, lots of onion."
7/21/2017,20170721,3,4.29,"We had the uni pasta and seafood tomato cream pasta. We didn't find neither of them stand out. Kinjiro uni risotto was off the chart compare to this. Maybe it came from higher expectation. The seafood tomato cream was on par, good but not great. Their tempura were great, calamari was so so, a little over breaded. Overall, it was a decent experience, but would not wait in line for it."
7/23/2017,20170723,5,4.29,"Oh. My. God. So good!We went here on a Saturday morning, arriving 30 minutes after opening and there was already a group of people waiting outside. We waited about 30-35 minutes in the hot sun to be seated. TOTALLY WORTH IT!This place makes their own udon noodles which you can watch being made in the kitchen from your seat thanks to the giant window. I highly suggest taking advantage of the lunch special and add the rice bowl for $3-4. The Kaikage/tempura bowl was the most epic with a tower of tempura on top of rice. The fatty tuna bowl was probably my favorite, that tuna was so fresh and smooth...melt in your mouth good. (My mouth legit just watered remembering it.). I ordered the spicy ground pork bowl and it delivered, spicy but well balanced with the white rice. Udon and broth. The broth is so simple but jam packed with flavor and the bits of tempura are such a nice touch adding texture and flavor. The udon were perfectly cooked and the best udon I've ever had, honestly. I ordered the sea urchin udon in creamy sauce. It tasted like Italian/Japanese fusion the sauce was so creamy and so good. Others at my table ordered the chicken tempura udon, shrimp tempura udon, and beef udon. The three latter came in the simple broth. Service was good and fast. The restaurant is small but seemingly always full. Oh, not usually something I mention, but the bathroom: SO CLEAN! (A real plus)Make this your next stop in Little Tokyo! You won't regret it!!"

7/25/2017,20170725,5,4.29,"Oh my goodness, this place is so good! I was craving udon and my friend remembered eating here and really liking it so we decided to have dinner here on a Sunday afternoon. The wait list was pretty long but they were quick to go through it and get people seated. I would have liked to order the Curry udon, but I don't eat pork and they couldn't substitute it for beef. Disappointing!! But I had the Beef Udon and OH MY. It was a bowl of perfectly flavored goodness. The salt level of the broth was right on and the beef was so tender. I will definitely be back!"
7/25/2017,20170725,2,4.28,"The udon was very fresh, but the sea urchin and mentai squid butter sauces were a bit heavy and bland. Disappointing as these were signature dishes and came recommended by the staff."
7/25/2017,20170725,4,4.28,"If you have the patience and time to wait, it's worth it. Delicious food, friendly staff and pleasant customer service."
7/27/2017,20170727,4,4.28,"For udon lovers... this is PERFECTION in a bowl!!Food (4 stars): The noodles were amazing!! You can see the guy making it in front of you so you know for sure it's fresh haha! I tried the Mentai Squid Butter udon and OMGGG it was life changing! From the first bite and up until the last drop of the soup was perfect. It came with a few pieces of Squid, nothing too crazy about it. When you reach the end of the soup though... you will notice a bunch of smelt eggs on the very bottom OMG Amy favvvvv! Perfect way to end my meal. I'm a huge fan of udon so this place was literally heaven for me! Cons: The only reason this place doesn't get a 5 star is because their quantity is small. It did not fill me up and that really disappointed me. Next time I would pay a little more for their extra noodles!Service (4 stars): On a busy Saturday, we waited about 45 mins for the lunch rush (luckily there's a plaza to walk around to kill time). The restaurant is small so that's why it takes a while to get a table. Luckily the food doesn't arrive too long after you order! Foods I tried:- Mentai Squid Butter Udon (5 stars)- Curry Udon (4 stars)- Shrimp Tempura (2 stars)"
7/27/2017,20170727,4,4.28,"I got the chicken tempura Udon, with an extra side of chicken tempura because I love protein. It was pretty tasty, I added some spice to it.Overall the noodles were very fresh, I literally saw them make the noodles right in front of me. And it is for that reason why I am giving them four stars rather than 3. Also had the pork belly rice bowl, which was actually amazing! I'd highly recommend getting that for sure! I'm more of a ramen guy, but if you like udon, this is the place to go! I find the menu rather intimidating, plus there's no cell phone service or wifi available in there! So I had to order without being able to review photos from restaurant on yelp! It was chaos! LolBtw if you go during the summer like I did, be prepared to sweat while you're there! Dress light, cause you'll sweat through it all!"
7/27/2017,20170727,4,4.28,The udon was amazing here and it was bursting with flavor. However the portions where a little small for my liking. My family didn't really feel full after the meal which was sad because we spent about $96 on our meal. I'm not from LA so to me $12-13 for a bowl of noodles was pretty pricey. And waiting for a table was difficult too because we didn't know every member of the table had to be present in order to be seated.
7/27/2017,20170727,5,4.28,This is great food with awesome service!!! My girls wanted sushi and we are staying at a nearby hotel. We ordered the food delivered so this was the perfect end to a family day!
7/29/2017,20170729,5,4.28,"I seriously contemplated licking the bowl but didn't want to embarrass my sister. I did, however, keep scraping up the sauce with my super cute spoon until I could scrape no more. So what deserved an ALMOST unadulterated consumption of every ounce of sauce? Uni udon.My sister had been wanting to try this place and since we happened to be downtown, we gave it a go. The wait wasn't too long and we were so thankful for the canopy to provide shade from the brutal sun.The menu was interesting in the range of udon available. I almost ordered one of the cold udon dishes to try the dipping sauces. I also almost ordered tempura...another time. So I settled on the uni udon with a side mini bowl of negitoro on rice. I was a little skeptical of the sweet soy sauce and mayo served with the negitoro but it actually was a great combo. The negitoro came out first and was so fresh. Loved the flavors of the sauces with the negitoro.When the uni udon came out, I was a little concerned by the size of the bowl. The bowl itself was rather large and I wasn't sure I could actually finish the noodles. I was also pleasantly surprised by the pieces of udon in the dish. I naturally ate a piece of the uni first and was disappointed by the lack of flavor. It was really just there for the texture. When I tried the udon with the sauce, I realized that all the uni flavor was deliciously covering my noodles through the sauce. I love uni and the creamy flavor that reminds me of the sea. The udon noodles were just the right consistency for me - not too firm or too soft. The noodles were also not dense, which I was concerned about. But the highlight for me was definitely the sauce. I even threw my rice into the bowl to sop up the sauce when I ran out of noodles.Needless to say I was incredibly impressed by this place. I hear it's about to open up on the Westside, which is way closer to me. I can't wait to try it out!"
7/29/2017,20170729,5,4.29,This place is by far the best Udon I have ever had. There was a bit of a wait (we waited about an hour) but the wait is far worth it and the portions are filling. I definitely recommend the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon.
7/30/2017,20170730,5,4.29,"Marugame Monzo has the BEST udon in Los Angeles! Nothing beats their freshly made udon :) If you are ever in Little Tokyo area and do not mind waiting, definitely check this place out!We came here around 7pm on a Thursday evening and waited about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad! I guess I was one of the lucky ones that day!Every time my boyfriend and I come here, we order one hot udon and one cold. The dinner menu is a little different than their lunch menu. For dinner, they have the seafood mentai udon! This is our FAVORITE! The creamy sauce and seafood..mixed with the fresh udon, is absolute heaven! **they only have the seafood mentai during dinner** :) we also ordered a cold udon. For the cold, we got the Ikura udon! It is soooo refreshing and not as heavy as the seafood udon. I love the amount of daikon radish in the cold noodle!"
7/30/2017,20170730,5,4.29,"The udon was excellent, we arrived very early so we didn't have a wait. We had the uni udon and the kakuni udon; both were excellent. The uni was very heavy, while the kakuni was light. The large pork belly chunks were unexpected; I have become used to seeing pork belly slices. However, the food was still spectacular and the handmade noodles make all the difference. I'm not actually a fan of regular store-bought udon; the handmade udon noodles were not overly chewy and had a fantastic mouthfeel."
7/30/2017,20170730,3,4.29,"Was second in line yesterday by showing up 45 minutes before opening. To us, it is just not worth the wait and all the hype. Mentai Squid Butter Udon 5/5, Champon Udon 3/5, Negitoro Rice Bowl 5/5, Takoyaki 3/5. You can definitely taste the freshness of the noodles and they have some interesting flavors. They lose two points because they are to cheap to fix the A/C or run it, there is little organization (more chaos) when taking the orders as to who was seated and ready first and one of the servers (not ours, she was good) who gave us water couldn't even bother to acknowledge the thank you. He just kept chewing his gum and staring off into the distance which gives me the impression that some of the employees act like you are being done a favor by being able to eat there."
8/1/2017,20170801,2,4.28,"I had bookmarked this place because I wanted to try it for the first time . Recap of last night: We came to celebrate one of my closest friend's birthday here and had a party of 11. Parking is pricey as always in Little Tokyo with flat rates ranging from $8-12. The restaurant took too long to accommodate our party as they wanted to seat all the parties of 2-3 people first even though our party had arrived first. While we were glad to finally be seated, our server ruined our experience with his poor attitude. We asked him if it was possible to split checks between the two parties so it would be easier and he said no which was sort of understandable.Then another person asked if we could order as two separate tables the server said yes, but still put all our orders under one table. So I don't know why they are so lazy to even split our table's order or split the checks since most places order using tablets or the pos system should make it simple enough.Not only were the male servers already rude, but still managed to horse play, fool around, and laughing at each other while literally serving our party's food. First of all, it was really immature and not professional. Second, they did not come around to fill the empty water glasses for our table throughout the entire meal, yet somehow the girl servers always had pitchers in their hands and refilled other tables empty water glass. I only gave two stars because the food was whatever... $16-$17 for uni udon was a joke because there was only like 3-4 pieces of uni and the bowl was bigger than portion served inside. Overall the taste of it was mediocre because it just looked like the Japanese version of chicken alfredo. Also, I tried both of the onigiri plum and pork flavored. The plum tasted pretty gross and the pork was just overly sweet . Did not pair well with the udon at all. Don't even get me started when the bill came to the table, the servers had the NERVE to highlight and put a stars around the suggested gratuity right after the poor service we had received. Luckily for them we still at least tipped 15-20% instead of 5% which they should of received. And to top it all off they still could not give a proper end of the meal greeting. Overall, I wish the restaurant hired more professional staff and trained servers. Honestly, your time and money is better spent on any other udon shops in the same block and hopefully the service is better too..."
8/2/2017,20170802,5,4.28,"I've eaten here several times now and while it is one of the udon places that do not need another endorsement - I must say it is excellent and worth the price and wait.While not expensive, it is on the pricier side of nooodles in the area. An order of zaru soba (only cold noodles and sauce) and a side of tempura will set you back $16.00. I come here for the noodles and tempura and they are both above average. If you can appreciate a good noodle, you won't be diassapointed - just be warned it can get crowded and there is no a/c."
8/3/2017,20170803,4,4.28,"The udon was very good! I got the Kakuni udon and although I was a bit disappointed they didn't have any vegetables in it, I am glad I got the vegetable tempura on the side. I didn't have to wait a ridiculous amount of time for it (unlike Daikokuya nxt door) and I thought the freshness of the udon was refreshing. I would definitely come back to try their uni or mentai udon when I get a chance."
8/4/2017,20170804,4,4.28,"Parking here is a real pain in the ass & almost left because we couldn't find any open spots. Came around 2pm and it was still crowded. There were about 8 people in front of us on the waiting list & they told us it would be about 30-40 more minutes, so we left the restaurant to roam around the area. When we came back, they had crossed our names off the list, but were very accommodating when we notified them that we were still here.Got the LUNCH SPECIAL (order any udon on the list & get a rice bowl for $4). Got the MENTAI SQUID BUTTER UDON $12.95: small portions. Broth was buttery & delicious. A food party in my mouth. Udon is freshly made by hand (open viewing kitchen where you can see the chefs roll the noodles), squid is tender and fresh. NEGITORO RICE BOWL: really really small dish (won't fill you up at all), but the fatty tuna and mayo drizzle is so good. You have to try this one.BUKKAKE UDON ~$7 (cold): the cold broth came on the side & had a pleasant sweetness. All in all, experience here was nice. Waiters are friendly & food came out fast. Just a bit pricey for its measly portion. Big bowls deceive."
8/5/2017,20170805,3,4.28,"I don't really understand what the hype is about this place. There were tons of people waiting in line and many good yelp reviews but I was pretty disappointed. I got the specialty carbonara udon and it wasn't what I was expecting. It tasted like fettuccini Alfredo from an Italian restaurant and I didn't really see where the udon part came in. The udon that I've had is in soup and there was like no soup? I may have just not understood the concept of the dish. For $13, the portion was pretty small. I will say that the noodles are good and the sauce is rich and creamy. It comes with a few pieces of bacon and that's it, which all in all didn't seem like a lot of food. it just wasn't a groundbreaking meal for me and I was literally hungry again an hour later. Considering the original hour that we had to wait to be seated, this whole meal just wasn't worth it for me. If I ever do come here again, I think I would try something else if I didn't have to wait."
8/5/2017,20170805,5,4.28,"Strictly speaking this is a really good place to eat at. The waiters were really cool and I'm pretty sure all of them liked the crocodile game I brought--it started a good conversation with all of the waiters and they were pretty smiley most likely nostalgic after. Sea Urchin Udon, Curry Udon, and Beef Udon is really good here. If I lived in LA I would def be here all the time! It was a good experience to come and check out the place though, I bought a $3 soft serve in cool packaging from the little convenience store while waiting. On a side note, the weather was nice and he was constantly calling out names so it didn't feel like the line wasn't moving, so that was nice. The food came out really fast too. And I'm regretting eating all the good food here because the udon place at mitsuwa will never match up.Now not strictly speaking I didn't eat all day and parking was a pain in the...but whatever we paid $10 for the mall structure and just walked across the street and my hangry fury was put to rest when I got that icecream to buffer the hunger lol. Don't get disheartened by the wait and the parking, my suggestion is only go with a friend or if your a solo kinda person go alone so the wait isn't ungodly long."
8/5/2017,20170805,5,4.28,I swear their uni udon is so good!! Worth the line. Even though it's a lil bit pricy.
8/6/2017,20170806,5,4.28,"Trying everything on the menu one as a time.So far Mentai cream udon, miso carbonara udon and beef taktaki, have very rich favor ( very tasty ). The next menu will be seafood with tomato cream. I'm going to get fat.."
8/7/2017,20170807,5,4.28,"When we arrive we had to wait in line, but the wait is totally worth it! The udon is great! Also, it's good to see handmade noodle live. In addition, the customer service is incredibly good! Definitely recommend this place!"
8/8/2017,20170808,5,4.29,Hands down the best udon I've ever had!!! My bf and I ordered the mentai squid butter udon (12.95) and sea urchin cream udon (16.95) and we were basically fighting over the latter. I was really skeptical coming in to the restaurant because I was reading mixed reviews but let me just tell you--this is an experience you don't want to miss! The noodles are cooked to perfection and the uni udon broth is so creamy and filling. The squid udon was also really good but my advice is: spend the extra $4 and go for the uni udon!! You won't regret it.We came 15 minutes before the place opened on a Sunday and the line was already pretty long...so come early!! Parking is abundant in the lots across the street but be prepared to pay $6-10. You might as well make the most of it and shop around lil Tokyo or grab a matcha green tea ice cream in the area!!
8/10/2017,20170810,4,4.29,"There is always a line out the door when I pass by but when I came here on a Friday night around 7 with a party of four and we only waited around 25 min. I ordered the uni udon and it was delicious. It was very creamy and the amount of uni they put in isn't a generous amount but it is enough for you to be satisfied. I would recommend getting extra noodles if you're really hungry because by the time I was done, I could definitely eat more. My friends ordered the beef soup udon (?) and I thought it was delicious too."
8/11/2017,20170811,4,4.28,"If you're coming here for lunch, better be the first batch or don't come at all. We missed the first wave and waited about 45min for lunch, which would never fly with our boss but TGIF!The udon is definitely fresh. I made the mistake of ordering a kitsune udon (bean curd), but I can see the hype with the other menu options. Always get a tempura fried egg on the side. Trust me (and everyone with any love for food). I'm dubious if I'd ever come back with such a long wait time, but definitely not a bad place for an udon fix if you've got the time to spare or enjoy playing games in long lines."
8/12/2017,20170812,5,4.29,"Hands down the best udon in LA. Glad their Sawtelle location is opening soon, maybe already opened? Their Uni udon is my favorite. It's expensive for a bowl of udon but hey it's Uni. Noodles are cooked to perfection and the broth is rich n creamy. You must try at least once if you haven't. Service is friendly. This place is always packed though."
8/12/2017,20170812,4,4.29,I've been here two times and I got the uni udon both times. I love it! It's very creamy and the eggs burst in the mouth. It feels a little heavy but soo good. I also recommend getting the tempura egg.
8/13/2017,20170813,5,4.29,"Marugame is an udon game changer! The varieties of udon is insane. They also have a giant window where you can watch the chefs hand make and hand cut the udon noodles. It gets pretty packed so come early and MAKE SURE YOUR ENTIRE PARTY IS THERE! (Or they won't sit you) Make sure you get the fried chicken and add an egg to your udon. Trust me you don't regret it.Love,Paul"
8/13/2017,20170813,3,4.28,"Really the food was good-- wife and I ordered. Brought out my food and not hers. They stated they ran out of noodles. For 5pm on a Sunday, when they aren't even at their busiest, I don't see how a chef doesn't begin to prep noodles when he sees they are running low. Canceled her order when I was done with mine. Luckily it was enough to share and sort of curb our hunger."
8/13/2017,20170813,3,4.28,The waiter recommended me to try the udon w white sauce and I was underwhelmed by it. It was only okay. The udon itself was good but I wouldn't come back for udon with alfredo sauce. Meh!
8/14/2017,20170814,5,4.28,"Uni Udon - what else is there to say? (Jk, I actually liked this the least out of the 4 dishes that we ordered)Marugame Monzo is currently one of the hyped up restaurants in Little Tokyo and are known for their HQ udon dishes of all types. As a huge fan of udon, I can say that the consistency and texture of their udon is by far the best I've had (I haven't been to Japan yet...). If you plan on eating here, I suggest putting your name down and then walk across the street to hang out in the main plaza of Little Tokyo until it's your turn (be prepared to wait at least an hour during peak meal times)Eventually we were seated and we pretty much decided to share everything. The two notable dishes were definitely the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and Vongole Udon (clams). My personal favorite is hands down the Squid one (i'm not even a fan of squid) - everything about it was perfect!! Of course I have to mention the uni udon. I'm a huge fan of uni and I do what I can to try it whenever I can, but it quite a let down when I took my first bite and realized that the uni taste didn't carry onto the udon... The dish pretty much incorporates the creamy texture from the uni over their delicious udon. Oh well, at least I can say I tried it."
8/15/2017,20170815,5,4.29,"The moment I landed in LA, I had to go visit this spot. I heard all about their uni udon and had to try it for myself. It tastes exactly how it looks - creamy - but delicious. I shared a bowl with my friend but seriously thought about it my whole trip. Even their rice plates were amazing (although much smaller than we would have thought). They also serve really authentic takoyaki balls that had a unique flavor of dough. Can't wait to go back to taste this again!"
8/15/2017,20170815,5,4.29,"Another place with long long lines all the time. Why? Because they serve some really deliciously uni udon, cooked in some super heavy cream based broth. Generous amount of uni for price of the noodle which was less than 20 dollars! Yeah probably because of the cream, the udon was very filling but it was so deliciously, I couldn't stop eating even after I got full.One of my favorite restaurants in Little Tokyo!"
8/15/2017,20170815,2,4.28,"From an overall experience, 2 stars. Udon is alright...just... alright. I believe it is way too overhyped. Not worth waiting more than 15 minutes to eat at this place. Second, the place is really small so I dont recommend coming here with a group larger than 4. Lastly, keep your ears open while waiting for your name to be called. I understand that this is a Japanese restaurant but at least use a hostess that can speak/understand English well."
8/16/2017,20170816,3,4.28,"Let me put it out there, I understand the hype of this udon restaurant. They have many unique and interesting broths. I like that. However, the noodles were not amazing?? I'm hoping I just got a bad batch of mushy, overcooked noodles.Mentai Squid Butter Udon : 5/5Broth was very rich and flavorful. Squid was cooked perfectly, not chewy at all.Calamari : 3/5Texture was perfect. Not bready. Perfectly crunchy. Calamari was cooked just right. However, batter was not salted. The flavor was underwhelming. I would come back to try the other items on the menu.The only BAD experience was I was almost kicked out of the restaurant because my whole party wasn't there. They simply forgot something at the car and went to retrieve it. There were 4 of us in total, so 2 of us were sat down. When we were about to order, 1 waitress said we couldn't order for them, and the whole party was supposed to be sitting down. I wasn't sure how far away my 2 other friends were from Monzo, so I said to give them 2 min. The waitress told us we had to leave if they didn't show up in 2 min. They showed up within 1 min and we ordered. The waitress that threatened us wasn't even around to check nack with my table. My suggestion for Monzo is to have BIG sign that says all of the party must be present. No one reads tiny signs if it's out of the way."
8/16/2017,20170816,5,4.28,"Hands down THE BEST udon I have ever had. Mentai Squid Butter Udon was really really good. Great flavor, creamy, big chunks of squid with the right consistency. Noodles were the perfect consistency. Pork Belly rice bowl was also very very good. Perfect flavor and not overly seasoned. Definitely on my list of places to return to. I prefer it more than Daikokuya and I normally am a ramen noodle person...... but not anymore."
8/17/2017,20170817,5,4.28,"Came all the way from the Bay Area and made a trip out here and I do not regret it one bit. I wish Marugame Monzo would open a location in the bay!!!! PLEASEEEEEE. The only udon I've ever tried was probably the basic clear udon at your local Japanese restaurant that doesn't specialize in the udon. Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but this type of udon is on a whole other level!!! Came with a group of 5 at 4:45 PM before it opened (5:00PM) on a Friday and there was already a lot people outside waiting. I got to try 4 different types of udon dishes with my group and ranking them in order the Mentai Squid Butter Udon would be at the top of my list, following the Hot Dragon Udon, Sea Urchin Udon, and last but not least the Udon Gratin. These are all ranked by flavor and words cannot explain the explosive amount flavor that came from the first bite of Mentai Squid Butter Udon. Maybe I was really hungry before I came, but it was sooooo good. So unique, unlike anything I've tried before. Creamy and filled with fish eggs.The Udon Gratin was very interesting. Udon with cheese, alrighty then. It was good but not the best, only because it just tasted Alfredo/pasta sauce with Udon. Service was impeccable. Our waitress was very accommodating and informative on the various dishes they offered. If I'm ever in the area, I will stop by."
8/18/2017,20170818,5,4.28,The best damm noodles in so cal period!!! I hate uni but love the uni pasta here! The pork belly bowl is crack. It's a small place but you can see them making the noddles real time so it's a plus. Parking is a pain to find but trust me it's worth it. If your going to go daik next door don't make the mistake of going because if you do you will miss out on the most delicious and nom nom nom noddles here. One of the best places to eat in LA no questions asked!
8/18/2017,20170818,4,4.28,"Waited for about an hour on a Thursday night for 2. I tried the mentai squid butter and sea urchin udon based on their popularity here. Large portions of squid meat and uni come with the dishes, which is a plus. Since the udon is handmade, the texture of the noodles were great as well. The uni udon was awesome and not too heavy/creamy. The fried eggplant appetizer was great as well! I will be back to try the other many choices for udon."
8/18/2017,20170818,4,4.28,"Absolutely delicious udon. Wait times are quite long with limited shade, but they do offer iced water to drink while you wait. I ordered the curry udon with eggplant tempura - while the curry udon was a bit salty, the udon itself was delicious and the eggplant was full of flavor. Will definitely come back and possibly try the plainer kake udon or one of the creamy broths which might make my review a 5*!"
8/19/2017,20170819,4,4.28,"Food: Best udon ever. Second time here. Just as good as the first. Tried udon with uni, udon with curry, cold udon with bonito flakes. All good.Service: fast and good.Atmosphere: loud and casual."
8/19/2017,20170819,5,4.28,Great udon place in town! I recommend the pork belly rice and the tororo cold udon on the summer special menu. They are both delicious and perfect for season :)
8/21/2017,20170821,1,4.28,"SUCKS service!!! Never come here again!!!If I could give zero star or negative stars, I could definitely do that!!!After we sit, another party came in and sit next to us. They gave them menu but not us for long time until we asked for! When we ordered, my friend spoke Japanese to one of the waiter, he pretended not to understand! But he spoke Japanese to another waiter! Also he admit that he could understand Japanese in the end! After we complaint about the service to another waiter, we heard that they discussed us using Japanese and said we are Chinese!!! We strongly feel DISCRIMINATION!!! which I never felt it in any other stores or restaurants in LA. After we heard their talking, we asked them what's the matter with Chinese. The guy who pretended not to understand Japanese came to our table and argued with us! No apology at all!!! Even, he told us to GET OUT!!! the restaurants and threatened to call the police!!! My friend always say that service in Japan is amazing. But this restaurant's service brings shame on it! AVOID this restaurant!!!"
8/21/2017,20170821,4,4.28,"Delicious vegetarian udon!! A bit salty but the sautéed veggies were so flavorful and cooked just right. The udon were freshly made in house a bit softer than I like but so good. I added seaweed topping to mine. The udon were a bit on the expensive side.Btw, they do not do take-out since the quality would not be as good as when eaten fresh."
8/21/2017,20170821,5,4.28,"One of the best udon in town. You won't be disappointed. The broth is the perfect creaminess, the udon is just the right texture."
8/22/2017,20170822,5,4.28,"Best udon place EVER. The udon is made in-house, and you can watch them in action if you are seated around the kitchen. The udon is perfectly chewy.Space is small, so there's usually a long wait. Parking is metered or there are structures around the area. Metered parking ends at 8 pm. Aiso parking structure is $2.*Mentai squid butter udon - One of my favorites. The flavor is difficult to describe, but trust that it's delicious. The squid pieces in the udon are large and extremely tender. Yum!*Uni udon - Another popular favorite. This udon has more of a pasta feel because it has a cream base. I would say the uni udon isn't very consistent. Sometimes there's a fairly strong ocean flavor, but not all the time. It's definitely worth a try. *Dragon udon - There's a spicy kick. It kind of reminds me of Chinese cuisine. *Champon udon - There's a strong sesame seed oil flavor. If you like sesame seed oil, this one is for you. *Gratin udon - This is a cream and cheese based baked udon. It's definitely not your traditional udon. If you like heavy high cholesterol food, this one is for you. *Kakuni udon - The broth is great, and the pork pieces are HUGE and delicious! Keeping in mind that the pork is cut from one of the fattiest part of the pig, sometimes it seems to taste excessively fatty. *Curry udon - If you like Japanese curry, this one is for you.*Miso carbonara udon - Another cream based udon with bacon pieces. Not one of their best.*Cold dipping udons - You may want to ask the waiter how to portion the dipping sauce. We didn't know what we were doing, so we did not enjoy this dish. *Pork belly rice bowl - Salty and delicious. The pork pieces are sliced thin - similar to brisket.*Tempura boiled egg topping - Always cooked perfectly with runny yolk goodness."
8/22/2017,20170822,5,4.28,"Sea Urchin. If it is your first time, that is what you NEED to order. I think this dish is the best representation of the restaurant. That is all you need to know. Besides that, enjoy the wait. It moves fairly quickly."
8/23/2017,20170823,4,4.28,Tried this place on the fly since we were nearby. We came 15 minutes before they opened and one group was in front of us on a Wednesday for lunch. The line quickly got long after that. Food: I got the beef udon. Broth was clean and good. The noodles are freshly made there but I wasn't impress with it. By husband liked it more than other places. He ordered the sea urchin udon and was not impressed. He said it tasted like alfredo sauce with a hint of uni. Service: Our food came out quickly. They refilled out water without us asking.
8/23/2017,20170823,5,4.28,Bomb udon on the low! Their prices are very reasonable and their portions are pretty filling! Udon is made freshly in front of you as well. The actual restaurant is a bit small and sometimes the wait gets a lil long but i think it's worth the wait
8/24/2017,20170824,5,4.28,"The hype is real!!! While I'm a huge sea urchin fan, I'm not too big on udon so I was hesitant to try this place. I'm sure glad I did. It is the best udon I've ever had. Udon is made fresh in front of your eyes! We arrived on a Monday afternoon and there was a wait already. Lucky for my boyfriend and I, there were 2 seats left at the counter so we were able to snatch it up and got to watch them in action making the fresh udon. Service was impeccable. Everyone was attentive and friendly.My boyfriend and I each got the sea urchin udon + rice bowl combo plus the takoyaki to share. I got the spicy beef bowl rice bowl and he got the negitoro rice bowl. While both rice bowls were good in their own way, I would have to say I favor the negitoro bowl a bit more. The sea urchin udon was so rich and creamy. I usually get sick of any rich and creamy broth but with this udon bowl, I never got sick of it. They don't skimp on the uni either. The udon had just the right amount of chewy texture to it. I'm drooling as I'm writing this review. Please go give this place a try!"
8/24/2017,20170824,2,4.28,"Very disappointed. Not sure if it was just the day that I went or if this spot is always like this, but my Udon was SO SO SALTY!!! I couldn't bear to finish it!!My friend and I put our name down at 8:40pm on a Wednesday evening. We were seated at around 9:15pm. This place is clearly POPPIN so I thought I would be getting some bomb Udon...I ordered the Hot Sansai Udon & my friend got the Mad Tiger Udon (cold). Our orders came out extremely quickly - props for the fast service & quick turnover rate! But then I had my first bite of my udon... wow so salty. My friend agreed that it was much, much saltier than the beef udon he had previously tried at this spot. I literally only picked out the noodles (which were also saltier than I would've liked) and left behind all of the soup and veggies. I also tried a bite of my friend's cold udon - it tasted like cold noodles covered in dried seaweed - nothing special I would pay $13 for. I don't recommend either dish.Overall, this spot is just not worth the struggle of parking and long wait. The food I ate was no better than instant udon out of a package. I am giving this place the benefit of the doubt that maybe the night I went was the exception. Maybe the chef just messed up that night? My friend still has high regards for the beef udon here so perhaps I will be back to try it."
8/24/2017,20170824,5,4.28,"If you are a fan of uni, then you must come here and try the uni udon. Even if you aren't a fan of uni, you really should give it a try. The udon is made fresh here and the broth is perfect! You can definitely taste the uni, but it's not overpowering. The wait here looks long, but honestly it moves pretty quickly. The service here is great as well. I will definitely be back for more uni udon and maybe will try the other udons :)"
8/24/2017,20170824,5,4.28,This udon shop is definitely the best that I have ever tried! They make udon fresh and cut on the spot behind a transparent counter. This is a must have for udon and noodle lovers!!We ordered the Sea urchin cream udon and the Hot dragon udon. We also added the Negitoro don.Sea urchin udon stole the show as it is rich and creamy with plenty of uni pieces to eat. Hot dragon udon was good but not nearly as good as sea urchin. Negitoro was good on its own as an appetizer being fatty tuna with lots of sauce for flavor.I will return again and try out the other udons!
8/25/2017,20170825,3,4.28,I was not as impressed as other reviewers. Service was sloppy. Food was lesser quality than anticipated.
8/26/2017,20170826,2,4.28,"I actually came to Monzo twice, once for Spring Break and another time recently with my friends on Monday, August 14th at around 5-6 PM for their dinner service.My first time at Monzo was really amazing in my opinion. At the recommendation of this restaurant by my best friend and the notion of ""freshly made udon noodles"", we went there for lunch at the first opportunity we could take. The wait time was about an hour to an hour and a half but when we got in, I ordered the Chicken Tempura Udon while my best friend ordered a Curry Udon. The appearance of the udon looked delicious and mouth-watering and it smelled soooo good. The taste did live up to the hype and I finished every last bit of it with a full tummy at the end.At the second visit to Monzo, I brought my best friend again and my boyfriend but this time for dinner. I mean the udon was really delicious before and I had to expose my boyfriend this bowl of goodness too like it was my mission!!! I ordered the same bowl again while my friend tried something new. We were seated really quickly, maybe about 10 minutes but we were not greeted by friendly waiters/waitresses/hosts/hostesses. I know that the atmosphere at that day and time was full of people who kept staring at us, including the staff. I felt judged; I felt like I came to a museum instead of an udon restaurant; it didn't helped that the table next to us had a man staring at me and my friends like he had nothing better to do and wanted to listen to our conversation. The place was pretty loud but I got some pretty bad attitudes from the waitresses and when I asked for an extra bowl to share with my boyfriend, it wasn't given to us until we had to ask again after we waited for a reasonable amount of time. It wasn't THAT busy but apparently they can dismiss us like we're nothing.Now for the main course-- the food. What. A. Disaster... there was a disgusting aftertaste in the Chicken Tempura and broth... the broth was bland (save for that aftertaste) and it was a real struggle to continue eating no matter how false of a smile I tried to put on my face to be polite. I know it's been a while but the quality of this one dish... HOW. HOW does quality DROP like a BOMB so fast?! The noodles didn't taste FRESH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! And that's the LEAST of that bowl's problem! You can't fool me-- that was a dish I fell in love with at first taste and you CANNOT serve me this questionable bowl of udon thay my best friend agreed tasted funny!!! Her udon bowl had this very sour taste to it, too! Smother all those problems with the staff of that day? Terrible. At the end of the day, none of us finished the bowls we bought. My friend took the leftover udon in both bowls in a carryout, saying she will go home and make it BETTER and I asked if she wanted my broth or chicken tempura which only had four bites on one piece and another piece untouched. Her reply, ""Nah, no thanks-- there's no saving that."" GEE MONZO-- When your MEAT and BROTH is UNSALVAGEABLE... SMH. When we got out of the restaurant, I started gagging because the aftertaste of my chicken tempura udon was still in my mouth. Thank you Monzo, for almost having me puke in Little Tokyo. I don't know what happened to the restaurant that we incurred terrible lack of exceptional, proper and professional service, the nasty food that did not have a ""fresh"" uniqueness to it like before, and the judgy atmosphere in 4 months, but Monzo, GET. A. GRIP. Maybe it was just bad this ONE time that I happened to bring someone else to try Monzo, but until we feel that it's back to the Monzo from 4 months ago, this review will stay this way and I encourage everyone reading this to bring yourself a red flag so you can literally wave down waiters/waitresses or else you'll be waiting for help to arrive for a while, busy or not. We do not appreciate the attitude and lack of service we got from Monzo's staff but please at least be on point with your ""fresh"" udon..."
8/26/2017,20170826,5,4.28,"The wait was VERY long, but the food was well worth the wait! The udon was excellent. My friend ordered the miso carbonara and I the beef bukkake udon. I couldn't taste the miso in the carbonara and it was a bit heavy for a summer day, but it was still good. I really enjoyed the cold beef udon - the beef was sweet and worked very well with the broth and noodles! Very happy with the food."
8/27/2017,20170827,5,4.28,"These are the best noodles you will probably ever have in your life. They're so, so soft and chewy - unlike any other udon I have ever had. On top of the that, the creamy broth is to die for. It's extremely rich! I ordered the Uni Sea Urchin Udon Bowl, and I can't wait to come back again. The wait time is long so I advise coming 45 minutes early."
8/27/2017,20170827,5,4.28,"Best udon in LA, and I just came back from Tokyo a few months ago! Get the spicy dragon udon or the uni udon and you won't be disappointed!"
8/27/2017,20170827,5,4.28,"The best udon I ever had in California. I came here with my girlfriend for dinner on a Saturday. This place was packed and there was quite a long line. However, most parties get tired of waiting and leave so the line goes by pretty fast. Parking is LA aka a hassle. Other than that there are some shops and plazas to walk around after being stuffed with good food here. The shop is pretty small but the kitchen has a window where you can see them hand making udon. It was pretty nice to watch them make udon and cook the dishes. The prices are pretty fair for the amount you get and the quality. I got the Uni (Sea Urchin) Udon and my girlfriend got the Shrimp Tempura Udon. We also got the takoyaki.The takoyaki was delcious! There were 3 pcs but they were enough! Very creamy and soft with explosions of flavor from the sauces. It was one of my favorite takoyakis I have had in recent memory. The Uni Udon looks pretty simple. I would have added some seaweed in it if I knew it didn't come with it. However, other than that it just has some roe, uni, udon, and creamy sauce! The sauce wasn't super thick and creamy. It was perfectly balanced and did not feel 'heavy'. The udon was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of bite. The star of this dish has to be the uni. The flavor oozes out into the surrounding cream and udon giving each bite an explosion of flavor. The uni itself is very very good. This is one of the best dishes I have ever had. The Shrimp Tempura Udon with no toppings looks kind of sad. I am a person who usually likes a bunch of toppings and ingredients. And while you can add more toppings, the basic Udon with the broth and noodles was amazing! I was wrong to judge and when I had a taste of the broth I was amazed. The broth was so warm and comforting. The udon, like mine, was perfect. The shrimp tempura came out on the side. The batter was light and crisp. The pieces of shrimp were pretty big too. This was my girlfriend's favorite udon dish by far. Overall, I am very happy we got to try this place. The Sea Urchin Udon is one of my favorite dishes ever. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and come back again sometime in the future."
8/28/2017,20170828,3,4.28,"My friends and I decided to try this place out as we have heard great things about it. First off, the place is absolutely packed with a waiting line so make sure to put your name down as soon as you get there. As other reviewers have mentioned most people do not wait so you make sure to stick around in case they call your name. I ordered the Miso carbonara udon with a side order of shrimp Tempura. At $12.50 I expected to get somewhat a good portion but I got a little less that expected. My dish was very good but reminded me a bit of Italian food mixed with udon noodles. Now here is where I was a little mad, the side order of tempura I ordered only came with one measly shrimp tempura that costed $2.50. I was very upset that it only came with one tempura as for that price it should include atleast two tempuras. The redeeming quality is that the staff is super friendly and very patient despite how busy it is. You can tell they are tired but are still able to put on a smile. Overall, I do not think I will be coming back as this place is a bit too pricey for what you get."
8/29/2017,20170829,4,4.28,"By far the best udon I've had in my life. I came here on a Monday at 6:30PM and we got seated within a few minutes. If you get seated at the bar you get to see a cook roll out the udon and cut it up. It isn't the most exciting thing to watch but it's good to know that the udon is fresh.I ordered the sea urchin udon. This isn't your typical udon, the texture of the broth/sauce is a lot like a creamy mac and cheese (minus the pull) or like an alfredo sauce. It's a bit heavy. You probably get about 1 or 2 pieces of uni cut up and mixed into the bowl. I can't really tell how fresh the uni is because the hot broth/sauce cooks it. As a topping you get several piece of roe placed on top of a leaf. The roe tasted pretty fresh. What I loved most about the udon bowl were the noodles. I'm all about the thick chewy noodles. I can slurp the noodles all day!Overall, I thought it was fantastic and will for sure be back to try other udon bowls. The only reason why this isn't a 5 star is because of the portion. $17 for the sea urchin bowl is a bit steep, I probably would have felt better if they just gave me more noodles or maybe give me smaller bowl because the bowl they provided is wide. It only filled up about halfway. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my food and will definitely be back for another round."
8/29/2017,20170829,5,4.28,"FRESH HANDMADE UDON. That is all you need to know. Well, also that the udon is delicious. Be prepared to wait. This place is popular. My friend and I probably waited a good thirty minutes before we were seated at the bar. (The line at Daikokuya was even longer!) This place offers both hot and cold udon noodle bowls! We ordered one cold and one hot to share. We got the curry udon and the cold bukkake udon with egg. A lot of people were ordering the carbonara udon. The food came out super fast. (I think the amount of time we were IN the restaurant was shorter than the time we waited!) The noodles were DELICIOUS! The curry was tasty and simple. And the cold udon was also super yummy. And the best part is that while we were eating, one of the employees started rolling the udon noodle dough and cutting them with the noodle slicer (that looked like a paper cutter)! It was dinner plus a show!!!"
8/29/2017,20170829,3,4.28,"What I ordered: Sea Urchin Udon ($16.95), Negitoro Wrap (7.25), Tempura soft-boiled egg (1.5). The Udon tasted more like cream pasta and I felt the portion was way too small for the price paid. If I visit again, I would not order again. The wrap and the tempura egg were interesting and tasty. Overall, if I am in the area again I may visit but only if there's less than 20mins of wait. Otherwise, not sure if it's worth the time..."
8/30/2017,20170830,5,4.28,"Their udon is incredible, and I couldn't stop eating! The portions are huge especially for such an affordable price. The service was wonderful. I will for sure be coming back."
9/1/2017,20170901,5,4.28,"My boyfriend came here on a Friday morning and were the first in line waiting for them to open. It was really hot in the 90-100 today and couldn't wait to get inside only to find out the inside was really hot too. 'No air conditioning? Anyways, saw the worker making fresh udon noodle was entertaining. I ordered the lunch special udon gratin with the negitori rice bowl and my boyfriend got the uni udon! Both udon were amazing and so was the rice bowl!! We were really happy with our meal. But literally dying cause it was so hot in there! Other than that, staff were friendly and I'd recommend this place if you're looking to eat somewhere in little Tokyo!"
9/1/2017,20170901,5,4.28,"This place is known for having quality udon, and they definitely live up to their reputation. In addition to the exceptional udon, coming here was a very immerse dining experience; the chefs work behind a large glass enclosure and you can watch them hand roll all the noodles from blocks of dough. I ordered the uni udon, which turned out to be more creamy than I expected, but the creaminess of the uni complemented the overall flavor very well. I would definitely order this again when I decide to come back.As for the parking situation, parking in this area is always going to be difficult or expensive. Plan accordingly, or just take an Uber.The service here was great. The waiters and waitresses are obviously very busy, but they do a good job of being attentive and efficient."
9/2/2017,20170902,4,4.28,"So glad I finally had the chance to check out this place! They don't take reservations so you have to come on the earlier side in order to avoid a super long wait. My friend and I came around 6 on a Friday night and the wait was about 20 minutes for us both. Got seated by the kitchen so it was pretty warm where we were sitting (the biggest downside of the meal). They make the udon from scratch, it's cool to see it being made. We ordered quickly and the food came out promptly. I ordered the sea urchin udon which was so creamy and delicious. The pieces of uni were chopped up quite small though so it was kind of tricky to get all the little morsels--definitely made me work for it! It was a rich dish that was filling and satisfying, and I liked the salmon roe bonus. I'd come back and try the squid butter udon next!"
9/2/2017,20170902,1,4.28,"EXTREMELY RUDE Receptionist! We arrived here at around 930pm. I asked the receptionist whether they were closed now. He simply ignored me, and started to read names on the waitlist. I waited for a second, and after he briefly stopped, I asked again with ""Excuse me"". He looked at me for a sec, and left. This is clearly unacceptable. I think they may just don't care about their customers, because people will come anyway."
9/3/2017,20170903,5,4.28,"SO GOOD MUST TRY THE NOODLES ARE VERY QMy boyfriends got uni udon it was creamy and delicious.There were actually a bunch of uni. I got a duck soup udon. It was cold noodle (summer special) I loved it also. Although the soup was a little salty, with those cold oodles, it tasted really good. Would definitely come back again! It was p hot inside but we still enjoyed the noodle"
9/3/2017,20170903,5,4.28,"Came on a Sunday morning and were the first people waiting in line. Opens at 11:30am on Sunday so we began waiting around 11. At first we thought the crowd was for Marugame, but it was Daikokuya a few doors down. But the line for Marugame started getting long at 11:30. We ordered the curry udon, and the sea urchin udon. And made one of the meals into a combo and got the pork belly rice. The pork belly rice was so good! It was marinated with garlic so it was garlic pork belly on top of rice. Tasted similar to your kbbq garlic pork belly, but thinly sliced. The curry udon was a huge bowl, and the curry flavor definitely was there. It wasn't a super thick curry so the bowl wasn't super heavy. The sea urchin udon was super delicious. Plenty of pieces of sea urchin in the noodles and the cream had a good flavor to it. The cream wasn't too rich, which is good because if it was too rich, it would be a bit hard to finish. We both finished both of our udon bowls in less than 15 minutes. Maybe because we were hungry from waiting in line? Will definitely be back again!"
9/3/2017,20170903,5,4.28,"I've heard a lot of things about Marugame Monzo from friends and online food bloggers. First of all in my opinion I think it lives up to its hype. The Udon is amazing. They handmade all of their noodles and you can even watch them in the restaurant. I got the Vongole Udon and honestly I don't think I would order anything else when I go back because it's that amazing. If you're a fan of obviously Vongole pasta then you will definitely love this dish. One thing that is kind of disappointing was the portion. The portions are honestly pretty small. There's not a ton of broth and noodles. Granted, the quality of the dish was superior than other Udon restaurants I've been to. The restaurant itself is very small. I would coming with a party of 4 was the limit because anything more than that is going to result in a long wait. I came with a party of 4 and it was a bit of a wait. The usually wait time is around 30-40minutes. MAKE SURE TO GO IN AND WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN! Stick around that area especially because a lot of people end up going somewhere else and the restaurant just skips over them and gives up their table to the next party. Parking is a bit difficult to find because it is in Little Tokyo. But what you can do is either street park around there or park in the little tokyo plaza and go get some coffee in the plaza after to get it validated for a free hour. If you can lyft or uber , I would HIGHLY suggest that because parking in downtown is expensive and very limited. OVERALL, it's great food for about $12-$15. I definitely highly recommend this place! Hope you enjoy it too!"
9/3/2017,20170903,1,4.28,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE experience today with a server. Everyone is always friendly when I come here except this girl today!!! Drove all the way from San Diego to dine here and had a very unpleasant service. I admit to making mistake to where I put my name on the waiting list, I apologized to the host/server and she was upset and told me I should know next time and that I should make sure to put my name on the right place. Ignored the attitude and moved on. 15 mins later she called a few customers in line and I checked if my name was called she said with attitude ""NO I DIDN'T FORGET YOU"". I grabbed the clip board to explain to my parents why we've been waiting for awhile. She came after me saying ""I can't take the clip board outside"" returned the clip board and apologized. She sat us down and again scolded us and make sure next time that I put my name on the right spot. I ordered seafood udon knowing it was the same one I had ordered last time, when the food came it was a different one. Didn't bother to say anything but when I paid, I left a note on the receipt that it was the wrong ordered, didn't leave a tip because of the very bad service. As we walked out the server came up to me and said that the order was right and so I said oh I thought it wasn't because it did not look the same as last time. She then said I didn't tip because of what happend when she told me I couldn't take the clip board out and I said I didn't because of your attitude and sevice. she continued to be upset and said because of my note she then will have to file a report to her manager, sounded that I'm obligated to give her a tip and that she deserves a tip. so I said well alright then give me the receipt and I'll just give you your tip. she walked out no thank you or what so ever. VERY RUDE! NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN. SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT!"
9/4/2017,20170904,5,4.28,Excellent Udon!Sit at the bar and watch the noodles get made from scratch. Food is delicious and the service is great.
9/6/2017,20170906,5,4.28,"Time to switch gears from ramen to the first review of our favorite udon spot in the LA area. Marugame Monzo is located in Little Tokyo located right next to Daikokuya. They have an interesting menu balanced with both traditional styles of udon and more modern, fusion styles of udon. Though we usually don't go for the latter, the udon dishes that are a fusion of Italian pasta and udon are popular menu items that look delicious if you're in the mood. Everything we've had from here has been consistently delicious and always hits the spot.Something kind of neat about the space itself is that all the noodles are handmade behind a large, open window. If you are seated at the bar, you can sit and watch the udon noodles being made right in front of you. Kind of cool to see the noodles made right in front of you, and you know they're always going to be fresh! This time around we ordered an appetizer and got to try three different bowls of udon. To start, we tried their crispy chicken skin and for our entrees, we went for the Mad Tiger Udon, Shrimp Tempura Udon, and the Curry Udon.The crispy chicken skin was a last minute decision to tide us over since we were all starving and it was a pleasant surprise. The pieces of chicken skin were very crispy and had a nice crunch. The texture was fairly reminiscent of chicharron. It was served in a bowl of ponzu sauce and topped with a Japanese herb called mitsuba which is kind of like a less flavorful cilantro. Great little dish to snack on while you wait for your udon.So, I guess we'll start with the curry udon. This is definitely on the heavier side since the broth is comprised of a thicker Japanese style curry. It isn't as thick as regular curry but is certainly thicker and heavier than your average udon broth. The noodles are of course cooked to perfection and as fresh as they get and were topped with a healthy serving of green onions. The curry udon is served with a side of deep fried soft-boiled egg. Had an interesting look to it and was very tasty.The Mad Tiger Udon is the perfect dish for a warm summer's day. This dish is a serious explosion of flavor. It's a cold udon that doesn't come with broth and is served with a side of sauce that you can pour over the udon to your liking. The udon is topped with ground pork, chives, green onion, bonito, nori and a soft-boiled egg. The sauce that could double as a cold broth is flavorful and savory and ties the whole dish together. You can't go wrong with the Shrimp Tempura Udon, which was the most traditional bowl of udon of the three dishes we ordered. The broth was super yummy and the perfect amount of saltiness. Just like the other bowls of udon, the noodles were made to perfection. Aside from the delicious broth and perfect noodles, the shrimp tempura came out on top as the MVP. The shrimp was butterflied, slightly pounded, and deep fried to perfection.We're both such big fans of ramen that we sometimes forget about how dank udon is. If you're ever in Little Tokyo, drop by Marugame Monzo because it's definitely the best we've had in LA."
9/6/2017,20170906,4,4.28,"Recently went to Marugame with some friends and the udon here is awesome. They have a big variety of all different signature udons as well as the original style. I been to this location once before and got the Uni Udon (sea urchin), which is probably the most popular udon there. This time however, i got the mushroom cream and it was good as well, but not as delicious as the uni. I believe the noodles here are hand made as well.My gf got the seafood salad, and she said it was ""just okay"". Probably because the seafood didn't look all too fresh, but hey, this is a udon spot, not sushi. She really liked the japanese salad dressing tho (shes all about the sauce).She also said the tempura was one of the best there as well.Quick tip: if you are trying to get extra noodles, you must order before your meal comes out. The waitress was a little feisty when I asked for extra noodles at the end and she replied to me saying ""this is not a ramen spot"".All in all, I do like this place, I will definitely be coming back, BUT you gotta there early, 30 min before they open, or you will be waiting 1-2 hours for a table. This place always gets packed."
9/8/2017,20170908,4,4.28,"We keep coming back. It's just that good. But prepare for a wait as it is a tiny place and pretty popular. I love sitting and watching them make the noodle fresh. You can really taste the freshness once you get your bowl of udon. What's great is they have the typical udon soup or curry and then the not so typical like carbonara. We've tried a few and haven't had anything we don't like. Even though it's all really filling, the mini rice bowl to add to your meal is worth it. We love the pork belly and beef. And if you're really hangry, just splurge on the crispy chicken skin appetizers. Do it. And hit the gym tomorrow. lol"
9/9/2017,20170909,3,4.28,"Came here for lunch around 12:45pm and the wait was like 10 minutes. We ordered the uni cream udon, mentai squid butter, soft boiled eggs, chikuwa and baby octopus. Uni cream udon was super rich but tasty. I wasn't a fan of the mentai squid butter. The sweetness from the onion threw off the saltiness of the mentai. Soft boiled egg was bland and chikuwa had flour in the middle wasn't fully cooked. My favorite side was the baby octopus. It was crispy and tender. Food was ok and nothing spectacular. Not sure what the hype it."
9/9/2017,20170909,1,4.28,"The service is HORRIBLE here. When I got to this place and there were three table empty. Firstly, they don't let me sit because of their policy. I was really exhausted from work and want a place to sit but they refused me. I plead to have a chair and a waiter gave it to me. The other servant came and asked me cannot sit . It's just tooo rude to treat customers like this. DON'T COME"
9/10/2017,20170910,4,4.28,"My favorite udon place, the udon noodles are made fresh everyday in the restaurant! The wait time is usually 40-50 minutes long, especially in the weekend.They have a good selection of traditional flavor like beef udon, and non traditional flavor like carbonara udon. My favorite udon is Sea Urchin Cream udon and Mentai squid butter udon. But the mad tiger cold udon is perfect for the summer!"
9/10/2017,20170910,5,4.28,"Dining room experience:We have been coming to Little Tokyo as a group for years, and today was the night we finally tried somewhere new. It is a small hole in the wall with a clean, relaxing environment. We waited a little longer, but that was mostly due to us being a bigger group. Servers/staff always had smiles and were attentive. I always enjoy getting to see them making the noodles by hand in the back. 10/10Food: Calamari as an appetizer was juicy, tasty, and delicious. We also ordered the beef tataki, which had such a great flavor and tenderness. 10/10Chicken Tempura Udon had a tasty, hearty broth. Had this with a side of rice, and it was filling. Noodles were fantastic. Simple, and satisfying. 9/10Hot Dragon Udon was flavorful and well presented. Had a spice that did not give me an overbearing fire. The portion amount was just right, not too little to leave me needing more, nor was it too much. Loved it!!10/10Lastly, the Mentai Squid Butter udon was probably the best udon bowl I've ever tasted. The squid quality was fantastic, tender and easily melts in your mouth. I will be talking about this bowl forever.11/10Overall, I will say this place is worth giving a try for something new. We will definitely be coming back here. 10/10"
9/10/2017,20170910,5,4.28,"Wanted to go here for a while and it happened last weekend. The place is pretty small and the wait is forever, but one thing I can say is that it's worth waiting. I had the uni udon and my husband had the creamy tomato seafood udon and they were both amazing. Mine was a little better though just because I love uni, and needless to say that they were soooo generous with the amount of sea urchin that you almost can't even finish it all. Will be back soon!"
9/10/2017,20170910,5,4.28,The best noodle soup in town. Mentai Squid Butter udon is my favorite of all. Squid is amazingly soft.
9/10/2017,20170910,5,4.28,"I went there a year ago, it was pretty late and was last.order. But they still deliver good food and servive."
9/10/2017,20170910,2,4.28,I waited 30min and when we got inside and orders udon . And it came I was like what !!!!! Udon noodle is so little . I was hungry after ate all. Are you guys joking right? Put more udon we paid more than $13
9/13/2017,20170913,5,4.28,"This is one of the few times I need to write an appropriately updated review for my apparent underrating of a certain establishment. Put it this way: there are plenty of great ramen shops in L.A. that you can select from. But there is only ONE Monzo.So having been here more than once now, I have now tried what are the two most popular and undisputed best dishes at Monzo: (1) the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and (2) the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. I personally think the Sea Urchin Cream Udon is a bit overrated since it's definitely a case of less uni, more cream, but it's still good. But the Mentai Squid Butter Udon? Holy hell, that bowl of udon is by itself enough reason for me to come back to this place. It manages to balance being a flavor bomb in your mouth without being too heavy. If there were a perfect bowl of udon, this comes as close as you can get to it.On top of that, the rice bowls here are pretty legit too. I don't really eat all that much anymore so the udon bowl is the perfect portion size. But if you wanna get your money's worth, a side of the pork belly rice bowl is a great addition to your meal!The line has definitely gotten to the point where it can rival next door Daikokuya in wait. Get there early for lunch if you don't want a long wait. Nothing worse than missing out on the first rotation of people and having to wait 40 or so minutes.Service is generally very friendly, have never had any complaints with staff here in the many times I've been here.Monzo was initially a whatever place to me, but it's now elevated to one of my top go-to choices in L.A., either for myself or friends. I have definitely taken my fair share of friends here and they all love itI Monzo is truly a gem."
9/13/2017,20170913,5,4.28,"We came 20 minutes before closing and they were still able to accommodate and provide us with excellent service. Thank god! For starters, the appetizers exceeded my expectations. The garlic calamari and takoyaki were both very good! Uni udon was rich and savory, but in my opinion, the uni was was a little overcooked. My friend's beef udon was the exact opposite from mine. It was like clear light umami vs. rich & creamy. Both very good! 10/10 would come again to try their vegan broth"
9/15/2017,20170915,1,4.28,"I checked my credit card statement a few days after visiting this place and found out that they charged me $77, How can 2 bowls of udon and a rice bowl cost that much? I am working with the credit card company on the overcharge now... beaware..."
9/16/2017,20170916,5,4.28,"We stayed in Little Tokyo for two nights in the summer and stood in line at this restaurant for dinner both nights. There's nothing like this place where we live so it had to be done. The udon is so fresh and perfectly cooked, made incredibly tasty by the broths and toppings, that the 30+ minute wait each time was worth it. Once you're inside, the wait staff is friendly and very efficient, but you don't feel like you're being rushed to accommodate the other patrons who are waiting. I love uni but can't have cream based sauces, so sadly I couldn't have the dish that they're famous for. The sansai udon was delicious and very satisfying, and the negitoro rice bowl felt like a decadent treat. I also tried the plum shiso bukkake udon with one of the summer salads they had. The hubby loved the hot dragon and mad tiger udon and probably would've ordered the same thing again had we gone back a third time. Don't let the long lines deter you; a lot of people are also waiting for the ramen place next door (which is also excellent). I miss this place and can't wait to go back!"
9/17/2017,20170917,5,4.28,"Yes, it is worth the wait. There is nothing better than hand made noodles!!! With any good place = there's always the wait! Although we were there before they even opened, our wait was about 10 minutes after they opened their door at 11:30. There was a line before 11:15 on a Saturday. But you know what they say, good things happen to those who wait~Expect to wait about good 20+ minutes during their peak hours. Food is as expected. Good, clean, fresh, & tasty. The udon noodles were of that perfect texture; fat, perfectly cooked, & totally slurp worthy. The menu is not totally traditional but the combination of old and new seems to work very well. There were so many different udon dishes (hot & cold) I wanted to try, it was hard for me to pick what I wanted~ Tried the carbonara and the summer special Hot Dragon. Also ordered their assorted tempura as an app. Carbonara = rich, bacony, creamy, & dreamy~ totally a carb cheat day treat!!Hot Dragon = the broth was so yummy! Nicely spiced up (for a spicy whimp, it was a perfectly spicy dish). Get it before the summer is over~ Tempura = assorted vegetables (shiso, shiitake, nasu eggplant, & kabocha) & a shrimp - lightly battered that is crunchy and yummy! Properly fried goodness!! Tentsuyu was great too~Deep fried soft boil egg = Eat it!Service was prompt & friendly.If you're a true udon lover and want to try a new udon dish or even as a traditionalist = you need to come try their udon!!! Over 2000 people visited and they have near perfect star rating. 2000+ taste buds can't be wrong~ I will make the annoying drive to Little Tokyo from O.C anyday for their udon~ ^^**They just opened up their traditional udon restaurant in Sawtelle Japantown (Little Osaka) too - they've got tempura bar there with their udon offerings. They're spreading the udon love~ maybe open one down in O.C. next?!"
9/18/2017,20170918,5,4.28,"Had high expectations for this place and it was excellent. Their uni udon was very flavorful. Creamy, but a little too heavy and feels very cheesy. If you have a few bites than it's delicious, but finishing the whole bowl feels a bit too heavy. Would be a great side dish if they had it in smaller size. Kinda like their side rice plate, which by the way was really great, highly recommended. I picked the squid ink udon. It was delicious. I enjoyed it more than the uni. The soup was very savory, had that ocean freshness and fresh seafood greatness. Onions in the soup brought out that sweetness towards the end. Squid meat was tender and chewy, very well cooked. Noodle was very well made, props to that noodle guy being watched by everyone. Line gets really long on weekends so go early and be ready to wait."
9/19/2017,20170919,4,4.28,"Marugame Monzo is located in the heart of Little Tokyo right next door to Daikokuya Ramen if you're familiar with the area.Upon arrival expect a long standing wait outside the restaurant after signing your name to the list. Although the list was extremely long on our first visit, the wait went by extremely fast (about 20 min. total) since a lot of people gave up waiting and went elsewhere.The staff here seem to be very nice and attentive and always made sure we got what we wanted.In terms of food, the make fresh udon noodles right there in the restaurant through a viewing room in the back of the restaurant. We all ordered the Uni Cream Udon, which was well flavored but not excessive like some uni plates. The uni is cooked here so that was a little different to what I am use to since it sort of changes the taste of the uni and makes it less flavorful. Why Marugame Monzo lost a star:Don't expect your bowl of udon to be full of soup as usual, there is barely any cream, just enough to soak the udon, sort of like how a bowl of pasta would be. Also, we were recommended by the waitress to order a tempura style egg to be added to the soup. Although the egg was properly cooked with the yolk still runny, the egg was completely flavorless along with a flavorless tempura shell.We were also recommended the kakiagi which is basically a small tower of mixed vegetables tempura style, also flavorless and I would avoid.Overall, the actual main dish we got was good and had good flavor, it could have used more soupy goodness. In terms of uni dishes, I think EMC's Uni Pasta still takes the cake."
9/19/2017,20170919,4,4.28,"Great, filling ramen, no line when we went either! Go for the lunch deal so you can also get a cheaper rice bowl"
9/20/2017,20170920,4,4.28,"I came here on a Sunday around 6:30PM, so the place was poppin through the roof. I waited around 45 minutes. When they say you only call your name 3 times before crossing it out, they mean it.I got the uni udon. It was pretty good, but the dish got too creamy halfway though. However, that's expected when you order an uni udon dish. The noodles were done just right. Next time I come, I'm definitely going to try a dish that has a broth base. As an appetizer, I got the calamari. It was pretty good especially with the sauce.Overall, I thought the place was pretttty good but not like OMG THIS IS AMAZING YOU HAVE TO GO HERE kind of thing. I'll update my review once I try the other dishes though. This place is probably great for hangovers though. It'd be dope if the place offered specials with udon + meat/rice on the side. Udon West in NYC does that, and it's soooooo worth."
9/20/2017,20170920,4,4.28,"Came here Labor Day weekend and the line was long but the food was worth the wait. Enjoyed their creamy ramen and fatty tuna w rice dish. The fried baby octopus could have been better if they fried them separately, mine ended up clumped together, and maybe a dipping sauce. The place is small and cramped and did not have AC in the middle of a summer. We were sweating so much trying to eat hot ramen...what were we thinking. Overall I would come back if the ac works or it's more towards the winter. Good thing was we didn't have to wait too long.Food - AService - AAtmosphere - D"
9/21/2017,20170921,3,4.28,"The udon here is made in house for a delicious bowl of happiness. Be prepared for a wait, as this spot is very popular. I've tried many of the dishes here throughout the years and have liked almost all of them. I wish the udon noodles were slightly more al dente, but they are still very very good. - Uni cream udon - I love uni, but this dish was a bit overwhelming. The heaviness of the cream and the uni really made it only palatable for a few bites. It's almost too rich to really eat an entire bowl of this. I recommend sharing this if you are a fan of uni. - Beef udon - Delicious broth, simple, elegant, flavorful, but a classic that I always return to. - Mentai squid butter udon - A lovely mixture of tender squid, cream, and that savory flavor of roe intermingled with the hot udon noodles make it a wonderful dish. - Udon au gratin with chicken - The chicken was surprisingly dry even though the cheese, cream, and baked udon was good. Unfortunately the dry chicken brought down the dish. Overall a solid udon place, but because of the line and hit or miss food, I may look to other udon spots in the neighborhood."
9/21/2017,20170921,5,4.28,"Never was a udon person. It was all about ramen for me. When my cousin suggested we go here I was iffy about it because I thought I knew I didn't like udon. But I was so wrong. I realized I just never had a good bowl of udon. I had thought udon noodles were just so flour-y, why do people like that. But the noodles here are hand made which really affects their texture. I remember thinking, OMG this is how udon noodles are supposed to be?!?! The creamy uni udon is obviously a must try but it can be too much creaminess in one sitting. I recommend going with at least another person and splitting the creamy uni udon and another clear broth udon just to balance it out. There's not that much uni but the flavor is on point. Only con is that there is usually a very long wait but for me its always worth it."
9/22/2017,20170922,5,4.28,This is so much better than the Little Tokyo fave a few doors down. Clean and the udon is made right in front of you. Shrimp Tempura and lunch special wAs fantastic. The man seated next to me had what looked like an udon mac n cheese! I will definitely try the truffle udon too. This is my go to place in Little Tokyo
9/23/2017,20170923,5,4.28,"I'm actually not a fan of udon, but this place is delicious! I decided to go with their cold udon and veggies with a mini beef bowl. The beef bowl was just okay, but the udon was the best I've had. Definitely will be back!There's street parking or there's a parking structure across the street."
9/24/2017,20170924,5,4.28,"This place is amazing!!! We're here from Orange County, and found it as relatively close to a concert we're going to tonight. We ordered the uni and the squid butter udon, with a takoyaki appetizer. Our friends ordered beef udon, and tomato basil udon with seafood. Everything was fantastic! The wait was quoted as 45 minutes, but it took about 20. They make the udon fresh (you can watch them do it), and you can tell the difference when you eat it. Our server Vanessa helped us choose, and everything she suggested was wonderful! (Well, everything she suggested that we had room to try.) We are going to need to come back next time we are in the area."
9/24/2017,20170924,5,4.28,"Amazing udon! I had beef, my wife had tomato basil seafood, everything I tasted (including the things our friends ordered) was spectacular!"
9/25/2017,20170925,3,4.28,"Zero wait on a weekday @5:30pm! My friend and I were seated instantly and had a super attentive server that took our order, and presented us with steaming bowls of udon within minutes. I ordered the Hot Beef Udon and my friend got the signature Uni one. My bowl of Beef Udon was solid. The beef was tender, the Udon was well cooked and just the right amount of chewiness, and the broth was light and flavorful. I really enjoyed how simple but well done the dish was. It's unassuming and homey in all the right ways. My friend's Uni Udon was good, but definitely felt toooooooo creamy and overpowering after a while. We both love Uni and were therefore a bit disappointed by the paltry Uni serving. Overall, I think there's a lot of hype around the Uni Cream Udon, but the hype is a bit unnecessary. It's good because it's different/unique, but because of how heavy it is, I'd choose the simple Beef Udon over the Uni one any day. A great find, especially for those Udon lovers out there!"
9/25/2017,20170925,5,4.28,"I "" hate"" doing this, becauseI really don't want to wait inLine any longer. But this isTHE BEST noodle house inLA . Period. Daikokuya next door Is a just ok next this incredible Find. The sea urchin udon andThe fried chicken skins ...I'd drive an hour to get here. I hope you don't ... but I have To be honest .... this is it."
9/25/2017,20170925,3,4.28,"I will straightaway say that although my 3 stars may look low, it's just more how I feel towards udon in general. I do feel that Marugame Monzo is good, and the service is fast and friendly and there are a ton of choices for the udon lover. As a person who is kind of meh towards udon to begin with, I didn't expect to fall in love with their udon, and although I would absolutely return, my heart just sits with Daikokuya next door. I like that the udon is rolled and cut right there in the restaurant, and there are a ton of choices for broth and toppings. We also did the lunch special mini rice bowl add on, which was great, although that is definitely way too much food for an individual. I got the chicken tempura udon, which was good, and the tempura chicken was light and airy, although VERY quick to get soggy even sitting on the separate plate (and once it's soggy, it's way less enjoyable). On a Sunday afternoon our party of 2 waited 30 minutes. They will recall names but I think they permanently cross you off if you don't show up after 3 calls, and your entire party needs to be present. The restaurant is small and packed, but the wait staff moves things along as fast as possible. I like that there is another addition to Little Tokyo, and I would totally be game to bring family here to try this out as well."
9/26/2017,20170926,5,4.28,"First of all, I gotta thank my girlfriend for telling me about this place. Even though udon isn't bad at all, I was always a ramen guy more than an udon guy. But this place totally make me like udon more.I always get the Udon Gratin with chicken. It was made to perfection. It's kind of like an Alfredo pasta, but it's with udon instead. I really like it because it was very flavorful. My girlfriend's beef udon was delicious as well. I really liked the Rice with seaweed shaped like a triangle (pictured -I apologize that I forgot what was it called) because it was very tasty.The service here was great, this is also another place I'd love to go back whenever I'm in town."
9/26/2017,20170926,5,4.28,"Great place for udon adventures. Worth the drive, wait and expensive parking. I had the mushroom with cream udon. Came here last month for one of my birthday dinners. Wait time was about 30-45 mins during the weekday and parking across the street in the lot cost me $10. If I lived closer I would probably just uber/lyft to here to avoid paying and looking for parking. I would also try to come here during non peak hours."
9/26/2017,20170926,5,4.28,"I have been craving for some good udon since I came back from Japan a few months ago. Lucky for me, I was in LA, and my sister recommended this place. She claimed it was the best udon she's had outside from Japan, and I can't say I disagree! I came here for lunch on a Sunday, and it was pretty crowded. I waited for about 1.5 hours, but it was totally worth it!!! I ordered the hot dragon udon, which really isn't that spicy at all. I was scared it'd be overwhelmingly spicy and take away from the flavor of the broth but that wasn't the case at all. It was not too fatty or too rich, which I actually prefer. The udon noodles were perfectly chewy. My boyfriend got the sea urchin udon, which came in a creamy and much thicker broth. It was so good for about 75% of the bowl, but I have to say that it did get a little too heavy towards the end. They have a ton of different udons on their menu so I'm sure there is something on there for everyone. I can't wait to come back to try other things on their menu! That's if I can stray away from the hot dragon and the sea urchin one..."
9/26/2017,20170926,5,4.28,Yummy udon! Had the mushroom udon and the uni udon wasn't bad either. Wait wasn't too long. Came right in time.
9/27/2017,20170927,5,4.28,"I've heard great things about this place. I'm in the area for work and my hotel is about 45 min away. I rented a car and drove the long distance just to try their udon. I arrived approximately at 9pm, and the place was still packed. I was seated right away, because I was a party of one. Ordered the creamy sea urchin udon. One bite into the meal, and I was in love. I normally eat really fast, but it was so good that I sat there enjoying every single bite. The soup was a little heavy, but who cares, you can work it off at the gym. Price before tax for the udon is about $17, which I feel was a little pricey. BUT, it was worth every penny!! Service was a two thumbs up. I would definitely come back when I visit again."
9/28/2017,20170928,5,4.28,"Nice customer service. It's cool to see them make their noodles by scratch. And it pays off. The noodles are perfect smooth soft texture and the broth was amazing. I got chicken tempura udon. The udon would've nice with soy sauce, but they didn't bring it after we asked. It was a busy place so definitely well liked. My friend and I want to go back again."
9/28/2017,20170928,4,4.28,"I had the clam udon, or ""udon Vongole "" and it was good! I asked them if it was oily, and they said no it's not but it's salty so I asked for less salt. And it came out in a delicious white wine broth that was very pleasant. Highly recommend."
9/29/2017,20170929,5,4.28,This is honestly the best udon noodles on the planet earth and beyond. We had the mad tiger udon and the hot dragon udon. We also had fried calamari and takoyaki for appetizers. These were also spectacular. Food is well-presented and comes out lightning fast despite a packed house. Service was attentive and kind. Those homemade noodles are bombbb. A little pricey but an excellent meal overall. You won't be disappointed.
9/30/2017,20170930,5,4.28,"I just realized I haven't written a review on this place and I've been here a few times over the last 4 years! I love udon and this place is legit... Japanese handmade noodles (made in front of you!!). Back in the day, I saw Japanese men making the noodles, the last time I came here, they were all Latino, but hey, welcome to LA. Their hot udon noodle soups are delicious. Their udon pasta dishes are all good and I agree with everyone that their uni (sea urchin) pasta is very tasty... Even if you don't usually like uni, you might like it. The only downside is that there is a super long wait and I don't think they take reservations, why should they!! But for a foodie, waiting to eat something excellent just comes with the territory. I know everyone is crazy about ramen but I honestly prefer udon and highly recommend this place!"
9/30/2017,20170930,4,4.28,This is good Udon. A solid place. In house noodle making. If you sit at the bar you can watch and be mesmerized. I wish I could try all the sauces.
9/30/2017,20170930,5,4.28,"David So recommended this place and as any of his follower would do, we need to try the Sea Urchin Udon. The creamy based leaving-your-mouth-wanting-more sauce makes me crave it as I write this review. The wait was only about 15-20 minutes which was long if you go in the summer and have to stand outside but the wait is well worth it. The udon is handmade and you can see it once you go inside the restaurant. The cheese udon was to die for! OMG! They also have THE BEST CALAMARI and I had a share of calamari around the state. I recommend sharing with a group of friends because you couldn't decide which udon to get and the portion is a good amount to share. The price is affordable. If you love food like I do, you will love handmade udon like they make it."
10/1/2017,20171001,5,4.28,"I can come eat here every single day if I could! We usually go here on weekends or for dinner on weekdays, and theres almost always a line, so make sure you have some time to spare waiting to get a table! (Wait time varies but I personally never waited longer than 35 minutes, they usually get people in and out fast) My fiancé and I love the Sea Urchin Udon and Gratin Udon (if you love cheese this one's a must try).Also the Takoyaki is a must try as an appetizer!"
10/1/2017,20171001,5,4.28,Always a favorite except maybe the long wait when I am very hungry. Love the beef or uni udon. Definitely also recommend the fried chicken or clams. My friend tried the vegetarian option and loved it too.10/10 would recommend
10/2/2017,20171002,5,4.28,"I have always seen this place packed with people, but I never actually went in since I usually came to daikokuya right next door. So when I finally did not feel up for ramen and opted for udon, I knew where to go... isn't that convenient!I had the creamy miso carbonara udon, it was absolutely delicious. I cannot emphasize at how dissappointed I was in myself that I did not order the double portion... it was only 2 bucks more!!! It was made with a very rich cream sauce, and I actually prefer it over actual italian carbonara, because I believe the udon texture adds another element to the dish. If you are not in the mood for more traditional udon, I would highly recommend this dish. I also ordered the Negitoro rice bowl, which was also very tasty as well. I got it before my udon, and I was planning on saving it to eat together with my entree. Maybe I was just so hungry, but I finished it in like two minutes tops... It has a very mild flavor, and the seasonings don't overpower the fish which I think is great. The toro is ground up so I am not sure about how great the quality of the fish is... The service was great as well! The servers were very quick to help us out with making the order, and they were also well versed in the menu, since they were helping us pick out our dishes."
10/3/2017,20171003,5,4.28,"Go for the udon only for sure. Mentai Squid Butter. Sound weird but amazing? Ummmm...because it totally is. I am a thousand percent sure a lot of people Google ""mentai"" before getting this dish. And then up comes ""pollock roe"" and people are still like wtf is pollock - so all we can do is try. LoL. And it does not disappoint. The squid has that balance between hard and soft for that perfect chew texture. And the mentai adds the perfect amount of flavorful salt to the butter. YUM! Uni Cream. Makes you salivate. That's for sure. No need to elaborate. The udon noodles here - can do no wrong.Just say yes."
10/4/2017,20171004,5,4.28,"MUST GO FOR UDON LOVERS!!! Monzo is famous for their freshly made udon noodles and you can even watch the chef them! I always take my friends from out of state here if we're by Little Tokyo. The restaurant is pretty small and gets crowded very fast. Arriving early before meal times would be smart, otherwise you can definitely expect a wait.Their signature cream sauce udon dishes are definitely interesting, but I prefer to stick to the classics. I got the Hot Sansai Udon which has mountain vegetables like mushrooms, salted mountain vegetables, cloud ear mushrooms, carrots, and grated radish. The noodles are so soft and slippery! And I love to watch the process of making the udon, it's very fascinating. The dish is a large portion of noodles, soup, and toppings. I also ordered their takoyaki, which is okay."
10/4/2017,20171004,4,4.28,Truly a must try for any Udon lover. My Top three are Kitsune Udon (if you're looking for something light.) Carbonara (If you're feeling extra indulgent) and Mentai Squid Butter if you're looking for something extra unique. You literally can't go wrong with any selection on the menu. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the service. While friendly and attentive enough it is a bit rushed. I understand that they need quick turn-around for the long lines but for the price they charge I feel unnecessarily rushed and I'm a fast eater.
10/5/2017,20171005,2,4.28,"The udon here is delicious but service is not all that great. So I wouldn't rate it 4 or 5 stars, perhaps the service is better and hope that grumpy server learns how to deal with better customer service. I've been here a few times to give the restaurant and server the benefit of the doubt and try to rate it higher, but the same grumpy server is really rude which cause the rating to be lower."
10/6/2017,20171006,5,4.28,"Monzo is the best Udon hands down!!!! The sea urchin udon noodles is a MUST TRY! Also the uni butter is amazing too! If you're a fan of Seafood and Japanese, this place won't disappoint! How can I describe this uni udon noodles magnificence! It's so creamy, it's so rich with the butter flavoring every sip of the broth. It has that Seafood richness without the salty ""sea"" taste you get from other places! The udon noodles are authentic and has the perfect chewiness! The small amount of fish roe on top of the udon explode in your mouth with a burst of sea flavor! I also had the shrimp tempura, two of them actually! Yes, they're like $5 each but it's so worth it! To dip a little bit in that uni broth is the best ! Plus if you get the shrimp tempura, it's quite large! It's butterflied nicely and the crispy of the batter is great! I've never had tempura that good before! That's why I had to order two! So the only downside of this place is 3 things! Get ready to wait.....and wait.....and wait......and wait! Trust me, you're not the only one that wants to try this uni udon soup! We literally waited 1.5 hours and we were only a party of 3. Try to go during random non-busy times, maybe you'll have more luck. Also, it's a very small space, thus if you don't like cramped areas, you're gonna hate this place. It's on one of the streets of a little Tokyo where space is scarce there, so they make do with what they have. And last but not least, after trying the uni udon noodles, you're gonna want more! They don't give that much but it's still a normal portion."
10/8/2017,20171008,5,4.28,"love love LOVE the udon here!! Handcrafted udon is not something you can have everyday. Definitely order the Sea Urchin udon if you're a first timer, but FYI is very rich but not overly done. You'll definitely be in a nice food coma afterwards. Must haves:- beef tartare: coated in nice olive oil and diced pickles. Very refreshing- udon: if you want something light and simple, the beef udon is also amazing. The broth will win your heart immediately. Always hard for me to choose between this and the uni udon- Jumbo add-on: it's NOT a normal tempura. It's bigger and meatier - Negitoro Bowl: MUST HAVE! You'll thank me later. I haven't heard anyone say they dislike this dish yet.Personal dislikes:- scallop appetizer: didn't impress me. - salmon roe bowl: it's literally a bowl of rice... plus a couple of roes Tip: Don't come here during ""rush hours"". The restaurant does NOT take reservation and for dinner usually the wait is about an hour."
10/8/2017,20171008,5,4.28,"They have an hour break during the weekdays from 4-5pm. We arrived around 4:30 but they were still closed but when we came back around 5:05, it was already a full house. We were the last ones to get seated before the line got really really long. The udon noodles range from $12-17. The creamy uni udon was soooo good. I really want to try everything else on the menu. I also had the squid udon? (dont know the actual name) and it was amazing as well. Super rich flavors. I want to try the creamy tomato next time and the carbonara. They freshly cut and make the noodles there and you can watch the guy cut it while the other one boils it. The portions are okay, I won't guarentee you'll be full but it will definitely make you happy because it was so flavorful."
10/9/2017,20171009,5,4.28,"Wonderful place to grab some lunch or dinner. Wait time ranges from 30 minutes to beyond, but you can always take a nice stroll into Little Tokyo if the waits too long. Remember that once your name is called, they WILL cross you out. I always go for the cold udon because it has such a refreshing taste to it. The noodles are always chewy and bouncy, just the way I like it! Last but not least, order the takoyakis!!!! Another must-get every single time I go here!"
10/9/2017,20171009,1,4.28,"My friend brought me and another friend here for my first and last time on Saturday. I have never tried udon before so I ordered what my friend did, tempura shrimp udon. The shrimp was good, but I was not a fan of the udon at all. I took a taste of it and didn't touch it again. I was going to tell the waiter I did not like my meal but nobody ever came to check on our table and when he did come they brought the check. I kindly let him know that I did not like my food and his response was ""Okay?"" and proceeded to hand my the bill. I asked to speak with someone else and that man said ""You guys have been sitting here for 40 minutes you should have said something earlier, there is nothing we can do about it."" My and my friends decided to just take our loss and pay for the food we did not enjoy or eat and asked if they could split the bill 3 ways and they said no. It was a very bad first impression of a restaurant and a very irritating experience. I will not come back to this restaurant or refer it to anyone looking for this type of cuisine."
10/10/2017,20171010,5,4.28,"If you like udon, this place is a must try for you!! My group of 6 came on a Saturday night at 5pm and there were people waiting outside already! There's a paper you can put your name on at the front. We waited for only about 20 minutes, which wasn't bad at all! They have so many choices and I ordered the sea urchin cream udon with a side of green onions ($0.25). I also ordered the negitoro rice!The food comes out very quickly and it was so delicious!! The specialty udons like the sea urchin cream udon and the hot dragon udon don't allow you to add extra noodles. The other such as the curry udon, however, allowed it for $2 and I think it's worth it. I highly recommend getting the sea urchin udon! The taste isn't super strong but it's there and there was more sea urchin than I expected! The bowl was enough to make me full. The negitoro rice was delicious and the portion was perfect! It was tasty with all the sauces and I really enjoyed it with my udon! I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try! My friends and I loved it so much we tried to come the next day again! I will definitely be back when I'm in the area!! Come early to avoid the long wait :) but it does go by pretty quickly! The only downside is that the hostess in the front was rude and not very professional... but all the servers inside were so friendly!"
10/10/2017,20171010,5,4.28,"I have tried the Urchin Udon and Mentai Squid Butter - Love them foods. Their soup bases are very tasty and flavorful. I also have tried their baby octopus skewers. It's kinda expensive a bit because it's 2 dollars for one, but it's worth it. Last thing to remind new customers, don't come at lunch. This place is small and hot. People sit next together, very tight and out of air."
10/11/2017,20171011,4,4.28,"Udon made in house and you can see the entire process! While the wait here isn't long, for larger parties they are more difficult to seat. Make sure your whole party is present or they won't seat you! We ordered the seafood tomato udon, metai udon, and their most popular uni udon. All broths were on the dreamy end. The seafood tomato udon tasted exactly like the tomato pasta ones, with just a change in carbs. The metai udon was extremely flavorful and tasted like clam chowder. The shellfish taste was a bit strong for my liking. Lastly, the uni. While there are very small pieces of uni in the dish, it didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped for. The broth was extremely flavorful, and balanced the savory with a little bit of sweet. Udon noodles had a bounce to each bite."
10/11/2017,20171011,4,4.28,"I didn't try the signature cream noodle. Instead, I tried their summer special cold plum noodle. Surprisingly tasty and fresh."
10/11/2017,20171011,5,4.28,This is the bomb.com Best udon in town. Which was less line and actually could reserve a table cos I will do it every night. Thank for Beeing in my neighbor
10/12/2017,20171012,5,4.28,"5 star udon right here!!! We arrived on a Sunday night to find a 20 minute wait. Not too bad, considering Daikokuya down the street had a huge crowd outside. Little do these people know, delicious udon is just a store down! My two friends and I ordered 2 udon bowls to share, as well as a negitoro rice bowl (toro w/ rice). The negitoro came out first and it was a good appetizer to our dinner! The toro was delicious and we liked the sauces on top. For udon, we ordered the famous sea urchin/uni udon and the curry udon. After splitting the bowls, we dug in! The udon noodles here are SO CHEWY. I couldn't get enough of them. The uni cream sauce was creamy, had the perfect amount of uni it in, and was not fishy at all. The curry udon was super flavorful and had a spice kick to it. We were also sitting in front of the window where they make the udon, so dinner was definitely an experience! It was so fun and engaging to watch the chef flip, fold, and cut the udon dough. Service was great and I'm glad the wait wasn't too long! Come to SF please!!"
10/12/2017,20171012,2,4.28,"Came with great expectation but left with bitter taste in my mouth. Discovered Monzo after reading various Yelp reviews and frankly speaking, hype does not equal to the value nor the taste of the food. The noodle was decent and the appetizers were ok. I had much better Japanese noodles at other establishments. Don't let the line fool you and don't believe in the HYPE. Skip the line and go some where else and get your noodle on."
10/14/2017,20171014,5,4.28,"While traipsing through Little Tokyo, we were in a store and asked where to go for udon. The guy said, ""Monzo"" and off we went. After a minimal wait we were seated and the deliciousness began. We ordered the beef bowl. Now I have eaten my share of beef bowls but nothing compares to this one. The beef is perfectly seasoned accompanied by just the right amount of ginger over a bed of rice. Yum and yum. I then ordered the urchin udon. All I can say is comfort bowl. The sauce is creamy, the freshly made noodles are divine and the urchin...perfecto. Keep up the great dining experience."
10/14/2017,20171014,5,4.28,"if you want fresh ""homemade"" udon this a must do. sat at the ""bar"" & was able to watch them make the udon. many udon selections hot & cold. the appetizer selection was great. the tempura was light & tasty. will definitely return."
10/15/2017,20171015,5,4.28,Yes! A million times yes! I've had udon at quite a few locations and this one just blew me out of the water! I had the sea urchin Udon...and I couldn't believe how incredibly rich and fresh it all tasted! I love uni and getting to try it with their freshly made udon was so delicious I had to savor every bite. One of my favorite things about eating here was watching the cooks prepare the udon right in front of us while we ate. That's how you know it's truly fresh! Will be coming again to try more of their bowls.
10/15/2017,20171015,5,4.28,"I've been to Marugame Monzo a handful of times and had only tried three of their icons. It was by far, the best udon I had in LA, particular the Sea urchin [uni] udon. The creamy uni sauce over the udon reminds me of a fettuccine Alfredo sauce in how creamy it was over the noodles. The wait time could be quite some time between 30 minutes or longer if arriving during peak hours as they only open in the afternoon and again at night. The location is very small and can be quite hot inside due to the small indoor AC and fan."
10/15/2017,20171015,4,4.28,"Different types of udon dishes made me happy! I tried the carbonara udon which tasted wonderful! A little heavy but still loved it. Also tried their shrimp tempura udon, but will need to request it without tempura flakes inside the udon because it made it too oily. You can watch them make the udon noodles if you sit at the 'bar'. Quite entertaining when you're hungry and waiting for your food to come out."
10/16/2017,20171016,5,4.28,"I LOVE Marugame Monzo. Quick tip for people that don't want to wait... come a little before they open! There is definitely still a line... but its a little better. I've been to Marugame a few times and have never not have to wait. Their restaurant is really tiny and can seat mostly small parties. I love their udon.. especially the gratin udon. It's baked with cheese, an alfredo/creamy sauce, and you can decide to pay extra for seafood. It's freaking delicious. It's very filling and I have never finished it in one seating, but it's so delicious. I've also had the chance to have their uni udon (it reminds me a lot of the EMC uni pasta if you've ever had it), but it's mostly very creamy. Their hot dragon udon is also very yummy. It's a soup base and very savory -- not creamy compared to the other two udons I've recommend above. AND OH MY GOODNESS the fatty tuna bowl that you can add on for a few extra buck ($4 I believe) is absolutely phenomenal. I loved it!! Overall, I've never had anything like Marugame and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to try it out."
10/16/2017,20171016,4,4.28,"Wonderful handcrafted udon! While other places on 1st Street were lightly crowded for Thursday dinner, this place had a little wait, which was well worth it! You may want to include a few extras to fortify your bowl."
10/17/2017,20171017,4,4.28,"For a ramen place where it's all about table turnover, this place is exceptional at service! The wait was around an hour and we missed our name while taking a stroll around Little Tokyo. Nonetheless, the hostess went ahead and seated us next! THANK YOU!Their specialty here is super creamy ramen. It's a take that is quite different but exciting for your taste buds. I mean what's life living if you're doing the same damn thing everyday?I started with the tuna belly rice bowl as an appetizer. Hot damn that was INCREDIBLY YUMMY! I honestly wish they had a main course that was this. Ughhh...I'm salivating thinking about it right now. For the ramen course, I ordered the squid butter udon. Absolutely delicious. Enough said. Absolutely delicious."
10/22/2017,20171022,5,4.28,We took a quickie trip to LA this weekend and this was our very first stop.The sea urchin creamy udon here was uber creamy and uber delish! I'm back in the Bay Area but already craving it again.
10/22/2017,20171022,5,4.28,"This is probably the best udon I've ever had, that I might have to go directly to Japan to find a competitor. The noodles are extremely buttery and soft, the open kitchen and classy tables and bar (with a view of the open kitchen) create a certain ambience. The cheque was surprisingly small considering the dish! My boyfriend and I both got the Miso Carbonara Udon, a bacon-topped, super rich and creamy broth that had this perfect color and deep flavor without losing the consistency that makes it a great soup. The couple next to us had a rice bowl to accompany their udon bowl that was absolutely topped off with deep fried tempura-style vegetables that were thinly sliced. It seems like it was the size of the entire bowl plus 0.5 more! The bowl of udon itself was huge, making the portion seem smaller than a normal udon bowl would be, but it's super satisfying and fills you up. The chefs roll the noodles and prepare them right in front of you (if you sit at the open bar) and the noodles come right out to you incredibly quickly. On a Sunday afternoon, the line took around 25-30 minutes but since we took one walk around that huge block and got milk tea at a grand opening nearby, we (just) missed our call. Went right in and the name was the most recent one crossed off!Considered if it was worth waiting again, and waited the extra 30 minutes. So worth it. Definitely want to head back next time I'm in LA."
10/23/2017,20171023,4,4.28,"Everyone's obsessed with next door neighbor daikokoyu, but this place is just as good foodwise! Their udon is delicious, humongous and so well priced; plus they take card! Get ready to get your slurp on and make sure to use chopsticks unabashedly, half the deliciousness of a noodle bowl is in licking your lips and tasting the flavor of the broth. For an incredibly filling $7.50 bowl of udon, you really can't find a better deal anywhere in the heart of a major city. However, their service was a major peeve. The waiter brought us the wrong bill-twice! If I hadn't checked the bill, we would have been way overcharged. You really have to be very vigilant. That being said, the price and tastiness really did win me over, but I almost gave this place 3 stars for the awful service. Will see what happens next time, I'm choosing to believe the waiter may have been new!"
10/23/2017,20171023,5,4.28,"I'm obsessed with this place! It's unfortunate you cannot get extra noodles with any option, but it's not a deal breaker. The noodles are fresh and fun to watch being made! The dragon is my favorite!"
10/24/2017,20171024,4,4.28,"The time spent waiting to be seated was longer than the time actually eating HAHA. If you want to eat here be prepared to wait at least 45 minute. Even though the wait time was crazy, the food definitely made up for it. I got the uni udon and it sooo good. The udon noodles were unlike anything I've had before and the uni cream sauce was really yummy. The only complaint I have is that I wish there was more uni in the sauce but only because I loveeeee uni LOL. The staff were very accommodating; we asked to switch seats because the table we were at originally felt too cramped and they were super nice about the whole thing. Definitely coming back here!!"
10/25/2017,20171025,4,4.28,"The noodles here are fresh and I love the idea of watching them make it through the window, it somehow makes it feel more authentic (who knows if it is). I haven't ventured out to try the crazier udon broths here, but the traditional beef udon made me happy enough to return and eat it again and again.Was this place beaming with rarity and out of the world options? Probably not, but it's the best version of udon I've had in L.A., so four stars it is!Can you even go wrong with udon? Probably not."
10/25/2017,20171025,3,4.28,"We waited about an hour, but we also walked around Little Tokyo to kill time. I really like that they make the udon here fresh. You can see the guy making it in the window. I ordered the mentai squid butter udon. I didn't really like it as much. I thought the sauce would be creamier, but it was more watery. The bowl is really big, but it's not as much food as you think. They have unique flavors here. If I come again, I probably will try something else."
10/26/2017,20171026,5,4.28,Great!! The cream uni udon is as good as people say! Very innovative. The regular udon dishes are very traditional and the tastes are on par!
10/27/2017,20171027,4,4.28,"I love this place. Everything is fresh and tasty, and the noodle is made right in front of you. I've tried few things on the menu and I loved everything. The place is small and it gets packed very quickly so get there early."
10/27/2017,20171027,5,4.28,"MY FAVORITE NOODLE PLACE the wait is always long but it's worth the wait! If you like pasta&cheese, you won't regret ordering carbonara udon!"
10/28/2017,20171028,5,4.28,DELISH. We ordered the veggy udon and shared the huge thing. The broth was on point. Will definitely return
10/30/2017,20171030,5,4.29,"One of the best udons I've ever had (asides from my grandfather's udon, no doubt!).There is always a 20-40minutes wait during weekends and dinner time but at lunch time the wait is only 5 minutes and most of the time no wait!!!I am so lucky to work so close to Marugame Monzo, you can find me at least twice a week here specially now that the weather is getting colder.If you haven't tried it yet, I don't know what you have been doing all this time. You definitely will love it. They make their own noodles which are thick and chewy. I was raised in Peru where most kids grow up eating chicken noodle soup but I grew up eating Udon!Marugame Monzo serves udon very similar to the one my grandfather's used to cook. I just can't live without my Udon because it keeps me close to my ojiichan (grandfather) Thats why I love, love, love Marugame Monzo."
10/30/2017,20171030,4,4.29,"*** 3.5 stars ***Woke up this past Sunday with a huge craving for udon. We were leaving my friend's place in West LA for Fullerton, and with Little Tokyo on the way, I took to Yelp to find a spot. Marugame Monzo popped up as one of the first restaurants, and with 2,400+ reviews and a 4.5 star overall rating, I was convinced. This place seemed legit.Upon arrival at ~2pm, we were met with a 30-40 minute wait. We put our names down and decided to check out the stores nearby. This restaurant is located in a very popular area of Little Tokyo with lots of restaurants and shops to explore. Parking is a bit of a pain, but if you're feeling too lazy to search for street parking, there are plenty of lots.It wasn't long until we were seated. The wait list is definitely inflated and looks more intimidating than it actually is. Lots of no shows that put there name down and leave. The line jumped rapidly. We had looked at the menu while we were waiting and were ready to order.I was tempted by the uni udon (~$16.95), which would appear to be their most popular item, but it looked a little too creamy for me. All of their signature udons sounded creamy, and I wasn't in the mood. I'll have to come back to try them. Instead, I opted for their Beef Udon, priced around $12.95. The beef udon was pretty good, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little bit disappointed. Their noodles are made fresh onsite, and you can actually watch them making it, which is great, but the broth was a little underwhelming. The beef was good, but nothing I'd rave about. Perhaps I'm spoiled from my recent trip to Japan. It was good, but not as amazing as I'd expect given their reviews.This place is worth visiting and coming back to, but come in with level expectations. That being said, the menu is very unique, and the noodles are pretty good. I like that they make them fresh and you can watch. Prices are OK. Not the cheapest, but definitely won't break the bank. Service was great throughout. Go ahead and give this place a try."
10/30/2017,20171030,4,4.28,"I've been eyeing this place for about a year when I first discovered it while I was working nearby. I read that there was always a wait, so I never risked coming here during my lunch break. I eventually quit my job and time just passed by without me trying it.However, someone mentioned that they were going to come here and I suddenly remembered that I really wanted to try this place. We came here on a Sunday around 3:30 PM and had to wait about 30 minutes for a party of six, which wasn't too bad, considering this place isn't too big. I originally wanted to try the uni pasta because that's what seems to be the most popular, but someone told me not to since I don't really like uni. I ended up getting the Kakuni udon, which comes with fatty braised pork belly and green onions. When I initially saw the waiter come with the bowl, I was intimidated by the size because it looked huge, but when I actually saw the amount, it wasn't too bad. The broth was light, it wasn't too salty or plain and had a very nice flavor. There was a total of 3 braised pork belly pieces and were pretty big in size. It wasn't super soft where it would fall apart, but soft enough to bite without struggling to pull apart. The udons, like everyone said is made in house and it was quite soft. The only problem that I have with udon broth dishes is that the udon itself doesn't seem to have enough time to absorb the broth's flavor or something because when I just ate the udon, it didn't really carry the broth's flavor with it. I do plan on coming back since there were a handful that I still wanted to try. Parking:There is street parking, but I feel like you have to be really lucky to find one. I ended up parking at the Aiso Parking lot on Judge John Aiso Street. It's pretty much across Jist Cafe, if you know where that is. Entrance can be a bit hard to find though, so I just recommend driving slow. For a Sunday afternoon, there was plenty of space available. It is $1 for each hour for only 2 hours, but an additional $3 for the 3rd hour and $1.50 for every 15 minutes after. However, it's a $3 flat rate if you come after 5 PM!"
10/31/2017,20171031,5,4.29,"Holy smokes, please come to San Francisco. I got the uni udon and it was outright heavenly. The wait wasn't too bad on a Saturday night at 5PM, it took about 10-20 minutes. Service was friendly and food was DELICIOUS. Tasty, smooth, creamy, delicious."
11/2/2017,20171102,5,4.29,"Possibly the best udon I've had so far compared to all the ones I tried in my hometown NYC & in Japan itself. I love that they make the udon constantly fresh in front of you by the counter seating through a big glass-enclosed kitchen. You can truly taste the freshness in the noodles and what tops it off is that they cook it so perfectly to how I like it; chewy but yet not too el dente with some softness to it. My usual go to in NYC makes it slippery soft while the well-known establishment in Tokyo that had lines around the block in the morning was way too el dente for me. Marugame's was perfect.My partner had the mentai squid butter udon which is one of their most popular signature dish while being the uni and creamy lover that I am, of course I couldn't resist ordering the uni cream udon. While both were divine and oh so flavorful, the star of the dish to me was the uni cream... I can't stop thinking about it!"
11/2/2017,20171102,5,4.29,"In the heart of little Tokyo you'll find this delicious hotspot! Must try the Uni pasta, shrimp tempura, and the agadashi eggplant! They give generous portions of ramen and everything is fairly priced. I am definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu!"
11/2/2017,20171102,5,4.29,"The sea urchin ramen is the bomb! So good! It is a little too much for me to eat the whole thing so I shared with my husband, both of us liked it!"
11/3/2017,20171103,5,4.29,"Had the Vongole Udon which has clams. I'm a huge clam nut and usually enjoy Chinese style clam dishes. I was hoping that this dish would be flavorful and satisfy my clam cravings. For taste, I would give it a 6/10. It was good, but not great. If you'd like a light udon dish, you can def go with this one. It's not as rich and thick in broth as the others.Parking: street and local paid lots/ structuresAmbiance: small, crowded, high noise level, modern japanese interior and lightingStaff: incredibly friendly"
11/3/2017,20171103,5,4.29,"Def the best udon in Socal, can't go as far as saying it's the best udon ever tho. If your party is small enough, def sit at the bar where you can watch the chefs make the noodles fresh. They're so chewy and perfect. I also appreciate that they have vegetarian options here. I highly recommend this place for all noodle lovers!"
11/4/2017,20171104,4,4.29,"The freshly made udon was the point of coming. Texturally, the fresh noodle was smoother on the outside and chewier on the inside. Visually, the noodle was straighter and shed less fragments into the broth which resulted in a clearer soup. On all counts, I prefer fresh over mass-produced, machine-made refrigerated udon, but not by a spectacular advantage.The biggest plus of Monzo was that they treated the udon with respect. Not that the fresh udon tasted superior, but the added care taken to handle and present it. Udon was revered in this kitchen rather than given the lowly position it usually holds in most full menu restaurants where it is quickly heated and covered with as many condiments as possible (the same as I do at home).The wakame seaweed hot udon was my favorite where the big soft noodle was complemented by oil bursts from fried tempura batter. For added excitement, order the fun to eat tempura fried soft-boiled egg or the long and wide shrimp tempura. The shiso bukkake (stop laughing) cold udon was spicier and a better way to show off the fresh noodle. The signature creamy uni udon was rich and filling, but the udon was no longer the showcase ingredient because of the endless uni flavor with uni in the cream sauce and as a garnish. Must like both uni and cream, otherwise the dish becomes repetitive.Waiting for a table is common. Sunday evening had a 40-minute wait while a weekend lunch was 20 minutes."
11/4/2017,20171104,5,4.29,"I live in little Tokyo and I do wish I come here more than I have. It's a bit discouraging that there's always a line, but I do have to say, if you have never been, it's worth going and waiting in that line. I know everyone raves about the sea urchin udon, for me, it's not really about what broth or flavor I get because the texture of their udon is really the star of the show. I have to say that I always was more of a ramen girl, I always found ramen broth more flavor and you can always add more ingredients in. But after having udon here, I started to understand that I just never really had good udon, because the noodle itself should stand on its own, that's why traditional udon soup is always so simple. Anyway, I vote with two thumbs up!"
11/4/2017,20171104,5,4.29,"This place is a must!! The carbonara udon with mushroom is yummy, the uni udon is on point and good price.. but the vegetable udon didn't like it much.. everything with cream sauce a must order from here. They know how to make it goooodddd lol"
11/4/2017,20171104,5,4.29,Yes Yelp reviews are correct. Best Uni Udon I've had! The kind where you want to lick the bowl after...the mini bowls were so good. The negotoro is a must! My husband tried the mentai squid butter n he loved it. Price is reasonable...around 12.95 per bowl (Uni bowl was 16.95 but so worth it). The udon noodles are made right infront of you! There was a wait but I guess when food is that good the word spreads...will definitely come back!
11/4/2017,20171104,5,4.29,This place was so tasty. My body was very satisfied. We arrived around 7:40 on a Saturday. Wait was 1.5 hours and worth it. I had the gratin udon and my friend had the seafood urchin udon. The gratin udon was so cheesy and good. It's pretty heavy. My friends plate was very tasty. I will definitely get the seafood urchin udon next time. We shared the fried chicken appetizer and OMG so good! I will definitely be back.
11/5/2017,20171105,5,4.29,"This place had a bunch of people waiting outside to get in so I had to give it a try. It did not disappoint! I got the hot beef udon with an order of vegetable tempura on the side. The waiter recommended us to put the tempura in the udon and wait for it to dissolve, so good!!"
11/5/2017,20171105,4,4.29,"We ordered cream udon and regular udon .. Food was excellent but I had better one in NYC. Price is reasonable and it is not too expensive! If you stop by little Tokyo, come try!"
11/6/2017,20171106,5,4.29,"Had to update my review of this place because after having so much other uni pastas elsewhere, I've decided that marugame Monzo has the best. I find myself craving it all the time. and I think the price is actually justified. idk why I said in my last review it should be $9 lol.. kind of ridiculous of me."
11/6/2017,20171106,5,4.29,"Amazing. Seriously. Got the uni udon and it was perfect. Great favor the cream sauce still managed to be light yet full. If you have a sensitivity to heavy creams definitely stay away from anything with cream in it but if you don't, do it! The noodles are seriously so fresh and thick and amazing. They make them to order which is perfect."
11/7/2017,20171107,4,4.29,"This restaurant was on our list and when we went to Daikokuya ,we were surprised that this place was right next to each other. Both the places had a long line so we decided to go in which ever place calls us first. Luckily we got in marugame first. We got sea urchin cream udon and mentai squid butter udon. We also got a tempura soft boiled egg and kakiage. The Sea urchin udon was rich and creamy with sea urchin crumbs mixed in and salmon roe on top. The squid in the mentai squid udon was perfectly cooked and super tender. The best part of the mentai squid udon was the sauce, it was made with fish eggs, we never thought of making a sauce out of fish eggs, it was a genius idea that we are gonna try to recreate at home. Overall definitely a must visit."
11/7/2017,20171107,5,4.29,"Wow, the best udon noodle dish I ever had! It was worth the wait which was around 40 minutes. The udon was so soft and boy I don't know what they put in that broth but it was so creamy and good!!! The prices are reasonable and the only downfall is trying to find parking in the area. If you are in little Tokyo, you have to give this place a try!"
11/7/2017,20171107,5,4.29,Wait was rather long but the food was appropriately priced and can't beat the experience of the food and watching them make the noodles.
11/8/2017,20171108,5,4.29,"This was the best udon place I have ever been to in the United States, period. Their hand pulled noodles have the perfect consistency and texture; undo their broth is clear but deeply flavorful. There was a long wait on a Monday night but I'm glad I stuck around. This place is worth a trip even if you're far from Little Tokyo. If I'm ever back in LA, I'll come here again. Highly recommended!"
11/8/2017,20171108,5,4.29,Hands down the best udon you can buy at a restaraunt!
11/9/2017,20171109,4,4.29,"This place has been on my list of places to try for ages. AGES. So glad I finally had the change to try it out What I ate:- Uni udon: Hello, is that heaven? YES! If you love uni, if you love udon, this dish is for you. Rich, creamy, flavorful, this was so decadent. But not too rich. I was still able to finish it. Those udon noodles were soooooo tasty- Fried chicken: Really good appetizer. - Assorted tempura: Crispy, delicate, came out with a nice assortment of various root veggies, veggies, and a shrimpPros:- Udon! Can you beat freshly made noodles? - Staff was super friendly and on point- Menu had a nice assortment of udon. Really let the udon noodle shine- Beer and sake - Sitting at the bar, you can really see the magic happen. We were able to watch the guy cut some noodles. On the other side you can watch the cooks bring everything together- Fast serviceCons:- That wait though... ughhhhhh We went on a Friday night at 715ish, waiting a good hour in the cold for ramen. I'm old! I know this because I never want to wait that long for food again- Small restaurant. Not the best place to go with ninety friends- No reservations. First come, first serve, and everyone in your party must be present to be seatedWould I come again? If I have to wait longer than 15mins, probably not."
11/9/2017,20171109,5,4.29,"This place is amazing. Came here on a friend's recommendation and loved it. The wait wasn't too bad. Got there around 7:30pm and waited 15-20 mins for a seat at the bar. We got a front and center view of the noodle making. It was spectacular and mesmerizing. I'm sure we made the noodle maker guy awkward by staring so hard but it was so impressive to watch! Friend got the sea urchin udon in cream sauce, which is their signature dish. I got the tomato cream sauce udon with mixed seafood (scallops and shrimp). Mine was way better! The acid of the tomatoes was needed to cut the fatty cream. My friend kept eating out of my bowl instead of his! It reminded me of a vodka sauce for pasta, but better! The service was excellent. They are really attentive and fill up your water constantly. I liked the ambiance and simple decor of this place. The udon was just amazing and I'm definitely coming back soon!"
11/10/2017,20171110,5,4.29,"Street metered parking can be hard. There is usually a wait because the restaurant is tiny. But the  Udon is freshly made and service is good. My favorite is the mushroom cream udon, around $13 or the carbonara udon. I'm a creamy udon kind of gal. I also love their pork belly bowl! LOVE. If you get an udon, a mini side bowl is only $3."
11/13/2017,20171113,4,4.29,"My party got the sea urchin udon and the and the mentai squid udon. The noodles are so good since they are made fresh. The sea urchin udon is a bit on the heavier side since it's creamy and the mentai squid udon is more of a butter broth. The wait is pretty long, took about 1 hr to get seated but the food came out pretty quick."
11/15/2017,20171115,5,4.29,"This tiny restaurant in Little Tokyo, only a few doors down from Daikokuya, doesn't look like much from the outside, but produces what was easily the best udon I've had the pleasure of eating. The noodles are made fresh and put most of what I'd had previously to shame. At the strong insistence of a friend, I tried the best Monzo has to offer, which is apparently their Uni Udon. Typically not a fan of dairy or cream-based dishes, I had my reservations, but I was blown away by how rich and delicious the dish was without being heavy. I noticed some complaints in other reviews about the amount of actual uni in the dish, but I had 4-5 large pieces in mine, so no issues here!If at all possible, try to grab a seat facing the window so you can watch the magic happen as they make the noodles before your eyes! There always seems to be a wait during peak times, but it's totally worth it."
11/16/2017,20171116,5,4.29,"This is the smallest and probably the busiest restaurant in Little Tokyo. I always say I'll order something new, but I can't seem to not order their uni (sea urchin) udon. It's so creamy and well made that if I was to imagine how uni udon should be done, this would be it. Their noodles are made fresh, the pieces of uni in the dish are amazing, and it's pleasantly presented. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I occasionally dream about the dish.I did try their takoyaki the other day, which was also good. But this is a more classic dish that doesn't necessarily make the restaurant any more special than the next Japanese restaurant in the area. Regardless, I'd recommend coming here.Be aware of the long waits if you choose a popular time. :)"
11/17/2017,20171117,5,4.29,"Came here a few times, always packed with people and good food.I see how it can get very crowded and busy during dinner and lunch times, but if you come as soon as they open, you'll be served right away. I came right after they opened at 11:30 and boy I was done eating by 12. I ordered the Carbonara udon, it is SO creamy and full of flavor. I totally recommend, as well as their tempura egg. Service is great, servers are very nice and attentive, food came out fast and belly was very happy."
11/17/2017,20171117,5,4.29,"This place is fantastic! Udon made on premise. My first time here. My friend and I ordered 3 Udon dishes to share, in this order:- Duck Nanban Udon- Uni (Sea Urchin) Cream Udon- Mad Tiger Cold UdonThe flavors were right on. The duck udon was full of subtle nuances and extremely flavorful. Very unexpected from a clear broth. Takes a lot of skills and efforts to achieve a simple broth with complex flavor. The Uni udon was just heaven, rich, decadent, and full of the salty and sweet uni flavor that I love. The Mad Tiger cold udon was a perfect finish. The soft boiled egg, along with bonito flakes, negi, and thinly cut nori blend together perfectly with the cold soba broth. A great finish.Highly recommended. Do expect a wait as this place is very popular."
11/19/2017,20171119,5,4.29,"We came here on a Sunday night at 6pm for a table of 2 and the wait was approximately 1 hour. It wasn't too bad of a wait since you're able to walk around Little Tokyo and explore while waiting. We walked around for 30 minutes and had Honeymee to kill time. When we walked back, we only waited about 10 minutes before we were seated.They make the udon fresh here and if you're seated at the bar, you're able to see them roll it and make it which is really cool. I ordered the sea urchin udon and my bf got the duck udon. Both were very tasty. The sea urchin udon is more creamy and the broth was very flavorful. My bf turned out to like eating mine more than his. The duck in his udon was very tender and good. I highly recommend trying this place if you're in the mood for udon."
11/19/2017,20171119,4,4.29,Was highly recommended by my friends so I decided to make a trip to LA. Wait wasn't too bad for a table for 2. It took about 20 minutes. There's garage parking down the street for hourly parking which wasn't badUdons:They make fresh udons right in front of you! Great experience. We ordered the Beef Udon and the Miso Carbonara Udon and mini pork belly rice bowl. Food comes pretty quick! Beef Udon- Udon texture was made to perfection!  Enough chewiness and the broth was very flavorful. Miso Carbonara Udon- Udon in a creamy miso egg yolk sauce.  Topped with pieces of bacon. Mini pork belly Rice bowl- simple and enough to share for two just to try.  They added sesame sauce to the green onion topping which gave it a great flavor.
11/19/2017,20171119,5,4.29,"A place where udon is the star is definitely a must try for us! If you don't mind the line, it's worth it. Here's a tip-- put your name down for a table there AND Daikokuya and see which one calls you first. Either way, you won't be disappointed. This place is hands down the best udon in Little Tokyo!"
11/20/2017,20171120,4,4.29,"Sat at the bar, right where they make the udon made to order. Got here at 4:45pm on a Monday and there were a few people waiting already. By the time we finished dinner, the place was packed!Ordered carbonara udon, uni udon, and crispy chicken skin. Overall, the dishes weren't anything to write home about, but you can taste how fresh the udon was."
11/20/2017,20171120,4,4.29,"Second time eating here. Last time I had uni udon and the squid udon. I love the uni udon, but this time I just needed a light meal...and the squid udon was perfect for that. The squid was very soft and the dish itself is very clean tasting. I forgot to order the chicken skin. The chicken skin has been on my list since eating there a couple years ago. Now the fatty tuna bowl is on my list. My girl didn't enjoy here vegetarian udon bowl, so it could be hit or miss for vegetarians. The wait was 45min for Sunday night, but we usually walk around or buy other snacks nearby to kill time."
11/21/2017,20171121,4,4.29,"I always enjoy eating the Udon here, but the location itself is horrible if you're lugging around a baby. Parking is hard to find, the wait time is horrendous, and the restaurant is hot, muggy, and cramped. Imagine eating a hot soup while sweating through your boxers. Not a pretty picture aye? Regardless, the quality of the udon here is awesome and I really enjoy their Ume udon and mixed mushroom udon.4 stars."
11/21/2017,20171121,2,4.29,"Here's the scoop. I don't understand how you can advertise ""sanuki"" udon if you aren't even serving sanuki udon noodles. They are supposed to be firm and chewy, not soft and mushy. You can get the same quality noodles from the frozen foods section of Marukai. 2 stars because you can't really go wrong with flavors like uni cream and mentaiko cream, etc., but not worth the wait."
11/22/2017,20171122,4,4.29,"Long long waits for in house noodles. They make their own udon like noodles in house so they are super fresh and delightful. I ordered their noodles with the squid and mentaiko. The broth was super flavorful and infused a good amount of fishy flavor due to the mentaiko(cod roe). The squid was delicious and it was a great meal. My friend and I also shared the appetizer of clams, which I also recommend. There was a good amount and was cooked well. The only downside is the long waits which is a high deterrent."
11/24/2017,20171124,5,4.29,"I don't remember how many time that I have been here, each time the Udon and the rice bowl are super good, tried hot dipping Udon, love it! And the beef bowl, yummy! Will come back sometime soon when I m in the area!"
11/26/2017,20171126,4,4.29,"Marguame Monzo always has a ridiculous wait, but for good reason. The udon here is made on site and has a nice, chewy consistency. There's also a wide variety of options that almost becomes overwhelming-- hot or cold, soup or dry, they have it all. My favorites are the Nagasaki champon and the Mad Tiger. With its seafood and pork based broth, the champon is the ultimate comfort food-- the broth is warm, comforting and flavorful, reminiscent of home cooking. The Mad Tiger is a dry cold udon topped with spicy pork (actually quite spicy!) with a tsuyu-based dipping sauce that keeps it light, making it perfect for a hot summer day. I also sampled the super famous squid butter udon, and while it was quite good and less creamy than most places, it was still a bit too rich for me to finish a whole bowl on my own. The one slightly annoying thing is that they don't take down phone numbers to call you when it's your turn, but its location in Little Tokyo allows you to explore while waiting without venturing too far (Wolf and Crane is a bar that's less 10 min walk away), so it's quite easy to put down your name and hang out while waiting. Overall, a super solid spot in Little Tokyo for lunch or dinner."
11/27/2017,20171127,5,4.29,"This place specializes in Udon, and they specialize in it extremely well. The udon-making process can be clearly seen, and it's a great way to spend your time while you wait for your food to come. My current favorite is the Miso Carbonara Udon. It has no broth, but it is mixed with the same ingredients as you would expect from a traditional Spaghetti Carbonara, except they add a little bit of Miso to spice things up even more. I've also tried the Beef Udon, and the Curry Udon and were impressed with both as well; my friends have also tried the Pork Belly Udon, which they loved, especially the thick cuts of pork belly. The mini rice bowls here are also incredible, I've tried the pork belly, beef, and negitoro rice bowls and they are all unbelievably delicious. It's a must have to accompany your beautiful bowl of udon. Despite all this, the wait is pretty ridiculous, albeit quite worth it. Service is also good. Definitely give it a shot if you're ever in Little Tokyo!"
11/28/2017,20171128,3,4.29,"I've heard a lot of hype about this place, so I came hungry and prepared to eat some of the best Udon LA has to offer. I was however a bit disappointed not only about the food, but about the absolutely insane line up to get in. We came here on a Saturday evening and after we put our names down, it took about an hour to be seated. There was a line up out the door and it didn't seem like it was ever moving. Also be warned if you aren't there when your name is called or if your complete party is not there when your name is called, be prepared to be skipped or wait even longer.We ordered A LOT of food for two people. Beef Tataki, Squid Butter Udon, Uni Udon, Cold Udon and a few of the select Tempura items including the egg. The Beef Tataki was alright, but super heavy on the pepper corns. The Udon was alright as well, but I felt it was super heavy on the broth to the point where it was too thick for me. The cold Udon was a different take on the dish, but the flavors were a bit bland for me. I was super excited about the tempura egg after reading and watching reviews on that, but alas mine was overcooked and had no gooey insides.I hate to be ""that dude that is picky af about food"", but I had high expectations for this place. Considering the wait and the location, I think there are better options. I did like the price though, everything on the menu seemed fairly priced even down to the alcohol, so the place makes for a good cheap date night. That is unless your date hates waiting...in that case you might not be able to score a second one."
11/28/2017,20171128,5,4.29,"One of my favorite restaurants in LA. There's always a wait, but it's never been too bad (30-45mins), so just put your name down and walk around Little Tokyo for a bit! I really like the Sea Urchin Udon! I've had the Mushroom Cream Udon which is similar and also good, and the Miso Carbonara, but I thought the Carbonara was too heavy for my taste. They definitely try to rush you a little here, but it's understandable given the constant popularity. If you don't order the Signature Udon, you can double the noodle amount for only $2! The first time I had this, I fell in love, but the second time, it was still good but not AMAZING. So this truly is a 4.5, but 5 for the memory."
11/28/2017,20171128,5,4.29,"Really enjoyed my mushroom cream udon soup today. I loved the texture of the udon - the right kind of chewy and softness. The soup was much creamier than I expected (reminded me of a can of Campbell's cream of mushroom) but I still enjoyed it and slurped away.I also tried the kakiake(?) - a tempura tower of carrots/pumpkin(?)/onions/shrimp. It was tasty, but a beast to pull apart. I probably wouldn't get this again unless I was sharing it with 2-3 people. The wait for lunch on Tuesday was less than 10 minutes for a table for 2. Street parking is a a tough one, though, so just try for a lot to save time."
11/28/2017,20171128,5,4.29,"I can't believe I never reviewed Marugame Monzo. It's the best udon I've ever had in my life. Also I always prefer ramen over udon, but my friend insisted we go to this udon place. I'm convinced this is the best udon place that Los Angeles has to offer. The udon are made fresh on site daily, and the mentai udon is amazing. I tasted the broth before I added my usual chili to it. It was amazing! I highly recommend getting the mentai squid udon."
11/28/2017,20171128,5,4.29,"Amazing food experience. I've never had traditional housemade udon before and the difference compared to all others I've tried is astounding. Wonderful ingredients and I loved the taste of my vegetarian mushroom cream udon. There are two main vegetarian udon options.Wait was 1.5 hours for 6 of us at about 7pm on a Friday night. Plenty things to see and explore in Little Tokyo, cute village area across the street."
11/30/2017,20171130,5,4.29,"I don't even know where to begin. This place has given me one of the best experiences with food! It is delicious and the food is so unique, unlike anything I've ever had! We got the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and Sea Urchin Cream Udon. All in all, this place is worth going to! GOODS:-the food is QUALITY: super delicious and flavorful, and ingredients taste fresh-The Mentai Squid Butter Udon had really strong butter flavors, and was pretty salty; the broth seems condensed, but goes so well with the udon noodles-The Sea Urchin Udon was very creamy and coated the noodles so nicely; it wasn't as salty as the Mentai Squid Butter udon; definitely try if you like Uni-They handmake their udon noodles; you can sit at the bar for a show (udon making)! -Love how they focus on their speciality dishes; hard to find the same dishes anywhere else, at least at the same quality -Customer service is pretty fastNOT-SO-GOODS:-the lines can get pretty ridiculous-space can be tight; very small, almost touching the people sitting at the tables next to you-since space is so small and tight, it can get loud here and conversations can get lost -mostly seafood dishes, so not the best place for a seafood-hater"
11/30/2017,20171130,4,4.29,"This is a long overdue review for my fave udon place. Funny story, I was first introduced to Marugame by one of my previous CMB (Coffee Meets Bagel) dates and even though things didn't go anywhere with him, I was so happy to be able to find a spot where the noodles will always be chewy and fresh to my liking, even it means me having to drive an hour to LA to get it. I've tried a majority of the udons, ranging from the popular mentai squid butter udon & uni udon to curry to duck nanban to miso carbonara to the simple beef udon. I usually add a soft-boiled tempura egg in my udon but you can do without. I've also had a fair share of the appetizers such as the calamari and beef tataki. You can't go wrong with ordering any of the items on the menu; aside from the food, I really enjoy getting a front row view of the chefs making the udon. It's actually quite mesmerizing. Most of their dishes are dairy/cream-based so if you're lactose intolerant, be sure to take something beforehand! Also, you should always expect a wait so you should probably not come if you're already hangry."
11/30/2017,20171130,5,4.29,This place is so good I am hesitant to let the secret out. Great food and staff. The manager is always up front and greets everyone.
12/2/2017,20171202,5,4.29,"Everything tasted amazing! A bit of a wait for table as expected but service was quick :)Had duck udon which was clean, light and simply delicious!Bf had curry udon and beef with rice which were both well seasoned."
12/3/2017,20171203,4,4.29,"This place was good. My favorite dish is the sea urchin creamy udon. It was balanced just right and went down to my stomach very well. I also like the lunch special for the tuna rice bowl. You can actually eat that and the udon without being overstuffed.The other time, I had the cheese gratin udon and that was delicious. However, it was too cheesy and filling. I could barely finish it. The cheese was too strong and just too thick. I don't recommend unless you really really really like cheese.Other than thought, this is a good Japanese restaurant for udon. I recommend this place."
12/5/2017,20171205,5,4.29,"Yeah sure, you could hit Sawtelle and pay $4 for a decent udon or you could make the drive to Little Tokyo and pay $12 for a great udon.Their Monzo salad dressing is amazing. No idea at all whats in it but if they ever start selling it Im first in line.My friend & i were about to get 2 of the same udon- our server suggested that we do a double order for $2 more. We did it, they saved us $13. Super thoughtful service."
12/6/2017,20171206,4,4.29,"This place has been super popular lately. Located in Little Tokyo, Marugame Monzo is well known for their udon with uni cream broth. They handmake their thick and chewy noodles, and the broth is so creamy and rich - I'd highly recommend trying it! That itself deserves 5 stars. I also tried the beef tataki but I wasn't a fan of it - too heavy on the pepper, sliced too thick and not tender enough. I would just stick to the udon. The wait is long and lines out the door, so be prepared to wait, or come at off-meal times. Go inside and put your name down on the waiting list and you can probably expect to wait at least an hour. The front door and signage is a little obscure, so it may be hard to find for first timers, but just look next door to Daikokuya Ramen and you'll find it."
12/7/2017,20171207,5,4.29,"Been looking for some sort of sea urchin noodle/pasta dish? This place does not disappoint! I love uni so obviously, when I see reviews all raving about the sea urchin cream udon, I definitely needed to come here. I've ordered this dish every single time I come. It's quite rich and creamy. I love my uni raw but the uni is cooked in this dish. I need to order something new but it's difficult since this creamy udon dish is so good.. Luckily, my husband likes to try different dishes and he likes to share with me so I get to try different dishes that way. I also like their negitoro bowl. It's pretty small so I wouldn't order that alone. I've brought friends who are vegetarian. I recommend the mushroom cream udon. It's also rich in flavor and tasty. The wait varies depending on when you come. Luckily I've been on a Friday and a Saturday night when the wait was between 5-15 minutes. But I have came on one Friday night where the wait was over an hour. It depends on the weekend and the time you come. Since the location is in Little Tokyo, there's meter parking, which can be hard to find. However, there's a nearby parking lot just down the street that's only $3 flat after 5:00pm!"
12/7/2017,20171207,5,4.29,"It makes me angry how good the udon here is, entirely because I don't live in LA anymore and I won't get to die of food happiness anytime soon.The wait here is no joke. You might think you're being clever coming early/late/in a small group, but guess what -- everyone else had the same idea too. I waited over an hour at 2pm. 2PM! GO HOME SO I CAN EAT. PLEASE.The noodles here are so fantastically chewy, I still dream about them. I got the signature carbonara udon -- a questionable choice for sure, but it was really quite tasty. The broth was heavy and cheesy, and I don't think I'd get it again unless I were absolutely starving, but I was super satisfied when I finally finished and rolled out of the restaurant. Will probably stick to one of the lighter, non-creamy broths next time :)"
12/7/2017,20171207,4,4.29,Our family enjoyed a great meal in Little Tokyo are of Los Angeles at this restaurant. The udon (not ramen) and all the ingredients were all fresh and tasty. The combinations of flavors were unique. The broth was flavorful but not salty. We were all happy with our choices. They do not take reservations and the wait on a Saturday afternoon (We put our name on the waiting list at around 1:30PM and we were seated around 2:30PM). We would return to this restaurant the next time we are in the area.
12/8/2017,20171208,5,4.29,"This is my all time favorite place for Uni Udon. The Udon is fresh and the Uni sauce is so creamy and delicious!!! The wait can be a bit long but it is so worth the drive and wait.Here's a tip: Normally, if the wait is long I just go two or three doors down and have a drink at the Far East Bar by the time I'm done with my drink the wait is over."
12/8/2017,20171208,5,4.29,"Sigh. When I had to move from LA, I was so bummed that I couldn't take Marugame Monzo. I don't even like udon that much, but I LOVE Marugame Monzo. I highly recommend the miso carbonara udon, mental squid butter udon, and the sea urchin udon. If you come during lunchtime, I recommend upgrading your meal by adding a mini rice bowl with your udon. The negitoro bowl is THE BEST I EVER HAD. Please, if you're reading this, go to Marugame Monzo -- on my behalf! I miss this place dearly."
12/8/2017,20171208,4,4.29,The service was wonderful always love going here but I ordered pasta. Prices were great and inexpensive.
12/10/2017,20171210,5,4.29,"I've always heard about how amazing this place was and I finally had the time to try it when I was in Little Tokyo. I was actually surprised that the wait wasn't long. I think I waited at max 15 minutes. The tables inside are all so close to each other so it may feel a little more intimate with your party and other parties around you. There were so many udons that I wanted to try because they all looked so good. I decided to go with the miso carbonara which is a creamy udon topped with bacon and my friend got the creamy sea urchin. The creamy soup is quite thick but it's filled with so much flavor. It wasn't like any udon I've ever tasted before. It's definitely something worth trying. If you're not a big fan of thick flavored soup, then I would recommend getting one of the hot udons which comes with the broth instead of cream base. Overall, the service here was amazing. They were always tentative and checked up on us every so often. This place is definitely 10/10."
12/10/2017,20171210,5,4.29,"I LOVE this place! I always say I'll try something new on the menu but I cannot pull myself away from the uni udon - it is so delicious that I always drink every single drop of the sauce. I also like the chicken karaage, it is lightly fried and is not oily. The wait time is quite crazy (around 1hr), but it is completely worth it."
12/11/2017,20171211,5,4.29,"While our family is typically into Japanese Ramen Noodle Houses, we saw how many people were raving about this well known Udon Spot in DTLA. We arrived around 3:30pm Saturday and we still had a 30+ minute wait as there were 3 parties of 3+ ahead of us.MM's dining room only seats maybe 30 diners including the Udon bar on the kitchen's perimeter. All seating are tables for two which they move about the dining room and join together to accommodate parties larger than 2.We ordered the a mushroom cream Udon, a beef Udon, a tempura chicken Udon, & a Vegetarian Udon. Also had a mixed shrimp & vegetable tempura appetizer, and a pork belly rice bowl as pre-Udon appetizers. All 4 we're finished, no complaints, all Udon varieties were tasty, hot, and most of delicious. Lots of different kinds of Udon were available. The soups averaged between $12-$14/bowl. Restrooms were clean, all staff we encountered were pleasant, and we didn't feel like the staff were trying to push us out quickly, despite knowing there were tons of people on their waiting list. We probably would opt for a Ramen spot if we were to do it again, no knock on MM, but it's just personal preference. Based on the dining room activity we encountered that Saturday, they're doing very well."
12/11/2017,20171211,3,4.29,"I recently came here for the second time and sadly, I was not nearly as impressed as I was the first time.The first time I came, I tried the Mentai Squid Butter udon and the Sea Urchin Cream udon. Both were fantastic - great udon texture with creamy and rich sauces. But a couple of days ago, my the udon from my second visit wasn't nearly as good in texture as the ones from my first visit. I got the Shrimp Tempura Udon this time which is a hot udon in broth with tempura on the side. My udon was over cooked! The noodles were too soft and didn't have a slight chew that it had the first time... the shrimp tempura was very good though. It was a very light yellow batter that wasn't over fried so the shrimp stayed moist and was cooked just right in the middle. I got a side of fish cake tempura - would not recommend. The tempura was kind of chalky in texture. Not sure if that's from being fried or if that's just the type of fish cake they make :/My boyfriend got the Mentai Cream Udon. The texture was better on this one and the cream wasn't overly heavy. It comes with little shrimp and bay scallops. Bay scallops were a little hard (over cooked)... I honestly don't know if this was just a one time experience... maybe one day I'll give it a third try and make an updated decision!"
12/11/2017,20171211,5,4.29,"I told my friend, Don ""U-DON better try this place! Right now!"" Just kidding...I don't have a friend named Don, but if I did...you bet I would! In fact, I've been telling all of my friends to try this place ever since I went. And to invite me because I wanna go back again and again and again :) [ [ s e r v i c e ] ]Considering that this place is so small, they were extremely fast in getting us seated! I was impressed with their turnover rate. And while I was eating, not once did I feel rushed to finished. The service here was great. I have nothing to complain about![ [ u d o n ] ]Alright, before I get into each dish...I just have to point out their udon is made freshly and in house. In fact, if you get a bar seat, you can watch them make batch after batch of udon. It's insane how fast they make it. And you're probably thinking, cool Ashley...it's fresh but you probably can't even taste the difference. It's all about the broth. That's when I tell you that you are 100% wrong. I can't even explain how mind blown I was by how delicious the udon itself was. It like melts in your mouth because it has that perfect texture of being chewy, yet soft. Call me crazy, but you just need to try it for yourself!- - sea urchin cream udon - -I've been SEA URCHIN for the perfect sea urchin dish and I think this is it! It's not too over powering with it's flavor. It pairs really well with the creamy soup so that there's just enough of the sea urchin to taste it, while still getting a perfectly sweet cream soup base. I highly recommend it!! (if you like sea urchin, I know it's not for everyone)- - miso carbonara udon - -So I didn't actually try this for myself, but my friend told me that this was DELICIOUS! She had been here before and told me that everything she's tried here has been nothing less than delicious. I'll have to try it for myself next time (and update you all about the whole menu as I go through them all) [ [ d r i n k s ] ]- - ginga morgen beer - -I don't usually write about drinks but this beer was really good! It's very light and was just a great refresher to have along with my udon. I've never seen this brand of beer at other places, so I'll have to keep my eye out for it because wow! I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth it was![ [ p a r k i n g ] ]Because when is this not asked about if you're going to a place in DTLA?! So right across the street from the restaurant, there's public parking at a little shopping center (it was like $11 when we went). I mean obviously if you find street parking then I applaud you and your luck because those spots are gold. It's in Little Tokyo and there's a bunch of little shops and other restaurants around that area. Considering how much I just salivated as I wrote this review, I am definitely going to have to come back! There's no doubt about it. I've had this place bookmarked for so long and can't believe it took me this long to try it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
12/11/2017,20171211,4,4.29,"Great noodles. They make them on the premises, and if you are lucky, you can grab a seat at the noodle bar and watch. The 4 of us tried different dishes: Hot sansai udon, cold sansai udon, tiger udon and tempura soft eggs. All were delicious. I just wish the noodle portions were larger.Service was polite and efficient.We will definitely eat here again."
12/11/2017,20171211,1,4.29,"I FOUND a piece of SHORT WHITE HAIR in my hot dragon udon! A waiter happened to be right next to me when I made this discovery and had the audacity to ask right away if it was mine?! (No it was not! And very rude.)She then proceeded to immediately take my udon without saying anything at all. I was left sitting there with no udon for a good 15 minutes with no idea what was going on. Finally a different waiter came to ask what was wrong and ordered another udon for me which I had to wait another 10mins for. All in all, their service is pretty UNPROFESSIONAL and slow considering how they handled this situation. There was no apologizes made and they were too quick to blame the customer. I am very disappointed to have been treated like this especially after having to wait 1+ hours to come in."
12/11/2017,20171211,5,4.29,"One of my favorite restaurants in DTLA! Almost everything I've had here is spot-on; the udon and rice bowls never disappoint. From rich cream-based udon to traditional broth-based udon, this spot is perfect to warm you up in December. Here are some of my faves:Mentai squid butter udon 5/5: Buttery and full of flavor but not too fishy! Plenty of squid roe and lots of tender squid. Great if you want something rich but still broth-based.Seafood tomato cream udon 5/5: Rich, creamy, incredible flavor. I get this when I want seafood and not the squid butter but something a bit richer. Comes with plenty of fish roe, baby scallops, and shrimp.Vongole udon 5/5: Comes with lots of clams and has a full-bodied clam flavor. For seafood fanatics only. Champon udon 5/5: I don't remember what usual champon tastes like, but there's a delicious smokiness to this dish (and smells really amazing). Full of healthy veggies and shrimp and baby scallops. Uni cream udon 4/5: Their most famous dish, but this one didn't wow me. Not very much uni and a bit too subtle for me (I'm an uni fanatic), but probably great for those a bit more tentative to try something that sounds so fishy!Duck udon 2.5/5: Although the duck was tender, the udon seemed a bit overcooked and the broth bland. Meh. Rice bowls:All of the ones I tried were amazing! I love the negitoro (fun!), pork belly (w/sesame oil and reminiscent of kbbq), and beef bowl (think yoshinoya but much better). I will try more!Thanks for being a great LA staple! We love you!!!!"
12/13/2017,20171213,2,4.29,"My bf and I dined here last night around 7PM, thankfully there was no wait and we were seated immediately at the bar. I can be pretty indecisive when it comes to ordering; in this case, I wasn't sure if I wanted to stick to a specialty fusion udon or the traditional. We ordered the miso carbonara and the uni. Both were too heavy for my taste that I almost felt sick and queasy afterwards. We sat for a few minutes after eating our dishes and were both thinking the same thing-- ""That's it??"" Both still hungry and underwhelmed. We then decided to order the cold beef bukkake udon to share, which tasted much better. I finally learned my lesson to stick to traditional udon and no more of the fusion bull. The noodles portions also have to be a joke, especially for the price you're paying. We paid a total of $54 including a 20% tip for 3 udon dishes. Ridiculous if you ask me. You can get cheaper udon that tastes pretty much the same @ Marugame on Sawtelle. The only pro from this whole experience is how quickly the food came out; we probably waited less than 5 minutes for our dishes to come out. Also, since we sat at the bar, we were able to see the noodles being made. This place is overhyped for sure."
12/14/2017,20171214,5,4.29,Worth the wait! The udon is full of flavor. They give a very generous portion. I definitely left satisfied and happy :).
12/16/2017,20171216,5,4.29,"If you love udon (or if you have a liking towards it), you'll want to visit Marugame Monzo. My friend and I sat right in front of the window where you're able to watch the guys roll out and cut fresh noodles. It was such a sight to see -- so entertaining and meticulously done, but at a fast speed cause there are noodles to be made here people! I had the curry udon and my friend ordered the mentai squid ink udon. Both were really yummy, satisfying and filled us up. I would say that I did feel the need to eat and go since there is always a line/waitlist to adhere to. The udon here is quality made -- they put a lot of TLC in their dishes and the flavors come out amazing. I've been meaning to go back, but I just don't like waiting for a spot if its just me and usually if I were to suggest places to someone who wasn't dying to eat there, they could get antsy on the wait time and move onto somewhere else. Gotta go with the right people to some places. You won't be disappointed if you eat here though. I've never had such fresh udon prepared right before my eyes."
12/16/2017,20171216,5,4.29,"This restaurant is located in little Tokyo right next to Kaikokuya. You can park in the little Tokyo structure if you can't find parking on the street. So I'm going to be honest, before I tried this place I had no interest in udon what so ever. But I was intrigued with this restaurant for its glowing reviews and because I had read that they do make their own udon. There is a portion of the restaurant where you can sit and you can actually watch the chefs make the udon from scratch! Unfortunately I made my reservation too late so I wasn't able to get a table close to where they make the udon. Call and reserve in advance if you want those seats. Their udon is not really soup based. I would say that it's more of a creamier base than soupy. On top of their udon being cooked perfectly, their cream is jam packed with flavor! I have never eaten any udon like it. Good amount of portions and I feel like you get a little of the Japanese taste. I don't know if I added anything new to the previous reviews but I really just wanted to show my love to this wonderful restaurant! I can't wait to come back!"
12/17/2017,20171217,1,4.29,"I was excited to finally dine at Marugame Monzo with some of my friends that flew in that I haven't seen in a long time. The line was not that long of a wait during prime hours for dinner. I had the Carbonara Udon. Everything was good, but unfortunately I got a bad case of food poisoning shortely after. Had a tough weekend while hosting my friends in LA. However, I will say that my udon tasted good and was a unique dish haha.    1 / 5 Stars"
12/20/2017,20171220,5,4.29,"This is my third time here and I am never disappointed. I love that they make the udon fresh. My friends and I came around 4:40pm since it opens at 5pm for dinner and there was already a small line forming outside the door. This time I tried the mad tiger udon, which is a cold noodle topped with ground pork, green onions, bonito flakes, soft boiled egg, and chives. This udon is spicy but not overwhelmingly hot. You get the sauce on the side, it tasted like a light soy sauce. Not really sure what it was. But it was good! I also tried the takoyaki. It was good but it wasn't special. I've had better ones.My friends tried the carbonara and curry udon. The carbonara was creamy and tasty. The curry was really thick. My friend said half way done it was too much for her. At first the portion looks small but the bowl is actually huge and makes it look like a small portion but you'll get full. For the cold and hot udon you can double the portion for $2."
12/20/2017,20171220,5,4.29,"Needless to say best udon in Downtown LA. The uni was great but if you're looking for a light option the vegetable udon was equally delicious thanks to the amazing broth. Negitoro wrap was bomb, so was the tempura. Definitely long lines on the weekends and hard to find parking. Saturday and Sundays they do stay open the whole day so pick your lucky slot!"
12/20/2017,20171220,5,4.29,"I got the Kakuni braised pork udon with extra noodle and girllllllllll I was so stuffed full of goodness and the pork was melting in my mouth. My sister got the Kamaaga dipping udon and it was soooo great as well. My dad got the duck udon that was alright and my mom got the hot dragon udon, which was just the right amount of spiciness for her! There's usually a long wait time, so what my family and I did was put our names down on the waitlist and walked around to other stores and shops to kill some time. By the time our party was called, we worked up a huge appetite. It was definitely nice to see the chefs make the udon noodles while you wait for your food! Honestly, I would definitely come back here again if I was in the area and you could walk off what you ate at Little Tokyo that's nearby!"
12/20/2017,20171220,5,4.29,"First time being here, amazing udon! I ordered the miso carbonara udon and was surprised of how tasty it was. I cannot wait to try out this place again when I'm at Little Tokyo!"
12/21/2017,20171221,5,4.29,"Yummy! I'm not a huge udon fan, but this place is as good as it gets! I've been here twice now and it's definitely worth the wait if you come at a busy time. First time I came here for dinner, waited about an hour. Second time I came about 30 minutes after lunch opening and there was no wait. Both times I sat at the bar seating. It's great cause you get to see the open kitchen! First time I tried the Miso Carbonara. It was creamy and super delicious. The noodles are so chewy and mouth watering. The bacon in the carbonara is yummy. So fatty and so good. If you like spaghetti carbonara, you can't go wrong! Second time I got the Seafood tomato cream udon. This one was really good as well. I might like it more than the carbonara. It's a toss-up..It has shrimp and creamy tomato. There's some other seafood in there too, but can't remember. It's good.Overall, I would totally come back. I might consider trying their more traditional japanese soup base ones next time. If you like pasta, you'll love Marugame!"

12/22/2017,20171222,5,4.29,"I'm a huge fan of udon so I loved this place. I thought their udon itself was delicious. My girlfriend and I came with a big group. Between she and I, we got the two most well known bowls (butter squid and uni cream udon). Both delicious. I thought the uni cream was a bit heavy. The first couple of bites were REALLY delicious but I felt a bit overwhelmed towards the end. I wished I ordered something on the side to balance out the soft texture of the noodles and the creaminess of the sauce (maybe fried chicken). With that being said, I probably wouldn't order either one of those specialty bowls of udon again. I would probably try their other bowls because I do think they make a really tasty udon bowl."
12/22/2017,20171222,4,4.29,"I ordered the vegetable udon and my boyfriend ordered one of the cold noodle options with a side of assorted tenpura. My soup was just OK, it was pretty basic. I wanted something light and thats what I got but i expected something with a little more flavor. The noodles were great, though. We would have loved to try the creamy udon dishes, that seems to be the popular order but we are from the East coast. Time was limited. However if this place is as good as everyone makes it out to be, all of the dishes should be on point--especially a basic vegetable soup. Service was just fine."

I tried the soba and my girlfriend tried the traditional udon. The soba was great probably one of the best I had in awhile. The base to dip your noodles was light and refreshing with nice overall tanginess.the udon however left something to be desired the base broth was surprisingly flat and tasted unbalanced like they added to much garlic. But the noodles had nice bounciness and chew to the them and all the condiments were fresh and had a place in the dish.

It was spectacular! Uni lovers musttt give this a try. They have some big tobiko garnished on top of udon and it has completed the bowl as it pops and melts in your mouth. My husband ordered Squid butter udon & it was as delicious as the Uni udon I had, loved in! One star deducted because we needed some hot water to warm up our baby's milk but the server said they didn't have hot water.

We also got the eggplant appetizer which was so refreshing with the daikon. Parking on the street was painless as on Sunday nights you don't need to feed the meter.Friendly staff. Fun that you can watch the staff make the noodles in the back. Food came out really fast.Will definitely come back again.

There was always a crowd in front so decided to check it out. Came with a party of 4 and they sat us like at a bar counter area. There was a guy making fresh udon noodles behind the glass. The majority of us ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon while my cousin got the Miso Carbonara Udon. We also got an order of Takoyaki (octopus balls). The sea urchin udon was amazing! So creamy, great texture and flavor! Not a huge fan of raw uni but it's great in a noodle soup! Or pasta. I also tried the miso carbonara udon and it was good too but my fav out of the 2 is the Uni Udon. Would def come again!"

12/26/2017,20171226,4,4.29,"I'm just going to preface this review with the fact that this was one of the simplest yet most soul-satisfying meals I've ever had.After visiting Little Tokyo for the first time, we were looking for good Japanese food in the area and stumbled upon Marguame Monzo and its 4.5 stars with over 1,000 reviews. Despite it being 3:30 in the afternoon, we still ended up waiting around 40 minutes to get seated, which made the experience a little less worth it. However, the high reviews for this place are legitimate; the udon was amazing!We ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon (a signature dish), the Beef Udon (my order), the Curry Udon, and the Hot Sansai Udon (Japanese mountain vegetables). The udon broths were extremely satisfying and all the ingredients in each dish were fresh and wholesome. Although they serve the udons in large black bowls, the actual amount of the food is not that much, which means that you're paying for quality and soul-satisfaction at Marugame Monzo, not to be full. Yet it will be difficult to forget this meal given how satisfying the simple combination of broth, noodles, green onion, and beef were.I highly recommend trying Marugame Monzo, especially if you're willing to wait at least 30 minutes. If you do decide to come by, I recommend ordering their signature udons such as the Mentai Squid Butter Udon if you like seafood or the Miso Carbonara Udon (what I'm getting next time!) to get the full range of their udon capabilities!"

12/27/2017,20171227,5,4.29,"I've never had creamy udon and Marugame Monzo was a fantastic introduction to this dish. I love udon noodles (I tend to like chewier things). The ones here are hand made. You can see the chefs making them through a glass window at the bar. They are cut perfectly but each noodle was thinner than I like so texture wise it wasn't quite what I was looking for in udon, especially hand cut udon.I got the Creamy Mushroom Udon bit.ly/2BL8fruThe broth and mushrooms were so rich. It was exactly what I was expecting. Because of how heavy the dish was it was kind of hard for me to finish but I would absolutely come back for another bowl (another day).I also got a jumbo shrimp tempora. You get 1 large shrimp. Pretty average tempora."
12/27/2017,20171227,5,4.29,"Marugame Monzo is one of my favorite restaurants in LA by far. The noodles are just so damn good, I'm drooling as we speak. The line is always incredibly long, dinner wait times typically range around 45 mins to an hour, but it's worth it. You can walk around the plaza across the street in the mean time so it's not that big of a deal. You could also come right when they open for dinner around 5:30 to be seated quicker.I order the seafood tomato cream udon religiously. It's my favorite. It has so much depth to it. It's hard for me to try other things bc I'm so loyal to it. I think my second favorite udon would have to be the hot dragon. It's flavorful and spicy which I really enjoy. I love the bean sprouts and chives on it.Appetizers such as takoyaki, fried chicken (karaage), and tempura are also a few of my favorites. Service is always friendly and fast."
12/27/2017,20171227,3,4.29,"I liked it. The item I ordered probably wasn't best on the menu. I may need to go back and try something else except there is a long line whenever I did go. I am a veggie person, so it probably was not my best, but service is good and udon is made fresh, flavor is ok, but I""ve only tried one item, so not the expert. I probably shouldn't rate. 3 stars"

12/29/2017,20171229,5,4.29,"Warning: the wait is quite long. Means they're doing something right if everyone is willing to wait over an hour for their udon. I came here today at 7:30pm (Friday) and got seated around 8:45. After eatting here, my friends and I agree that it was worth the wait. We got the a bunch of sea urchin udons, takoyaki, beef carpaccio, toro wraps, and a beef rice bowl. All of them were excellent. The sea urchin udon is the star of the restaurant. Rich, creamy and flavorful with chunks of uni mixed in. Would come back and wait again, that udon is mouth sex."
12/29/2017,20171229,4,4.29,Love the food and would love to give this place 5 stars but can't because you feel like a cattle being rushed through to be slaughtered. The food is amazing but the line is absolutely ridiculous.
12/30/2017,20171230,5,4.29,Always a good meal and quick service.Usually get the sea urchin (uni) udon. Tried champon udon this time. It wasnt spicy at all and there were plenty of little pieces of seafood in it. Yum!
12/30/2017,20171230,5,4.3,Don't be put off by the long queues this place is a must visit when in LA. Put your name on the list get a time and look around Little Tokyo while you wait. Hand made udon noodles being prepared behind a window in the restaurant and a real Japanese vibe. Quick and friendly service and great value. Oh and did I mention the noodles
12/31/2017,20171231,5,4.3,"The uni noofles may be a million calories but they are worth it. I am not kidding. they are that good. Habd cut, creamy, topped with a pound of uni"
1/2/2018,20180102,4,4.3,"Definitely some great udon, but I'm not sure it's worth all the hype.Food - we go the mentai butter squid and the miso carbonara udons, and both were good and flavorful in their own ways. The mentai butter squid had a light and super flavorful broth, with little pink fish eggs floating around in the soup. The udon was chewy but not as chewy as I would've expected from a first-class udon place like I've had in Japan. The miso carbonara udon was also good. Really rich but not overly heavy (and I'm not usually a fan of the creamy stuff). You can ask for hot tea and it goes so well with the rich broths of the udon.Service - there is ALWAYS a huge line outside, compounded by the huge line from Daikokuya as well. But the line goes quickly. I'd say that we waited about ~45 minutes with 8-10 parties ahead of us. Ambiance - super crowded traditional Japanese restaurant. People are bustling back and forth with trays of food and drink, but you do have enough table space to have a quiet conversation with your group. Honestly, I love this environment because it feels cozy and warm.Overall, their udon game is strong but probably not the best I've had. But if you haven't had it, and have an hour-or-so to kill in Little Tokyo I would highly suggest stopping by and trying the mentai butter squid udon."
1/2/2018,20180102,5,4.3,"It's always a long wait here (45+ min), but it's also always worth it. I'm a creature of habit who can't say no to uni, so I always end up getting the uni (sea urchin) udon.. but I love it! It's probably the best uni udon / noodle dish I've ever had, and I've definitely tried many. The handmade nature of the noodles definitely makes a difference."
1/2/2018,20180102,5,4.3,Wish they had larger space but I guess now days the wait is part of the experience. Really great udon. Service is quick and fantastic.
1/3/2018,20180103,3,4.3,"I really wanted to like Marugame Monzo after hearing multiple friends rave about their Uni (Sea Urchin) Cream Udon, but the dish unfortunately fell flat of my expectations.Wait (3/5):This restaurant is always crowded! It's one of Little Tokyo's most popular restaurants, and it's coincidentally situated right next to the just as popular Daikokuya. It's actually sort of confusing that these restaurants are right next to each other, as both of the lines sort of mesh together. No matter the time of day, I'd expect a wait of at least 40 minutes to 1.5 hours.Parking (4/5):Both times I've been here, I lucked out and found street parking for only $0.50/hour a few blocks away. I believe the Daiso on Alameda validates parking for 1 hour, so you could always spend $1.50 there and get some of your parking covered.Service (5/5):No complaints about the servers! They were all friendly, efficient, and proactive in refilling my water. Our food came out fairly quickly, too.Food (3/5):I was excited to try their signature Uni Cream Udon ($16.95), but it was pretty disappointing. First off, the dish was lukewarm. Right off the bat, that sort of ruined the experience for me. The uni was skimpy and barely detectable, mushy and not fresh-tasting at all. The udon lacked a chewy texture. Even the ikura (my absolute favorite type of seafood) tasted old and soggy.I also tried some of my cousin's Miso Carbonara Udon ($12.95). I couldn't really taste the miso in the dish. It tasted like regular carbonara, but with udon. I'd say this is a safe choice, but it's certainly not one of their best dishes.The portion of my entree was too small and not filling enough for me, so I ordered some Assorted Vegetable Tempura ($6.95) on the side. Thankfully, the tempura was pretty darn delicious: it came piping hot, it wasn't overly salty or greasy, and it was perfectly crispy.TLDR: Just another Asian fusion restaurant that is disguised as an authentic udon eatery with the help of its Little Tokyo address. Marugame Monzo reaffirmed my conclusion that ""Japanese"" food in the States will never be as good as it is in Japan..."
1/3/2018,20180103,3,4.29,"This place didn't live up to the hype for me. I came on a Thursday night and there was a big crowd of people outside. I would say the waitlist had at least 20 people ahead of us. My friend and I put our names down and came back a little over an hour later and we were called shortly.  We sat at the bar and I was set on ordering the uni udon since I heard so much about it. I was really excited for it since I love uni! The presentation was nice, but for $17 it was a bit of a disappointment. It almost tasted too creamy and there was one tiny piece of uni. I also felt like there wasn't as much noodles. As a person who normally can't eat a lot, I managed to finish my meal before my friend and was left not completely satisfied. I did enjoy my meal and the noodles tasted fresh, but I feel like instant udon made at home is almost just as good.Waiters were friendly, and the food came out fast, but it wasn't anything amazing for me. I don't think it's a place I'll come out of my way to eat at, or wait in a long line for, but I'm glad I finally got to try it."
1/3/2018,20180103,4,4.29,Very good portion of udon soup!
1/3/2018,20180103,5,4.3,Omg best uni udon ever!!!! So creamy! I couldn't find a similar one in NY when I returned
1/4/2018,20180104,5,4.3,"I find this place so extremely unique and original. I came on a Tuesday afternoon and there was no wait. If it's your first time visiting, I would recommend sitting at the bar! All of their udon is made in-house and it's fresh, soft, and delicious. At the bar, you can see, first-hand, how their udon is made from scratch. I ordered the miso carbonara udon. I took my first bite and the flavors melted in my mouth. You can truly taste the difference between the udon noodles here vs. another place where it's not fresh. The miso carbonara is definitely a creamier, thicker sauce. It was super delicious but if you are not the type of person that enjoys creamier dishes, I would definitely go with something else as it definitely becomes overwhelming near the end of the dish.Either way, 5-stars for the freshness of the noodles. Will definitely be returning to try different flavors!"
1/4/2018,20180104,5,4.3,"Amazing Ramen! The 45 minute was almost 100% worth it. The service was very good despite the place being super busy. We ordered 3 different ramens: uni ramen, tomato sauce seafood ramen, and the clam vongole ramen. (Official names uncertain but if you took a look at the menu you'd know). All 3 were in the specialties page. For appetizers, we ordered fried chicken skin, and the tuna toro wrap. AppetizersTuna toro wrap: This dish was pretty good. I enjoyed it a lot, not sure if it was worth $7 though.Fried chicken skin: The skin wasn't fried long enough. It ended up being pretty greasy since the sauce mixed with the fried batter made it soggy. RamensTomato sauces seafood: I am usually not a fan of tomato sauce because they don't use real tomatoes and the taste is fake and too strong. However, this ramen was amazing. You can taste real tomatoes and it doesn't taste fake or like ketchup. The tomato taste isn't too strong where it covers up the taste of the seafood. 5/5 for this dish :) Uni Ramen: My favorite of the three. The creamy sauce was amazing and it wasn't too rich to the point where I'd get sick after finishing the noodles. The sauce was just right and not too salty and not too sweet. They are super generous with the uni which is rare to find. I loved this dish. Clam Vongole: This dish is on the lighter side. It was refreshing and the wine sauce enhanced the taste of the clams. Big fan of this as well. It was a great dish. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant along with their artworks. I sat at the bar so I could see the chefs make our dishes. I think it's the best seat in the entire restaurant. Very please with my experience and I would definitely visit again. Maybe just try a different appetizer next time. The location is in Little Tokyo so parking is a hassle and waiting outside at night was a bit tiring. Still, 5/5 for their ramen!"
1/4/2018,20180104,4,4.3,I've always loved udon and it's my second favorite Japanese noodle right after ramen. Marugame Monzo is a popular lunch and dinner spot. It is located right next to the Little Tokyo plaza. Parking is always tough as it is in LA. Marugame has quick and helpful staff so at least you're seated quickly and you get your food pretty fast as well.I've eaten here three times and I always get one of the creamy udon options. My favorite is the Uni udon as I am a big fan of uni. The portions are a little small for me. I wish they had more noodles. 4/5 because the portions aren't worth the price. But it is pretty good meal if you want something lighter for lunch.
1/4/2018,20180104,5,4.3,"Pros: - Waiters/person who calls in tables are really nice! - Everything on their menu is under $20! Most expensive specialty udon is $16 (sea urchin cream) - Taste of their udon 10/10 - Creamy udons are actually creamy and not watered down. Would've liked more uni but, it's uni ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Cons: - You can hear conversations next to you bc they try to squish as many people in as possible - Lack of privacy, but what can you do when the wait is 30-60 minutes LOL. - They indirectly rush you, we got our check when I was almost done eating. However, you can't eat here expecting to stay anymore than half an hour (2 people) and be able to take your sweet time. Tips: - Get there early, as in when it opens, especially if you're a big table. - Tables of 2-3 get seated pretty often so don't be disheartened at the line.- Know what you want, don't take too long to order! - Whole party must be present to be seated. - x"
1/4/2018,20180104,5,4.3,"The handmade noodles have the best texture! And it's fun to watch them being made if you get a seat at the bar.Uni Udon is very rich/creamy. May be a bit much for some.Shrimp Tempura Udon is a classic. Great broth.The rice bowls are also a good option and the karaage is bomb.Service is fantastic! There is almost always a wait, but the tables turn quickly. If there is a line, make sure not to dawdle."
1/5/2018,20180105,5,4.3,"A-MA-ZING!!! Completely lived up to the hype! We arrived just after 11 on a Sunday (they open at 11:30) & there was already a line! But it was SO worth the wait! Fast service & an interesting menu offering classics and modern fusion dishes.My friend ordered the tempura appetizer & Hot Dragon Udon. Both were excellent! I ordered the Carbonara Udon- it was to die for! Bottom line- if you know and appreciate good, authentic Japanese food this place is a must-try! Ignore any random reviews written by people who knock off stars for wait time or who would be happy with packaged noodles from 99 Ranch!"
1/5/2018,20180105,5,4.3,"We had three different types of servings all with noodles, Two of them were creamy. All were delicious we will definitely come again. There was a lot of people outside but we did not wait long. The servers were polite and helpful."
1/6/2018,20180106,4,4.3,"This is a great spot right in Little Tokyo, and a lovely option if you're looking for a change from ramen. I came on a Tuesday evening around 7ish, and there was still a sizeable line. The two of us were seated after about 20 minutes. I ordered the curry udon and my friend got the chicken tempura udon. We both got a soft-boiled tempura egg on the side. I loved the curry udon -- it's thicker and more flavorful, so a great alternative if you don't want traditional udon broth. The egg was perfectly cooked and tasty to eat with the soup. The udon noodles were also great. While you'll expect to wait at least a little, the service is quick and on the ball, serving sizes are generous, and food is delicious."
1/6/2018,20180106,4,4.3,"Excellent.  Long wait, but well worth it. Make sure your entire party is there when they call your name or else they'll skip you. I got the Annake Mushroom Udon. I would get it again, but I'd like to try something different next time."
1/7/2018,20180107,4,4.3,"place opens at 5pm. we got there at 5:17pm and there was already a 30 min wait! MENTAI SQUID BUTTER UDON - one of their specialty dishes. i could eat this every day. there was a good amount of squid but i wish the mentai taste was a little stronger and they gave more noodles. the portions are tiny... TEMPURA EGG - MUST GET. they have tempura sides along with non-tempura sides. the egg is cooked where the yolk is still a little runny. parking is difficult. street parking right in front was $4/hr but if you park a little further, it is $1.50/hr. there are also plenty of parking structures and lots you can park but just don't expect to find free parking in little tokyo."
1/7/2018,20180107,4,4.3,"There was a lot of people outside on a Saturday evening but lucky we got in within 30 mins. Ordered a uni cream udon (of course!), tomato seafood udon and squid cream udon, beef tataki and takoyaki. Appetizers were way overpriced. Don't recommend. $4.95 for 3 takoyaki lol. However, the udon was delicious! It was freshly made. The uni was my fav and the others were mediocre."
1/8/2018,20180108,5,4.3,"Beautiful. Delicious. Reasonably priced food. As out of towners we were looking for a place to have dinner. What we discovered was speedy service, made to see udon, and a must visit location in LA. Thank you."
1/8/2018,20180108,5,4.3,"Freshly made udon right in front of you? Yes please.Things to know:1) There is likely going to always be a wait.2) The wait is most certainly worth it3) If you feel overwhelmed by the number of options do the following: - Pick Hot or Cold - Pick Seafood, Meat, or Veggie - When in doubt, I default to Hot Dragon Udon (my favorite)Parking: it is a pain. Try to luck out and find street parking or nowadays I just park across the street in the Garage. You can also valet for a reasonable price at the hotel directly across the street as well)"
1/9/2018,20180109,5,4.3,"FRESHLY CUT UDON right in front of your face! I've been here twice and each time I've gotten the Uni Udon. I didn't wait over an hour to get anything else other than their famous bowl of Uni udon. The sauce is amazing. Rich and creamy with fresh udon. I love the Ikura topping but I have to admit, I do not like the cooked pieces of uni. It tastes weird, and the texture is completely changed when it's cooked. I like my uni smooth, sweet and raw. But that won't stop me from coming back. The rest of the bowl is super delicious. Service is as good as you would expect from a Japanese staff, they try to move people along so the wait won't be too bad, but with the amount of people waiting, it's inevitable it'll be around an hour (or more) wait."
1/9/2018,20180109,5,4.3,"uni udon!!!!! (ooo-dohng, not oo-DONG... death to all who pronounce it as DONG. it's not DONG like your name, you DING DONG)is it worth the wait? ehhh... but when you're craving uni undon pasta--what can you do?"
1/9/2018,20180109,5,4.3,awesome dishes I had my Negitoro bowl at Marugame Monzo Ilike the place
1/12/2018,20180112,5,4.3,"Great on spot made noodles. Worth the wait! Portions seem small but the creamy broth is so rich that it fills you right up. Excellent handmade udon. Tried the Uni and duck udons, negitoro, garlic clams, and tempura. All delicious. Best place for udon noodle."
1/12/2018,20180112,4,4.3,"Personally I think their rice bowls are really delicious, better than their signature Udon. However, you need to try their sea urchin and octopus creamy udon. These are Japanese westernized udon. Brilliant fusion. They're more like eating pasta. Their hot dragon udon is good too"
1/13/2018,20180113,4,4.3,"Marugame Monzo is in Little Tokyo and right next to Daikokuya. Both places usually always has a wait for a table. Have read all the rave reviews of the infamous Sea Urchin Uni Udon so that's exactly what got. Also ordered the shrimp tempura, diced green onions and chili oil to add to my noodles.Served in a deep bowl swimming in creamy rich broth which was not salty or greasy, just lovely consistency. The handmade udon noodles were good, a tad thick, not too aldente or chewy. I have had uni pasta and sadly the sea urchin uni was almost not present here, no fresh uni, zeroSo this dining experience was missing the important uni factor, you know, that ocean taste, caviar like goodness melting in your tongue as you savor every bite, but that thrill was just a fantasy.I had that fab uni Pasta at Georgie in Beverly Hills and the dish is seasonal and was also $$$Nonetheless I would return to Marugame Monzo to try the other rich looking udon offerings and would definitely recommend. It is a small restaurant, be prepared to wait and it is not fancy, very casual.The shrimp tempura was quite good, I would order more than one, very irresistible, like the uni udon"
1/13/2018,20180113,5,4.3,I am still dreaming about the Udon I had last night! Wow where do I even begin. If you go here be ready to wait at least at hour before you're seated. But once you're in the service is very fast and the servers are extremely friendly. We ordered the Carbonara Udon and the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. The great part was that we were seated right by the window looking into the kitchen. We had front row seats to seeing how these amazing dishes were being made. We also ordered fried calamari because our server told us it's a must have. Not long after everything came out! The Sea Urchin was super creamy and so so good. I couldn't get enough of the broth the noodles were resting in. Fantastic dish. The Carbonara was another great one since the bacon pieces were a bit crispy and it had a great balance. Amazing amazing amazing and totally worth the wait. P.S. parking is a hit or miss so do yourself a favor and park in the public parking across. It's $5 after 4pm.
1/13/2018,20180113,5,4.3,Creamy Tomato seafood udon is to die for. My boyfriend and I come here too often! Beef udon is my second choice ! Fried calamari and negitoro is delicious! Love this place! No waiting area seating tho! Very busy !
1/14/2018,20180114,5,4.3,"There is always a line here but it is worth the wait. Right next to Daikokuya, it is under the black awning. There is a counter you can sit at where you can see them make the udon. It's pretty neat.They have a variety of udon. From the classic udon dishes to the more fusiony udon like miso carbonara. My favorite is the mental squid butter. The udon here is handmade so very delicious. The perfect amount of chewiness and full of flavor."
1/14/2018,20180114,5,4.3,"Yes, yes, and so much yes! Where have you been in my life?!I finally got my chance to go to Marugame Monzo the other day and I am just sad that I have not been to this place sooner before?! It was on a Friday night and my friend and I had a day in LA trip. We decided to end our night at Little Tokyo by having Marugame Monzo (both our first times) and it was probably the best decision that we've ever made. We parked elsewhere in DTLA so we walked from Grand Central Area to Little Tokyo. The line wasn't too bad mostly because we came in kinda early to sign our names on the waiting list...so our total wait was about 30 min (which wasn't too bad). As soon our names were called, we were seated immediately in the corner and we were both really excited. I was hoping to get the booth seat because I wanted to see the cooking action in full display but that's ok. Next time! For dinner, I originally wanted to try the Sea Urchin Udon because that seems to be the most popular item and this was my first time, but at the same time I wasn't really in the mood to be spending that much on a meal...so my friend and I both ended up getting the Hot Dragon Udon. According to the menu and the server, it was considered to by ""spicy"" so I'm down for some fire action. Our meals were brought to us soon afterwards and as soon as I took one sip of the broth, it felt like heaven in a bowl. The broth was so rich and delicious, my mouth was salivating every sip of the udon broth. It wasn't really spicy as it stated on the menu but it was still very good in my opinion. I was also quite content with the condiments that they placed in the udon bowl as well. I loved the texture of the handmade udon noodles. It was hard but not too hard. By the end of our dinner stay, my friend and I both finished our udon bowls in one sitting and we were super happy, crying tears of joy. I would so definitely come back when I get the chance. It was that good! Maybe I'll order the Sea Urchin Udon next time. Thank you Marugame Monzo for this epic dinner experience :)"
1/15/2018,20180115,4,4.3,"Long line (waited over an hour when we arrived around 5:30pm)Mushroom udon was too creamy for me, but the fried chicken was good. The kake(?) udon which my friend ordered was great!"
1/15/2018,20180115,4,4.3,"Ate here today for lunch. Had the Sea Urchin Uni Udon, which is delicious. Like a seafood alfredo Japanese style. The other dishes we ordered were the curry Udon, a chicken tempura Udon and a basic Udon with just broth and green onions for our picky eater.We also had calamari which is an appetizer,Food is 5 stars. Portion size is 3.5 stars. Service was good.You can see the kitchen behind a glass wall. Directly in front of the small eating area, they are (from a marketing perspective, very intelligently) making the noodles from scratch.Definitely a good restaurant."
1/15/2018,20180115,2,4.3,"So I've been here before and come for the creamy uni udon. I'm not sure if they raised their prices, but I feel like they did raise their price and decreased their portion size; drastically! I compared it to my friend's curry udon and my bf's shrimp udon thing he ordered. My portion was almost half of theirs! I was super disappointed and paid way more than their udon. I def won't be ordering this dish again. Not worth $16.95!!"
1/16/2018,20180116,5,4.3,"Cream? YesThick noodles? YesAmazing service? YesThis hidden little shop next to Daikokuya should not be overlooked. I almost missed it because they don't display their name anywhere. I came around 12:30 on a Tuesday and got seated right away. Service is superb, as they have servers walking around constantly. They were extremely friendly, which made us feel welcomed. Their lunch special includes a regular sized udon bowl and a mini rice bowl for about $3 or $4 depending on what you get. I got the miso carbonara udon. Lemme tell you something. THAT IS ONE HEAVY CREAMY DISH. But not in a bad way. I found the flavor to be unlike anywhere else and addicting, but the amount of cream was a feat to endure through. The noodles were cooked to the perfect texture and soaked up the flavor extremely well. I will definitely come back to try some of their other signature udon dishes."
1/16/2018,20180116,5,4.3,"I came here during a weekend with my friends because I wanted to try fresh udon noodles and I am a big fan of uni. The wait was about 30 to 45 minutes on a Sunday. The uni udon was really good. It was rich in flavor and the udon noodles was soft and smooth. Also ordered the a cheesy udon dish. I don't remember the name of the udon dish bit it was good. I love cheese and the amount of cheese used for the udon was perfect in taste. But I can only eat a few bites, it was very cheesy"
1/17/2018,20180117,4,4.3,"They make their own udon noodles which is amazing. They have traditional Japanese udon noodles and some special ones that you won't find in regular Japanese restaurant. Tried the chanpon udon which was great! It's pretty big in portion too. There is always a long line, but worth a wait."
1/17/2018,20180117,5,4.3,This place never fails to amaze me! The noodles are so good. And you would think that the portions are small but they fill you up quickly. The rice bowls are amazing too! I wish I had two stomachs.
1/18/2018,20180118,5,4.3,"Best accident I hit in Little Tokyo. I was really trying to find a good ramen shop on a rainy, cold day in LA. I found Daikokuya to be the top pick but as we found it, there was line out the door! :( Hungry and getting wetter by the second, next door stood right in front of us, we found Marugame Monzo.Looking through the window, we saw an empty table with huge bowls of steaming hot soup. You bet we ran right in.But I'm so so happy we stumbled here because it was one of the best meals I had in LA. You see your udon noodles getting made right as you're eating. The soft boiled egg did not disappoint. The soft braised pork cuts were INSANE. I was full eating one piece. The broth was perfect and the noodles were as fresh as can be.Udon over ramen? Any day as long as it's at Marugame!"
1/19/2018,20180119,4,4.3,"Good service, you will be seated fast although the line outside is probably horrible-it always is. Beef udon is a little salty but still good! They're known for their cream based udons. Waiters understand English very well."
1/20/2018,20180120,3,4.3,"Having Udon being made in front of you while eating Udon? I had to visit.I arrived around 2pm and surprisingly there wasn't a line. Luckily there was an open seat in front of the bar. Time to watch some udon be made! Unfortunately they didn't make any during visit, possibly due for them closing at 230pm.I got the Sea Urchin Udon as recommended from a friend. The soup was very creamy and filled with tons of uni . From my personal experience fresh uni is a bright orange and very creamy as well. The uni that was in my dish was ranging from orange to dark orange with tough texture. Although the udon was perfect, it reminded me of some udon I had back in Japan.Overall. I'd come back if a friend wanted to try, but not on my own. Parking can be pretty tough, but I parked at Aiso and walked over. It was less than a 5 minute walk."
1/22/2018,20180122,5,4.3,"Came here twice on a one week trip to LA.It's right across the street near the entrance to Japan town and it's easy to miss, but man it's good. It's a smallish restaurant and how we luckily never had to wait in line. They have an extensive list of udons on their menu, ranging from budget options of less than $10, to a sea urchin creamy udon for about $20 (also, SEA URCHIN UDON!!). Their udon is all freshly made in the restaurant. If you get a bar table (which I recommend you do if you're going with one or two people), you get to watch them make it.It's not expensive, they serve sea urchin udon, and it's freshly made right in front of you."
1/22/2018,20180122,3,4.3,"I had this place bookmarked for a long time but long lines deter from dining here. Until Friday afternoon, I was in the area and decided to check this place out. Surprised to see no one wasn't here yet and was told by an employee that they don't open til 4pm. It was only a few minutes away so I decided to stand in line. Soon after, more and more people cued in line."

They have an extensive list of udons on their menu, ranging from budget options of less than $10, to a sea urchin creamy udon for about $20 (also, SEA URCHIN UDON!!). Their udon is all freshly made in the restaurant. If you get a bar table (which I recommend you do if you're going with one or two people), you get to watch them make it.It's not expensive, they serve sea urchin udon, and it's freshly made right in front of you."
1/22/2018,20180122,3,4.3,"I had this place bookmarked for a long time but long lines deter from dining here. Until Friday afternoon, I was in the area and decided to check this place out. Surprised to see no one wasn't here yet and was told by an employee that they don't open til 4pm. It was only a few minutes away so I decided to stand in line. Soon after, more and more people cued in line."
1/22/2018,20180122,1,4.3,"Usually love coming here, food is amazing and service is great. On Friday however I came and got my usual dish (Udon Gratin with sea food) shared it with my S.O. we both ended up with food poisoning next day....Might want to be careful getting seafood here. Not sure if I'll be back now."
1/23/2018,20180123,4,4.3,Marugame was a good place. Amazing udon. I definitely would recommend the non-creamy udon. Not that the creamy ones were bad but if you are expecting an udon experience you will get a pasta experience instead with a creamy udon. That's just my opinion. Although it was nice just was not udon I was used to or wanted to have.

1/24/2018,20180124,2,4.3,"I will be blatantly honest based on how I perceive Japanese cuisine ( my mom's ex husband was from Kyoto). A- I will proclaim I much more prefer ramen to udon. Udon is to thick and heavy while being unfulfilling.* They only serve udon and it's very fixed amounts of broth vs noodles vs anything else. No way about it. B- Japanese cuisine is very healthy, light and yet satisfying based on kyoshi( my stepdad & his cooking) C- mama has been all over Japan and raves about the cuisine. She disliked everything we had down to the tea.Ok now my American version of it.... I have had ramen and Japanese cuisine , probably in every town I have been in. I really was looking forward to this place, only to get grossed out. If you want to feel sick with a rich creamy broth along with fat slimey udon, then this is your place. I like a flavorful broth filled w ramen and all the other fixings which this place does not provide. Like I have said before, the broth for these soulful soups are made with so much love, time, care and attention. These taste to me like an American made, heavy , creamy version. (Remember my step dad is from Kyoto and a gourmet chef) . My Bella who is going to be the next chef in our household was only able to have one bite and be done. The service is super cultured, polite perfection, therefore,we never said a word. Mind you between the three of us we had six different items. Way too rich and thick on all levels . If I had to pick one that was semi ok, it would be the vegetable udon on their special udon menu. Still lil to no broth and as a chef or even just a foodie, you know the noodles suck up the broth in no time. Right? So I had a Japanese pasta dish which fell flat on every level. So did my companions :(I am sorry to say I will not go back to little Tokyo when we have some really good ramen shops here in Sherman oaks and elsewhere . Total flop for me and some food network friends... if these heavy bowls work for you along w udon then give them a try. I don't understand the reviews. This is not what my stepdad makes or considers real Japanese. This was fatty , heavy, makes you feel like you ate a five pound weight of carbs and fat with little to no flavor. Go next door if you want the real thing!"

1/24/2018,20180124,5,4.29,"Monzo reminds me of one of my favorite udon restaurants I ate at in Japan. This is because well there aren't many udon specialty restaurants in America. Udon is definitely an underrated dish! The long lines at the ramen place next door may entice you but I highly recommend you dine at Monzo instead. Lines seem to be not as long here too. They have so many options for different kinds of udon from cold to hot. Sea urchin udon is a must try if you enjoy a creamy broth. Though creamy, it's not heavy at all. For something more simple and traditional, I would go for the shrimp tempura udon."

I've been there on four very separate occasions and I have yet to be disappointed!"
1/25/2018,20180125,4,4.29,"To be brief, you should try this place at least once to see if it's to your taste. MM does a richer, Western-inspired take on Japanese udon, and they do it extremely well. (Hence the Asian fusion label.)You can see chefs making the udon from scratch in the semi-open kitchen, and the noodles are indeed fresh, thick, and wonderfully chewy. Most of the signature udon are cream based and what I imagine to be the deliciously decadent love child of Japanese udon and fettuccine Alfredo. The Sea Urchin Udon is really one of a kind and totally worth the self-loathing after you lick your entire bowl clean. If your palate favors lighter, clear broths to go with noodles, this might not be your cup of soup. There are lighter options on the menu like shrimp tempura and braised pork udon, but I can't really speak to those since I've yet to try. One vegetarian friendly entree that I saw. The menu also offers mini rice bowls topped with assorted meat and fish. I recommend the Negitoro, or fatty tuna over rice. It comes with a good amount of fish and the flavor profile is more traditional Japanese. The service here is impeccable. My server actually rotated my bowl of udon in front me so that the handle of the spoon was next to my left hand. What attention to detail, what customer service!All in all, I enjoyed the concept of this restaurant, and I enjoyed the food even more. Thanks for a great meal!"

It's ridicules how excited we were to get in but then again we were starving. I ordered the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon and my Sister ordered the Dragon Udon dish, and we also order a side of tempura egg. It was Delicious! We both loved that it came with a huge spoon to eat with lol. I tried both dishes, don't recommend switching in between eating both of them bc they are two completely different dishes, but they are so Yummy! Definitely made driving and walking, and waiting worth it for me! Yum!"
1/26/2018,20180126,5,4.3,"Ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon and fried chicken. Love both of them! We came in around 5:30pm on Friday and there's no wait for two of us. The Udon is great and really creamy, and the amount of noodles is perfect such that I won't feel very sick of the cream. Fried chicken is sooo good!"

Regardless they have long wait they have the best udon. Got hot udon: Beef udon really good for cold and rainy weather. Very simple and tasty. For signature udon got: Sea urchin, miso carbonara, seafood tomato cream, mushroom cream; everything is very saucy, creamy, and I like it! At first I thought the serving is small but the portion is good for one person and it's really heavy. Appetizer: fried chicken and crispy chicken skin is excellent! Highly recommend those. Since this location is in Lil Tokyo be ready to look for parking. Street parking is pain in the a.. Theres parking structure a block away. Have fun eating!! :)"
1/27/2018,20180127,5,4.3,"I've never waited willingly over an hour for food, but I was determined to try this 4.5 star homemade rated cream sea urchin salmon roe udon. I ended up eating around 3pm. I thought I was going to pass out from hunger and started getting annoyed at people before me taking their time but...Alas, finally got seated! Ordered Asahi beer and the udon I so desired and a few appetizers: takayaki and several tempura. It was so worth the wait. So satisfied. This place has lines out the door throughout the day. But runs well mannered and efficiently. Perfect score. Thank you!"

1/28/2018,20180128,5,4.3,Best japanese udon. Their sea urchin udon is my favorite. Lines are long so prepare for that. Worth waiting.
1/29/2018,20180129,5,4.3,Super tasty. So much fun to watch them make the noodles right in front of you. If you can sit at the bar seats that overlook the noodle master it's endless entertainment.
1/30/2018,20180130,3,4.3,"I've been here many times last year and I haven't been here recently. I love Japanese thick noodles- so this place is one of the best places to check out for noodles if you're in Little Tokyo. The flavors are packed but I have to give it no more than 3 stars because of its portion!! Last year, the price (and the long wait time) for the amount of food was totally worth it. But now... sadly their portions are way too small. I think I ate my sea urchin noodle under 10 bites... I was so surprised and disappointed by their small portions. Now with that in mind, I don't think this place is worth coming again and again. Not worth my time and my money."
1/31/2018,20180131,4,4.3,"Wanted to check this place out for ages but I didn't want to wait for hours to get seated so I always passed on it. So when I went, I made sure I went at a time when it wasn't too crowded which was around 4:45pm.(I got seated right away)LOCATION- its on the streets so you need to park in the Tokyo Village Parking structure. Its not that far of a walk to the restaurant.SERVICE- the servers were well-mannered and did their work efficiently. SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON- looking at the pictures, it looked like it was going to be overly buttery and creamy, but it was not! It was delicious! I wish they put more uni in it though and the portion was not generous because I was still a bit hungry. The restaurant was clean and tidy but its a very tiny place. I don't know if I would go back just to eat this though."
1/31/2018,20180131,4,4.3,"The food is really good, but the portions for their special umi udon is a little.... lackingStill good though!"
2/1/2018,20180201,5,4.3,Got the Udon Gratin and green tea. It was sooo cheesy and creamy! A different variation of your typical udon. I was expecting broth lol. Anyway it was good and different. All Udon is fresh and you can watch the chefs make it while your dining which was really neat.
2/2/2018,20180202,5,4.3,"This place is wonderful, it does get fairly packed throughout the day. I have seen lines begin right at the opening throughout the afternoon. This restaurant is located in the heart of Little Tokyo right next to Daikokuya. There's a glass wall where you can watch the cooks make the noodles from scratch. It's amazing watching these magicians turn flour into a serving of noodles. There is a plethora of warm and cold udons and i have not ordered an entree that I did not like. Aside from the Carbonara, I also had the Crying Tiger as well as the Beef udon. You can really taste how fresh and flavorful the noodles are. As an aside, you must also get the fired soft boiled egg - think of a typical soft boiled egg in tempera form. A++"
2/2/2018,20180202,4,4.3,I ordered the seafood udon that day and it tasted very Japanese! The shrimp tempura is crispy and big!
2/3/2018,20180203,4,4.3,"probably one of the most unique udons I've had. The popularity of this place is no joke. My friends and I waited about 45 minutes and it was only about 5 pm. However, it definitely is worth the wait. I ordered the Mentai seafood udon. It was very creamy and very different from the udons I was used to. If you love creamy foods, this is the one for you. However, I received a smaller portion than my friends that even they noticed it too as I finished 10 min before them and we all eat at generally the same pace. The noodles were very good quality. Overall, it was a good experience with great food but the wait time and smaller portion were the reason why I took off 1 star."
2/3/2018,20180203,5,4.3,"It was a huge wait, but the udon was superb. You could tell it's hand made. The consistency was the right chewiness. I had the udon with mentaiko. Portions are a bit small so recommend getting the side rice bowl (also small)."
2/4/2018,20180204,4,4.3,Had the sea urchin udon. It was dangerously delicious. Creamy & tasted almost like carbonara until you taste the uni! Really good udon
2/5/2018,20180205,3,4.3,"Came in with high expectations due to all the great reviews, and left kinda disappointed. When I first arrived at the restaurant, there were a lot people waiting outside. However, because I came by myself, so I was able to snatched a bar seat without waiting.I ordered the Mental Squid Butter Udon and Fried chicken. The noodle dish was alright, not worth the $12.95 in my opinion. The bowl was huge, but the food isn't much, there were barely any soup. The fried chicken in the other hand, was pretty good. It was tender and has a great flavor."
2/5/2018,20180205,4,4.3,"Came here during lunch, and had the Carbonara Udon and the pork belly rice. The Udon were delicious! The rice not so much....Overall it was good and they also accepted credit cards."
2/5/2018,20180205,4,4.3,"This place is yummy. The noodles are fresh and chewy. If you are lucky you can sit at the bar and watch the chef roll and cut them. Who doesn't love diner and a show? There might be better ramen places out there but this place is pleasant, has an attentive staff, is affordable and the wait is reasonable. I like to get the curry ramen and then I put the tempura soft-boiled egg in there .... holy guacamole!"
2/6/2018,20180206,4,4.3,"Love all of their Udons. Huge menus with very wide collections and fun flavors, including some unique items I've never seen elsewhere. My favorite are their cream-based Udons. For appetizers/sides, I like their tempuras, fresh and tasty. The only thing is the service could be a bit slow or lackluster."
2/6/2018,20180206,5,4.3,Excellent Udon and absolutely amazing deal for the price (7.99-13.99/bowl). I shouldn't say this but honestly they could raise the prices 50-75% and the place would still be packed and the value would still be there. This place is a total score. There's a wait during prime time even on Tuesday when I went so be prepared for that but well worth it!
2/8/2018,20180208,3,4.3,"This place was so hyped up for me and I'm sad it didn't live up to my expectations :( I got the squid butter udon, and this was just way too heavy for me. I think it's honestly just my preference because so many people do love that udon. It was very rich and had a fishy flavor that wasn't too overwhelming at first but got gradually worse as I ate more. My other two friends got lighter ramens that they both loved, So I think I will try to come again.Parking in this area is pretty easy. Little Tokyo has a lot of parking garages around it"
2/8/2018,20180208,5,4.3,"Hoh yeah Marugame Monzo. I'm in love with this place. Specifically their uni (sea urchin) udon. Their udon is fresh made in house. It is literal perfection, only rivaled by marukame udon in Honolulu from what I've had so far. The crispy chicken skins were amazing as well. Also love that they carry Ginga Kogen beer, which is basically a Japanese Hefeweizen. Get there before the dinner rush unless you want to wait over an hour."
2/8/2018,20180208,4,4.3,"I enjoy getting Marugame when I want something different from the usual ramen or sushi selections in Little Tokyo. I usually get the Squid Butter Udon and it is the perfect blend of creaminess without being too heavy. The udon noodles are always freshly made here and perfectly chewy. Prices here are a tad higher than I would like to pay for the noodles, but once in a while, I crave udon noodles and come here."
2/8/2018,20180208,5,4.3,Amazing!!!!!!! Lives up to the hype. I hate waiting for anything- when my boyfriend is in the shower too long I turn the water on cold so he will hurry his ass up. Anyways- I waited 1 hour for this deliciousness and It was SO worth it. 10/10. Would trade my mother for the recipe.
2/9/2018,20180209,5,4.3,They have traditional Japanese udon noodles and some special ones that you won't find in other Japanese restaurant. The food is delicious and the staff is pleasant.
2/10/2018,20180210,5,4.3,"UNI and UDON! UNI and UDON! What more do I need to convince you this place is beyond magical. No words can describe the sensations, explosions, dance bombs going on in my mouth. HOLY *BEEP BEEP BEEP*! This place is a gift from the heavens!!And we all know that with exceptional food comes a ridiculously long line. My average wait time is 1.30-2hrs. I usually come around 7-8pm. So, be prepared to wait. Go enjoy the plaza of Little Tokyo right opposite. Explore the nearby quirky shops. Buy an ice cream. Do anything to pass time LOL because it will be LONG! But then again, good things come to those who wait.To the food, the udon itself is amazing. The texture is perfect. Each bite has a great chew and since it is made fresh everyday, right in front of your eyes, you know it's legit. Their appetizers are also extremely tasty. Our party of 2 ordered takoyaki, braised pork belly, crispy chicken skin, uni udon and hot dragon udon. We also ordered a special alcoholic beverage, puchi puchi, which was $19?! Do not get this drink. It is not worth the price. The total bill came to be, $78."
2/10/2018,20180210,4,4.3,"First time here! I ordered the Sea Urchin Udon with side Kakiage and Squid tempura. The Sea Urchin Udon(4.5/5) was very delicious with a creamy broth and decent portion sea urchins and salmon roe toppings. Unlike the regular hot Udon with Dashi soup broth, this udon is more of a sticky and creamy ""Pasta style"" Udon. Overall very good.The Kakiage was also quite creatively prepared. Unlike most of the Kakiage you find in Udon stores in Japan that are prepared only use vegetables, the Kakiage here contains shrimp and baby scallop filings which has taken this tempura dish onto a new level.So does this place beat Tsurumaru across the street? Not really. For me, Marugame Monzo and Tsurumaru Udons represent two distinctly different styles of Udons. It really comes down to your own preference. Here are my thoughts of each:Marugame Monzo-Udon has softer and more sticky ""Mochi"" like texture-More selection of different Udons. Besides the regular hot Udons you can find in most places, they have signature style Udons that are created using their own creativity, these Udons tend to be priced higher than the regular hot Udons but they also come with higher quality toppings like the Sea Urchin, Salmon Roe which you can't find easily in other udon places. In fact, they even have Duck meat udon.-Smaller portion size than Tsurumaru but you can add extra udon for $2Tsurumaru-Udon has harder and more chewy texture as opposed to the softer and mochi like texture at Monzo-I felt the Dashi soup broth at Tsurumaru is close to perfection, even better than some of the Udon Shops I tried in Japan. At the same time, I can't comment on the Dashi soup broth at Monzo because I haven't tried their regular hot Udons, will update the next time after I try it.-Price is cheaper but with less Udon selection"
2/10/2018,20180210,2,4.3,This place is GOOD (I've only had their uni udon) I've been here a handful of times but it's always packed and the wait is kind of long which I don't really mind what I do mind is finding a hair in my calamari and not getting an apology or even a discount on my order when we mentioned the hair all they did was get the calamari not even make eye contact and being us a new one once our check came no discount was applied no apology it wasn't even mentioned it left a bad taste in our mouths I understand that sometimes things happen but no apology or even acknowledgement which was annoying
2/10/2018,20180210,5,4.3,"This is definitely my favorite spot for udon. I've been here a few times and have had to wait about an hour for a seat each time, but it's definitely well worth the wait for me because all of their food is amazing. I've tried the uni udon (which is definitely my favorite here), the mentai squid udon, the carbonara udon (probably my second favorite), and the udon cheese gratin. I have never been disappointed with any of the dishes here. I've tried coming back a few times to try their regular soup udon since I've only ever had the creamy udon dishes, but the line was just too long (I come during lunch hour at work so I don't have the time to wait for a seat), but I will still continue trying. There is usually already a line outside the door before they even open, which further emphasizes how good the food is here. The area inside is pretty small and cramped with not too much space, but enough to feel comfortable as you're seated and eating. The udon is made fresh; they have a kitchen area that is covered by glass windows so as you're eating you can watch the chefs roll out dough to make the udon noodles. I look forward to my next time here because I love all the food."
2/11/2018,20180211,3,4.3,"Been in my bookmarks for a while now and finally got the chance to try it. Half my friends gave a 5 Star review and the other half gave it a 2 Star. My finally verdict is a 3 Star. For a late Saturday lunch, we got there around 1:30 and waited around 30 mins to get seated. The store is quite small and the tables are aligned closely together. The udon did not take long to arrive. My boyfriend and I were pretty hungry at that time. He ordered their most popular sea urchin udon and I ordered the mushroom cream udon. He finished the entire bowl within 5 mins!!! The udon proportion was off. I had more udon than him. For a $17 udon dish, the portion was lacking and it was simply just not enough food. My mushroom udon was pretty good. I really liked it. The reason why they don't get a 5 Star review is because their prices are way too high for the amount of food you get.. if they lower it I would definitely come back. Be prepared to spend around $45 for 2 people."
2/12/2018,20180212,5,4.3,"Handmade spun gold in your mouth...but really. This udon shop is so delicious you will leave drooling.Let's start with the menu; they have a lot of undo options of their specific blends. You can have duck or veggie the options are galore. But the best part like any Japanese noodle shop is the add ins. You can add tempura soft boiled eggs, green onion, and even more. The options and combinations are endless. I am a tempura girl and they even had pumpkins which is delish! The food is flawless season is so on point and their noodles are truly the Stars which is why you go to a udon shop right?!?Service is so great; all the staff is nothing but friendly. Greeting you at the door, asking preferences, and offering great suggestions if you have questions about the menu. They are fast, effective and still courteous which you can't always find in Little Tokyo!Lastly, the environment is small and intimate but casual. Perfect for a lunch or chill dinner. It's not too loud so you can have good conversation.Definitely a must try if you can't wait in long lines for ramen! Or you just want to try something new!"
2/13/2018,20180213,5,4.3,Went here for dinner & tried the sea urchin udon. The udon noodles are very nice & chewy. This particular dish to me tasted like i was eating carbonara pasta but with uni in it instead of bacon. Got here just before the dinner crowd & was seated right away. The servers are very nice as well!
2/13/2018,20180213,5,4.3,"Definitely the best udon in LA. Definitely worth the wait and I would definitely recommend to anyone craving authentic Japanese udon.The broth is clear and clean and the taste is spectacular. The udon texture is chewy but soft. The side orders such as the kaarage is good. The tempura is crispy and delicious. You can't go wrong here. The service is friendly and even though there can be a long wait at times, I think it is definitely the best udon I've ever had. They have a lot of option and I went with the vongole udon. The creamy white sauce is aromatic and has great consistency, not too thick or watered down. I would definitely recommend this item.I usually opt for street parking. I would also recommend coming on a weekday to avoid the crowds."
2/14/2018,20180214,1,4.3,I don't think it's worth the long wait and the overpriced sea urchin udon. Might as well just eat pasta.
2/14/2018,20180214,5,4.3,Wow! This is not a place that you would choose from the street but inside is great. Staff is great! Food is too good to leave any at all.
2/16/2018,20180216,4,4.3,"Long wait but it's worth it. The cream-based udon was SO good, and watching the chef make the noodles through the glass was so interesting. I would definitely recommend getting the soft boiled egg as a topping -- it completed the dish."
2/17/2018,20180217,5,4.3,"This place never disappoints. The staff is friendly, the service is efficient, the food is consistent. I've tried half the appetisers, a couple of the rice bowls, and an assortment of their Udon. None of it has been less than excellent. My current favorite is the Hot Dragon, it's the middle ground between clear broth and cream base. Generally there is a wait, but it's very reasonable and worth every second!"
2/18/2018,20180218,4,4.3,"Located in Little Tokyo, this place is known for their hand pulled udon noodles. If you're like me and love udon and noodles in general, you will love this place! The inside is kind of small, which means you should come early if possible. I came on a weekday right before the restaurant opened for dinner. Parking can be difficult, but there is a structure you can park in for a small fee (depending on how long your car is parked there). I was contemplating between the Beef Udon or the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. It was a tough decision, but I wanted to try something new, so I ended up ordering the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. The first few spoons tasted heavenly, but after that I started to feel like it was too heavy. Perhaps it's just because I'm not a fan of thick and super creamy because of the bloated feeling it leaves you with afterwards. There were only little bits of Sea Urchin on top. It was still really good, but I just felt it was slightly overhyped. I still really want to try their Beef Udon, so maybe I'll be back to try that next time. I'll probably stick to soupy clear broths from now on to not feel so bloated. Prices are okay, but the noodles are freshly made in house. Not expensive, but definitely not cheap either!"
2/19/2018,20180219,1,4.29,"I seriously don't get what the hype is about. A 1 hour wait for udon? The food tastes good but nothing special on the menu. I could make it at home. While we waited in the cold outside, we went to a boba shop across the street to kill time and keep warm. And as soon as we were seated in the restaurant, one of the employees confiscated our boba drinks because ""no outside food or drinks."" Would not recommend this place."
2/20/2018,20180220,5,4.29,"The wait to get into the restaurant was long but the food came out quickly.  As soon as we sat, they gave us a menu and checked on us a minute later for drinks. By they time they got back with the drink, we were ready to order so service was quick. We ordered the followig:* Vongole udon had a clear seafood broth with clams, green oinion and we added the tempura soft boiled eggs* Sea Urchin Cream Udon had a creamy uni flavored broth topped with a few pieces of uni.A glass of wine is reasonably priced and good too."
2/21/2018,20180221,4,4.29,"The best udon ever, usually there is a long waiting line outside the restaurant on lunch or dinner because the space of the restaurant is not big enough to fit 50 people or so but it's worth to wait, my favourite is the carbonara udon although people usually recommend the uni udon. The taste was great! I would love to come back."
2/21/2018,20180221,5,4.3,"This is a great place for any Udon craving! My go to choices would be the beef udon and shrimp tempura udon. My friend ordered something with uni, I forgot the name but it was also good. My visits here are usually between lunch and dinner during the week, so it's not that busy. The staff is good and the service is efficient."
2/21/2018,20180221,5,4.3,Love this place! You can see how they make their udon noodles and their uni udon pasta is wonderful. The line can be long but the wait isn't so bad. Don't leave to browse at other areas because they will skip you if you're not there.
2/22/2018,20180222,4,4.3,"Uni Udon? You can count me in! But make sure you only invite me during the weekday! My friend and I came on a Friday afternoon and the wait wasn't long at all. We waited about 15 minutes!| p a r k i n g | Well, what do you expect in DTLA? Parking is horrible! There is street parking and a parking structure across the street. Pick your poison. | f a c i l i t y |This place is very small and intimate. You're pretty much elbow to elbow with the person next to you. Not good for big groups.| f o o d |[ + ] Sea Urchin Udon: I heard this is a must have so of course I had to order it. I really loved the flavor of the cream sauce. Udon was cooked to perfection. Just wished there was more uni. There were only small bits and pieces. This dish is really heavy so I suggest sharing with someone![ ++ ] Beef Udon: Deeeelicious! This pretty much tastes like a Yoshinoya beef bowl but in a soup version. Loved the broth. It's very refreshing and clean. [ + / - ] Kikiage Rice Bowl: This was tasty but two things. I think it could do without the rice. And two, wish it came with some kinda sauce on the side. I saw the chefs spray it with some but I'm a saucy person. I would've loved more![ - ] Braised Pork Belly: This was really disappointing. I was excited to try this but it was bland! Didn't do anything for me. Pass!"
2/22/2018,20180222,4,4.3,"Very solid udon shop. I ordered the beef udon, simple but hits the spot. I also ordered a soft-boiled egg and seaweed as toppings. The portion was the perfect size for me. It was just enough to fill me but not uncomfortably. My friend's vongole udon was a bit smaller though. They always have a double order option, which gives you double noodles if you're really hungry. The soup flavor, udon consistency, and toppings were all really good. The soft-boiled egg was perfect!My only complaint is that the soup was not hot enough. It was just slightly more than warm and I typically like my hot foods pretty hot so it doesn't get cold too fast. The place is also kinda small so expect a bit of a wait.Overall, good quality food and I would come again. They also have a more unique selection of udon for the adventurous!"
2/22/2018,20180222,4,4.29,"This is solely based on the Uni Udon. I've had this place three times so far in my life. I'm currently 29 twice was this year once was about 4 years ago. My experience then was at most 2 stars and I didn't write a review then. I'm glad I didn't and gave this place a chance again. Number 1 thing is there will be a line. You hate lines then go somewhere else. Number 2 once again solely based on one dish and that's the Uni Udon. I haven't tried anything else and I don't think I will anytime soon. Based on other friends the other dishes are hit or miss. Anyhow the best way to describe this dish would be simple. Fresh Udon check, simple creamy uni broth check. Not much more to say. 1 hour wait for a decently priced freshly made bowl of Uni Udon that you really can't get anywhere else in LA. So enjoi."
2/22/2018,20180222,5,4.3,I woke up dreaming about the udon I ate last night. The udon I had was called Ankake mushroom udon and I finished every bit of it including the broth. If you love mushrooms like I do this will be an unforgettable meal. Next time I will try the mushroom cream udon and see how it compares to Ankake. I can't wait:)
2/22/2018,20180222,4,4.3,"I actually love this restaurant. The food is fantastic and the handmade noodles are great. I would definitely recommend this place even though the wait is horrible. My only gripe is that they don't take reservations and won't seat a party until everyone is there. If I have the person's order, I don't see that this would be a problem. I hope you will consider easing up on this policy. I would have given you 5 stars otherwise!"
2/23/2018,20180223,5,4.3,"Been here many times and I highly recommend it to all. There are many choices from the typical original udon to the crazy cheese udon called gratin. They have limited seating, which is usually expected. Many of the little Tokyo locations are very small, so they will have a difficult time accommodating large groups. There is always most certainly a wait so be prepared to dish out the time to get in and wait. With the average wait being about 30-45 it isn't that bad. Once you enter and are seated the menu is one large page with many variety choices on there. They have add on as well from udon so you can add stuff to your hearts content. They have rice dishes, and decent appetizers that you can choose from. I have tried the gratin, squid butter, uni, mad tiger, beef, carbonara, and hot dragon udon. They all were tasty with the highly anticipated uni being the favorite of many. The spicy pork bowl is something I also highly recommend with the deep flavor of the pork and that slight kick of spice. The calamari is another added touch with a crunch to every bite. The takoyaki was decent, but can be soggy at times so tread carefully. Step by step, bite by bite everything is savored and devoured in the end. Food: 5/5Atmosphere: 3/5 it can be noisy. Service: 5/5"
2/23/2018,20180223,4,4.3,"Long lines but the wait time wasn't awful. Good thing it is LA and you can wait outside generally - Otherwise, there is no room to wait inside the restaurant. Watching the staff make the noodles through the window at the bar was really fun. Mentai squid butter udon was pretty good - It was filling but somehow I finished the whole bowl.. The carbonara was super filling as well. I'm sure we both consumed 1500 calories that night a piece. Fun experience, though"
2/25/2018,20180225,5,4.3,"Fate decided tonight's dinner. After putting my name on the lists for both Daikokuya (next door) and Marugame Monzo, the latter called us up first.FRIED CHICKEN = classic, juicy, tender, crispy. I might be hard pressed to find a better version in this area.TAKOYAKI = 3 pieces a bit overloaded with toppings. MISO CARBONARA UDON = creamy with bacon and egg, hint of miso. So indulgent, so good.MUSHROOM CREAM UDON = same creamy indulgence, but with the earthiness of mushrooms. I added a FISHCAKE which I loved, as well as a SOFT-BOILED EGG, however this egg's creaminess was lost in the already rich broth.UDON GRATIN = baked udon with chicken in a cream sauce, topped with cheese. This crossed over too much into the Italian zone for me. Next time, I'll stick with the soupy offerings.SHRIMP TEMPURA UDON = good choice for anyone lactose intolerant who can't handle the signature creamy options. This one is clear, flavorful broth with 2 pieces of crispy shrimp tempura on the side.If you're lucky enough, you'll be seated at the counter by the open kitchen. There, watch the dough rolled out into sheets, then sliced into the perfect noodles you'll soon be indulging in.Location is in Little Tokyo along 1st Street across from the Miyako Hotel."
2/25/2018,20180225,5,4.3,Finally got to try place out with my friend. Was a little hard to find because sign isn't clear. They are located right next to Daikokuya Ramen. Vegetable udon tasted great. We arrived couple minuets after opening and place was packed. Service was great and staff was very friendly. I will definitely come back.
2/25/2018,20180225,3,4.3,"Hot sansai Udon made into a combo with beef rice bowl at the last minute (good decisions!). The Udon was whatever. Not amazing tasting to me, mediocre at best. Broth just tasted of salt, vegetables were all mixed in and kind of mushy (I enjoyed them though) and Udon tasted like normal Udon. On the expensive side, but massive portions. The beef rice bowl, on the other hand, was what I loved. I ended up giving away my Udon and just eating the beef rice. Rip off to not do the combo Bc the bowl is tiny and the same size but cheaper if u do a combo. They WONT LET U SHARE! The beef was flavorful and paired super well with the rice. I would only come back for that not the Udon. I wasn't a fan of the tight spacing of the restaurant. Service was fine."
2/25/2018,20180225,5,4.3,"1. Best ramen in LA! The sea urchin ramen was rich and creamy. Flavor was perfectly balanced. 2. Braised pork ramen was delicious! The pork was cooked perfectly- tender and juicy. The broth was comforting and smooth. 3. The wait is long but worth it! You get to see how ramen is made while waiting for your food, if you sit next to the kitchen. Service was fast compared to the wait time."
2/25/2018,20180225,5,4.3,"Favorite place to eat! Gets pretty busy but just come early! Sea Urchin Udon is definitely the best seller but for a good reason, because it's so GOOD! Probably been here more than 5X and every time the food and service are exceptional. Definitely a must try if you are ever in the area"
2/26/2018,20180226,5,4.3,"If you're looking for udon with a twist, this is the place to go! They offer a variety of Italian fusion udon dishes including carbonara and clams with with white wine sauce. I stopped by on a Sunday night for 2 and there was about a 30 minute wait. The restaurant was tiny, but turnover was fairly quick. We started with the fried chicken as apps and it was delicious. It comes with a flavorful curry powder dip. For the udon, I tried the champon which seemed like a general soup broth with veggies and seafood. The noodles had a home made feel and were a good consistency. My friend had the carbonara which I had a taste of and it was rich and creamy. Overall, a great place to stop by for udon."
2/26/2018,20180226,5,4.3,I definitely like this location the most. I've tried at least six different types of udon from here and I've never been disappointed. The line is a bit of a wait but definitely worth it.
2/27/2018,20180227,5,4.3,"I didn't know this restaurant was affiliated to the one in Oahu! The concept was a little different since you order at the table. There were more selections versus in Oahu. The udon noodle itself was very fresh since they make it by hand. I ordered the beef udon and the broth was amazing. You can definitely taste the beef bone since they probably simmered it for a long time. The wait was pretty long since it's a popular spot even though we went for lunch on a Saturday. If you are craving for udon, check this place out!"
2/28/2018,20180228,4,4.3,"I went to this restaurant with high expectation, and had to wait for a while before being seated. I ordered sea urchin cream udon and hot dragon udon. Overall, noodles tasted really good and chewy since they were hand made. Sea urchin udon tasted something I had already expected becuase of the cream sauce. It was not something special. But hot dragon udon was really good and something that I did not expect. Chicken and prok broth was deep and delicious. I would recommend it for hangover."
3/1/2018,20180301,4,4.3,"A very uniqe experience - you won't find udon like Marugame's anywhere else! I had heard so much about the place and just had to check it out. Went around 1 pm on a weekday but it was still pretty packed. It's a cute restaurant with tightly packed wooden tables and chairs. My friend and I ordered the miso carbonara udon, kakuni udon, and shared a beef rice bowl. The rice bowls are only $3 with the udon during the lunch hour - I highly recommend you try it out. Thin slices of melt-in-your-mouth beef in what tasted like sukiyaki sauce served on a bed of Japanese rice and a side of pickled ginger. The miso carbonara udon tasted more like pasta than udon to me (though I am not complaining). It had the creamiest sauce and was topped with generous amounts of chopped bacon. I was unable to really taste the miso, however, so I was a little disappointed. Also, the portion size was a bit on the smaller side, considering it was $12+ The hot broth in the kakuni udon instantly warms you up. It was so rich, and the pork belly was fatty and perfectly cooked. I actually preferred this to the carbonara. Reminded me almost of shoyu ramen. Overall, a great place to get your udon fix."
3/3/2018,20180303,4,4.3,"My favorite orders, as listed: 1.) HOT DRAGON UDON2.) Miso Carbonara3.) Beef Udon3.) Cheese UdonDon't sleep on the under dog! I find myself ALWAYS going back to the hot dragon. (Thanks to Marugame for no longer making this a seasonal dish). The soup is a perfect medium of creamy and clear broth with crunchy bean sprouts, boasting just the right amount of flavor. Kind of like a ramen base but with thick, chewy udon noodles. The miso carbonara is rich and robust, unlike any other udon dishes I've tried. That bacon makes a good addition, hands down. Beef udon is always a safe go-to, and be prepared for a (happy) mini heart attack with the cheese udon. My advice is to go during dinner, because surprisingly, the restaurant is way more crowded at lunch peak hours!"
3/3/2018,20180303,4,4.3,"First experience having Ramen, I know, kinda weird but when I was growing up in the great city of Brooklyn, NYC, it just wasn't common in my area. Recommended to check it out by a co-worker. The wait can get a little out of control, but it is well worth it. I had the Udon Gratin, cheese galore. If you are lover of cheese, I highly recommend."
3/4/2018,20180304,5,4.3,"Super unique and delicious udon dishes! The wait will probably be long, but I promise, it is definitely worth it. I tried the pork belly as an appetizer and got the mentai squid butter udon with a tempura fishcake on the side. The braised pork belly was very flavourful and had a good amount of chew; it comes with about 5 large pieces, so it's a great option for sharing with friends. The mentai squid butter udon was packed with umami due to the generous amount of mentaiko (roe) incorporated in the broth! Moreover, the udon noodles themselves were very fresh and hand-cut in front of our eyes. Lastly, the tempura fishcake was pretty standard but tasty nonetheless.I came around 7:30 PM in the middle of the week and this place was packed. We waited outside for about 40 minutes until we were seated, but we were able to look through the menu while waiting. After being seated though, the service was really efficient and we got our food quickly! The interior of this place is bright and clean, with sleek hardwood tables and a nice bar seating area where you can see the noodles being hand-cut.I feel like ramen is usually more popular than udon, but Marugame Monzo really ups the udon game! Just writing this review is making me crave another warm, comforting bowl of udon..."
3/4/2018,20180304,5,4.3,"Parking structures nearby for $6 for the day. They also close I believe from 3:30-5:00 on the weekends as well, I would call in to double check, the yelp times may not be correct.This place is worth the wait! Udon noodles are hand made in front of you. Ordered the mentai squid butter udon ($12.95). Handmade noodles make it easy to grip with the chopsticks and the squid is soft. The broth is rich and flavorful, and filled with fish or squid eggs (I forgot which one). For this bowl, I would recommend chefs to add more broth and for the broth to be hotter. It was just warm and with little broth, it was tough to scoop up the broth to eat with my udon.Also got try the uni udon ($16.95), thick flavorful broth. If you are someone that doesn't enjoy seafood, you may start getting sick of it after 4-5 bites, as the rich creamy broth could be overwhelming."
3/4/2018,20180304,4,4.3,I decided to head to Little Tokyo for dinner and found the spot as soon as I saw Miso Carbonara Udon. It was a long walk from the hotel but it was well worth it. I probably should have gone more traditional but I loved the idea of Japanese Italian fusion. It's well worth a try!
3/4/2018,20180304,5,4.3,I was in LA for work and heard my hotel was next to Little Tokyo so I thought I'd eat dinner out! I chose this place based on the great reviews and was not disappointed. The creamy seafood udon with fish eggs was a delicious and comforting dish and I leaped up every last drop! I also recommend the fried calamari and the champagne sake. The champagne sake was $19 for a single serving bottle but so worth it!
3/4/2018,20180304,5,4.3,You can't beat the fresh udon noodles! But the wait during peak hours is so not fun. So make sure you're not in a rush if you want to eat here before heading somewhere else in DTLA.
3/5/2018,20180305,5,4.3,"Never knew Udon could be so good.....So I'm not so big on thick noodles, but I will keep coming to Marugame Monzo regardless!I ordered the mushroom cream udon and cherished every bite. If only kaedama was a thing here, I would have ordered another set of noodles. The Uni udon seems to be the go-to entree and it did not disappoint. We also split the chashu appetizer and the pork was so fatty and melted in our mouths.I was fortunate to not have to wait when coming here, but it seems like it's always a good wait. I will say, it's definitely worth it though!"
3/5/2018,20180305,5,4.3,"Don't be alarmed by the line outside! It could be for the daikoukuya ramen place next door but this place is just as yummy! My roomie and I came here on an empty stomach ready to devour some udon. We waited around 1:45pm and got seated in 30 mins. I ordered the lunch combo - carbonara miso udon and negitoro rice bowl while my roomie got the double portion curry udon. The negitoro rice bowl is so delicious that halfway through I forgot to try my udon! The udon has a firm texture but is soft as you bite into it. You can see at the bar that they make it fresh nonstop! So you know this place is going to be amazing if they are serving the best quality. Honestly, I got really full because it was so creamy. But it was worth it. My roomie's double portion curry udon was so humongous!!! They weren't skimping on the portion for sure. I think it's worth it to just get the regular portion because it's just as filling as any other dish."
3/6/2018,20180306,2,4.3,The last time we were here the taste kind weird and the broth was blend. The udon wasn't cook properly. This place used to be one of the best udon in town
3/7/2018,20180307,5,4.3,"They have one vegetarian udon, which also happens to be vegan. It's extremely flavorful and filling - both the creamy broth and the noodles are superb. And I love that you can watch them make the noodles in the kitchen! Highly recommend."
3/8/2018,20180308,4,4.3,"Amazing and delicious food await for your utter enjoyment. Simply put, how can you go wrong with freshly made pasta being spun right before your eyes! They are enormously busy for a good reason; great taste and excellent value! Arrived and placed our name on the list. Have been know to use ""Elvis"" as my name, but not this time. The list was short and didn't want the hassle of autographs :)Having been here many a times, was thinking and drooling of the many wonderful dishes available and the Saké to go along...nice! (See pic please)We settled on 2 appetizers, 2 noodle dishes, and 2 bottles of Saké. I was in a tutu dress mode. Appetizers: Pork Belly in broth. Tender and flavorful is putting it mildly. This was Pork at its finest! It came out hot and the belly went into my belly--4.5 starsSecond Appetizer: Calamari. Fried perfectly and crispy with great chunky calamari. Dowsed it with the lemon juice dripping all over and ...Bam! 4 stars Please note: Calamari must be consumed hot,, do not allow it to cool as we did.And now! For the Main Event!!Oodles and Oodles of Noodles!Miso Carbonara Udon- Savory creamy white sauce with gorgeous freshly made Udon noodles (i saw them spin it) and smoked bacon.(see pic) I love this dish! 5 stars! Hot Dragon Udon- Fresh Udon noodles in paitan soup. Paitan broth is full flavored soup base extracted from pork, chicken bone marrow and cartilage boiled for extended periods creating a broth too delicious for words. Yummy! It was an amazing taste as well!(Please see pic) 4 stars!The Saké and Beer selection is extensive and well rounded. My favorite page on the menu of course! This evening we opted for a Hakkaisan Junmai which has a floral aroma and is light but firm...superb!The service is attentive but quick and curt-no problem as they have lots of people to serve. Parking is a bit tricky as street parking tends to be full, but a garage across the street with set pricing after 6pm is available.Will return again and again......"
3/8/2018,20180308,5,4.3,"Best udon I've had in California. Wait time isn't bad at all. Plenty of parking structures around ranging from $6-15. Came here on a Sunday and there was over 10 parties ahead of us. Wrote our name down and assumed it'll be around an hour wait so me and my bf went exploring in Little Tokyo. Came back in 30 minutes and our names were already called. Put our names down again and waited another 20 mins. Squid butter udon - recommend. Squid was nice and firm. Didn't have the typical rubbery texture. Uni udon - recommend. Uni was more firm than expected. Seems like it was slightly fried? Makes it easier to grip the pieces with your udon Udon - handmade and fresh! If you sit at the bar, you can see the chef in action making the udon."
3/8/2018,20180308,5,4.3,"110% worth the hype. One of the most unique authentic restaurants I've ever been to. Me and two friends sat by the bar and got to watch our udon be made in front of us! You can really feel the love put into every dish. The toro appetizer was fun because you got to make diy handrolls and they were delicious and refreshing. I got the mushroom cream udon, and my friends got the curry udon and the champon udon. They were all great and unique from each other. The mushroom and curry broths were very thick and the champon was thinner, which is something to think about before you choose one. Some are creamy and saucy and others are more soup-like. I have no doubt each one is delicious. The other fun thing is you can get a ton of different sides, and you can get basically anything you could ever dream of tempura-fried. (Eggs, vegetables, seafood, etc.) I got a tempura soft-boiled egg (amazing) and the kakiage. DEFINITELY get the kakiage! Never had anything like it and I've tried a ton of tempura.The wait is annoying and the place is tiny, don't go with more than 1 or 2 people and try to hit it on an off peak time. We had to wait around 30 mins on a Tuesday night, not bad at all but I think we got pretty lucky. That being said it is worth the wait! Delicious, unique, fun, cheap... I will be coming back to impress all my friends. :)"
3/8/2018,20180308,5,4.3,This place is consistently good I came here when they first opened and have come back many times and the noodles have always been really good and fresh.
3/9/2018,20180309,5,4.3,"There was a bit of a wait, but they did their best to seat everyone as soon as possible. We were 3 people, and waited ~20 minutes around 7:30 PM on a Wednesday night.I had the sea urchin udon ramen, which was insanely good. If I had more time in town, I would definitely try other items from their menu."
3/11/2018,20180311,4,4.3,"We waited for about 40-45 minutes for two people on a Sunday around 2:30 pm. Service was quick and to the point. We ordered the uni udon, the shrimp tempura udon, two tempura soft boiled eggs and the negitoro rice bowl. Probably sticking to their specialty udons is a better route. I enjoyed my uni udon, it was nice and light almost felt like I was eating some type of Italian style cream pasta. The tempura soft boiled egg was made perfectly, no gray around the yolk. Everything was good but the broth was not something that would be remembered.I do not feel like I will come here again, mainly because someone has to physically wait there for your name to be called and we generally do not do long waits for food. Also because if we are out there we would rather go to Sushi Gen. But this -- as all reviews are very biased to my own restrictions. I would still recommend trying it, if you have time to kill."
3/12/2018,20180312,5,4.3,"Extremely legitimate udon, one of the best in LA. However, put your name on the list, prepare to use that 1 hour to explore and shop the anime stores across the street."
3/12/2018,20180312,4,4.3,"i love their fresh udon made from scratch. the line can be a little long on weekends before dinner time... so we try to head there just before lunch closing or right when dinner hours are open. other than that, we love all the food we've tried there from the appetizers to main entrees."
3/13/2018,20180313,5,4.3,"I tried their carbonara udon, which was on their specialty udon menu. It was creamy without being too oily, and did a good job of not being overbearingly cheesy. The udon is cut fresh by a chef behind a counter, which is pretty cool to watch, as he rolls like a foot of dough and shears it. The udon wasn't too thick, and had a bounciness that complimented the heaviness of the sauce really well. The slivers of ham were salty and rounded the dish. Amazing place for udon, and I'm surprised they're so small! Though, with food like that they have every right to make us wait!"
3/14/2018,20180314,4,4.3,"Overall, the service here is very quick and the employees are very nice. If you come at a good time , you won't have to wait for long . I came right before the rush so I was able to be seated right away, but about 5 mins after I was seated , a line and wait list started to build up with people waiting outside. The ramen was very good. I wish they provided pictures on their menus because some of their portions were a lot smaller than I expected."
3/15/2018,20180315,3,4.3,"I came here with two friends about 30 minutes before it opened for lunch, and I definitely am glad we did because we were immediately seated! The line grew super long when it was about 20 minutes to opening, so keep that in mind if you don't want to wait in a long line. I ordered the Miso Carbonara Udon, and while it tasted good for the first few bites, it became rather heavy and too creamy to eat. Also, I couldn't really taste the miso flavor amidst the heavy cream. I added the tempura soft-boiled egg to my order, which also arrived a bit cold. I also tasted my friend's Kakuni Udon (pork belly), and while the broth was super flavorful, I thought the pork belly could have been braised or stewed a bit longer since it wasn't the ""melt in your mouth"" texture. Overall, I'm glad I got to try this restaurant, but I'm not sure I would come back if I had to wait a long time!"
3/15/2018,20180315,5,4.3,"Best Udon place you will find in LA. I had pretty much everything on the menu, but I highly recommend the Uni Udon// Miso Carbonara Udon. To start off with an appetizer try out the Beef Tataki. The only downside is the wait time and there should be parking nearby. If you want free parking go park a couple blocks away."
3/16/2018,20180316,5,4.3,Best ramen ever. Hands down. I had creamy noodle and it was fantastic. Will come back for others. Downside is portion of noodle little bit small but if you order side bowl of rice then should be good. Overall it was good
3/17/2018,20180317,5,4.3,It's my #1 choice if I'd be looking to have a noodle soup. The absolute favorite is an udon with beef along with appetizer of rice+beef+raddish. This is something that keep coming back to my mind every other week. Way better than Daikokuya next door.
3/17/2018,20180317,4,4.3,Long line (worth it)AMAZING Udonvery bad air circulation in the space which is usually packed.my favorite: Seafood with tomato cream
3/17/2018,20180317,5,4.3,"My favorite udon place in the US. Try the sea urchin, just thinking about it makes my mouth water."
3/17/2018,20180317,5,4.3,"What more can I say about this place? Fresh udon noodles made right in front of your eyes, all the flavors on point, very friendly staffs and energetic atmosphere. Only sad part is the long line but it's so worth it!"
3/18/2018,20180318,5,4.3,"The best freshly handmade udon in all of Southern California, and if Marugame Monzo decides to open up a store in Japan it would make it in the top five best udon places in all of Japan! Yes it's that good! To start, it's hard to find handmade udon places. There are only a couple of places that actually make udon noodles fresh. Most places use pre-made factory noodles or frozen generic udon noodles. Marugame Monzo makes noodles fresh right in front of your eyes! Result is the chewy slightly thick noodles that goes well with the house sauce and soup broth. Brave the long line and you will be rewarded with the best udon that will make you slurp up the whole bowl!"
3/18/2018,20180318,4,4.3,"Okay! 4 stars because: good food and good waiters/ waitresses. I like how we can see the chefs cooking in the back. The noodles are very yummy and the broth is fresh and delicious! Tried the ""Hot Dragon Udon"", ""Miso Carbonara Udon"", and ""Beef Udon"". All of them were very tasty and filled us up. Also tried the pork belly bowl which was okay. I didn't give it 5 stars because our water was very unsanitary. There were flakes floating around in the water and a bug in my friend's water. They gave us new water without complaining(: We also had to wait about 15-20 minutes, but this is understandable. Overall, good place but not for large groups. Try it out!"
3/19/2018,20180319,5,4.3,"I am so happy I found this place! Despite an hour long wait for dinner, it was so worth it.We ordered Takoyaki ($5), Uni Cream Udon ($17), Curry Udon ($10), Choya Umeshu / plum wine ($6). I've also had the cold Beef Bukkake Udon ($1225 ) and the Duck Nanban Udon ($13.25) Everything was delicious! The takoyaki balls had so much umami flavor. The curry udon tasted exactly as it sounds and you can take the curry back to make curry rice the next day. The beef bukkake was one of the best cold udons I've had - very refreshing and clean but tasty! And the duck nanban was a table favorite - pure dashi umami flavor with tender pieces of duck. Plum wine is always delicious. But the highlight was the uni udon. This is the first time that I've had uni that didn't taste fishy. Literally, the first time - and that's include sushi shops in Tokyo, Nobu in NYC, etc. This is unheard of and a miracle. The uni was deliciously buttery and the uni with the roe added the brine needed to break up the creamy sauce. Highly recommended. This place is a treasure."
3/19/2018,20180319,5,4.3,I seriously wish they had more places like this. The udon was so good! I read a lot of reviews about the noodles and the Uni udon and they definitely lived up to the hype. I wanted to take some home but they don't do to go orders. The meal was not over priced which is always a sigh of relief at a place that's as popular as this. I love that they make their noodles in house and you can actually see them making them!
3/19/2018,20180319,4,4.3,"I've been here twice now and I always get the Hot Dragon Udon-- it's not very spicy, but I do enjoy the flavorful broth and the nicely textured noodles. We arrived on a Monday before 1PM and we waited maybe 5 min for a table for 2. The first time I ate here with a group of 3 on a Saturday evening, the wait time was much longer. I definitely recommend this place... And I don't typically like udon!"
3/19/2018,20180319,4,4.3,My first time coming here was skeptical of trying a new place out but I'm so glad I did! They are hand made noodles very delicious I loved it! Would definitely recommend this place!
3/20/2018,20180320,4,4.3,"Best udon noodles ever- freshly made and very chewy and flavorful. The place is packed but there was hardly any wait on a Monday at 8pm. I got the sea urchin udon and it was so rich and creamy. There wasn't a whole in this dish but it tasted amazing! The salmon roe and the tiny bit of sea urchin made the entire dish. I did wish they gave me more sea urchin and salmon roe though. It was the tiniest, barely visible to the naked eye piece of sea urchin and there was about 10 salmon roe eggs. Still a great meal though- I would just pick a different udon next time, one that has more ingredients for a lower price. Service was pretty fast, but they forgot our sake bomb!"
3/20/2018,20180320,5,4.3,"Oh man, just thinking of the uni udon makes my mouth water and brings back amazing memories. LOVED the uni udon if that wasn't obvious enough. It's a bit of a wait normally, so put your name down and take a walk to Japan Town. We did a little bit of shopping and came back to wait another 10 mins. Another reason for the long wait besides being popular, it's a small place. So seating is limited.Pricing, I feel like it's worth it for the quality. Sauce was delicious, noodles were cooked perfectly and uni was so yummy. I'll be back for sure."
3/21/2018,20180321,5,4.3,"There's a wait, but the food's well worth the wait.- Uni Cream UdonAMAZING!!! You just have to try it- Mentai Squid Butter UdonGreat, but can't compare to Uni Cream udon- Agedashi eggplantOkay, not overly greasy.- Assorted TempuraGood variety - included mushroom & eggplantI will definitely return here for the Uni Cream udon."
3/22/2018,20180322,4,4.3,"Definitely something to try when you're in LA!It's cool that you can see people making the freshly handmade noodles in front of you. The udon texture is very nice. The sea urchin cream udon only has a small piece of uni in it, but it's reasonable for the usual market price of uni. The broth of the sea urchin udon is nice not too rich or heavy, but a perfect touch. However, my boyfriend got the hot dragon udon and it wasn't really spicy or flavorful."
3/23/2018,20180323,4,4.3,"#TheLatestFoodNewz""Udon know, how much you mean to me.""Tonight was just one of those nights where something hot hits the spot! Came across two Japanese restaurants next to each other. Both seem to be good, judging by the long lines. But it was the freshly made Udon Noodles that convinced me to enter! Particularly the...Rare Miso Carbonara UDON!A creamy white sauce transformed together with egg yolk and shards of Bacon. Topped it off with freshly sliced noodles. Every bite encourages you for the next one and next one, until you're sauced out. Carbonara sauce was on a different level. Score: 9/10Recommend: Definitely Service: Fast & the Furious!Menu: Choices choices!Average wait time at night: 16min. And that's all for #TheLatestFoodNewz"
3/23/2018,20180323,4,4.3,Fried chicken skin appetizer is really good and tasty. Pairs well with the shrimp tempura udon! This time I tried the clam udon which was good but I still prefer the shrimp tempura. Bf tried the mentai squid butter and we both thought it was okay. Not as tasty as all the others.
3/24/2018,20180324,5,4.3,BEST UDON IN LA. Always go and order their signature seafood tomato based udon and I've got to say it's the most amazing Udon ever.
3/25/2018,20180325,5,4.3,"Udon in Los Angeles, there is nowhere else to go. The wait doesn't even matter!! And you will wait. Unless you are standing in front of the door when they open, be prepared to wait...and wait some more. On a Saturday night at 8:45 there was a crowd huddled around the door and the list was lengthy. They even had a cut off that stated if your name was past a certain point, you may not get seated. Again, worth the risk. Name on the list, and over to Far Bar to get a drink. Fortunately, not everyone is as dedicated and when we checked back at 9:20, we were next on the list! YAAAAASSSSS!!!!! At Monzo you can watch the chefs hand cut the noodles, they are thick and never soggy... they are heaven on earth. My favorite and go-to is the Chandon. It's veggies and seafood in a pork broth (the menu doesn't say pork broth but it is, I asked). Shrimp and scallops with the best udon noodles in LA, you cannot go wrong!!!! I also recommend the shrimp tempura udon, it is a lighter broth. The shrimp is perfectly fried and when you dip them in the broth, the tempura soaks up the soup goodness. YUMMMMMYYYYY!The carbonara is a signature dish here! It's ridic it's so good! But a little too heavy for my taste. The broth is thick, flavor full and filling. Thick chunks of bacon, so good!"
3/25/2018,20180325,1,4.3,"This place is definitely over rated! Although their udon is handmade, it tastes the same as the udon that you can buy from any Japanese market. I ordered the chicken tempura udon and the chicken tempura was very oily with thick tempura wrap."
3/26/2018,20180326,5,4.3,"Marugame is always worth the wait. Doesn't matter what day, what time--the udon noodles are always fresh and chewy perfections. Each dish is beautiful and perfectly seasoned. The wait staff and hostesses are friendly and totally understanding that you're starving from waiting in the long line because every DTLA local knows this place is good. Little Tokyo is already a banging good time, Marugame Monzo just makes everything a little better and has something for everyone--classics for the traditionalists and edgy modern for the ig foodies out there. But this place is by no means just another trendy restaurant, its been a staple for too long to get that particular title."
3/27/2018,20180327,5,4.3,It was my first time at Monzo and I got the sea urchin udon. I normally don't like creamy/seafood but this is so good! The wait can be a bit long but if you go around lunch time or 5-6pm the wait is about 30 minutes. Definitely worth a try.
3/27/2018,20180327,4,4.3,Good Udon noodle and good soup. I love this place also it was long line so it's take some time to take seat.
3/28/2018,20180328,5,4.3,The best Udon I had in a while. I had the Carbonara and couldn't get enough of it. this place definitively worth the wait.
3/29/2018,20180329,4,4.3,"First time I came here I really thought the price and food was not worth it. I tried the regular ol beef udon last time, reminded me of the instant udon you can buy at the 99 ranch market. However, talking with friends made me want to try something else because they agreed with me but insisted that I tried something else. This time I sat down and saw a girl next to me order something that look super appetizing. I ordered the Udon Gratin and was not dissapointed. Taste amazing although it was so filling I only managed to finish half. Portion is an adequate amount. Overall really glad I gave it another shot. I do recommend getting anything creamy from this place. For the wait however, its hard to predict but I waited around an hour to get seated, not worth an hour of wait in my opinion but I guess its unavoidable sometimes. (The photo attached is my friend Carbonara Bacon Udon and the top is the Seafood Urchin Udon)"
3/30/2018,20180330,5,4.3,"This was the best udon I have ever had. It's the kind of food that just might change your life, and udon will never be the same.I got the Ankake Udon, a bowl of shitake mushroom-filled goodness. The broth is incredible, the noodles are chewy goodness, and the onions tie the meal together.I came alone on a Tuesday and had no wait time. They make the noodles in front of you; service is fast and friendly, and the price is more than reasonable. No take out, dine in only.I can't wait to come back!"
3/31/2018,20180331,5,4.3,Still as good as the first time. I got the sea urchin Cream udon and the noodles were perfect. I love that it's so creamy and the sea urchin doesn't taste too oceany. I noticed that the sea urchin was a tad bit sautéed as well. My boyfriend did the lunch special with the pork belly rice bowl. It's the perfect side and the rice was seasoned which made it 10x better! The service was quick and the wait wasn't too bad. They call your name three times and if you don't show within the last call your off the list
3/31/2018,20180331,3,4.3,I've had much better udon in NYC - I don't feel that this one is worth the waitThe pricing is decent but I truly feel there is better udon in LA as wellIf this place didn't always have a crazy line I would be willing to try it again
4/1/2018,20180401,5,4.3,"This is my boyfriends favorite place and I understand why! This is now my favorite udon place because the customer service was attentive, and the udon noodles was chewy but firm, and the broth was super flavorful.I got the Duck Nanban udon and the duck was soft but chewy, and it soaked up the broth which was really good. My boyfriend got the curry udon and it was also really good. The curry tastes like japanese curry but it was more thick. It has little bits of beef in it as well.The portion definitely fills you up, and the price is pretty cheap for high quality food! I would for sure come back."
4/1/2018,20180401,4,4.3,"Relatively crowded on a Sunday, which was expected. Waited about 35 minutes to seat our party of 4. The restaurant is small, which is once again expected in LA. Tip: make sure your party is there by the time you are called because If not they will skip to another party. I got carbonara udon, which is basically carbonara and udon. It was creamy and I was savoring every bite! I definitely recommend that dish. Service was relatively quick and we didn't have to wait for our food to come. I'm only giving this place a 4 because it's very cramped and it's hard to move around. I would come back to this place if I'm around j-town! This place is also very close to Japanese village plaza. So you can grab a bite then easily roam around after."
4/1/2018,20180401,5,4.3,"I love going here, but it's really popular now so it's hard to get a seat without waiting for a long time! I'm glad they're doing well though, since this is my favorite udon joint in Los Angeles. Their noodles are always handmade and have the perfect chewy consistency you come to expect from high quality noodles. I love their shrimp tempura the most, though it seems the Uni udon is the most popular dish. Their tempura is flavorful and cooked just right. Definitely order a tempura egg, it's so unique and delicious. The price is reasonable too. If you decide to go, make sure you sit at the counter! You'll get a noodle making show if you're lucky."
4/3/2018,20180403,5,4.3,"CHEESY UDON. Basically Japanese pasta. I've never seen anything like this. Luckily (or unluckily?) we arrived at 2 because traffic was bad coming from the LAX car rental. Fortunately there wasn't a line and the kitchen was still open, so we were seated right away.I ordered the Miso Carbonara, which comes with bacon. The udon is so, so fresh - you can tell they made it fresh in-house as you can see the chefs making the udon noodles from a glass window on the kitchen wall. Creamy sauce and GENEROUS amounts of chopped bacon - and not just bacon bites, but bacon PIECES. I tasted zero miso, but I ain't complaining - my stomach was happy with the comfort food of carbonara udon.Be warned... this is ONE HEAVY DISH. Come when you're starving, not when you're even an ounce full."
4/3/2018,20180403,4,4.3,"I've heard so much about Marugame Monzo's uni udon and I finally got the chance to try it. Wow. The handmade noodles are so chewy and not a second overcooked. The broth is incredibly rich and creamy, and is fully infused with the uni flavor. It definitely resembles a drinkable creamy white pasta sauce. Who knew udon could be made like this. I just wish that the udon came with more pieces of uni. The few pieces they gave me were so small. I also really didn't like the roe because it was so salty, so I ended up not eating any of it. My friends got the carbonara and the pork belly udon. Both were also very delicious. The carbonara udon is very similar to the uni udon, but doesn't have the seafood taste from the uni. The pork belly udon is a traditional clear broth udon, and the tender pork belly just melts in your mouth. Yum.We came on a Saturday around 6 pm for early dinner and waited 30 minutes, which was exactly what the server estimated. Their timeliness didn't end there. Our food came out very quickly after we ordered, too. Parking can be pretty scare around the area, but we were able to easily find a metered parking spot.Overall, I enjoyed my udon, but I don't think I would come back. The focus of their udon is definitely the udon and the broth. While delicious, I prefer to have my udon noddles as a base for proteins and vegetables, not the other way around. It's definitely worth a try, though!"
4/3/2018,20180403,5,4.3,"Cold sansai Udon was the way to go. Delicious noodles. The vegetables in it are amazing! Also a must get is the beef rice bowl. Do the combo, pretty good deal. Love the rice bowl. The meat is flavored beautifully. Don't be fooled by the seemingly small bowl, there is plenty of rice and meat."
4/4/2018,20180404,5,4.3,"OMG! I THINK I DIED AND WENT TO FOOD HEAVEN! The udon here is a-mazing! You can see them make the noodles fresh. I had the sea urchin udon, and literally wanted to cry because it was so good! I tried my friends carbonara udon and it was just as amazing. Seriously worth the wait. I will seriously recommend this place to anyone like it's my religion."
4/4/2018,20180404,5,4.3,"This udon specialty restaurant is located on the far side of Little Tokyo with an unsuspecting storefront that does not do justice to the food served here. I have been back multiple times, tried a multitude of dishes, and have never been disappointed. The service here is always top notch, with the servers being extremely courteous and patient whenever coming here. Now the food. The food is fantastic. This is quite literally the best udon I've had in my life. Here is what I have tried here.Uni Udon: This was a sea urchin cream based udon. The salty flavor of the uni with the creamy broth paired perfectly and the noodles were perfectly cooked, just like the rest of the dishes. The added salmon roe on top added small bursts of refreshing ocean-salty flavor in the dish.Mentai Squid Butter Udon: This udon has a lighter broth, but was almost just as rich in taste as the rest. The squid was perfectly soft and paired very well with the lighter broth. Miso Carbonara Udon: The creamy sauce with a generous helping of bacon on top was absolutely fantastic. For some, the pure umami bomb that is this dish may be too much, but I loved it. Overall, this is an absolutely amazing restaurant and I highly recommend everyone to try this place at least once, maybe twice. P.S. Just make sure you prepare for the giant line outside."
4/4/2018,20180404,5,4.3,First time ever getting Japanese noodles. Delicious! Generous portions as well. Friendly staff with quick attentive service.
4/5/2018,20180405,5,4.3,Probably my #1 recommendation for people wanting to eat in Little Tokyo. I like watching them make the udon noodles behind the glass and then eating fresh noodles minutes later. Fairly crowded most of the time but worth the wait.
4/5/2018,20180405,4,4.3,"Fresh chewy noodles with an interesting variety of broths. Very good and fast service, and you can watch how everyone does. I recommend you to go early time because there is long line every time."
4/6/2018,20180406,5,4.3,"If you're in Little Tokyo and don't mind a possible 15-minute queue, come check this place out. Don't worry, it's not the same queue as the famous ramen (Daikokuya) a few doors down. Imagine that a fresh glutinous udon noodle and an Italian creamy carbonara sauce got married and had a baby. Boom- carbonara udon! Not only is Marugame Monzo known for the freshness of their udon (made in sight behind a glass window), but also for their fun and creative flavors. If you like Japanese curry, they have that type of udon too. Sometimes udon can feel heavy, but whatever special ingredients goes into the noodles doesn't give that feeling. Good thing, that way you can keep eating and eating. Prices are affordable; the average udon bowl is $12.95."
4/7/2018,20180407,5,4.3,"This place is almost like a ""hole in the wall"" the entrance is a bit small and kinda easy to miss and the whole block is lined up with a lot of restaurants. Although they are opened for dinner, on the weekdays if you're there when it opens you should get a seat right away, if your there during the weekends, it could be a bit of a wait.The udon noodles are made fresh in house, there is a window view you can watch them twirl, flip, stretch the noodles.I been here a few times and I always find myself going back and forth between ordering the squid butter or red Dragon , both are very good, the red Dragon I like for the little kick in spice and flavour, the squid butter is great for when I want something creamy and smooth."
4/7/2018,20180407,3,4.3,"Family of four came here on a Friday morning for Spring break and got there exactly at 11:30. There was a line forming. As we didn't want to wait for the famous ramen next door, we opt to eat here. We all got something different from the speciality Udon to the cold Udon. All of the stuff we ordered lacked flavor and I honestly would not come back again. Three stars is because we enjoyed watching the guy make fresh Udon and service was friendly."
4/8/2018,20180408,5,4.3,Super good udon and very interesting menu choices! Yummy and worth the wait. (Around 10 minutes- not bad). Definitely recommend :-)
4/8/2018,20180408,5,4.3,"Great service, thr food was on point - SO DAMN GOOD!I got the Kalamari and the Curry Udon - high reccomendad!"
4/9/2018,20180409,5,4.3,"4.5, but rounding up.First things first, the slight detraction there was for the service - it was a bit too fast and chaotic. We were approached by three different waiters and waitresses throughout every part of the meal, and there was absolutely no communication between them, so we'd answer to the first, and have to repeat ""We told someone else"" twice. Amazingly enough, the food still came out quickly and correctly, and the meal was superb.The uni udon was probably my favorite. It was really heavy in flavor and weight on the tongue, but the cream brought everything together. With this, we also ordered the salmon roe rice bowl as part of the lunch combo, which was surprisingly refreshing. The shiso leaf they give you was light, and balanced the noodles well.The cold udon dishes were also good, and may be more of a viable option on extremely hot days. Overall, they're like eating udon noodles in a soba broth, but the radish and spring onions lift everything in terms of lightness.Usually a wait outside, but chances are they're for the ramen shop next door."
4/10/2018,20180410,4,4.3,"Food: 3/5 starsService: 5/5 starsFrom the great ratings and reviews I've seen on yelp, I decided to check this place out one night. There was a huge crowd outside waiting to get seated so I thought we would have to wait for at least an hour (for two people). Surprisingly, we only waited around 15 minutes. The restaurant itself is quite small and is located right next to Daikokuya. We ordered right away and the food got to us pretty quickly. I ordered the beef udon and my friend got the most popular creamy one. It was pretty decent, but not at all what I was expecting. The broth was flavorful, but a little too sweet for my liking and came out warm not hot. My friend's had a hair in hers and noticed it right away. Once informed, the waiter quickly apologized and returned with a new bowl within 5minutes! Their customer service was impeccable. Although I wasn't super into my bowl of udon, my friend enjoyed hers. Maybe I'll try a different bowl next time!"
4/10/2018,20180410,4,4.3,"Personally the hype gave me unrealistic expectations or maybe it was due to having physically located next to one of the best ramen shops in all of Socal just inflated their image. Honestly i believe about 1/3 of their customer base on the weekends come from ppl who are tired of waiting at daikoukuya, just saying. Is it a good bowl of udon, yes, is it worth standing in line for, meh"
4/10/2018,20180410,5,4.3,"After hearing so many good things about this place, my boyfriend and I finally got to try it out. We arrived around 6:30 PM on a busy Friday night. To our expectations, there was a huge crowd of people around the restaurant. We waited for about 40 minutes, not bad considering how many people were waiting as well. Just a heads up though, if you aren't there when your name is called then they cross out your name and move on to the next group. Lots of groups left and came back only to find out their names were already called and their spot had been given away. Service was quick and nice. The ambiance of the restaurant was very fast paced, with a majority of people coming in, eating quickly, and leaving to make space for the next group of people. We ordered the beef udon with the tempura egg and a side of mixed tempura to share. OMG. Let me tell you the portion sizes are huge!! We honestly did not expect such a big bowl of udon. The amount of udon to meat ratio was amazing. I found myself drinking almost all of the soup because it was that good! While many people say to get the tempura egg, I honestly thought it was just ok. The texture is nice and perfectly soft boiled but overall it was just ok. Overall this place has very tasty udon and tempura with quick service. The price isn't so bad either! After ordering 2 bowls of beef udon, 2 tempura eggs, mixed tempura, and one beer the total came out to about $45. Not bad at all. Will definitely recommend to a friend and will be returning to try the more creamy udon selections next time."
4/10/2018,20180410,5,4.3,"Fresh handmade, handcut udon noodles. Watching them made before your eyes is very entertaining. Try their mountain vegetable udon! Amazing quality of veggies. Broth is clean, not too heavy or salty, 55!"
4/12/2018,20180412,5,4.3,"Second time eating at this place and it doesn't disappoint! The uni pasta was very filled, added on the rice bowl and I was over the top full. Great for lunch but closes at 2/3 if i recall. Expect a wait. No outside drinks allowed inside so be weary."
4/13/2018,20180413,4,4.3,"They make their own udon noodles which is awesome. They have traditional Japanese udon noodles and some special ones that you won't find in regular Japanese restaurant. Tried the chanpon udon which was good! It's pretty big in portion too. There is always a long line, but worth a wait. Make sure you write your name on the list!"
4/14/2018,20180414,5,4.3,"5+ Yelp stars for the best udon ever.Udon noodles are my favorite noodles of all. And I've had udon in other restaurants that were good, and even great. But the udon at Marugame Monzo take the cake, by far. Incredibly fresh, delicious and the perfect texture, they are also offered with a variety of different seasonings and toppings.If you haven't been here yet, put it on the top of your list. We arrived right at 11:30 am in order to get counter seats so we could see the noodles being made. So much fun to have a free show during lunch! The line for lunch can be really long, so get there early. Typical Little Tokyo parking situation."
4/14/2018,20180414,5,4.3,"Wooow this place is so good! I definitely had my doubts about it when my friends suggested we come here since I'm usually not a fan of udon. However, I was pleasantly wrong about what it would taste like. I got the lunch special which included a choice of udon with a bowl of rice on the side. For the amount of food you get, it was a really decent price! I got the first udon on the menu (blanking on the name) carbonara something- anyways- it was so good I couldn't stop eating! When I was full I was staring at the bowl, trying to figure out how I could stuff the rest in. Man. It was like eating a creamier version of pasta but with better noodles. The broth/sauce was so smooth and flavorful. I swear I still think about this meal whenever I get hungry.I would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Little Tokyo again! We came ten minutes before opening and there was a line so plan ahead if you don't want to wait. Even if you have to wait though-the food is worth it!"
4/14/2018,20180414,5,4.3,Really good texture on the noodles on a traditional setting. Would definitely be coming back!
4/15/2018,20180415,2,4.3,"Food is amazing. Definitely recommend the creamy urchin udon however this review is more for the service received. Our waitress was initially rude when taking our order; when we would point to the menu item, she would respond with ""what is that?"", keep in mind that in fear of butchering the names we just directed her to the menu item. Afterwards our food was brought to us by another server and she never came by to ask if anything was needed or if the food was ok. I understands it's a tiny venue. The problem we had was when we signed the check and left a cash tip we were asked by this same waitress why we did not tip more. I left what I deemed was reasonable given the service. Not sure if I'll go back given the impression I received. If you don't mind being question about your tip then definitely recommend."
4/16/2018,20180416,5,4.3,"First meal of the day and it was absolutely filling, amazing and perfect. Went with the lunch special that they have on the menu where it includes an udon dish and a mini rice bowl of your choice from the menu. I ordered the chicken tempura udon and the pork belly rice bowl. The broth of the soup was very tasty where i finished the whole bowl. Chicken tempura was nice and crisp just like any other chicken tempura and juicy inside. The pork belly was very thin and flavorful! The wait wasn't long at all and the service was fantastic! Highly recommend this place!"
4/16/2018,20180416,5,4.3,"Not gonna lie...this place was worth the hype! I got a 2nd entree cause it was that good!!! I got the Seafood Urchin and Udon Gratin. Both were AMAZING. These dishes are unique to this place, so it's at least worth a try. Portions are tiny, the place is packed (so be prepared to wait), and the restaurant is small. But the food taste is what makes it all ok!!"
4/16/2018,20180416,5,4.3,"Sooooo good. A unique and must visit when in Little Tokyo!Dinner is always popping and the wait is usually pretty long. You can put your name down and explore nearby Little Tokyo while waiting. There's really limited street parking so I usually park in a nearby parking structure that is pretty cheap for several hours. The sea urchin udon is soooo good. Really creamy and satisfying but not overpowering in flavor. The little pieces of uni floating in the broth melt in your mouth. Udon actually isn't my favorite kind of noodle, but here they get the udon right. It's honestly an experience everyone should have. It's kind of pricey but really worth it. The beef tataki here is also great but honestly I didn't need to order that because the udon was more than filling."
4/16/2018,20180416,5,4.3,"The uni udon is DELICIOUSVery thick and creamy. The portions are too big, but the broth makes it very filling.The wait wasn't too long either about 20 minutes, but we came around 1 on a Monday.One of the best udon noodles I've had!"
4/18/2018,20180418,4,4.3,"Super good!Went in at 5 when it opened and didn't have to wait at all. We ordered the Negitoro roll, assorted tempura, fried chicken, sea urchin udon, carbonara udon, and the vegetarian udon.Everything was done very well!All the appetizers were very tasty, negotoro roll was my favorite.As far as Udon, wow. I've never had udon like that before. Very good (but honestly I prefer ramen for the price and type of food)Very rich and intense flavors. Favorite was the Uni (Sea Urchin) udon. Flavor was ever so slightly better than the carbonara. Everything was very well done, staff was friendly and the service was quick."
4/18/2018,20180418,5,4.3,"Wow, I love this place already and my friend and I only tried the basic clear soup udon (beef and veggie). I'm definitely coming back to try their creamy soups. Their portions are perfectly sized for a big appetite!"
4/19/2018,20180419,5,4.3,"I seriously must have lived under a rock all my life...cause I've pretty much lived in LA my entire life but have not once tried Marugame Monzo. I FINALLY decided to try it with a group of friends on a Thursday night (I got lucky and didn't have to wait thaaat long like what a lot of people say) and ended up going with the Sea Urchin Udon (Uni Udon). HOLY CRAP WAS I BLOWN AWAY. The texture was the udon was just perfect along with the creaminess of the uni blended into the creamy sauce. I had extra sauce left when I finished and my friend ended up using it to dip his dipping noodles and fried chicken with. I kid you not I went back again that weekend and got had to get it again hahaAnyone who's from LA and hasn't tried this place yet, don't be like me and live under that rock of yours. MUST TRYYYYY~"
4/19/2018,20180419,4,4.3,"The best ever Udon place in this area! I am usually not a noodle person, but I gave it a try, I ordered the hot dragaon udon (i love spicy so muchhhh and thats the only option there) I love the soup base thick and creamy and the udon is so smooth! I will definitely try their cold udon next time :)The only downside would be it's extremely hard to find street parking in little tokyo, and you gotta pay $5 for parking in the tokyo plaza just across the street :(("
4/20/2018,20180420,5,4.3,"The focus of Monzo is their udon and in this they are exceptional. Upon entering one is greeted by quick and attentive servers. Although English is not a first language for most of them, they have an unrelenting energy to make sure all the customers are happy which is impressive and appreciated when the restaurant is always full and there is a line out the door. The kitchen is entirely visible through a glass wall and you can often find one of the chefs hand crafting udon noodles with painstaking care. The results of such meticulous work is evident in the quality of their food. The menu features hot or cold udon options to which you can modify with extra noodles as well as their signature udon which you cannot modify in this way. The signature section features many Italian inspired udon combinations, all of which are delicious. This time I got the sea urchin udon, a creamy sauce with uni and topped with salmon roe and a common favorite among patrons. It might not showcase the flavors of the noodles as a more traditional cold noodle option might, the sauce is the focus here. It is a successful fusion of an unconventional combination: a creamy Italian inspired base while maintaining the subtlety and delicacy of the flavors of its Japanese components. If you're feeling a cold option, try out the zaru udon. If you're feeling a hot option, the kake or kitsune with add-ons to taste. Either way you can't really mess this one up."
4/20/2018,20180420,5,4.3,Come early! It gets crowded. This is my favorite Japanese spot. The food is delicious & It's fun to sit at the bar & watch the cooks work hard chopping up fresh noodles. Nothing beats this spot to me I've been 4x & I can't wait to come back for my next experience. Thanks Marugame Monzo!
4/22/2018,20180422,5,4.3,Shiso mentai cold udon. Delicious. Order combo and try bowl of negitoro without mayo/sauce.
4/22/2018,20180422,5,4.3,Food was great and all the staffs were so friendly! (especially Makoto N. -san. Thanks!)
4/25/2018,20180425,4,4.3,"I was told about this place by my cousin who's also been to Marukame in Honolulu so the BF and I were interested in checking out this place for sometime now. We drove by the place where there appeared to be a long line of people waiting for the place to open already so the BF dropped me off and got in line to wait. As soon as they opened, the folks there literally sat probably the first 30-35 people that were in line. I was next in line and there was one table left for two and because the BF wasn't with me as they were about to sit me they made me put my name on their waiting list and sit the couple that was waiting in line behind. I can't tell you how irritated I was by that because the BF came moments later after I had to write my name down on the waiting list and he was extremely irritated and didn't even want to leave a tip. Don't worry, we did leave a tip once we finished our food. About 30 minutes or so later, we were seated at a table and since we looked over the menu while we were waiting we ordered our food right away. I went with their signature sea urchin udon and the BF went with the pork belly udon and a pork belly rice bowl on the side. Once we got our food and tasted the dishes, our angst against the place went away. The food is very much worth the wait. The uni udon was full of flavor and there was a lot of uni in it to my surprise. I thought there wouldn't be as much but glad there was. We were both also surprised by the pork belly udon because we didn't think the udon would have giant pieces of pork belly in it. We were anticipating it to be sliced thinly but no, they were giant pieces. We weren't mad at it though. So if you decide to come here, be willing to wait and have your entire party with you when you come. We will definitely be back."
4/25/2018,20180425,5,4.31,"How have I not written a review for this place yet!!? There are a plethora of Japanese restaurants in Little Tokyo but I don't crave anything else as much as I crave Marugame. Their menu is extensive and everything is so good. Any type of flavor you're craving, they have it! They do usually have a LONG wait unless you go right as they open, so be prepared to walk around little Tokyo until your name is called. I don't think they give phone calls or anything but they do tell you an approximate wait so just be sure to be back so they don't skip your name! During lunch they have lunch sets which was A LOT more food than I thought & boy was I stuffed. But you can always pack the rice bowls if anything so order to your heart's content! You won't regret it!!"
4/25/2018,20180425,5,4.31,"I didn't have any expectations heading into this experience nor was I really craving udon at the time. Solely upon looking through the menu, however, I became instantly intrigued. In addition to traditional hot and cold udon combinations, there were unique and exciting ""signature"" udon with cream sauces, Italian flares, and more. Being a cream sauce and cream of ""insert food name here"" soup addict myself, I was extremely excited to try a cream sauce based udon.For experimental purposes, we opted to try two different signature udon - the Hot Dragon Udon with paitan soup and the Sea Urchin Udon with cream sauce. The former wasn't bad but it was not spicy (to my taste) even though it was advertised as such, and it was bland compared to the latter udon. The Sea Urchin Udon, on the other hand, was a complex explosion of textures and flavors in my mouth. The udon noodles were tender and obviously fresh. The sauce was rich, creamy, and plenty. The sea urchin was well portioned and only mildly fishy. The salmon eggs, too, delivered a small but sufficient burst of fishiness when they popped in my mouth. I had no shame slurping up the remainder of the cream sauce when there was nothing else left, and I avoided drinking water post-meal for fear of losing the taste on my tongue.I'm writing this review nearly one week after visiting Marugame Monzo, and I'm still just as excited to go back as when I left after dinner that night. The question is not if I'll go back but what I will order when I do. I'm itching to try more of their signature udon, but I am so in love with the Sea Urchin Udon and I'm not sure I have the self-restraint to order anything in its place. I guess I'll find out soon..."
4/25/2018,20180425,5,4.31,"Looooooooved the sea urchin udon!!!! Went there at 7pm on a Tuesday night. Waited about 30 mins. Ordered the sea urchin udon, creamy tomato seafood udon, toro wrap, takoyaki and 1 drink. Paid 65$. Everything was really good. Would come back."
4/25/2018,20180425,2,4.3,"I love Japanese food, but this place left me cold. It just wasn't worth the long wait for a table and the noodles were nothing to write home about."

The kitchen has a see through glass type of work space where you can watch all the chefs at work making udon and doing everything. Would definitely recommend some type of reservation system to minimize the wait time."
4/26/2018,20180426,5,4.3,"The best udon. Handmaid, you can actually see them making it in the open kitchen area. Get the Uni udon. So delicious and creamy. Usually a long wait so get there early before the line gets crazy."

4/26/2018,20180426,5,4.31,Five stars! Really good food here! Great place for soup and a good place to bring good company. So good! Service was fast. Food was very tasty and flavorful.

4/28/2018,20180428,5,4.31,"Consistently delicious and good service. Been here several times and I only order the Uni creamy udon fromthe specialty udon menu. It's such a smooth, mild, and flavorful taste. It isn't a typical way to serve udon, but somehow it's so perfect!! Udon is made in house and you can see the master working hard behind a glass window. It's solid, but not heavy. Wonderful texture with a satisfying bite & chew. Always cooked to perfection. The $2.95 kakiage is also amazing. Delicious and a great deal for the amount of food. It's a high stack tempura with thin sliced veggies, baby scallops, & shrimp. Both items are on the MUST TRY list. Beef Tataki is s great opener. Tender rare sliced beef with light oil drizzle, chopped pickled radish, and Japanese chili powder sprinkled gently for a little heat."

But it IS very heavy and thick, and I got tired of the flavor after a while. I enjoyed the squid more than the uni, but I will say the uni is super worth it. You get a ton of uni for the $17. Next time I'll definitely get one of these and then make my bf get a traditional udon to share!Also bowls look small, but you will DEFINITELY be full after."
4/30/2018,20180430,5,4.31,"UPDATE #1: We went back for dinner exactly one week later, I reordered the sea urchin cream udon, and it was JUST as perfect! I love this place! The cold udon is a different animal, but it was absolutely delicious too!UPDATE #2: Call us crazy, but we had dinner here for the third Thursday in a row. After rock climbing for a couple of hours, I was ready to chow. down. Typically, soup is not something that I crave or comes to mind whenever I am really hungry because it hasn't usually got much substance and it leaves me feeling hungry soon after. Nevertheless, Marugame Monzo and its many udon were on my mind. I summoned up the will power to order something other than a white cream sauce based udon this time and settled on the curry udon. The spices in the curry-based broth left a gentle tingle on my tongue. It was more reminiscent of Indian curry than its Thai counterpart. As odd as it may sound, it reminded me of a Wienerschnitzel chili dog - YUM! Atop were plenty of chopped green onions, which added a nice crunch to the mix of creamy broth and chewy noodles. I expected the pork belly slices to be thickly cut (as is chashu pork in ramen), but it was sliced rather thinly (more like the brisket you'd find at an AYCE KBBQ restaurant). It had excellent flavor and was well-distributed throughout the entire dish. Needless to say, I left feeling happy, full, and excited for my next visit!"

I left this place still hungry and I would've been down for seconds if I felt baller enough."

5/4/2018,20180504,5,4.31,Would definitely suggest to come before it opens but there's still no guarantee to not wait a little. I came at 5 pm (when they opened) and waited about 10-15 minutes. The food was worth the wait and there are a lot of different options to choose from. I ordered the miso carbonara udon ($12.95) and I hope to go back soon to try all the other udon they have. I parked across the street in the Japanese Village Plaza and just bought something in that plaza to get validation because the restaurant doesn't validate.

However, I do feel the need to make occasional visits for their homemade, delicious udon.Large glass windows for the kitchen allows for admiration of chefs pulling long udon noodles. If you can score some seating right in front of this window, you'd be entertained for sure. If not, prepare for some tight seating where you will intimately dine with other customers near you. While I have enjoyed several dishes, the miso carbonara continues to be an all-time winner and ultimate indulgent dish that I continue to re-order. You can't go wrong with this. Thick, creamy sauce with chewy udon noodles. You will slurp it all up."
5/5/2018,20180505,5,4.31,This is by far the BEST udon place I have ever been to!!! Seeing the noodles made fresh in front of you was the ultimate dining experience. Their uni udon and mushroom cream udon were out of this world for a very reasonable price. we also tried the pork belly!! SO GOOD! 10/10 deff coming back! -Wyatt & Rox

5/6/2018,20180506,4,4.31,"I'm giving 5star for overall consistency as well as how the dish has improved from several months ago. I only get the uni udon whenever I come here. A few months ago, the uni in the bowl was sparse, even almost negligible to say the least in terms of quantity and quality. There would be max 2 pieces of small, black uni that did not taste anything like fresh uni. Fast forward today, I could actually see many pieces of uni which were orangey, not black/brown. Apart from the uni complaint, the cream broth is super tasty and will surely satisfy any cream lovers out there. Beware though that the bowl serving isn't mega huge or anything. I usually get a bowl of uni udon and a negitoro wrap to fill me up. Also service is super fast once you are seated and you will soon forget how long you waited in line (if you did) and be drifting to udon heaven."
5/6/2018,20180506,2,4.31,Belongs to the toilet-sized restaurant category thus there's always a line.Me and a friend waited one hour to get seated. The food quality is not worth the wait.There's a special lunch combo which we decided to share between us. They don't allow for sharing of special combo- which means if u don't come here alone you can't order the combo.Funny business practice. Good luck to them.

5/7/2018,20180507,5,4.31,"There's a reason why this restaurant has the longest line on the block and you'll just have to taste it for yourself. Clearly they're known for the udon noodles- which are absolutely amazing. The udon noodles are handmade at the restaurant and cooked to perfection. My table ordered a few appetizers along with the sea urchin, curry, and carbonara bacon udon dishes. All were delicious. I grew up eating a lot of udon noodles and this was the first time having it in a warm, creamy, savory sauce along with sea urchin. I'm a huge fan of Asian fusion dishes and this place definitely hits the spot! I'm not sure when I'll ever have these noodles again as I was just visiting LA for a day :-(. Easy street metered parking or paid public parking right across the street! Average price for a dish is ~$13."
5/7/2018,20180507,5,4.31,My favorite udon or Japanese noodle soup of any type in LA and I live right near Sawtelle. My husband and I go here and bring friends here at every opportunity. I usually get the kake udon with some tempura fixings and my husband often goes for one of the special udons. Everything is always mouth-watering and the quality of execution is frankly astonishing for the price. There are no substitutions; it's always worth the wait.
5/7/2018,20180507,4,4.31,"TL;DR - Quality of food is still great! Try their uni udon or the mentai squid butter udon. But for me, beef udon for the win. Prepare for ~$20 per person.Well, throughout the years I've tasted this place, I can say that the taste quality of the place has gone down. But don't get me wrong, the taste probably went down from a 5-star to a 4-star place. Nonetheless, this place is one of the places you must try for an udon restaurant in LA.This place does beef udon justice. Though you can find beef udon in many restaurants, this place is easily one of the best. The broth was satisfying to drink, the udon was not too soft and not too hard, but the best part was the beef. Crispy ends, tender, and carries the broth well. Some green onions on every bite, plus a helping scoop of the broth and udon really makes one's Saturday.And, of course, the staple recommendation from this place will be the mentai squid butter udon and the uni udon! These two were ones I've tried before and they were amazing! This past weekend, not as much, but still great!Parking is quite hard to find, but find it! Staff was great and made sure that we were taken care of. The line in this place during lunch and dinner hours do build up quickly, so coming at odd hours might help you get a seat faster. Coming in parties of 2 also helps because they have many more small tables compared to larger groups.The prices of each udon dish is fair, in my opinion. They're pricey yet leaves you feeling full. Do their lunch combo which pairs your udon with a rice bowl for a few dollars extra ($3-$4 if memory serves correct)Well, all in all, I'll always recommend this place to others if they like udon!"

5/8/2018,20180508,5,4.31,"Marugame Monzo holds true to every positive statement that exists to its name. The homemade udon noodles are unbelievable, yet the ingredients and combinations this little joint offers is what sets the place above the bar. If you're reading this I'm sure you're already familiar with the famous miso uni udon, but let me tell you, it is to die for. There will be a wait to be seated but once you are at your table, service is so efficient you will be served in no time. I can't wait to go back, love this hidden gem in little Tokyo!"
5/8/2018,20180508,5,4.31,Came here during the weekday and there was no wait. We found parking on the street(meter parking) at first we had a hard time finding it until we saw across the street the word 'monzo' The insides interior is very quaint. We came around 6 and there was no wait. We were seating immediately. We sat in front of a glass window where we could see them making the udon noodles. I got the creamy uni udon and my boyfriend got the bacon creamy udon. This is one of the best uni pasta-like dish I have had. I couldn't finish it and it was still good to-go later that night. My boyfriend loved his as well. Very creamy and the udon was cooked to perfection. The price range is roughly $20 a person
5/8/2018,20180508,5,4.31,"Udon creatively reimagined while somehow not seeming contrived, really nicely done variations on udon. The mentai udon and the carbonara udon are really fantastic. Don't be repelled by the line, it's worth the wait. I actually managed to get in at around noon on a Saturday, I think the lines just get more intense later in the afternoon and in the evening."
5/9/2018,20180509,4,4.31,"Another place I encountered during my jury service last month. I prefer udon much more than the ramen most people love eating. I tried the uni cream udon (hot) and the mentake (sp?) udon (cold). Both were good. I also ordered a pumpkin tempura on the side, it was a decently large piece and fried nicely for I think $1.50 or $2 extra. I don't know if I could justify coming here multiple times due to the price. But definitely a place you should try if you enjoy udon. It's a good lunch spot due to the setup, kind of like going to a street ramen shop where you just sit and eat and go."
5/9/2018,20180509,4,4.31,"We arrived at about 7 pm on a Tuesday and only waited for about 10 minutes. I got the bukkake udon (cold udon with bonito flakes, green onion, grated daikon, tempura flakes and dashi). My boyfriend got the miso carbonara. I wish that the dashi had been more savory/ salty, as all I could taste was the blandness of the daikon. Texturally, the daikon also created a mushy, gritty mouthfeel despite the crunchy bits of tempura flake. Perhaps next time I will get the kake udon (hot udon) so that I can experience the flavors better. The noodles were lovely though; properly chewy and slippery like good udon should be. The miso carbonara is on their specialty menu, and it was like carbonara pasta with udon noodles. Super strange but somehow yummy. The bacon flavor was very pronounced and the miso sauce almost tasted like an Italian cream sauce. While I don't expect that he'll order it again, it was an interesting dish. We plan to return sometime to try other menu items."
5/10/2018,20180510,3,4.31,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon for late lunch. We ordered the sea urchin udon, hot dragon udon, and two negitoro rice bowls. The sea urchin udon was simply mediocre, it was just creamy with a hint of uni flavor. It just tasted like a carbonara pasta with uni. We were quite disappointed with it. The hot dragon udon was good, but also, just mediocre. I don't know if it was just my udon bowl but it was overall bland with minimal flavor. Was not spicy at all either.The negitoro rice bowl, however, was so good! We both really enjoyed this. I would come back just for this! I highly recommend everyone to try this!"
5/10/2018,20180510,5,4.31,"I visited the location in Vegas back in March during my husbands birthday trip, my husband is a HUGE udon fan and any time he can time it on the menu that is what he will order. When i was writing a review for the one on Vegas i saw there was a location in LA so i knew i had to surprise him with a trip to check it out. We went on a random Thursday for lunch since neither of us wanted to deal with DTLA traffic. Got there around 12:30 the restaurant was full for their lunch rush, we waited about 5 mins for a table which isn't bad at all. Even with the restaurant being full our food came out very quickly. My husband got a cold udon dish and i got the udon gratin. The gratin was amazing!!!!! So rich and creamy, the onions mixed in magically. My husband really enjoyed his as well just wish i could remember the name of what he got lol."
5/11/2018,20180511,4,4.31,"The signature udons here are really good! We tried the miso carbonara udon & the sea urchin udon. The signature udon tastes more like a pasta but with the udon noodle. They have the regular hot udon as well as cold udon, so you have a variety to choose from! But I highly recommend trying one of their signatures because it seems pretty unique and it's very flavorful. The sea urchin udon was a little on the pricer side ($16.95) and the portion size wasn't too filling. But I guess it's more about the quality than the quantity here. If it wasn't so pricey, I would probably come back a lot more to get this udon!Note that there always seems to be a wait for this place. I've come on a Thursday night as well as a Friday night, and both times I've waited at least 30 minutes for a table of 2. It's also pretty difficult finding street parking since it's located in Little Tokyo."
5/11/2018,20180511,5,4.31,"Delicious handcrafted udon noodles! My friends and I went about 30 minutes after they opened for dinner and was able to snag some seats with little wait. Service was great, fast, and friendly. The food was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my Uni Udon bowl even though it was expensive. It was buttery and flavorful!My friends got the: mentai squid Udon, a spicy Udon (forgot the name), and dipping Udon.For appetizers, we tried their fried chicken skin and calamari.Overall it was a fun visit and we hope to come back and try other items from their menu!"
5/11/2018,20180511,4,4.31,"I ordered the famous sea urchin (uni) cream udon. The food came up after 15-20 minutes which felt like forever because I was really hungry. Fortunately, just like the other reviews say, the cream/soup is thick but very tasty. They give quite a generous portion of uni considering the price ($16.95). The udon itself is very tender yet does not lack the bouncy texture. Overall the food is really great.The only reason I gave them 4 star is because I think they gave very little udon. While they were generous about the cream and uni, I felt like the proportion of the udon and the cream was a bit off. I even compared my portion with my friends' food and we all agreed that mine had less udon compared to theirs. As someone who loves carbs, I was hoping to get more udon since they have absolutely amazing udon."
5/11/2018,20180511,5,4.31,"We came quite early for dinner at 5:30pm on Monday. There was no wait. We did have a baby stroller and they politely asked us if we could fold it and they can store it away in the corner which was no big deal.We got a few appetizers, my favorite was the chicken skin! At first there was not much flavor, but the sauce is on the bottom. It would definitely be better if they made the sauce for dipping instead of the bottom of the bowl. But it was delicious and crispy so long as you didn't let it sit on the sauce too long. Anyways, on to the main udon! It was great texture and flavor. I got the gratin udon - only order this if you are a cheese lover. I went with my 3 years old nephew and he was confused why I'm eating out of the pan and where is my plate... haha. He was like how come??? Definitely worth the trip! I would come back again!"
5/12/2018,20180512,5,4.31,"Marugame Monzo in Little TokyoIt's been a while my last visit here. Like their take on the Uni pasta with the homemade noodles. The kitchen is transparent and you can actually see the chefs in the kitchen making those yummy noodles. Got the Uni with the udon noodles in that creamy sauce, and a couple of the shrimp tempura...tastes so good, probably so bad=gluten + carbs :(Being a pasta snob, I would only consider eating this because it is homemade and it tastes good. I do wish they would put more Uni, even if they charge more because it's worth it. Got try this, definitely recommend and will return."
5/13/2018,20180513,4,4.31,"Great spot for Udon and their recipes are fantastic! I only wish they have larger quantity. But besides that, would have given them a 5 star!"
5/14/2018,20180514,5,4.31,"Finally got to try this spot out yesterday after wanting to for so long, and I already can't wait to come back. While we were expecting to wait for 30 min or more, we got lucky and came at the right moment where we got seated in less than 5 minutes. My bowl was called The Hot Dragon, and it was delicious! Slightly spicy, but not too much. Also pictured is a side of rice with pork belly, which had the perfect amount of rice and meat, and the meat was just the right amount of salty. The whole order also came out super fast as well! If you want udon, go. Be prepared for a wait as it in a popular spot, but it's absolutely worth it"

I had ordered a warm udon (not too sure which one) with the vegetable tempura as a side. Their serving size is bigger than average, so don't worry about not leaving the place without a full or over-content stomach. This place might not be ideal for dates, seeing that it is a bit of a loud environment with fast moving servers, and the wait outside for your seat may be long, but it's a great place for a one-on-one casual lunch or dinner!"

They have a counter with see-through glass window on stretching the udon and cooking it finely.Lovely and tasty! I was in seafood haven."

5/21/2018,20180521,1,4.31,"I came here last night at 9:28 pm is when i walked into this establishment. I put my name down on the list as well. It was nearing 10 pm and i asked the hostess how much longer would our wait be she informed me RUDELY that she didnt even know if we were going to be seated due to the fact that its almost closing time. Im like okay? but i was here 30 mins prior and no one informed me that its not guarenteed. I have never in my 26 years heard of a restaurant that tells its customer its a gamble if you will be seated or not. If im in the restaurant BEFORE you close i should be guarenteed service. Anyways the NEXT big problem is we did get seated. And i asked the waitress if she could give me some suggestions as i never really had udon before. She mentioned that the sea urchin udon is super popular and i would love it. Im like okay sold. And i also ordered a tuna bowl which was very very yummy. However I get my udon and im not really liking it. Nothing to blame the chef , its just my own taste buds isnt agreeing with the taste of the cream it was too over powering for me. I couldnt find my waitress so i asked another waiter who was an young asian male. I politely told him i dont like the udon, its not agreeing with me and before i could get out my next sentence to ask if i had time to switch to something else he rudely cut me off and said "" well im sorry you cant take it back, we dont do take backs here"" At this point im absolutely stunned and confused what type of restaurant this is. He said these exact words "" oh well sorry you cant take it back, you didnt know what you were ordering before? why order something you may not like. You never had sea urchin before? you shouldve already known"" Its absolutely disgusting to ever speak to someone like that especially someone who is here to spend money. I really would like a manager to contact me about this. I am not sure why this waiter thought it was okay to go back and forth with me and belittle me in front of people. As of now i will NEVER be back to this establishment."
5/21/2018,20180521,5,4.31,"YUM is how I would describe this place. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and put our name down for a party of 4. There were 13 parties ahead of us so we decided to walk around in Little Tokyo for about 30 mins, but when we came back they had already moved way past onto the next page, so the wait moved pretty quickly!I got the Miso Carbonara Udon which was my table's favorite choice, with the Curry Udon as the second choice. If you are a fan of creamy Italian-Asian fusion taste noodles the miso carbonara would be a great choice! The curry udon was a little more watery than the Sawtelle location, but it could have just been based on who made it that day. I personally prefer it with a thicker consistency.Parking in the area is terrible as usual with d*ckhead drivers everywhere, but we parked at the $8 valet at the hotel across the street.*For those who are super hungry you can make your noodles a double portion if it is a ""hot udon""!**Don't be intimidated by the huge crowd waiting outside the shop! The crowd is a mix of both Daikokiya and Marugume Monzo customers!*"
5/21/2018,20180521,5,4.31,"Came here two days in a row cause it was so good on day one. I came on a Friday right when they opened, my mom and I got to the line at about 11:25 and there were already a lot of people in line. Thankfully we were able to get seated immediately. The next day, I came around 1:30 pm and the wait time was only 30 minutes (probably cause Eats Con and a few other food events were going on in LA this past weekend). Day 1: I ordered the Creamy Uni Udon, and my mom ordered the Hot Dragon Udon. The uni udon was really rich and creamy and tasted pretty good. The broth of the Hot Dragon was flavorful, and although it's advertised as spicy, I felt like there was just a slight kick (I like pretty spicy foods so this might just be personal preference). Regardless, both were really good and flavorful.Day 2: I ordered the Creamy Tomato Seafood Udon and my friend got the Creamy Uni and a side of the Negitoro rice bowl. In my opinion, the creamy tomato was better than the creamy uni. The creamy tomato had a nice acidity that balanced well with the creaminess of the dish. I added the spicy powder they have in shakers on the table for a slight kick, but I think I'll order a side of chili oil next time. I also really enjoyed the seafood in the dish, which consisted of baby scallops (or maybe just small pieces, idk for sure) and shrimp. There was also a good amount of scallops and shrimp as well, not just a few pieces. My friend's creamy uni udon sauce had a thinner consistency that made the dish taste better, making me wish that my uni dish had the same consistency when I ordered it the day before. I forgot to ask my friend what he thought of the Negitoro rice bowl but his fat ass devoured the thing pretty quickly so I'm assuming it was good. Overall, this place definitely lives up to its hype, and as a self proclaimed noodle lover, I would definitely come back to try all the different styles of udon they offer. Also, the service is great. The service was quick, friendly, and consistent for both my visits."

Day 1: I ordered the Creamy Uni Udon, and my mom ordered the Hot Dragon Udon. The uni udon was really rich and creamy and tasted pretty good. The broth of the Hot Dragon was flavorful, and although it's advertised as spicy, I felt like there was just a slight kick (I like pretty spicy foods so this might just be personal preference). Regardless, both were really good and flavorful.Day 2: I ordered the Creamy Tomato Seafood Udon and my friend got the Creamy Uni and a side of the Negitoro rice bowl. In my opinion, the creamy tomato was better than the creamy uni. The creamy tomato had a nice acidity that balanced well with the creaminess of the dish. I added the spicy powder they have in shakers on the table for a slight kick, but I think I'll order a side of chili oil next time. I also really enjoyed the seafood in the dish, which consisted of baby scallops (or maybe just small pieces, idk for sure) and shrimp. There was also a good amount of scallops and shrimp as well, not just a few pieces. My friend's creamy uni udon sauce had a thinner consistency that made the dish taste better, making me wish that my uni dish had the same consistency when I ordered it the day before. I forgot to ask my friend what he thought of the Negitoro rice bowl but his fat ass devoured the thing pretty quickly so I'm assuming it was good. Overall, this place definitely lives up to its hype, and as a self proclaimed noodle lover, I would definitely come back to try all the different styles of udon they offer. Also, the service is great. The service was quick, friendly, and consistent for both my visits."
5/21/2018,20180521,4,4.31,"Why 4 stars... To begin with, I am not very adventurous eater and are very weary when stepping out of my comfort zone. I did like this place and I would definitely come back to enjoy the freshly made noodles. Would I recommend it, absolutely!.... the downside, there's a long wait most of the time. They are so popular, reservations are non existent here."
5/21/2018,20180521,5,4.31,"YUM is how I would describe this place. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and put our name down for a party of 4. There were 13 parties ahead of us so we decided to walk around in Little Tokyo for about 30 mins, but when we came back they had already moved way past onto the next page, so the wait moved pretty quickly!I got the Miso Carbonara Udon which was my table's favorite choice, with the Curry Udon as the second choice. If you are a fan of creamy Italian-Asian fusion taste noodles the miso carbonara would be a great choice! The curry udon was a little more watery than the Sawtelle location, but it could have just been based on who made it that day. I personally prefer it with a thicker consistency.Parking in the area is terrible as usual with d*ckhead drivers everywhere, but we parked at the $8 valet at the hotel across the street.*For those who are super hungry you can make your noodles a double portion if it is a ""hot udon""!**Don't be intimidated by the huge crowd waiting outside the shop! The crowd is a mix of both Daikokiya and Marugume Monzo customers!*"
5/21/2018,20180521,1,4.31,A peice of plastic was found in the water. Thank god that my girlfriend found it before I drank it. It could have chocked me. They should care more about their hygiene.
5/22/2018,20180522,5,4.31,The Udon noodles are very good and so is the rice. We had a party of 6 and were seated right away which was nice. Service was great and prompt. Would definitely go back.
5/22/2018,20180522,5,4.31,"Finally got to try this place after years of not wanting to wait in line . Anyway, it was about a 20-30 min wait which was much better than it usually is (up to an hour) because the place is small...like You'll-be-able-to-hear-your-neighbors'-convos-and-accidentally-hit-their-elbows kinda small. Got the uni pasta. Great flavor for the first three bites...and then it was just too much for me. I think it's more of a shared dish to not be overwhelmed by its creaminess."
5/23/2018,20180523,3,4.31,Decided to finally try this place since there was a very short wait and I was in the area. The mentai cream seafood came with cheap bay scallops and bay shrimp and both were overcooked. There was some cod roe cooked into the sauce with a dollop on top that was raw for you to mix in. Cream sauce itself was not too heavy and made well however it was incredibly over salted. 2.5/5The bolognese special was much too acidic and did not pair well with the udon at all. I like the addition of eggplant in the meat sauce but it was undercooked and was instead detrimental overall. 2.5/5Mixing both together was a more pleasant flavor as the salty seafood helped cut the high acidity in the tomato and the cream helped the sauce adhere to the udon. 3/5The actual udon was good. Cooked just about right with good bite. 4/5Always felt like it was hype driving this place as the pictures of the uni look horrible but so many people still keep lining up...
5/23/2018,20180523,5,4.31,"My friends had suggested this place on my trip this past weekend. They are known to have a long wait so I showed up around 630 to put my name down. Most people put their name down and go off to explore but keep in mind that they will only call your name twice and move on. Because of that, my wait ended up being like 15 mins instead of 45.Upon walking in, you can see the open kitchen view and a guy making the udon fresh. The restaurant is small and quaint (hence the wait). After reading reviews and based on the suggestions from my friends, we ordered the miso clams, creamy uni udon, curry udon with pork, and the mentai squid butter.The udon was creamy sauce with a good amount of sea urchin. The portion was a bit small. My 2 friends and I split each bowl but if I were to eat it on my own, it probably would not be enough. The curry has a kick of spice to it and was more saucy then soupy but very good. My least favorite was probably the squid butter.I would definitely come back for the uni udon but probably not if I had to wait an hour."
5/24/2018,20180524,4,4.31,"Been here a few times, great service and good food. Parking is a beach but the food is worth it. Light and refreshing, fried chicken was phenomneal and gotta get the champ udon, the sea urchin udon, and the tiger one. Beef tataki is okay, too well done if you ask me but its overall a light refreshing dinner"
5/25/2018,20180525,2,4.31,"If you're going to come here, you should definitely get a signature udon of theirs because all the basic ones are pretty lacking in flavor and Umami. The beef udon and cold udon don't have much really going on for them and are just so plain. The broth is extremely basic but it's the fact that the udon is tasteless and has so much alkalinity that doesn't absorb the soup makes for just dry pasta eating.Their chashu bowl add on was extremely good though for an add on. I recommend either the miso carbonara/uni cream, but otherwise don't try going for any basic udon. Also the soft boiled egg is literally a soft boiled egg, WITHOUT SEASONING. Kind of a sad let down that it's also $1.50 for a basic egg"
5/25/2018,20180525,4,4.31,Wow what can I say...this place is beyond delicious. Ordered the mushroom cream udon with pumpkin tempura and boiled egg. It was creamy and savory. My boyfriend order the urchin udon and also delicious. My only comment would be that perhaps they lighten up their cream sauces with a tad of broth it ends up really tasting like pasta more than what I was expecting. I still loved it but I may make that request next time. Also the place is insanely snug. I was elbow to elbow with the table next to me.
5/26/2018,20180526,5,4.31,"In reality, the Bolognese Udon did not look like the picture of it on the Specials Menu; the udon sat in a pool of bolognese ""broth"" rather than being coated by a bolognese sauce, and lots of chopped vegetables accompanied the ground beef. Though we were caught off guard by this stark difference, any doubts were quickly put to rest upon first bite. This dish reminded my dad and I of grandma's spaghetti with crushed tomatoes and ground meat, a childhood favorite for us both."
5/26/2018,20180526,5,4.31,"Must visit! Came here during my trip to LA due to everyone recommending me to go, and I'm glad I listened. I got the Uni udon and wow....I was blown away. I went in without any expectations and left speechless... You have to try it to believe it."
5/27/2018,20180527,5,4.31,"udon gratin is my favorite thing to get here!wait time can be really long, but it's so worth it.it's very small and crowded so not very good for large groups or parties"
5/28/2018,20180528,5,4.31,"This was really really good udon. Service was great !! And even with long lines, it goes by pretty quickly."
5/28/2018,20180528,2,4.31,"I ordered Champon Udon. Overcooked cabbages, black burned residuals, salty soup with so much msg that I have to drink a lot of water....."
5/29/2018,20180529,4,4.31,"Tried the sea urchin udon and the spicy pork udon. They both were yummy. The noodles seem to be the star of the show and the noodles was chewy to the right consistency. The sea urchin cream sauce seems to be a little more creamy than I would like. There is no acidity to cut the creaminess and no vegetables to cut it either. It seems noodles + sauce rather than noodles + soup. The spicy pork udon was good, there are bean sprouts and ground pork but provided different textures and tastes than just pure noodle and soups. Overall, great place. Would return if craving udon or if the ramen place next door is too packed"
5/31/2018,20180531,5,4.31,"I ordered shrimp tempura udon, and I lived it. My husband ordered the creamy one (I forgot the name, but it was the most expensive one). It was not my favorite. It is a very small and cute place. I would like to come back."
6/1/2018,20180601,2,4.31,I like the food the 1st time was amazing the 2nd time was a disappointment. And they charged us 12$ tip without asking us wtf
6/2/2018,20180602,5,4.31,Excellent homemade Udon! I liked that you could watch the chefs making the noodles too.I had the tomato cream udon with shrimp and scallops. My friend had the creamy uni udon. Presentation was on point. Tasted fantastic.I can see why this restaurant is always full. All good food here!

6/2/2018,20180602,5,4.31,i am now making coming here a staple everytime i visit LA. the uni ramen is something I haven't been able to find in NY and the most heavenly creamy ramen creation is the closest thing to nirvana I have experienced. all parties must be there before they will seat you.
6/3/2018,20180603,5,4.31,"I finally get the chance to try this place out! It was about a 30 min wait on a Sunday around 1pm so it wasn't bad at all. I was happy to be seated right where they were making the udon noodles. The interior is small, but clean. It got a bit warm in there. Granted it was 90 degrees outside.I had the uni udon and the sauce was delicious. The udon noodles were the best I've had. The staff came at a timely manner and were all friendly. No complaints in that department.There's parking garages everywhere and metered parking.I'm definitely coming back and ordering some other different dishes."
6/3/2018,20180603,5,4.31,"Freshly made udon paired with my favorite buttery flavored uni. Definitely only for uni lovers! And this uni udon is in a thick creamy sauce. Not for everyone but I love it! If it's not for you, try the lighter soup based options. Lunch specials available if you add +$3 or $4, then you can pick a bowl of rice with beef/pork/etc. I chose the pork belly rice bowl and it's pretty good. I arrived early in the morning at 11:35am and there is still a long line on a Saturday. So expect to line up and at least $15+. Will come back to try other flavors. Overall udon is exquisite. Parking not available but can park across the street in the Japanese village plaza or if you are lucky to find street parking."

6/4/2018,20180604,5,4.31,Seeing the pics again make my mouth water at how good the udon was here. It was well worth the 45-60 minute wait for dinner. I got the Miso Cabonara Udon and it was Sooo good. The thick rich creamy broth clings onto the handmade springy udon noodles! The bacon was just the cherry on top. It was a decent filling portion since it was creamy. Tried one of my friend's clams and it was pretty good too.Overall positive experience. The only downside is that it's a small place so it was tricky timing to try to fit a party of 8.
6/4/2018,20180604,3,4.31,Disappointed by my visit yesterday as the uni in my uni udon was very over cooked/burnt. Pretty sad because I've been craving this for a while and went and bore through the long wait. Also seems like the portions have gotten smaller compared to before.
6/4/2018,20180604,5,4.31,"Delicious and fun. I wish it wasn't so far from me. Parking is annoying, save yourself the trouble and Uber/Lyft here. Plenty of dessert spots to walk to afterward. Only get the large noodle if you are known to have a big appetite or if you're sharing with another person!"
6/4/2018,20180604,5,4.31,"Finally was able to try this place after having it bookmarked for years! It was DELICIOUS.Came on a Saturday for lunch at around 12:30, and waited for about half an hour for a table. The wait didn't seem too bad, lots of people were walking in and out of the restaurant so the turnaround seemed decently quick.Had the chicken tempura udon which is just chicken tempura on the side and a regular udon bowl. Also had the pork belly rice bowl and the miso carbonara udon, and a side of shrimp tempura. Everything was absolutely delicious! AND not that salty!!! The worst thing was the chicken tempura as they were a bit soggy and the chicken was dry. But everything else really hit the spot.Can't wait to come back!"

Actually, don't forget the sake.I don't know why else you would come here and wait in their giant line, but the hype is SOO worth it. The broth is just a rich umami flavor that is unlike anything else. Very seafood, but also very creamy and buttery. Just try it!!There was a girl next to my table who asked for recommendation from her server and even before ordering the uni, said ""umm what if I don't like it but okay"", ordered the expensive uni bowl and then sent it back and didn't pay/tip for anything. BISH this is not Applebee's! Or Costco!!!! Why would you come out here and wait hours just to turn your nose up at the food!! I was about to chase that server down and be like gimme the uni bowl I will slurp it down happily. Felt pretty bad for her friend but my boyfriend and I raised our brows, looked at each other, and returned to our uni and sake bliss. We also tried the mentai butter cream udon (with scallop!) which was also delicious, and had a thin cream broth. Boo yah."

6/6/2018,20180606,3,4.31,"I was extremely excited to come here because of the amazing reviews and made about three attempts to come here due to the wait. There seems to always be a line at this place, but my friend and I came here on a weekday for lunch and surprisingly there was no wait! We got seated right away and there were still a bunch of empty seats. The space itself is pretty small and you are pretty close to the table next to you but that was not a big deal for us. I ordered the Miso Carbonara Udon and the soup base was really rich and creamy, but I thought the portion size was so small, I was still hungry after I finished my bowl. The noodles were pretty good but not the best that I have eaten. My friend got the beef udon, and that one wasn't that good. The beef was not great and reminded me of over cooked fatty beef at hot pot and the sou base was alright, nothing too amazing. Once again, the portion was pretty small and we were def. not full after our meal. I'm not sure if we just did not order the right items or if we over-hyped this place for ourselves but we did not find it to be amazing."

I have tried about 4 different udons here and can say they have always been great. I personally like the Squid butter and the Uni. I know everyone always comes here to eat the Uni one, but the Squid one is definitely worth a try. The other sides like the beef tatake, tempura or the Pork bowl is great as well. Writing this review makes me want to come back already!"

6/8/2018,20180608,5,4.31,"I've never really cared for udon, because it always seems too thick and lacking of flavor... but U DON know udon until you've tried Marugame Monzo!Don't be too afraid of the long lines. Half of the crowd is for the next door ramen shop. I put my name down at 7:15pm on a Saturday evening for three. We were seated in an hour and our food came out fairly quickly. Shoutout to my friend Wiseley F. for his recommendation on the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. It was amazing!!! The soup was not too heavy, yet not too light either. The handmade udon noodles were perfectly al dente. My boyfriend ordered the curry udon. I tried a bit, but curry didn't seem as special. Get the Squid Butter!!! Excuse all the exclamation points I've used throughout my review... I get super excited for restaurants with great food and service. I can't wait to go back!"
6/8/2018,20180608,4,4.31,"I came here on a Friday night and there was a long line. Despite that, it was a relatively quick wait.I got the Miso Carbonara Udon and it was really good. The sauce was very rich and creamy, I savored every bite. However, I was disappointed with the amount of meat that was in the udon. I had a few pieces of bacon. To compensate for the lack of meat, I ordered the tempura soft boiled egg and tempura chicken. The tempura egg was reallllllly good.I will definitely be coming back to check out the other menu options."
6/10/2018,20180610,5,4.31,"Although the lines here are always super long, Marugame Monzo is definitely worth a try! My preferred strategy is to arrive a little bit before they open to make sure I get in for the first round of seating.I've tried several of their signature udons, but my favorite is the seafood tomato cream udon. It's creamy without being too thick and has the perfect level of that tomato acidity. Sometimes I'll pack up the leftover sauce and add more noodles to it the next day. Besides having interesting and flavorful soups/sauces, the udon here also has a great texture. Free/metered parking is hard to come by in this area, but there are several parking garages within walking distance."
6/10/2018,20180610,4,4.31,"The hype is real, if you like uni and noodles, this is your place! The uni udon is amazing! You can watch them make the fresh udon through a window. The wait can be long, but if you arrive before they open and be in the first round of tables sat - you're good! The service has always been good as well. Parking is a little inconvenient but so are most la restaurants. I would pass on the the tempura squid - was kind of tasteless and chewy but other than that everything else I've tried was good!"
6/11/2018,20180611,4,4.31,"Although I've been here several times, I'm still always in awe when I see them making fresh udon noodles. The noodles are so fresh with the perfect bite and bounciness. I usually try to come here on weekdays because it's crazy busy on the weekends/peak dining hours. It's awesome that they have lunch specials on weekends! The negitoro rice bowl is my favorite. They use a heavy hand on the sauces- mayo and ""sweet sauce"". If you would like to taste more of the fatty tuna, you should them to adjust the amount of sauces they use. I always mean to ask but forget. The hubs like the sea urchin udon. It's extremely creamy and rich. I prefer the lighter udons, such as the hot dragon udon and kake udon. The hot dragon udon could be a tad spicier. The menu has a nice mix of hot, cold, and the more non-traditional udons that should cater to everyone's palette."
6/11/2018,20180611,5,4.31,Best udon place ever! Fast service despite the busy times and limited space. Servers are also very nice and sweet. Can't get any better!!!
6/12/2018,20180612,4,4.31,"Arrived for lunch on Friday a little after 1PM.  The wait staff was incredibly efficient and attentive. We were able to get in and out of the restaurant in 45 minutes (I know because we had a parking spot for only 1 hour). Even with this efficiency, we were still about to fully enjoy our delicious food. We got the Uni Cream Udon, a otoro rice bowl, and a ikura rice bowl. This was a nice light lunch for under $30 for two people. The Uni Cream Udon has such a wonderful and unique flavor and the noodles were perfectly chewy. It is definitely worth a try. The two rice bowls were fairly standard. They both had nice, light flavors. Everything tasted fresh, not fishy."
6/13/2018,20180613,5,4.31,"This place is hands down one of the best udon places that I've been to. Extra points for hand making their own noodles: they're extra soft and smooth and ultimate perfect! Came here a third time and did not disappoint. This time I was prepared and knew what to order (my first time here I ordered udon with a broth that wasn't as good). I got the creamy mushroom, which tasted sort of Alfredo sauce but better and definitely less creamier. My husband got the seafood udon and he really enjoyed it. We ordered tempura boiled egg with our udon and it was delicious. This places is awesome, the bowls are big (beware you will get full) and they have a good selection of Japanese beers that I haven't seen anywhere else. Great place if you beat the dinner crowd, but even so, the wait is rarely more than 30 minutes (in my opinion)."
6/13/2018,20180613,5,4.31,Noodles made in store and cooked perfectly! Absolutely delicious even for someone who doesn't usually eat udon. Got the traditional with tempura and he fusion tomato sauce one. They were both very tasty and yummy!!
6/14/2018,20180614,5,4.31,"The best udon place that I know of!Tons of options ranging from cold, hot, and their signature udons. They also have a good variety of sides that are just as bomb. Prices are affordable and definitely worth it. The line may get long at times, so come early or be prepared. I do notice that the line does move pretty fast though. Definitely worth the wait!"
6/14/2018,20180614,5,4.31,"The best Udon noodles I've ever had! The noodles were cut to the perfect width and cooked to the perfect tenderness. And so fresh! I think we had the best seat in the house when we went: a seat facing the staff rolling and cutting the noodles. This place is extremely authentic in their approach and the deliciousness of the food is the proof that they're doing it right. This was my first trip to Little Tokyo, but this will be a staple every time I come back. If you're dining here, ordering one of the dishes with Udon noodles is a must."
6/15/2018,20180615,5,4.31,"This place is bomb. Ordered the miso carbonara udon and it definitely hit the spot. Since the udon is handmade, the texture of the udon goes perfect with the creamy sauce. Came in on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no wait. I would definitely come back here again!"
6/16/2018,20180616,5,4.31,"So I was realllly craving ramen, but the ramen place next door was SUPER crowded. I did not want to wait at all, so my friends and I walked in to Marugame Monzo and they seated us right away. It had good reviews on yelp so I knew we chose right either way. I didn't know it was an udon place before sitting down and just kept thinking about ramen. But when I saw that they handmade the noodles there, I was so happy! That means they're FRESH and not the frozen packs.I was between the curry udon and the sansai veggie one, but decided to choose the healthier option, and the waiter's recommendation, the sansai veggie. I don't normally order udon, but out of the ones I've had this was the best because I could taste the freshness, while the broth and veggies made it flavorful. It was so yummy, had the perfect texture and it was almost like it melted in my mouth.I also had the kabocha tempura (japanese pumpkin) and that was delish.They have some pretty crazy udon combinations that can pack a lot of calories, like the cheesy one my friend got, but I like their creativeness. It will draw in all the foodies! The only negative was that the booths were worn out and the tables were a bit greasy/sticky. The service was good and our food came out quick! I was very satisfied with my dinner!"
6/16/2018,20180616,3,4.31,"I love Asian food but beside sushi, other Japanese dishes have not always been a favorite of mine. Today, I tried the Mentai Squid Butter udon and the sea urchin cream udon and they did not stand out to me. The udon soup was too buttery and too thick for me. I just don't like the combination of the creamy soup and the udon; they made me feel full and heavy, therefore this restaurants is only a 3 star to me."
6/17/2018,20180617,5,4.31,"Best udon I've had in LA. I enjoy the mountain vegetable one a lot, but this is one of the few places I'll try new dishes every time because no matter what it turns out delicious."
6/17/2018,20180617,5,4.31,Best udon ever!!!!! I got the mushroom udon and it was so good the hubby got the miso udon and baby octopus tempura. We sat at the bar where you can watch them make the homemade udon which was very cool. Definitely going back
6/18/2018,20180618,3,4.31,"Not as good as I thought it would be?Everyone was hyping up the sea urchin cream udon so much, I had to try it. I love cream udon so that's why I wanted to go here in the first place.So first, there was a line outside but it didn't take too long. Our wait was like 20 mins for 2. The waiters are pretty nice, and there was a guy who walked around refilling drinks which is nice.They also have restrooms in the restaurant.We got hot tea, which was good.We order takoyaki, fried calamari and two udon dishes. The takoyaki was good but I felt like it was all sauce and no octopus? The calamari was good. Now the sea urchin udon, I have to say the cream sauce is the best I've had so far. It's very rich and just overall what made the dish. Even though the udon noodles are made in house, I didn't really taste anything special? Actually, I've had better.... the uni was alright but there was so little of it, I couldn't even get much of the taste. I also got a soft boiled egg for my udon, which was cold...if it was at least warm, it would've been perfect. The food overall for me was actually just alright. I'm a little disappointed but maybe my expectations are too high, especially for authentic Japanese food."
6/18/2018,20180618,4,4.31,"Super good freshly made udon place! Tried two of their most popular udons: carbonara and mental squid butter. -the carbonara is a thick cream sauce with bacon for a more savory heavy option. You get exactly what you would think for a carbonara. Definitely not something I would want all the time. But for a comfort food day, definitely. -the mental squid butter is where it's at. If you like cream sauce but want a lighter option this is it. It uses butter in the broth so it's still drinkable. Yet savory and satisfying. However I think it had too much mentaiko inside. It was hard to drink, but for some that's a good thing they don't skimp on the roe. There is also nice chunks of squid inside for a seafood option. We also got rice bowl combinations: the negitoro bowl and pork bowl. Negitoro was good, but it does have a lot of mayo and sauce. The pork bowl, avoid it. They boil the meat and it was very bland. Not worth. I need to come back and see the regular udon soup broth to complete this review of the place."
6/18/2018,20180618,5,4.31,"I've always been a big fan of udon, so the idea of cream udon was a must-try for me.I came on a Friday night at 8pm and the wait was around 45 minutes for a party of 3. We were seated at the bar, which while it did not seem ideal at first, ended up being really cool because we got to see the chefs make the udon noodles. It was so interesting to see the precision that goes into cutting the noodles and making sure they're perfectly even!I ordered the Mentai Cream Udon while my two friends ordered the Carbonara Udon. All three of us immediately fell in love, no joke. My friend, who had never had udon before, stated that it was the best meal she's had in LA, which is not a statement to be taken lightly! The Mentai Cream Udon had the perfect ratio of cream to noodle. It wasn't too salty (something I tend to find with a lot of cream sauces) and the noodles were cooked perfectly. All three of us finished our entire bowls, even drinking up the rest of the sauce since it was so good.There's no doubt I'll make the 40 minute drive just to come back sometime. The prices were reasonable and the food was so good it's the only thing that's been on my mind the past few days. I'd definitely recommend giving the place a try (and then coming back again and again because why not)."
6/19/2018,20180619,5,4.31,"Monzo is hands down one of the best udon spots in LA. The butter mentaiko squid udon is my favorite signature udon and probably the best on the menu. Not too heavy but has a lot of flavors. I had a bad first experience here but the taste made me come back for a second chance and I'm glad i took it! In my experience the wait for lunch is very minimal during weekdays. But if there's a line, just wait because it's worth it."
6/19/2018,20180619,5,4.31,Best udon in town!! I got the shrimp tempura udon and the simplicity of it is what is soo delicious. So many options on the menu you're forced to come back! Be back soon ;)
6/19/2018,20180619,4,4.31,"I got the uni udon! Very satisfied. Just... it's good for you to have something like this once in a while, you won't want to eat it everyday"
6/19/2018,20180619,4,4.31,"This is my go-to spot for fresh handmade, handcut udon noodles. The fried pork skin is usually very tasty. Cold udon is good too. Give this place a try!"
6/20/2018,20180620,5,4.31,Came back many times since my first review and the most recent time was last week- the clam udon was the bomb and so was the tempura egg. Uni cream and their udon noodles overall were still super delicious. Still long line but still totally worth it!
6/20/2018,20180620,5,4.31,"I'm not normally a huge fan of udon, but Marugame Monzo has changed the game. Though a little heavy on the wallet, this place has A+ quality noodles that are freshly handmade in the back area of the restaurant.I ordered the Mad Tiger Udon with their lunch special (+$3/4 for a rice bowl) and got the fatty tuna rice bowl. Cold and refreshing aren't words that usually come to mind when thinking about udon, but both the udon and bowl were super tasty refreshing breaks from the hot weather outside.Service is also impressive - I came in at around 3 PM with a friend, and the wait was surprisingly long. We almost lost our spot in line when our names were crossed out (we were roaming the area: this place takes your name but not your number) but when we came back our server was really nice and seated us anyways."
6/20/2018,20180620,4,4.31,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Monday night at around 9:00 PM. We lucked out and waited only 5 minutes even though there were 5 parties before us on the waitlist. You have to wait outside, so be prepared for the weather conditions when you have a long wait.It was our first time there, and we ordered the miso carbonara udon and uni cream udon based on the waitresses recommendation. For appetizers we tried the calamari and pork belly.The udon noodles are freshly made in house. You can see them making it on site, which is pretty cool. The texture of the noodles is different because it's freshly made. It's a little softer and less al dente. I love soft noodles, so the consistency was perfect for me. I realize that I'm not exactly a fan of uni, because it has a fishy taste. The carbonara tasted just like the traditional Italian pasta. The portions of the udon are smaller than I expected, but I think you get the right amount to fill you up.The calamari was made with tempura batter, and was very crispy and tender inside. It is accompanied with a creamy pink sauce that complements it well. The pork belly tasted great, but the meat was more chewy and drier than I was hoping for. Maybe if they braised it longer, it would be perfect.I'd definitely go back here and try out their other dishes, but I'm not sure I'd be willing to wait more than 30 minutes. I typically don't like to wait too long to eat."
6/21/2018,20180621,5,4.31,"This place is so good. Good service. Good food. Comfortable atmosphere. The udon noodles are made fresh. There was a slight wait during the lunch hour, but it was worth every minute. The rich creamy udon bowls and the light brothy udon bowls are both delicious. I love you Marugame Monzo."
6/21/2018,20180621,3,4.31,"Tasted horrible. Too strong taste. My friend's tempura and kakiage looked fried wrong.This place doesn't serve the authentic Japanese Udon (maybe any longer). I tired the one in J-town when they opened. That time was really good. Maybe chef came from Japan and trained local staffs so tasted great for first few years and the local chefs started to arrange or not following the original recipe then changed the taste.Customer service, restaurant exterior interior and cleanness were good but I don't think i will come back here."
6/22/2018,20180622,4,4.31,I loved the sea urchin cream udon (uni udon). It really exceeded my expectations! The creaminess was perfect and the favor wasn't overwhelming. The house made noodles made my dish perfection.
6/23/2018,20180623,5,4.31,"Came here around 1 on a Saturday, didnt have to wait too long. Was going to try something other than the miso carbonara, because that's what I always get, but couldn't resist. I love their miso carbonara!"
6/23/2018,20180623,5,4.31,"Best udon I've had in LA. No question. I come here every month or so with my girlfriend or family and I have never ever been disappointed by their food or service. The wait time seems intimidating, but it seriously is worth it. I recommend coming for lunch or an early ish dinner when the lines are short. No matter how long the wait, this place is a must try when you are in the Little Tokyo area!"
6/23/2018,20180623,5,4.31,"WOW WHAT A FAVORITE IN LOS ANGELES!! I have been dying to try Monzo ever since I heard about their Uni udon and this place does not disappoint!! Their line moves pretty quickly even close to their closing time. I went around late lunch time like 1:30-2 even though they close from 2:30-5 but their line outside still moved very quickly. They have a pretty small restaurant but their system works very efficiently, even the food came out pretty quickly. With my friends we ordered four different udons, the Uni, Squid Butter, Mushroom Cream, and Miso Carbonara and they were all SO GOOD!! Although they were on the $$ side, Monzo provides just enough so that you don't need leftovers but you're also not hungry when leaving. We also ordered the lunch special deal with the additional $3 rice bowl where we added the raw tuna bowl and the pork belly bowl. They were both soooo good but the tuna was definitely superior! Honestly all the udons were great so you can't go wrong with those four but are definitely on the cream and heavy side. I am definitely coming back whenever I crave udon!! TIPS BEFORE COMING: - Parking is ass since well... it's Downtown Los Angeles - Be ready for a wait! Many restaurants in Little Tokyo are very popular and usually have lines - Monzo is closed in the middle of the day so make sure to check when you plan on coming- Don't over order your dishes because these cream udons can be overwhelming at times"
6/24/2018,20180624,5,4.32,"Huge portions, great takes on udon dishes. My party ordered four types: the uni, miso carbo, beef, and the curry udon so I was able to try all of them. If you only had one choice, i highly recommend the uni udon!!!! Our party was basically fighting over it. The creaminess was not too heavy and I'm sure I would be able to finish all of it myself especially since it was so good. You can't go wrong with the beef udon, the miso carbo was ok to me but if you love pancetta/bacon I'm sure you would like it. The curry in my opinion was lacking and would have been better with rice so I do not recommend it. Can't wait to come back for the uni udon!"
6/24/2018,20180624,5,4.32,"A Little Tokyo staple with the wait to prove it.It's a small space, so head across the street and pick up some takoyaki from Tanota while you wait!But once you're in, you'll worship at this temple of udon. Glorious, springy, soft, chewy udon. All made by hand and on display at the bar seating. Watching them cut and roll and whip the udon in your bowl is a treat.Hot Dragon - An earthy broth with just a bit of kick filled with ground meat and veggies. Very comforting without being overindulgent and heavy.Uni Cream - Probably their most popular. Heavy, creamy, and oceanic. The cream sauce is thick and alfredo-like. There's a bit of uni to finish it off and some roe that'll give you that pop of salt needed to break up the dish.Karaage - A surprise favorite here. It's huge, crispy but not overly battered. The curry salt and mayo are very, very welcome."
6/24/2018,20180624,5,4.32,"I cannot say enough great things about they made the udon here; it's so delicious and has the right amount of umami. The line is super long, so be prepared to wait..wait..and wait, but, the udon is so worth the wait if you have not yet tried this place. I went with their most popular uni udon and my friend tried the pork udon. The noodles were cooked at the right consistency, the broth from the uni was just amazing. If you like creamier broths, then the uni is something to consider. There were other non-cream based broths like the duck, beef, or pork udon, so there are definitely a lot of choice. I don't know if I would wait like 1 hour for it again, but may go on an off day when it is not so packed. Highly recommended!"
6/25/2018,20180625,5,4.32,Monzo gets a lot of love for their seafood cream udon but the real star of the show for me was their simpler offerings. The kake udon is a seemingly plain dish but the execution of it at Marugame Monzo is as perfect as I've ever seen. I also tried the pork belly rice bowl which was surprisingly very good. I was expecting something more like chashu pork but what came out was thinly sliced unmarinated pork belly on a bowl of rice topped with a fragrant sesame oil. Needless to say I'm a fan and will be coming back for more.
6/26/2018,20180626,5,4.32,This is my first enjoyable udon restaurant compare to other Japanese restaurant that serves udon.I personally enjoy cream base rather than soup base because udon has the potato strachy chewy texture which creates a delicious combination taste ! I got to try two different cream base udon. Price: $12 The first one is the carbonara udon. It has fun size Bacon bites and mushrooms. It has a heavy milky cream base flavor. It's very savory and tasty but can be easily get tired of. I would suggest sharing it with a friend unless you can handle it :)  Price: $13 The second one is a tomato cream & seafood with udon. This one is not heavy as the carbonara udon. It has that a slight seafood scent to it and it's not very strong. The protein it contain are scallops and small shrimps.
6/27/2018,20180627,4,4.32,I went here on Saturday night. They close at 10 o'clock. It took about 45 minutes for us to get a table for two. We actually missed them calling our name and they were still very nice and let us have our table about five minutes later. We got served really quickly and they are very efficient in getting people in and out. I got the sea urchin pasta which had delicious cream sauce. The udon is cooked perfectly but it is pretty pricey at over $16. My fiancé got the steak tataki and the seafood salad. The seafood salad had a delicious citrus dressing. It was full of little scallops and shrimp which was tasty.
6/29/2018,20180629,5,4.32,"Hands down my new favorite udon destination. I've had udon at many many places before, and I am so glad that one of my best friends recommended that we try out this place. I tried the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon-- omg. The best thing I've had in all of Los Angeles. It comes in a huge portion, and even though I was already full halfway through my meal, I refused to leave the restaurant without finishing it. My best friend got the uni cream udon-- she loved it as well. We also got an order of the fried calamari-- of course, it was delicious. Perfectly crispy and the flavor evolves in your mouth."
6/29/2018,20180629,5,4.32,Go during a non peak time bc the line here is crazy. Handmade udon noodles and inventive sauces. I had a simple wakame udon and it was wholesome and delicious. Son had the rich miso carbonara which was very creamy and delicious. They give u a wooden spoon and a real ceramic bowl. No plastic nonsense. Just ask for water without the straw so you dont kill any dolphins with your meal.
7/1/2018,20180701,3,4.32,"I think over the years, I slowly got over the hype of this place. It doesn't taste like what it did before and I am not too big of a fan of this place anymore.The udon is good, yes. However, I think there are better udon places out there. Usually, I would opt for the miso carbonara udon. It is a very creamy texture and I don't think you are supposed to actually drink the soup. The bacon pieces are delicious and adds a smoky flavor to the dish. For their portions, I don't think it's a lot either. The beef udon reminds my bf of Yoshinoya (lol) and the beef slices were thinly cut. Broth was very basic tasting and nothing special to it. I have also tried the uni udon and mentai squid udon, both dishes were mediocre. The uni udon tastes like overpriced creamy alfredo sauce. Meh.Lines get shorter around 9 p.m., they do accept credit cards and parking can be very limited!"
7/1/2018,20180701,5,4.32,So we came here and went with what most reviews seem to consider the standard: Uni Cream and Mentai Squid Butter.I had never had Udon from an Udon restaurant before and it did not disappoint. The noodles are so good - a nice bite to them.We preferred the Uni cream. It's really a different experience and well worth another pilgrimage when we come back to LA. I think from a theoretical standpoint that tomato cream udon has to be delicious too.So that along with another uni cream is the goal for next time!
7/1/2018,20180701,4,4.32,"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time but never got around to do so until now because of the drive out here. All my friends that have eaten here have told me about how much beter it is in comparison to Marugame Udon in Sawtelle so I've had it bookmarked for quite some time. We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of the window that allowed us to watch the chefs hand-make the udon noodles. Definitely made me more excited about my meal as we were waiting for our food to arrive.People always rave about their uni cream udon so I knew I had to try it myself. The noodles were perfectly chewy and not too soft, just the way I like it. For someone trying uni for the first time, I didn't think the uni itself was anything extraordinary but the uni cream sauce was delicious! Although it was a cream udon, it wasn't too heavy nor did I feel gross after finishing it. It had a nice balance of savoriness and hint of sweetness to it - would def recommend it to anyone trying uni let alone Marugame Monzo for the first time! Would come more often if it wasn't so far but I'd def make an effort to come again to try more variations of their cream udon!"
7/2/2018,20180702,5,4.32,It's been a while since I've written a review but today's the day. I haven't had anything lately that has completely blown my mind but Marugame Monzo did just that. I've always seen this restaurant on LA Eater and even being covered on The Hundreds blog on top places to eat at in Little Tokyo. I recommended the carbonara udon dish by far one of the best dishes I have had.The sauce is amazing along with the udon noodles which are handcrafted by the staff. Service was very attentive as well. We had a party of 7 and our orders came out within 5 to 10 minutes. I would have to say that monzo is one of the best restaurants I've tried in a very long time. Don't believe the hype for Daikokuya next door and give monzo a try!
7/2/2018,20180702,5,4.32,Miso Carbonara Udon. OMG! Service was quick and all food was delicious. Will definitely come back.
7/3/2018,20180703,5,4.32,"Is monzo worth the hype? Honestly for me it was. I was super hungry and really wanted that creamy uni pasta! I made my bf get the mentai squid butter and he wasn't disappointed! The uni is super creamy and I really wished they served it with a piece of bread! I do agree with other yelpers that the pieces of uni are bare and skimpy, but I would definitely order it again!The mentai squid butter udon was so good! And it was really nice to take a bit of the cream pasta and switching it up with something more light, but packed a lot of flavor. It tasted like the ocean, but in the best possible way. Towards the end of the meal we started to combine both of the udons together and that created a new dish on its own! (Fat kids for life) total for the two dishes was 40$ which is really steep for udon, but splurging every once in a while is nice (especially on seafood)."
7/3/2018,20180703,5,4.32,Easily one of the best Udon places in LA! We love sitting at the bar area where you can watch them actually making the noodles. I haven't yet tried the popular urchin udon. Next time! I had the Hot Dragon which is amazing. Takoyaki was also tasty. Will definitely come back to try more!
7/3/2018,20180703,5,4.32,Hands down my favorite udon place! The mushroom cream udon is so perfect. The only thing is that parking is a b :(
7/7/2018,20180707,5,4.32,"My favorite udon place so far! They hand-make the udon noodles from scratch! If you like fresh pasta at Italian restaurants, you'll love fresh udon from this Japanese restaurant.They have lunch specials where you choose any udon of your choice for regular price, and add on a side rice dish for $3 more. Make sure to get double portions of the udon if it is the only item you'll be having as your main entree. I had the ikura (salmon egg) udon, and it was very refreshing! My cousin had the beef udon and it looked amazing!For those who don't know, Kariage is a tempura (deep fried vegetable/sweet potato). It looked amazing!They have uni udon, and that looked great! I think I would love to try the uni udon ($16) and add salmon egg to it. One thing marugame does not do is takeout. Their wait line can get very long so be ready to wait! It'll be worth it :) cheers!"
7/7/2018,20180707,5,4.32,Hot hot day outside and we came in for cold udon. Very refreshing indeed.The takoyakis were fantastic.Beware... No (or weak) air conditioning when it's 110 degrees outside
7/8/2018,20180708,1,4.32,"First of all, the quality of their noodles are great. There's no doubt in that in my opinion. Everything is fresh and great every time I came back here. However, their service might need some improvements... we came on a Sunday afternoon, we didn't see anyone waiting in front of the store and the waitress took us in right away. We were so happy because we were starving. And it was the first time ever that I didn't have to wait in line for this place so I was super happy initially. One minute after the waitress sat us down, she came back and made us get up and continue waiting outside because there was a party before us that wasn't there when we came in. We were exhausted and didn't want to argue but we were all really unhappy with the fact that we didn't even get any apology from the waitress since it was her mistake. Instead, she made us feel like everything was our fault. Despite the delicious food, that wasn't the right way to treat the customers. Us being quite hangry that day didn't really help the situation either. If you want to try decent quality food, I think this place is worth a try..however, the service could've been better. I've never experienced that sort of service in my life.. such a disappointment."
7/9/2018,20180709,5,4.32,The creamy broth is so good. It reminds me of pasta honestly. Very flavorful and filling. I recommend adding the chili powder. Doesn't make it spicy but adds more flavor. Also tried the onigiri but that was just alright. Wouldn't really recommend.
7/9/2018,20180709,5,4.32,"The udon are fresh, the broth is clean and the quality of the meat is just perfect. I always choose between the beef udon or the uni udon. But I always always order their beef bowls. It reminds me of a upscale version of yoshinoya's beef bowl. The place is super tiny but its definitely worth it"
7/10/2018,20180710,5,4.32,"Very awesome experience: visually and taste.This has been a bookmarked place for me and I finally got to try it.My wait expectation was pretty uncertain as I have read reviews that there can be a two hour wait. Luckily when we went for lunch on Sunday, the line was crazy only to realize that it was for Daikokuya. Don't get trick. Place your name on the waitlist inside shop and wait to be called. For party of 2, we only waiting for 35 minutes.We got seated at the bar and luckily right in front of the Udon maker. It was amazing watching him make a slab of dough to the chewy Udon that we had. It was entertaining and amazing. You can observe how food being made, and you can witness the cleanliness of how the staffs and chefs work. The transparency of the kitchen was assuring and soothing to watch.Food was delicious and savory. I had gotten the miso carbonara and the richness of the sauce complimented the Udon's freshness. The chewy texture is perfect for the Udon and it's how I like it. I don't like mushy noodles and it was exactly opposite of that.Price was very reasonable for the quality noodle and flavor.The staff are polite and professional. One of the great qualities of Japanese Culture shining through.I would definitely come back here again for the Udon. I just need to find friends that are crazy and willing to wait with me."
7/10/2018,20180710,5,4.32,"I'd never had cold udon before, but glad I tried it. The udon is pretty good. There's a long wait and it's definitely because of their udon. It's a small place overall and a little bit crowded. I got their cold udon with beef dish. It did not disappoint. The texture of the udon was chewy and made perfectly. The cold sauce was nicely flavor without being overwhelming. It hit the spot for a hot summer night. I'll definitely come back for their udon."
7/10/2018,20180710,5,4.32,"Love the uni udon of course. But because hubby would always get it I always have to order something else, which I don't mind at all. My usual choices would be the duck udon or the cold udon with kakiage. They are as good."
7/12/2018,20180712,5,4.32,"Fresh made Udon noodle tastes soooo good! The texture is to die for. I especially like the cold udon noddle with Ume Shiso paste, bonito flakes, green onion, and soup on the side."
7/12/2018,20180712,5,4.32,"You need this in your life. Freshly made udon crafted by hand on-site. I have eaten udon throughout much of the west and mid-west, and this is the gold standard. Dine here. You will not regret it. I particularly recommend the uni cream udon. The savory, smoky, creamy broth is absolutely to die for. Mentai squid butter is also quite good, as are their tempura toppings.I eat here once a year when I am in LA. This year, my girlfriend and I downed three bowls. We would have eaten more if we could fit it in our stomachs. That said, Monzo is a popular place, and there isn't much seating. On a busy day, I suggest arriving slightly before it opens, or being prepared to wait outside."
7/12/2018,20180712,5,4.32,"Came to this place during the LA heatwave with my friend and we got a large Mad Tiger Udon. It's been few days since I've been, but I have dreamt about this udon every night. The combination of the spicy pork with green onion and chives with the dashi broth was so good and refreshing. The noodles tasted really fresh and it was the right amount of chewiness for me. I'll definitely be back and try the other udon dishes!"
7/12/2018,20180712,5,4.32,I wasn't really a big fan of udon until I came here. Hands down the uni udon was out of this world!!!
7/12/2018,20180712,5,4.32,"Bomb.com! Like seriously, I have not had a better udon experience then this place, so this really tops every udon out there! I recommend you try the carbonara, curry, and shrimp tempura udon! Freakkin delicious all around :)"
7/13/2018,20180713,5,4.32,Half an hour wait in line was worth it. Hands down the best Udon noodles. My favorite was the sea urchin udon. Even our kids (6&8 year old) enjoyed it!
7/13/2018,20180713,4,4.32,Love their sea urchin udon was very rich. I agree with other reviews that the serving is on the smaller size but I'm okay with that since it's very fatting. Reasoning for ok not four star? Well it's pretty pricey 17 dollar for a bowl that doesn't fill you up. But will definitely coming back when I'm in the area
7/13/2018,20180713,5,4.32,"The udon here is amazing, the service is quick and super polite. There were three of us, beef, dragon, and pork bowls all delivered in a big bad way. The wait wasn't bad for an early Friday dinner. Def worth a visit!"
7/14/2018,20180714,5,4.32,"Hand pulled udon noodles is a unique skill that's hard to find. Therefore I'd say this place is a ""must try"" for anyone checking out LA"
7/15/2018,20180715,5,4.32,"Wow, this place is DELICIOUS! I accidentally came here because I wrote my name down at the wrong restaurant, but good thing I made that mistake because I'd totally come back again. Their cream udon is fantastic although their other dishes are decent too. Make sure to get the rice with pork belly as well!"
7/15/2018,20180715,5,4.32,"One word: perfection! They cut their noodles by hand here and there sure is a big difference in the texture and quality than when noodles are already prepared. They have signature, hot and cold udon! I went with the beef udon (I'm not a big risk taker!) and it was sooo delicious! It was a pretty simple udon dish (they have creamy broths), but for how simple it was, it was amazing. My boyfriend got the hot dragon udon which was delicious as well, spicier than mine. I was also impressed by how quickly they brought our order out after we placed them. If it wasn't so far from where I live, I'd be here pretty frequently but whenever I'm in town, I know where I'll be getting my udon!"
7/16/2018,20180716,4,4.32,"Best udon I've ever had!! I just wish I got a soup one instead of their signature. I got the miso bacon carbonara and it was good yet odd because of the Italian twist. Tho I got a little grossed out at the end because of all the oil. Which is expected because carbonara uses a lot of oil. My friend got the sea urchin udon and it was bomb!!! I'm not a fan of uni or sea urchin because of its fishy taste and texture but you can't really taste it in the udon and it was actually really good and I do see myself getting it again in the future. Expect to wait a long time also, but it's definitely worth the freshly hand made noodles. I also love that you can add tempura to the side of your udon cuz you can't have udon without some tempura! I'm only giving this place 4 stars tho because although the food was amazing. Our server had given us the check and after we paid she brought back our check but it was an even more expensive amount than the first. We thought it was weird or maybe it was gratuity cuz we were a party of 6. But it wasn't, we asked them why it's more expensive and they said they forgot to add some extra sides we ordered when they were doing last call as we went almost closing. It was just weird though that they didn't warn us. Overall, love the food and experience!"
7/17/2018,20180717,5,4.32,"This place was simply awesome, and you need to visit like, yesterday.We got there about a half hour after opening on a Tuesday, and yes there was already a line of about 10-15 people. Make sure to walk in and put your name on the list, then go back and stand in line. They're pretty good about keeping the line moving, and we were sat fairly quickly. Watching the chefs roll and cut the noodles was super entertaining while we waited for our food. We got two different udon bowls, and of course I forget the names but they were some of the more popular ones. One was mushroom based, and the broth in it was THE BEST BROTH OF MY LIFE. Also, I highly recommend adding the rice bowl for the extra $3- I chose the tuna rice bowl and it WAS AMAZING. Service was prompt, beer was cold, and there was so many amazing dishes on the menu. I cannot wait to go back next time I am in LA. Also, special shoutout to the guy who was running the list and seating people. He was the assertive, no nonsense type you need to deal with wait lines. If your whole party isn't there they won't seat you. We saw multiple try and say ""well they are close they are almost here"". And that guy was like, NO, if they aren't standing in front of me, then you have to find me when they get here. He was awesome."
7/19/2018,20180719,5,4.32,"We came right when it opened, and a small line had already formed.We were seated quickly at the counter, from which you can see the cooks making the udon noodles. Very nice while waiting for the food!The service is fast and the interior is very clean.We got 1 sea urchin udon, 1 salmon eggs rice bowl and 1 beef rice bowls. Everything was delicious, but definitely taste their specialty udons! Their noodles are super chewy, and combined with the hearty sauce and a tat of saltiness from the salmon eggs, it was a mouthful of happiness.Would definitely come back next time I go to LA!"
7/20/2018,20180720,5,4.32,My favorite Udon place. Fresh handout noodles. All of their special menu items are exceptional but my favorite is the gratin umm
7/21/2018,20180721,5,4.32,"I went here six times in a month because the noodles are to die for. Handmade udon (you can watch them make it in the restaurant!) is super unique, and the texture/taste is like no other. I'm dying to go back and have that beef udon. Appetizers are great as well. Wouldn't recommend the pork udon, but other than that, fantastic place and probably my favorite in LA."
7/23/2018,20180723,4,4.32,"I finally understand why there is always an almost hr wait. I don't know if all their udon bowls were the same quality but their miso carbonara was beyond delicious. I wanted to throw in bread? rice?  pasta? anything I could possibly find and edible to soak up every last drop. I did see my adjacent guest packed the last three teaspoons of sauces/soup to bring home. Girl, I feel you. Their udon had the perfect texture. If only each bowl came with a bit more? ~$17 with tax and tip included - pricy but still well worth it. Really tight space - come right at its opening hour or expect to wait by 5:30."
7/23/2018,20180723,5,4.32,Udon! The cousin of ramen. So something different for a change.Great food. Great service. Takoyaki was bomb!
7/24/2018,20180724,5,4.32,"Wow. Marugame Monzo singlehandedly changed my opinion on udon--I love the stuff now.I love ramen, and multiple bad udon experiences left me with the sense that udon was really just ""worse ramen"". But Monzo exposed me to just how well udon could be done: the two dishes I tasted were intensely flavorful and remarkably balanced.I tasted a thick, almost gelatinous curry udon and a richly satisfying mentai squid butter udon. The broths were fantastic. Sort of like a marriage of the fatty, salty umami of a tonkatsu and the noodle-clinging creaminess of an alfredo, and all driven by delicious flavor. Thoroughly enjoyed every bite.Our server was great--my water was never empty. Plus they have a clear glass divider between you and the kitchen, so you can watch them make the noodles.I don't know much about udon, but you'd better believe that Monzo got my attention."
7/24/2018,20180724,5,4.32,"The best udon place!!! Fresh udon noodles taste much cleaner and softer than the frozen noodles that I'm used to. The broth is by far the most delicious I've had. It is an extremely small place. The wait for this place is around 1-3 hours, so plan to come early, write your name on the list, and walk around little Tokyo for a bit to increase your appetite. Trust me, it is worth the wait!!"
7/25/2018,20180725,5,4.32,The udon is my favorite here. Plus the staff is so friendly! Freshly made udon in front of you with a great menu provides variety and quality. The staff makes you feel so incredibly welcome. If you're looking for quality with amazing service this is the place.

7/27/2018,20180727,5,4.32,"I was never really into going out for udon since I always made it at home with frozen noodles and soup base but coming here totally changed my mind. I got the regular udon with shrimp tempura and it was so good! The noodles are pretty similar to what I achieve with frozen noodles, but the soup is so different. I was also really glad I added the tempura because that made it even better. It was breaded perfectly. The wait wasn't too bad for a party of 2 during dinner rush. Definitely stop by if it's cold and you're in the soupy mood!"

7/28/2018,20180728,2,4.32,Went there explicitly for the uni pasta. It was more cream tasting than uni. I've had uni pasta in a few places and this rendition definitely not on the top 10 list. It looks amazing with the ikura on top but I don't know why the uni taste was lost in the cream.

I didnt even know cold udon exist... Cold udon sounds weird but it was BEST. Be sure to do double portion for few bucks more since single portion can be too small.When I try to pay with credit card, their credit card terminal was down and I have to wait 10 minutes but eventually it worked..."

Also, if you add a rice bowl to your entree it's only $4 extra.So glad we came in early because once we sat down a lot of people started to come in ~"

7/31/2018,20180731,5,4.32,"I've always enjoyed udon--thick, slurpy noodles that's chewy and filling. Monzo provides a great place to enjoy freshly made noodles (made right in front of your eyes!) and various delicious Japanese rice dishes. At lunch time, you can find a mini rice bowl udon combo that lets you get a smaller rice dish (I got the pork belly) along with a big bowl of traditional udon. There are many, many types of udon. I had what my server recommended: bukkake beef. Don't giggle, bukkake has other connotations other than the sexual one. It means ""to splash rudely"" in Japanese and refers to a pour-over-broth of udon noodles. For my add ons, I chose shrimp tempura and fried-soft-boiled-egg. While I love soft boiled eggs on my ramen, this soft fried egg was a new thing for me and it was great! So as we sat and ate our meal in front of the glass walled kitchen area, the noodle maker began making udon noodles right in front of us. It's not as fancy and over the top as Benihana, but it definitely is interesting to watch as it's full of history and precise craftsmanship. My beef udon was very delicious. It was cold and perfect for a hot summer day (ac in here isn't very cool). The pork belly rice bowl was also decent but not the main event. The service was great and attentive despite being fairly busy. I highly recommend a visit here. The wait time isn't too bad on a Saturday during late lunch time 2/3p) but be prepared to wait outside in the sun (no reservations). Parking can be found in metered spaces on the street or in the lot for Geffen Museum behind the restaurant. This costs $7. Enjoy!"
7/31/2018,20180731,5,4.32,"Although maybe not as busy as its next door neighbor Daikokuya, Marugame Monzo holds its own as a udon specialty place in Little Tokyo.If you're like me and you like thicc noods, Monzo is an excellent choice for a meal. My default order is usually the curry udon which is one of the cheapest things on the menu but if anyone tries to rag on curry udon ima swing!! Curry udon just brings feelings of comfort and home cooking.I've also tried the Mad Tiger Udon when I was feeling adventurous, and it was good, albeit not that spicy.Great place to try for inventive or traditional Japanese udon + curry udon"
7/31/2018,20180731,4,4.32,"Fresh hand made noodles. Quick service, and a small cozy interior. You can't go wrong with this place.

8/1/2018,20180801,5,4.32,"The Miso Carbonara Udon was SO good.Food: I ordered whichever my friend (who checked yelp) said was good here, the Miso Carbonara Udon. Since I never actually checked the photos online, I thought it would be a slightly creamy soup. Instead, the base was pretty much just a really thick pasta cream so I wouldn't recommend trying to drink it haha. The cream was almost a little too rich for my taste, but it still tasted amazing, so I'm still giving them 5 stars for it. If you can handle it, then order it, but next time, I'll opt for a soup udon. Anyways, the portion seems kinda small but this was all I ordered and after I finished, I couldn't bring myself to order anything else. Basically, if you love creamy pasta then you should definitely try this!! If you're lucky, you can be seated at the window and watch them make their udon noodles fresh.Service: Quick service, food came out pretty soon after ordering. There is almost always a short wait. Since there were 6 small tables ahead of us, my friends and I made the mistake of wandering around Little Tokyo for 25 minutes. We came back to find that we had been skipped a few tables ago and we had to wait another 15 minutes. So if there are some tables ahead waiting ahead of you, don't worry, it won't take long."
8/1/2018,20180801,3,4.32,"Food Ordered: Miso Carbonara UdonFood: I heard that this was the best dish and so okay, let's do it! Unfortunately, the soup base was a super thick pasta cream that was pretty salty. It still tasted ok, so I'm still giving them 3 stars for it. If you can handle it, order it, but I'll order something else for sure next time. Portions were a bit on the sparse side. I can't decide if this is a pro or con, but because of the super rich cream at least I was full? I don't know if you like that kind of udon/pasta, then you'll probably like this place. It's not for me. Sorry!Service: I have always seen a long ass line, so be prepared. Once inside the service is pretty quick I must say.Parking: Either get real lucky or just park in the parking structure one block south.Price: Standard for Udon/Ramen"
8/2/2018,20180802,5,4.32,"Love the appetizer!! Fried calamari and takoyaki!! Highly recommend this place and really packed! Have so many different types of udon, also they handmade the udon, in fact in front of you so extremely fresh! :) you will love it."
8/2/2018,20180802,5,4.32,"If the line out the door doesn't make you wonder what they have going on in here let me tell you: HANDMADE NOODLES They have an enormous collection of udon dishes going from classic to fusion. If you choose a classic soup, you can always customize with extras including: A TEMPURA SOFT BOILED EGG, the texture is so crazy and so amazingly tender. The Uni Butter Udon was way creamier than I expected and yet it is so light in flavor, you really taste the briny ocean. I have a photo here of the cold Mad Tiger Udon, since it was a hot day. It comes with spicy pork and a regular soft-boiled egg; unfortunately you cannot substitute for a tempura egg. It is super tasty, not very spicy and even has a little seafood flavor due to the included bonito flakes. They believe that the udon needs to be prepared and eaten in a certain way that basically means that they do not do To Go/Takeaway orders, unless it's a rice bowl. My cheat: order noodles with a double portion ($2 extra) and when you have leftovers they give you two bowls you separate your food into broth and noodles. It's amazing. I have to come back a few more times to try everything! This place isn't great for groups larger than 4, they'll squeeze 5 into the side with the booths, but it's really better for smaller groups and couples."
8/3/2018,20180803,5,4.32,"I live in NYC now, and while there's a lot of food I miss about LA, this is one of the top places. Sure, there are tons of udon places in NYC, but only few match the quality of Marugame Monzo's noodles.This place can get quite crowded, so plan accordingly: avoid going with huge parties and avoid the inevitable lunch/dinner rush. Sit by the bar and you can watch the fresh noodles being made.They have a good selection of udon with either creamy and soupy broth. While everyone writes about the uni cream udon, I've become less of a fan over the years - it's much too rich for me. However, it's a great option if you're sharing and/or you like rich foods. I also don't love the fact that most of the uni in the bowl is grilled (not raw).My favorite is the mentaiko squid butter udon. It gives you a thinner, yet still incredibly hearty, broth. The soup is packed and loaded with mentaiko; they definitely don't skimp on this one.Lunch specials are also worthwhile - you can add a mini rice bowl to your udon. Last time, I got the negitoro bowl, which was way saucier than I expected and would skip next time. Their appetizers are also delicious - even a simple side of tempura is well made; hot, crispy, and light.While I don't love every single dish here, the mentaiko bowl for me is more than enough to keep me coming back."
8/4/2018,20180804,5,4.32,THE BEST ASIAN FUSION RESTAURANT EVER. The miso carbonara udon and mentai squid butter udon were both great dishes and would recommend it to anyone quick and helpful service as well
8/5/2018,20180805,5,4.32,Omg... this place though. If you don't go in your lifetime you have not lived a full life-- and please get the uni udon! It's a bowl of heaven! I don't even know how this place has only 4.5 stars... should have 10! Yeah seriously that good-- nothing like it out there! It's fun to watch them make the udon noodles too!
8/6/2018,20180806,5,4.32,"Great noodles, and plenty of udon options. If you're a big eater, get a double portion (only for some of the noodles), and add the rice bowl options. Made for a pretty decently sized meal. Definitely wish they had a/c inside, as it was quite stuffy and hot when we went in. Lines were pretty much a constant, but go in a small group and you're in pretty quickly."
8/7/2018,20180807,4,4.32,"Marugame Monzo really satisfies my udon cravings. We went here once last year after waiting in line for an hour. This time, we got here right before they opened (at 11:30) so there were about 7 people waiting and we were all seated without much wait.We had bukkake cold beef udon and summer special tororo cold udon as it's so hot out! The udon noodles are just fantastic here whether served hot or cold. The cold udon was rinsed with cold water so the noodles' firmness was perfect. The beef was nicely flavored with the sweet soy based broth and it went well with the ground daikon and ginger. Tororo is ground yam and it's almost slimy in texture. When you mix it with the sauce and dip the cold udon noodles, you get to enjoy the soft tororo coating the firm udon. I wish they put some scallions and cut seaweed like what I would get in Japan. The aonori on top of the tororo was a bit disappointing for me but still, both dishes tasted great.I would love to try their modern (vs traditional tororo) dishes next time. You can always add toppings to customize your udon so your experience might be different from mine with a couple of toppings. Last time we came, we ordered way too many tempura so I didn't order much this time but apparently, I should have gotten something extra."
8/7/2018,20180807,5,4.32,Udon has always been one of my favorite Japanese dishes so this place was obviously going to be on my bucket list for LA. And they lived up to the expectations! The portions are quite large and they have a few unique fusions such as the uni cream pasta. I am personally a sucker for more traditional Japanese udon so I went with the hot sansai one for a lighter lunch along with the kakiage. The kakiage was very delicious. It was a decently sized portion and crunchy. The udon itself comes in a large bowl along with a large spoon and I feel like you get a really good portion of udon for a cheap price. Service was relatively fast once we were seated but waiting can take some time. Though I feel like it's worth it for good food. They also have an open display of the chefs making the noodles where you can sit so that you have a front row view. Parking can be a bit of a hassle in little Tokyo but there's plenty of structures and street parking if you know where to go. The restaurant itself is small so groups of four or more may have a difficult time getting a seat. I will definitely come back in the future.
8/8/2018,20180808,5,4.32,Got the Hentai Squid butter udon. Not much else say but great broth and can't complain about fresh made udon. The udon was perfectly cooked and absorbed the deep and hearty broth with every slurp of the noodle.Beef udon was good. Clean broth that had every essence of beef. Udon again was perfect and a great vehicle to hold the broth onto it.The egg was cooked to perfection and the yolk only created another layer of texture that was just smooth.Calamari was lightly coated and was like eating air. Service was attentive and spot on. Staff very efficient and courteous which made my experience memorable.Would go back more consistently if closer to home.
8/8/2018,20180808,4,4.32,"The udon here was good. I had the carbonara udon and it was good but I didn't like how it tastes like eating pasta. I'm expecting an Asian taste. The beef udon was good, just a little salting and boring. I felt it was missing something. However, I would come back again to give it another try."
8/9/2018,20180809,5,4.32,"Go during lunch time and get their lunch time special! For their lunch time special, you get to pick any udon + any mini rice bowl for an additional $3/$4. I absolutely love their negitoro rice bowl, so so good! When paired together with an udon, it balance out the flavorful udon.My favorite udon here is the Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($16.95). It might seem pricey for udon, but we're talking about uni here. This udon was super rich and creamy. The texture of the udon was absolutely perfect. Everything meshed together so well. I've also tried the Mentai Squid Butter Udon ($12.95). It has a lighter soup base, but it is definitely still creamy. The squid was cooked perfectly, so the texture was spot on!"
8/9/2018,20180809,5,4.32,"Best broth, hands down. Exceptional beef udon. Hint of miso, and the pure broth shows through."
8/9/2018,20180809,4,4.32,"The food is super amazing. My other favorite is just the beef udon. Amazing...very good. The creamy soup surrounding the island of udon was just to die for. Delicious noodles, good variety, love the Onigiri!!"
8/12/2018,20180812,4,4.32,"Finally got a chance to try this place last week and I kid you not, the line was extremely long. We waited approximately 1 hour for a table. However, their service was excellent and the food came out super fast. The bowl s look big but don't be fooled, it wasn't that much food. Still good regardless, worth the wait"
8/13/2018,20180813,5,4.32,"WORTH THE WAIT. I don't have much else to say. Parking here isn't too bad, but I do tend to be lucky with finding free or street parking. There are metered spots all along the street, free after 8pm. If possible I would have someone in your party go put your name down on the call list while you look for parking. Wait time for me and a friend was about an hour or so on Saturday night, arriving at 8pm.The restaurant is pretty small so you might bump elbows with the table next to you, but you'll be too focused on the food to care. Their noodles are handmade, and if you're lucky enough to get seated in the back you'll have a first hand view of them making the noodles for you!Service: 5/5 I would say table turnover was pretty fast and the food came out pretty fast as well.Pork Belly Rice Bowl $5.45: Looks simple, but the pork belly melts in your mouth. You have to try it!!Tempura Soft-Boiled Egg $1.50: A different twist on a soft boiled egg. Mix the runny yolk in with your uni cream udon.Sea Urchin Udon $16.95: The BEST uni cream udon I've tried anywhere. The cream is so rich and doesn't taste like the ""sea"" which is sometimes common in uni dishes. The shiso leaf and masago on top complimented the dish really well adding another layer to the depth of flavor. The texture of the udon noodle was perfect, not too doughy or chewy. My boyfriend and I ended up eating up every last bit of the udon, uni, and cream! (We mixed some of the leftover rice from the pork belly rice in with the cream and it was sooo good.)Overall, I would love to come back and try more of their udon dishes, but I'm torn because the uni cream udon is so good I'm tempted to order it everytime! Marugame is a must try if you're ever in the area."
8/13/2018,20180813,4,4.32,Our party of two went on a Monday night around 6:15 and we were seated after about 10 minutes. I had the Hot Dragon Udon. The noodles were chewy and the broth was seasoned well. It's not too hot so most people should be able to handle it. The broth wasn't too salty and it did not seem like they had MSG. Really enjoyed the dish. The Eggplant appetizer was also good. It was not over cooked and mushy. Will definitely be coming back to try another udon.
8/15/2018,20180815,5,4.32,"They Have such Unique flavors that most Udon places don't have, I've been here twice and already love it, the flavors really burst in your mouth and theirs so many flavors to choose from, this Udon place is different from the other and it's a great place to go for Lunch or Dinner."
8/16/2018,20180816,5,4.32,"In a town that's now over saturated by ramen spots (not a bad thing at all, mind you) it's great to see a Japanese udon noodle shop with the quality and authenticity as Monzo.Come here on a weekend for lunch and you'll see a line going down 1st street, especially if you're trying to get a first seating. Come during the week at 5 and it's fairly empty but by the time you're done eating at 6, it's once again packed with a line queued up for a table. Their udon menu has a lot of options. We got the classic beef udon in clear broth. There are many tasty looking cream soup udons but unfortunately that's not in my eating regimen at the moment so I got the always classic beef udon. Good size bowl, nice chewy typically hearty udon noodles and the beef was good. Soup maybe a tad under flavored compared to what I've had elsewhere but as I mentioned there are many other thicker and more flavorful soups to choose from. For me tho the real star was the bolognese udon which is basically their take on a spaghetti bolognese. Hearty sauce, not too salty with a gentle flavor that has beef Ragu with some chopped mushrooms and eggplant (?), but the bits are nice and small so you don't get that overpowering chunky vegetable taste which isn't my favorite texture nor flavoring. Big bowl that you'll want to scoop out the remaining sauce with the large wooden ladle spoon they provide. Excellent dish and I hope it stays on the menu as it's a ""special item"" for time being. Also of note is their braised pork belly appetizer which is 7 large chunks of braised pork belly in a mellow shoyu based soup. Very hearty and very filling, it's a much larger appetizer dish than I expected but every bite was sumptuous. Big chunks of pork tenderly cooked in a great tasting broth. Oh yea def a fan of this restaurant."

8/16/2018,20180816,4,4.33,"This place changed my mind about Japanese food. We have ordered sea food tomato cream and beef udon and they both were good. The tomato cream was rich and creamy, and it didn't smell seafood."
8/16/2018,20180816,5,4.33,"Best Udon EVER! You'll be telling your Udon to ""get in your belly"". My favorite is the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon, it tastes like Cream of Tomato... creamy deliciousness!"
8/18/2018,20180818,4,4.33,"Quick Summary:I've been here twice, and both times I have gotten the mentai squid butter udon. I have been wanting to try the hot dragon udon, but the mentai squid butter is always a winner!Inside/ environment:It's a small restaurant that seats probably 30-40 people? Has a bar top with single chairs and tables on both sides of the restaurant. When I put my name down, there were about 10-15 parties ahead of me. I only waited about 30 mins until my name was called. Food:The broth of the mentai squid butter is not as thick as the pictures make it out to be. The squid pieces are tender and chewy and the fish eggs in the broth gives this dish another level of taste...if that makes sense? I ordered a tempura soft boiled egg to go along with my udon. The center of the egg is cooked perfectly and the tempura batter is light and crispy. The first time I visited, I went with my boyfriend, and he ordered the uni udon. I think their uni sauce had good flavor, but lacked a strong uni flavor. It was very light and I was searching for that uni taste. This second trip, I went with my cousin. The duck udon caught her eye and even though I strongly urged her to try a couple other dishes, she went with the duck...we were disappointed with this one. I thought the broth was a bit bland. It lacked depth and the duck had a strong iron taste. I've had duck before and the duck slices were not very tender in this dish. I wouldn't recommend this. I ordered the calamari appetizer which was a good sharing size for 2 people. The batter was seasoned and very light and crispy! I liked this! The dipping sauce was like a mixture of mayo, ketchup, and other spices? I'll be back:) I need to try that hot dragon udon"
8/18/2018,20180818,4,4.33,"miso carbonara udon tastes like pasta. I did like the udon. They mixed many stuff in the udon soap. I also ordered pork belly, which has nothing special I don't recommend the pork belly"
8/18/2018,20180818,4,4.32,The line moved very fast. I don't recommend pork belly. miso carbonara tastes like pasta. I like the udon it self. They mixed a lot of thing in the udon soap. It tastes fine in general.
8/19/2018,20180819,4,4.32,"Came here for the first time thinking that it was Marugame Udon but unfortunately it was not what we were expecting. Upon walking in, it was not cafeteria-line style so we were confused haha. Despite it not being what we were anticipating, we decided to stay anyways because this place is so highly rated on Yelp, there were a bunch of people waiting (that means it must be good right?), and Marugame Udon was 14 miles away LOL!For our table of 4, we waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday for lunch. In the meanwhile, we walked over to Little Tokyo's little shops to stay in the air conditioning. If not, you can just stand outside in the heat to wait until they call your name; luckily they offer ice water. If you do leave, be sure you're back a little before you expect them to call your name because their policy is if they call your name 3 times and you're not there, they'll skip you and call the next person! The restaurant is really small, so being skipped may push your wait back for quite a while.Note that they have a lunch menu and a dinner menu so you may see something on Yelp that you can't order. Since it was so hot, I knew I didn't want to get a soupy hot udon. The idea of cold udon seemed kinda sad, too, so I didn't opt for that. I ordered the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon ($13.45) and thoroughly enjoyed my meal! It was very creamy and filling because it was so heavy. It is one of the most interesting entrees I've ever had; it was like a mixture of spaghetti sauce and alfredo sauce but with udon noodles instead of pasta. I'd give it a 7/10 because it was delicious but I can see how it can be a hit or miss for some people with picky tastebuds!My friends got the Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($16.95), Miso Carbonara Udon ($12.95) with a Tempura Soft-Boiled Egg ($1.50), Beef Udon ($12.25), Beef Rice Bowl ($3 from lunch special), and Pork Belly Rice Bowl ($3 from lunch special). The ones that got the cream udons also agreed that it was really heavy and felt like they had food babies after finishing. The only other thing to comment on is that the pork belly is not like the typical thick-slab of pork belly; here they slice the pork belly really thin."
8/19/2018,20180819,5,4.33,You can not go wrong with this restaurant. Their udon is FABULOUS. I always get the sea urchin udon which is creamy and filling. It's worth the wait.
8/19/2018,20180819,5,4.33,"Just go here. Love yourself. I had the uni udon and loved every bite. If that's too heavy/creamy for you, I also love the butter squid one."
8/19/2018,20180819,5,4.33,"The line was super long 30 min after opening. Couldn't wait so I returned a few hours later, probably around 4PM, to no line! Only one word can describe their udon - amazing. I need not say more."
8/22/2018,20180822,5,4.33,"SO GOOD! Came here with my friend on a weekend during lunchtime and although there were quite a few parties before us, their turnover rate was quick and we got seated fairly quickly. Service was also very attentive throughout!I ordered the cold beef udon, and it exceeded my expectations. The udon was perfectly cooked: chewy and springy. There was a good amount of beef in my dish, and the broth had a perfectly balanced sweet flavor. I had come here once ages ago and can't believe I've only recently rediscovered this gem! It is in the heart of Little Tokyo so parking can be difficult. Usually, the easiest bet is parking in one of the lots on the streets nearby and paying the $5/6 or so for convenience. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu options! MUST TRY!!"
8/22/2018,20180822,4,4.33,"Got the miso carbonara udon. I would give it a 8.5/10. It's very flavorful but very thick. The bacon really add flavor to the dish. The cream was very thick but good. However, it fills you up quickly since it's so heavy. But overall, the dish was very delicious and the service was decent."
8/22/2018,20180822,4,4.33,Got the miso carbonara udon and it was delicious! My only complain is that the portion was kind of small. Parking is also kind of difficult but overally great food!
8/23/2018,20180823,2,4.32,I went back here and the noodles were soggy again! A bit disappointed... i hope they stop overcooking the noodles!
8/25/2018,20180825,5,4.33,Got the opportunity to be able to sit in front of the kitchen where the chef was making noodles. Very cool indeed especially how quickly they can make them. The udon was perfect and delicious. The broth was flavorful and hot the right spot. Enjoyed their shrimp tempura udon with the shrimp being perfectly fried to perfect. Also had their vegetable udon. Really enjoyed the stir fried veggies that was infused into the broth. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly and attentive even though it was busy.
8/26/2018,20180826,4,4.32,"Great tasting, fresh Udon made in front of you is always a plus! I was very tempted to try the signature Sea Urchin Udon but opted for the Beef Bukkake Cold Udon upon the servers recommendation. It did not disappoint at all!The fresh, handmade udon is what drives people here and having fresh made udon makes all the difference in the world! This is also the first time I've had cold dipping udon. Cold dipping noodles smothered in daikon and green onions, along with the beef was a delightful and light meal.Going to have to come back and go bold with the thick, flavors such as the carbonara or sea urchin next time! The line wasn't too bad as I came here for a late lunch around d 13:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. I think it was a 15 min wait overall."
8/28/2018,20180828,5,4.33,"I loved this restaurant from the moment I walked in. The employees were kind, welcoming, and speedy with delivery of drinks and ordered food. I ordered the Beef Udon, expecting an average bowl of noodles, but what I got was a spectacular bowl of heaven. The beef was cooked to perfection, the noodles, springy and delicious, the broth was light and salty, with so many levels of taste. I would definitely recommend anyone who's in the area to stop by and enjoy a wonderful bowl of udon, for a reasonable price."
8/29/2018,20180829,4,4.33,I came on a Sunday 3pm so the wait was only 10 minutes. We got the udon gratin (udon topped with cheese and cream) and beef bukkake ;) udon (cold udon). Both were really good.Minus one star for having no AC inside.. there were like 5 cute little fans on the ceiling for this 90° weather..
8/29/2018,20180829,4,4.32,"I'm from the bay area and thought this was the same UDON shop as the one in Hawaii. IT""S NOT. But hey why do we eat food? Because it's fkin delicious right? OKAY THEN, don't let that stop you from coming here. THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS. I ordered the UNI udon and it was YUMMY. PERIOD.Gave me more uni than I had initially expected, udon's texture was just right and then you mix in the creamy broth with some fresh uni......My gf n her sister got some spicy and tomato udon, although delicious, wasn't the best thing I ever had type delicious."
8/29/2018,20180829,5,4.33,"Oishi! This is one of the best udon places I have ever had in the States. Probably the best in Southern California to be honest. Marugame's broth and their wide selection of different udon plates is simply mouth-watering and delicious. I love how we can see the chefs make their noodles and cook. I always appreciate having to see the chefs create magic in the kitchen. Just a forewarning though...this place can be very crowded fast! It doesn't matter whether it is weekday or weekend. You will have to be prepared to wait for 30 minutes to maybe even an hour if it gets crowded. With that being said, it is definitely worth the wait. Their service is top notch, and their food is just excellent and super worth it. Marugame, I thank you for bringing the authenticity of udon to Little Tokyo."
8/30/2018,20180830,4,4.33,"Friend took me here when I visited the city, I was really satisfied with the service and food. Great experience and would definitely go back when I visit LA again!"
8/31/2018,20180831,3,4.32,"Great place with great prices. Came in on a Thursday night around 930 and they happily took us in and there was no wait at all. The space is pretty tight so you'll be sure to have to squeeze yourself into a seat at the restaurant. Ordered the uni udon (17) which was nice and creamy with the noodles cooked perfectly. The flavor was there and the udon was covered with just the right amount of sauce. Unfortunately the downside to this noodle was the actual uni pieces that were in the dish. They were fully cooked and firm without any flavor inside my mouth which was something I wasn't used to. I'm used to it being raw and bursting with flavor while melting in my mouth. This texture was not pleasant. They should lay fresh pieces of uni on top with the roe that they already have this would make the dish perfect. I also tried the red dragon (13) which is a spicy udon. I believe that this is their take on Dan Dan mian with udon. It has a nice and rich spicy broth that comes with minced pork and bean sprouts. Don't get it if you can't handle the spice but on a cold night this is the perfect soup. Lastly I ordered a mixed tempura since there is not much meat in the dishes. The tempura comes with 2 perilla leaves, 1 shrimp, 1 mushroom , 1 eggplant, and 1 pumpkin. I mostly enjoyed the large mushroom cap and pumpkin. Would come here again to try their other signature udon!"
8/31/2018,20180831,5,4.32,"the wait is usually long, especially on the weekends BUT ITS WORTH IT. so far I've tried to shrimp tempura and sea urchin udon and neither disappoints! unfortunately, you can't order extra noodles for the sea urchin. they do close for a lunch break and during their lunch hours it's never too busy."
9/2/2018,20180902,4,4.32,Wow. The tomato cream seafood udon was quite good! I usually would not order any creamy dish but am glad I did here. It wasn't too heavy and had really fresh shrimp and baby scallops. The dish looked too by but I ended up really full! Only thing for me was I wish it were spicy! The red sauce made me want spicy. Like maybe a dash of tobasco would have been great. My guest ordered the carbonara udon and added the mini beef rice. He really enjoyed both dishes. The beef rice was a great deal and very tasty. Again the carbonara was not too heavy or greasy looking. We also had Zaru udon and cold sansi udon and both were thoroughly enjoyed. The udon has a great chewy texture and was extremely fresh.
9/3/2018,20180903,5,4.32,"Marugame Monzo is an udon place. They serve a variety of udon dishes. Besides udon, they serve appetizers, salads, and rice bowls. They seated us at the bar where we saw the chefs make the udon noodles from scratch. It was a pretty cool sight to see. The Sea Urchin Udon was fantastic! The noodle texture was perfect! It was thick and chewy. It went up smoothly when slurped. The sauce was very rich, thick, silky, and creamy. The restaurant is very small and not spacious. Seating is a bit cramped and you will most likely be of kissing distance with the person sitting next to you. It was super crowded during the time that we went but we didn't wait that long to get seated. Loved the Sea Urchin Udon. I will be back for another visit!"
9/3/2018,20180903,5,4.33,"I found myself in Little Tokyo on my day off and Yelp led me here. I could've easily chosen anywhere else but I had to see what this is about. To be honest I didn't even want Udon, I wanted sushi or ramen, but I came here anyway because the positive rating was too high to ignore. I waited at the door a little before opening. By the time I went inside, there was a line behind me.I sat at the bar and watched the kitchen work. I ordered a bukkake Udon while the bf ordered the mentai squid butter udon. Since it was disgustingly hot outside I couldn't be bothered to eat anything warm. The food came out quickly and I was impressed by both the presentation and the flavors. I was really impressed with the broth in my bf's mentai udon, though my cold bukkake udon was also enjoyable. The ingredients were all fresh. While waiting I was able to watch someone making noodles. I sadly had no idea how it was made, so it was a real treat for me to see. Service is average but really this place is about food. Where else am I going to get fresh handmade udon? I don't really know or care because this place gets the job done."
9/3/2018,20180903,3,4.32,"Noodles and more here!I had a rice bowl, and the lettuce wraps both with their delicious spicy pork.Was fun to watch the cooks roll out the noodle dough and slice up!"
9/3/2018,20180903,5,4.32,"This is my favorite udon place to go to! They make handmade noodles on front of you while you dine in. They have specialty udons that are unique, regular udon that's standard, and have appetizer options as all. My favorite udon is the uni pasta and I'd highly recommend sharing this with someone because it's really creamy & thick. The line is long for dinner time, but it's worth the wait in my opinion!"
9/3/2018,20180903,3,4.32,"The noddle too hard not soft, soup too cold, and too salty. I was disappointed. Waste time to stand in line for an hour."
9/4/2018,20180904,5,4.32,My cousins knew about this joint and decided to stop and eat here after our visit to universal studios. This place is always packed so I recommend first timers to come wait in line before or near opening times. The service was great and the food was amazing. Definitely coming back again!
9/5/2018,20180905,3,4.32,"This place is absolutely amazing! Great service and great food! My boyfriend and I came here on Labor Day and the line was looooong-- they weren't even open yet! My boyfriend kept hyping this spot so I wanted to try it myself.It was about a 30 minute wait-- not too badMy boyfriend ordered the Bacon Carbonara Udon with the Pork bowl. He enjoyed the pork bowl, but for me it didn't have as much taste then I would have thought. As for the Carbonara it was very savory, full of flavor! It was fresh, hot and delicious! As for myself, I ordered the Udon Gratin and the beef bowl.The beef bowl was good, beef semi sweet but it didn't really come with a lot of meat. It tasted like a yoshinoya bowl to me. As far as the Udon Gratin, the cheese was very delicious BUT the mixture with it just tasted like water, there was no sauce or flavor just melted cheese and watered noodles. I was a little disappointed because from photos it looked really good and the cheese pull video I have makes it look bomb -- but to me, there was no flavor, very bland. Thankfully our wonderful server was able to replace it with the Bacon Carbonara Udon. If the flavor in the Carbonara one was in the Gratin, it would be more enjoyable because the Carbonara was full of flavor!Great service, good food but I don't see myself coming here anytime soon."
9/7/2018,20180907,4,4.32,"I was first interested in Marugame Monzo when I saw the Sea Urchin Cream Udon on someone's Snapchat, and I ended up coming in a week later to check it out for myself.The Sea Urchin Cream Udon (which is one of the most popular here) is delicious at first bite, but I ended up getting a little tired of the creaminess of it by the end of the bowl. There's minimal uni actually in it, and the cream itself is a really lightly flavored with uni. My go-to now when I'm there is the Hot Dragon. The broth is so good! I like this more as opposed to the cream udon because it doesn't feel as thick and heavy as you're eating it. Despite it's name though, the soup isn't really that spicy. I also seriously wonder why the soup never comes out that hot?? I didn't even notice this until my bf pointed it out one day, but the soup comes out kind of lukewarm (other people also mention this in their reviews). If only the food came out hotter, it would be perfect.I've also tried the Squid Butter, which is really similar to the Sea Urchin one but has a lighter seafood taste, and the Miso Carbonara, which is good if you know you like Carbonara pasta.Will definitely come back to try the cold udon. Other than that, the udon is so fresh and delicious, making this one of the more popular hot spots in Little Tokyo."
9/7/2018,20180907,3,4.32,"This place is great. Everything about the place is friendly and the people are great here. I didn't mind the wait (We literally waited only 10 mins - it was a Sunday afternoon). I heard so much about this place and everyone always raves about their uni pasta. And I love uni with a passion. Sadly, the uni udon dish highly disappointed my expectations. The pasta was more cream than uni. I actually didn't taste the uni at all, I wouldn't even have known there was if I didn't see the huge pieces of uni there!As a little dish I got the tuna over rich which was awesome and takoyaki was really good! However, my boyfriend ordered the red dragon which was really good as well. I probably would just order the red dragon or something else. Their broth was really flavorful and the pork was great. Overall, Uni pasta was definitely a hard pass and the other dishes are a MUST."
9/8/2018,20180908,5,4.32,Not all udon soups are made equal. I try finding  similar uni udon soup to no avail. Nothing compared to this tasty and savory dish anywhere. I recommend this dish for new comers before ordering anything else so you will have great experience here. And the pasta is good and fresh. Try avoiding any time after five because it can get crowded. Parking can be tough but just pay for valet
9/9/2018,20180909,5,4.32,"I came iLove the negitoro bowl, and orishi shoyu udon! I will definitely have to come back to try the other stuff!"
9/11/2018,20180911,3,4.32,"This place is BUSY! Always a line up, all day long!They have a system so at least you can step in and put your name down on the list. I cannot say that there would be space for groups. Groups of 2 came in and out quicker but it took a much longer time for our group of 4. The staff will come out and yell out your name.I am glad I went. It was an experience. The chefs at the back, doing their thing were visible through the glass making udon the right way, the real way!It was VERY hot in there. Way hotter than outside and it was a hot day in LA. Once finally seated, I was not sure that the service could be there but it was pretty good. I had ordered a 2nd beer to share and it never came - they forgot, but it happens. At least it was not on the bill.I am more of a thinner noodle king of gal (ramen, rice noodles) but I enjoyed my ""Hot Dragon"" clear udon broth with ground pork. I was looking for something with shrimp but the only thing I saw was the shrimp tempura one. My dish was listed with the ""hot"" chili pepper next to it on the menu but was not spicy at all. I wished it had been.I also got to try the sea urchin udon (creamy sauce, filling) and we ordered edamame, (just ok) calamari (too much breading) and the rice with pork belly. The rice was delicious and with the little sliced, green onions, it was my fave thing on the table.I would recommend to anyone loving fresh udon if you have the time, to try it out here."
9/11/2018,20180911,5,4.32,"I have to say hands down, they served me the best takoyaki I have ever had and I couldn't help but get a second order. We also ordered calamari which was delicious, light and crispy. A great way to start the meal! Since it was our first time we decided to order their specialty udon gratin and miso carbonara. I thought that both dishes had lovely flavors however we I think next time we would go with traditional broth since they're on the richer side. Don't get me wrong though, it was delicious, its just stick to your bone delicious which I find better in cold weather. I love that you can get add on tempura which they make impeccably well. The soft boiled egg and shrimp tempura was magnificent. The staff is also super friendly and patient. I will definitely come back soon. Can you open one in Portland? If so, I will be there once a week!!"
9/11/2018,20180911,5,4.32,Uni udon is my favorite! It's a must try if you love uni. It's creamy and just right! I go there every time just for uni udon. Tried other udon too. All tasty.
9/12/2018,20180912,5,4.32,My husband and I went to Marugame Monzo for their high yelp ratings and their freshly made udon (thick chewy noodles) that they make. I liked how we got seated right in front of the gentleman who made the noodles. It was fascinating looking at his creativity in making really handsomely made noodles. We ordered tempura egg which if it was tempura battered or not didn't make a difference in the tastes of the egg in my opinion so next time I will just order regular boiled egg. Then we ordered hot dragon udon and kakuni udon. I hated my kakuni (pork belly) udon. The pork belly was over cooked and the broth didn't have a flavorful taste to it. I recommend avoiding this type of broth when you see it in the menu. My husband and I both disliked the broth that we just finished the meat and the noodles but left the broth :(. My husband's order which was the hot dragon udon was exceptionally delicious and flavorful. It was spicy and had a Thai food taste to it ironically since this is Japanese restaurant. I highly suggest you order it. The five stars is for this dish along with the delicious fresh noodles they make. I highly applaud that in any restaurant. I LOVED the noodles. Yum yum
9/13/2018,20180913,4,4.32,"My second time in the last month or so. After my first visit, I had to come back. I had the Red Dragon Udon the first time which was really delicious. But I didn't enjoy the Sansai Udon as much. The broth tasted more acidic and sharp which I didn't enjoy it as much. We went on the Sunday night around 7 o'clock. Our party of four waited for about 30 minutes."
9/16/2018,20180916,4,4.32,Is this place good for keto or low carb friendly? (I'm not a dietician)Can't escape carb because it's freshly made udon. Save this place for your cheat day. Good news if they don't give you a lot of udon...I had the sea urchin udon but I think next time the bacon would be good for $4 less. I need to try their tempura egg next time... saw my neighbor ordered it.Can't have carb often... then this is a great place to cheat when you do.
9/17/2018,20180917,4,4.32,"Great food. Lackluster service. There are 2 servers that actually care about the experience. The rest of the staff is hurried and scatterbrained. And the tables are damn near stuck together. Hey owners. It's ok to give us at least a foot apart. It is the best udon in Los Angeles so far, but I'm hoping I'll find another udon gem that actually knows how to seat people with enough elbow room to use my chopsticks. Don't get the rice, only get the original kake udon, or the squid butter udon. The tempura is good but not mind blowing. Portion is large and flavor is fire. You might have to get pushy to get shit handled."
9/17/2018,20180917,4,4.32,I am a Celebrity Reporter. I decided to take a few friends out to dinner. I was very impressed. We enjoyed every moment. Good place for friends. Bravo guys!
9/18/2018,20180918,4,4.32,"Any time I can get freshly made noodles (Japanese , Chinese, Italian) I am there! You can watch them make the noodles, then choose to customize your 'toppings.' Or you can order any of the myriad set items. My benchmark for Japanese restaurants is vegetable tempura: thin, light, crispy without being greasy, batter with just-right cooked-ness of the vegetable itself?"
9/19/2018,20180919,5,4.32,"If you come with a party of two or more, please do drop someone off at the location to put your name in because most of the time, it will be very difficult to find parking. There are plenty of parking structures you can choose, but if you drive around Little Tokyo, there are plenty of spots to park in if you're patient enough.I've gone once around dinner time and the wait was about 20-30 minutes. You can go explore the area a bit to kill some time. Many dessert spots and markets you can check out. Oh, they have an outdoor karaoke setup as well.Once we got in, the actual restaurant is pretty small, but very packed. If you're claustrophobic, I'd definitely stay away.Anyways, I believe I got their Hot Dragon Udon. Very good broth and noodles were cooked perfectly as well.Although the restaurant is super busy all throughout the dinner service, the actual service was very good.I've been here over a year ago, so it's well overdue, but the hype lives up to its name.If you want some bomb ramen and you're willing to wait a bit, I'd recommend this place 100%."
9/19/2018,20180919,4,4.32,"We came here on a whim while we were in the Los Angeles area. The wait time was pretty long and it was a hot day! There's not a lot of space on the sidewalk or under the awning on a weekend. The restaurant is actually quite narrow/small so a large party would understandably have to wait a bit (we had 7). They have someone in the window making fresh udon noodles and everyone can watch, which was pretty cool. The food itself is DELICIOUS and not like anything I have ever tried before! Everyone ordered different dishes including the Sea Urchin Cream Udon, Mushroom Udon, Tempura Udon, Carbonara Udon, and the calamari appetizer. Do not skip out on the calamari - that really took us all by surprise. Super yummy and everyone got a couple pieces before our udon came out! The presentation came out really clean and beautiful with utensils that made eating and sharing with each other super easy. Parking - there's street parking and garages close by. Just park in the garage across the street if there isn't any street parking. I don't remember how much it was - but it was reasonably priced considering it was in the middle of Little Tokyo. Bathroom - 1 bathroom for each gender specified; the women's restroom was clean and modern! Would definitely recommend coming and trying out, especially if you're a fan of noodles. The udon noodles were so fresh and the flavors they use were super unique and delicious! Believe the hype!"
9/21/2018,20180921,5,4.32,GET THE BEEF UDON. Its amazing. I love this place. In town for a visit and glad I found this place on yelp. The tempura is great as well.
9/22/2018,20180922,5,4.32,"The handmade udon tastes great. I ordered a champon udon and really liked the soup. I also added the sour plum paste, which has several layers of the flavor, yet does not went very well with my udon but probably a rather creamy one. Serving time is kinda long. It gets very busy on a weekend noon. Portion size for Champon is pretty great as it has lots of shrimps, scallop and cabbage."
9/22/2018,20180922,5,4.32,"BEST udon of my life. Sea Urchin Cream Udon was nothing but the best, although no chunks of Uni in it would highly recommend this place, none the less."
9/24/2018,20180924,5,4.32,"Had to come and check this place out! As an East coaster could only pick 1, since I would not be a regular. Went mainstream and chose the Uni for the novelty. It was really good! Loved the added Ikura on top. With that being said...I'm happy I ordered, but wouldn't be torn to keep getting this as a regular option if I could keep coming back. Worth getting once, but I'd be good choosing other items if I lived in the area. Udon noodles were cooked perfectly. $2 baby octo....why not? However, wish I had a side of tempura sauce. Solid place, would love to come back!"
9/24/2018,20180924,5,4.33,"I do not like Udon. Whenever my friends want udon, I pray that there is sushi at that restaurant. BUT Marugame Monzo is a game changer! Legit, you've changed me and I will not eat another bowl of udon unless it's here.I ordered the Mad Tiger Udon, which was a mistake, because the Sea Urchin Cream Udon AND Mentai Squid Butter Udon are an absolute MUST. I seriously almost lost some friends that night, because I was about to steal all their noodles and goods. Just trust me. Get the Mentai Squid and Urchin Cream, whatever you do. Zero ragrets."
9/24/2018,20180924,5,4.33,The Beef Udon was amazing! The meat is sliced perfectly and the marinade is really tasty. Added a soft boiled egg and that was the perfect addition. Want to try the Udon Carbonara next time- someone next to us had it and it looked really yummy.
9/27/2018,20180927,1,4.32,"I used to love this place but was a disappointment last week I was there. Extremely bad service and my friend has to insist our seating instead of being skipped for servers tables even though we have decided not to take big table and can separate into two and two. Then we ordered as usual. My uni udon have zero pieces of uni...... and I told her I saw other people ordered after me. They have the same amount of uni as the last time I came. I did complaint to the server. I don't like her attitude, she is making excuses and blah blah blah telling me it's pre cooked and it's just spend on the spoon how much they put into the bowl. From what my understanding of how Japanese restaurants work. They will measure how much they will put in each bowl. It's measured! Anyways, won't be going back anytime soon and anybody who encounter the same experience be warned. They really need to make some improvement in service!!!!!"
9/30/2018,20180930,5,4.32,"I love the uni udon here. However, the best kept secret here is the negitoro bowl. (Diced tuna belly sashimi with scallions over warm rice) Get it on the side!!!"
9/30/2018,20180930,4,4.32,Be prepared to wait in line outside. This place is small and pretty popular. Waited an hour before we were seated. Their udon is really good. I had the curry udon which was great but a little salty. My friend got the beef udon and I think that one is much better and less saltier. I would definitely try again for the beef udon. The price is worth the food but maybe not the wait. The service was good but the restaurant is really cramped with only one restroom. Be prepared to wait inside too.
10/1/2018,20181001,5,4.32,"Best udon in town, hands down. There's literally no comparable udon place in Los Angeles. I love the basic udon dishes here, and that you get to watch the process of the chefs tearing apart these handmade noodles. I suggest adding a soft boiled egg to anything you get here as well. The less traditional dishes are very savory. The uni udon was too heavy and creamy for me, but would be better to share with friends. The squid mentai was also food coma inducing, so I normally would stick the the less seasoned dishes. Still so good here, and please expect a wait."
10/5/2018,20181005,4,4.32,Uni cream udon is to die for. I always love coming here for the uni udon. I can never get enough of it. Me and my boyfriend come here at least once a month. I love watching the chefs cut my noodles. That's how you know it is freshhhh noodles.
10/6/2018,20181006,3,4.32,"Firstly, I had high expectations coming here because the place is very well liked by the locals and I heard good things. I had been meaning to come here and just ran into this restaurant, so we decided to try, there was a wait, we put one of our names down, walked around, came back, and were quickly seated into a packed space. We each tried the mentai squid butter udon and sea urchin cream udon. I thought the uni in the latter wasn't fresh and was TINY in portion; was honestly disappointed. I also thought the dish was too heavy for me to finish even considering that it's cream-based and I love cream-based noodles. The freshly made noodles weren't like amazingly different in terms of texture and taste from others I've tried either. Out of two dishes, I would recommend the squid butter udon."
10/6/2018,20181006,5,4.32,Best udon place around. I come here every time I'm in town and it always consistently hits the mark. I usually get the sea urchin or tomato udon and fried calamari.  Never disappoints.
10/7/2018,20181007,4,4.32,"Not as good as I thought it would be?Everyone was hyping up the sea urchin cream udon so much, I had to try it. I love cream udon so that's why I wanted to go here in the first place.So first, there was a line outside but it didn't take too long. Our wait was like 20 mins for 2. The waiters are pretty nice, and there was a guy who walked around refilling drinks which is nice.They also have restrooms in the restaurant.We got hot tea, which was goodWe order takoyaki, fried calamari and two udon dishes. The takoyaki was good but I felt like it was all sauce and no octopus? The calamari was good. Now the sea urchin udon, I have to say the cream sauce is the best I've had so far. It's very rich and just overall what made the dish. Even though the udon noodles are made in house, I didn't really taste anything special? Actually, I've had better.... the uni was alright but there was so little of it, I couldn't even get much of the taste. I also got a soft boiled egg for my udon, which was cold...if it was at least warm, it would've been perfect. The food overall for me was actually just alright. I'm a little disappointed but maybe my expectations are too high, especially for authentic Japanese food."
10/7/2018,20181007,5,4.32,"MM gave me a new opinion on udon! My SO and I were up in LA for an overnight trip on Labor Day and wanted to have some ramen, but most places were closed because of the holiday. Since this place was open, we decided to try, although I normally stay away from udon on the menu. I figured the short line outside was a good indication of how good it was. We were not disappointed!We shared calamari to start; it was delicious, but OK. I had the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon since I've never heard of a broth that would have chunks of uni in it. My SO got the Curry Udon. The bowls were pretty large and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to finish it. Well... it was so good! I made sure to not even leave a drop of that broth in the bowl - and neither did my SO with his. Both of us were slurping straight from the bowl! I had ikura and it was actually really nice to have the saltiness cut through the milkiness of the broth.The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from a noodle shop but the thing that we really enjoyed was being able to sit at the bar and watch the chefs make the noodles. If we ever come back up to LA, I will have to come back and try their other dishes."
10/8/2018,20181008,5,4.32,The Best fastest made fresh to order Udon Ever!!!! The guys in this kitchen are no joke they really hustle and focus on every order and movement. The noodle maker was impressive he was super fast and rolling out the dough and slicing the noodles. Very cool to watch from the bar. The noddle fresh and subtle and broth was basic but good. The pork was packed with flavor and smashing it down in the bowl made the udon taste even better! The tempura was crispy and delicious of course really enjoyed the juicy shiitake mushroom. Get in line early or expect a decent wait but the service is fast and people don't stay long during their meals.
10/8/2018,20181008,5,4.32,"THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! The wait isn't so bad just try and stand next to the door when you wait outside. I got the traditional ramen with the recommended flavor, the soup is huge so get a small. Unless you're super hungry, haha. Great vibe, soup comes out quick. Definitely a place to eat and enjoy but you really can't stay for to too long. Loved it though, for-sure coming back."
10/8/2018,20181008,4,4.32,Really good udon. Probably the best in LA. But always a wait and no space. Still have to go here for your udon craving!!
10/9/2018,20181009,5,4.32,"Best udon in the world. The line outside is long no matter what time you'll go, but it's so worth it. I keep coming back. Creamy mushroom or seafood udon is the best!"
10/10/2018,20181010,5,4.33,"This is a delicious spot for udon! Although the wait can compete with Daikokuya next door during prime times, I think it's well worth it for an udon craving. For four people we ordered tuna don, miso carbonara, beef udon, mentai squid udon, and kitsune udon. This was an ample amount of food and everyone got a bite of the small rice bowl as an appetizer. The miso carbonara was most like a creamy Alfredo fusion dishes. The squid udon had an odd texture with all the eggs. My favorite was the beef udon--I know, how boring."
10/10/2018,20181010,5,4.33,Hands down the BEST Udon I've ever had in my life...and it was vegetarian!! Marugame Monzo truly captures the umami taste with their broth and freshness of the noodles. A MUST GO while in LA. Vegetaful everyday please!
10/12/2018,20181012,3,4.32,"Ehhhh. In my opinion, this is NOT worth the wait. First time I came, we got there at 11:10 for an 11:30 opening, but since our group was large and not all there, we weren't seated and would have to wait for the tables to clear.On another night, my table of 3 put in their name at 8:10 on a Sat evening and we weren't seated till about 8:50. It is a lot easier if you are a group of two or are willing to be split up. The noodles didn't taste any different to me (sorry!!) but the types of offerings are really amazing. I had the creamy uni one and it's like an alfredo sauce with bits of uni. I do like that you can add on pieces of tempura and there are cold and hot udon options. Service was friendly and the food was good, but I honestly don't think I'd wait that long again."
10/12/2018,20181012,2,4.32,"Bad customer service: we had a group of 6 and a person from the group was parking they refused to take our order, even though we were going to order for the person who was going to join us. They kicked us out of our booth and were refusing to seat us. When we finally got our food it was good, however I found it overpriced and I will not return."
10/13/2018,20181013,5,4.32,"I've been coming to Monzo regularly since I've moved to LA 3 years ago, and it is one of my favorite restaurants ever.I'll write a review of each thing I've tried here below starting with the:APPETIZERNegitoro wrap - delicious! you make you tone wrap. highly recommend to share with 2-3 people.Fried chicken - very juicy! comes with side of mayo and seasoning. good to share for 2.Crispy chicken skin - the one thing I may not have enjoyed here. I would recommend the fried chicken instead.RICE BOWL These are great addition to any udon!My personal favorites are the beef bowl (same beef used in the beef udon and beef bukkake udon), pork belly rice bowl and the negitoro rice bowl. You can never go wrong with any of these!HOT UDONKake udon - a classic that never disappoints. I like to add a side of the jumbo shrimp tempura with this one.Shrimp tempura udon - pretty much the kake udon with 2 pieces of shrimp tempura. Yum!Beef udon - if you're looking for something a little more flavorful, beef udon is a great choice! The broth is rich and sweet.Kakuni udon - I didn't like that the pork was marinated. It's a little too sweet and fatty. Kamaage udon - another favorite of mine. This is a dipping hot udon if you're looking to try something different! A must try!Curry udon - it's not something I would recommend for first visit (try one of their more classic ones first), but this curry udon is good with a rice bowl or the fried chicken. The curry is just the right amount of flavorful.COLD UDONIt is kind of a weird concept to have cold udon, but it is so delicious! My favorite are the zaru, beef bukkake (this is a variation of the beef udon cold), the regular bukkake udon and cold udon with soft boiled egg.SIGNATURE UDONMiso carbonara - my favorite from this list of udon. It is pretty heavy and creamy, but oh so delicious!Champon udon - not something I would recommend for a first visit, but if you've been to Marugame a couple times and are looking for something different, I recommend trying the champon udon. There is also a lot of vegetables with this one and the broth is refreshing.Udon gratin - way too cheesy / thick but if you're into that, then go for it!That's all for now! Hope it helps and I shall update as I try more new things on the menu :)"
10/14/2018,20181014,5,4.32,The best udon in LA I've tried so far. Great complete menu with good classic hot and cold options. Great deal with the small rice bowls which are also delicious and worth getting. Line goes by fast and worth the wait!
10/15/2018,20181015,5,4.32,"I've seen so many people go here and rave about the food. Recently, I finally had a chance to try it and I was blown away! I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my friend expecting it would be busy with a long wait. Luckily, it moved quickly. Service was awesome. Everyone was very prompt and fast, but they didn't make it feel like they were rushing you out the door. Food. This probably the best meal that I've had in a while. I was seriously shook at the various flavors and the balance of each of the dishes. Coming here, I already had high expectations for the uni cream udon since that's one thing they're known for. So, my friend and shared the Uni Cream Udon and the Cold Beef Bukkake Udon. The uni udon was so rich and creamy but not overwhelming to the point where you get nauseated from the heaviness of the cream. Like I said - well balanced. The beef udon was very light and refreshing. The two dishes together were a great contrast from one another. As for the noodles, they were exactly how they should be - a nice bite and perfectly chewy. I can't wait to come back to try more of their dishes!"
10/15/2018,20181015,5,4.33,"For an udon lover, this place is perfect. You can choose from so many types of udon and it's cooked fresh just for you. The udon itself has the right amount of bounce to them. Being all vegetarians we tried 3 different vegetarian options. Kama boll pot which comes with a dipping sauce had a sweet, umami flavour, delicious. Hot sansai comes with vegetables and mushrooms was a touch on the salty side but still very good. The only reason I thought it was a little too salty was because the Vegetaful udon was absolutely tasty as heck! The flavour and creaminess was so balanced, I wished I was having that all by myself ."
10/17/2018,20181017,5,4.33,"I have been to this place so many times that I lost count. There is always a wait but it is so worth it! I always get the uni cream udon! Melt in your mouth delicious! And if it's during lunch time I get the combo and I either choose the ikura bowl or the negitoro bowl. If my husband comes with me, we buy the miso pork onigiri as well. Sometimes we get to see the chef make the udon noodles in front of us, which is really neat. I love watching them make the noodles! Whenever I'm in the area I always want to eat here. I will keep coming back again and again for sure! :]"
10/17/2018,20181017,5,4.33,"Chewy, slippery udon. Delicate (not overly salted), ice-cold dashi. Freshly grated, juicy, cold daikon. Orange-yolked, soft-boiled egg tempura (so light and crunchy on the outside, soft and velvety on the inside). Heaps of paper-thin, marinated beef. Finely chopped green onion. Firm ikura. The best lunch for a hot and sunny, L.A. day while walking around Little Tokyo."
10/18/2018,20181018,5,4.33,"It's a good thing we arrived 15 minutes before opening at lunch time, as a line had already begun to form when we walked up. Good sign, I thought. Once inside, I realized this was an amazingly busy restaurant. Fortunately for us, we were able to get in on the first wave. The menu was perfect, something for everyone, including vegetarians. And an option my hubby couldn't resist was to include double udon in his bowl. He chose the seaweed udon while I chose the vegetarian option. The fish broth in his bowl was quite tasty while my.broth tasted mushroom based filled with veggies, garlic, mushrooms and deliciousness. Both were quite interesting flavors. Did I mention we were able to see the udon being made right before our eyes? We also shared a small rice bowl of spicy tuna, I could have eaten another, it was sooo good.I'd go back in a heartbeat! Parking is available at garages or lots in the vicinity. Remember, get there early!"
10/18/2018,20181018,5,4.33,Been dying to try this place for the longest time. Lots of friends said I needed to try this place and they were absolutely right. One thing that was bad on my part was not noticing that they close between lunch and dinner. We came towards the tail end of lunch so the staff was in a hurry to take our order and get out. Totally understandable.I got the Udon Carbonara and added an ikura rice bowl for a few bucks more for the lunch combo. My friends got the Udon Bolognese and the Udon with Mushroom Creme. Everyone loved their order! Our food came out quickly.I'll definitely come back earlier or later so we don't feel as rushed next time. But definitely will come back!
10/19/2018,20181019,4,4.33,"If you can bear with the long lines, then you will be in for a treat. After waiting 30 minutes even at 9 pm, we finally got seated at the bar. We watched the cooks at work through the glass windows preparing the udon noodles. I recommend sitting here unless you can't stand sitting in real close proximity with strangers. I almost thought I would splash my neighbor with some soup base. Uni udon: So creamy I thought I was eating a carbonara pasta from a high end Italian restaurant. Full of flavor in each slurp of noodles. Texture of uni was a little different than what I am used to raw. It does take away from the distinct sweetness and ocean flavor of uni. Cold Udon: Surprisingly refreshing. Udon is chilled and has a mild tangy sauce that you mix into it. There are a variety of add ons that complement the noodles well. Definitely give the uni udon a try if you have not been here. It is one of those things that you probably will only get once just to experience it. I would suggest getting the cold udon on hot days and a simple bowl of udon for cold nights. Price is reasonable, but a little hectic from all the busy customers and waiters pacing around in a small vicinity. Overall, food is good and service is decent, so I will be back if I am in the area."
10/20/2018,20181020,4,4.33,"It was really fun to sit at the bar and watch the person in the glass window making and cutting udon. It makes you feel like the udon you are eating is really fresh and homemade. You can watch all of the people cooking and preparing the bowl you are about to enjoy. Although I enjoyed the bowl of udon I had, I realized that udon places lack vegetables. It's all udon creaminess. There is street meter parking if you're lucky, otherwise, the lot around the corner for the plaza across the street is not too expensive."
10/22/2018,20181022,5,4.33,Hands down their uni udon is the best thing I've ate in a long time! Definitely worth the wait! Absolutely delicious!
10/22/2018,20181022,5,4.33,If you haven't experienced fresh udon and are a huge fan of noodles you owe it to yourself to try this place. Fresh udon made at the window. The sauces were on point as well. Delicious good food. Try to beat the crowd and they don't take reservations. Good luck.
10/22/2018,20181022,5,4.33,One of my favorite udon restaurants to go to in la! The carbonara udon and the seafood tomato is one of the dishes to get
10/23/2018,20181023,4,4.33,"The wait was about an hour, but we've been wanting to give this place a try. And it was worth it. This place definitely has the best udon in LA. We ordered the mentai squid butter udon, which was quite an amazing experience. We also had the seafood tomato cream udon and miso carbonara udon, both of which I would order again. I would recommend also getting some of the tempura, especially the soft-boiled egg which was unique and delicious!"
10/24/2018,20181024,5,4.33,"Some of the yummiest ramen ever. I came here with my dad this past weekend to eat some ramen. The place opened at 11:30 am so we dashed there after going to the Cathedral. There was an AIDS walk going on, so luckily, it was pretty easy to cross the streets. The place itself is really small but very comforting.Onto the noodles, my favorite part! They are fresh, thick, and flavorful. I mean, you can see the chefs hard at work, pulling, stretching, and rolling those noodles. I got the curry with pork belly, I was going to try out one of their special ones, but I was feeling curry. They actually do give a lot of pork belly pieces and noodles. For less than $9, this was such a cheap steal. The broth is very thick and hearty. I like it better than the ones served with Japanese curry, because it has more ""body"". The pork belly is sliced thinly and has a nice flavor. The noodles are some of the best things on earth. I would totally just buy the noodles and eat them rather than ordering a whole dish. Other than hot udons, they also offer cold ones. I haven't tried those, but I have seen that they are on of the top ordered ones here on yelp. Service here is quick and you can be in and out within 45 minutes. It gets pretty crowded at lunch and there is seldom any parking. Most of it is metered street parking (I believe it is free Sundays but will have to check) or public parking with a fee."
10/25/2018,20181025,5,4.33,"The Wait: A wise one says if you wanna go fast, go alone. Two days in a row (yup, this place keeps me coming back!!), seat for one at the counter, ~noon weekday, no wait. Chef kept making eye contact with me. He was apparently taken in by my amazed face at the rolling dough and hand-cut noodles.The Service:FT. What? It's too fast it drops the AS. Get it? Don't worry, I don't get it neither, my brain. Not only fast, but very very attentive service. THE Udon:Wow. The Udon. I'm drooling again.- Creamy Uni Udon: So rich! So creamy! So flavorful! Quite a few big bits of Uni in there. I almost threw away my table manner and licked that bowl clean! Why? Why was I raised up with this useless consciousness? My wasted uni broth! I forever regret!- Mentai Squid Butter Udon: Thin broth. So rich! So flavorful! Quite a few big bits of tender squid in there. I almost threw away my table manner and licked that bowl clean! Why? Why was I raised up with this useless consciousness? My wasted mentaiko broth! I forever regret!I learned my lesson. Next time you see someone at the counter with the bowl on their face, it's me. Come and say hi.The sidekicks:- Negitoro bowl: rice bowl topped with fatty tuna minced with onion, a nice lead to the main course. I saved some of the white rice and dumped it in the left over mentaiko broth. So so good!!!- Tempura - jumbo shrimp, soft boiled egg: very light and crispy batter. Shrimp is huge. Soft boiled egg with runny center. Good but can do with or without.- Chili oil: what a waste of 50 cents. Skip it. If you want spicy, use the shichimi on the table for free!- Shichimi: I just discovered this on my second trip. So so good sprinkling on the Udon!!! Spicy as I like it!Coming back? What kind of silly question is this???!"
10/26/2018,20181026,4,4.33,"This is insanely busy during lunch. I was seated promptly, order was taken - but not much help for a first time order. I chose the tempura shrimp and udon. I had to request some dip for the shrimp and never saw my waitress again. A young gentleman finally helped out. If the food wasn't sooo amazing I might of gave less stars. I am from SF and drove a xtra 40 miles while in LA to eat here. Not sure I'll do it again."
10/27/2018,20181027,5,4.33,"I recently visited Monzo again and tried their Mentaiko squid butter udon thanks to my colleague / fellow yelp elite friend, Victoria and omg now I get the hype of Monzo!!+I've tried their traditional udon and miso carbonara or uni pasta but wasn't amazed. Thought they deserved 3 stars for creativity but wasn't impressed enough to visit again. However I recently visited Monzo due to my ex colleague's request who was resigning the company. She's also an avid yelp elite so I followed her lead and ordered the same Mentaiko squid butter udon and lo and behold, I'm an instant fan of Monzo now!! The Mentaiko squid butter isn't too heavy like miso carbonara and its super flavorful thanks to Mentaiko. The creaminess and Mentaiko perfectly complimented the thick udon noodles and I left Monzo wanting for more! +you can also upgrade your lunch and add small rice bowl for additional $2 or $3 I think. -but don't order the kakiage bowl. Its ginormous and looks like a small tower but it wasn't that great and it doesn't reheat well so it's not worth taking home either. Monzo... I'll be back for you soon!"
10/28/2018,20181028,5,4.33,"Came to visit LA for a weekend and I'm not usually an Udon or ramen person but this place was amazing!! We ordered the seafood tomato creamy udon, the dragon udon, and udon gratin. All of them were amazing!!!"
10/29/2018,20181029,4,4.33,"They make their noodles in house (get the bar seating to watch the action). The wait wasn't bad for a Saturday at 2pm. There were 9 people in front of me & I was seated in 15min! They have a variety of flavors to try (clear broth, cream sauce, hot/cold). The first time I visited, I had to try the the fried boiled egg. I suggest trying the squid butter udon if it's your first time because it really has a unique flavor. The beef udon is just exactly what the name suggests. The sea urchin udon had really little uni ‍ the serving size is perfect in that it leaves you satisfied but enough room for dessert since little Tokyo has a million places for dessert. If you eat bigger portions, they have a lunch special where you can get their bowls for an additional $3/$4."
11/1/2018,20181101,5,4.33,"One of my favorites!!! I come here pretty often, and I'm finally trying to catch up on some reviews. I've tried a variety of items from the menu, and my favorite are the cold bukkake udon and the uni udon. If i'm feeling some clean eats, I'll get a kitsune udon or a tempura udon. I love all of their mini rice bowls.. sooo good. negitoro!! you can't find in too many udon/ramen places around and I always love me some ikura. I love that I can always know what to expect (after the first time going). Their procedures, service, and food have been so consistent from my experience. It's cool to see them occasionally make/cut their noodles by the window. This is one of those restaurants that I'm always down to wait for. especially because you can put your name down and kinda walk around and come back :)"
11/5/2018,20181105,4,4.33,"Love this place! I am a lover of udon noodles and they make it so well here! I usually get the niku udon with wakame (beef udon with seaweed) and it never fails. The wait here can be a nightmare so make sure you go before they open to catch the first rush. I usually stand in line 11:15 for their 11:30 opening. One complaint I have is that.. this place is old and quite dirty, hope they will clean it up a bit in the future."
11/6/2018,20181106,5,4.33,"Uni udon is amaze balls lol I recently discover eating uni and I am hooked! Idk what took me so long to try it! The creamy udon was just perfect. You can see the chefs making fresh noodles right behind the counter so you just know it's going to be good. We also ordered the braised pork and the red dragon ramen! Both were super delicious! The braised pork had the perfect amount to sweet and savory and super soft and fatty meat, while the red dragon ramen had perfectly cooked ramen with a rich broth! I definitely want to come back and try some other things on the menu! This restaurant was a little small with a long wait but trust me it's worth it!"
11/6/2018,20181106,5,4.33,"I can never say no to noodles, especially HANDMADE noodles. We stopped by MM on a weekday, 5 minutes before they opened and there was already a line. We barely made it in! There were maybe 25 people ahead of us. FOOD Takoyaki (octopus balls) - looked homemade and came out super hot. Each ball had 1-2 pieces of octopus, recommend!Mentai squid butter udon - udon was chewy and so good. The sauce was tasty and not too heavy. Squid was was perfectly cooked and fish eggs added some texture. Mushroom cream udon - my partner ordered this and it was pretty good too! Very mushroom-y and noodles were the same (delish). The cream sauce was too heavy for lunch imo. Add-ons:Soft-boiled egg tempura - boiled egg coated in panko + fried, I've never had something like this and it went well with the udon.Shrimp tempura - shrimp was juicy inside, crispy outside. Chicken tempura - not a huge fan of this one, it fell apart and chicken was bland. Would not recommend. The patron next to me ordered the uni udon and it looked amazing. *drools*I would love to sit by the kitchen and watch the chefs make the noodles!"
11/6/2018,20181106,5,4.33,"I. LOVE. THIS. UDON. PLACE. i always find myself coming back to marugame monzo whenever i crave for a bowl of udon, and always dragging my friends to this place too. Their beef bukkake (cold) is the best!"
11/7/2018,20181107,4,4.33,"Everyone raves about this place so I finally decided to try it out to see what the hype was all about. I'm not a huge uni lover, but I wanted to try the uni udon since everyone said it's good. My friend and I ordered the uni udon and the beef udon to share so that we can try them both. I was actually really surprised that I loved the uni udon!! It's so creamy & rich and it pairs so well with the freshly made udon. However, it does tend to get a little heavy toward the end of the meal. The beef udon soup helped balance out the heaviness of the uni udon so I ate the uni bowl first. But I really enjoyed both bowls! The second time I came back, I tried the mad tiger udon and it was really good also! It's my first time trying a cold udon and it was really refreshing for a hot day. In my opinion, it wasn't overwhelmingly spicy so that was a plus :3 Appetizers: Takoyaki was sooo bomb! Clams w/ miso garlic was very flavorful but kind of expensive LOL. The prices are a little higher than normal udon places, but I think it's worth the splurge once in a while! There's a parking structure across the street that you could pay for or there's metered street parking."
11/8/2018,20181108,5,4.33,"WORTH THE WAIT. I don't have much else to say. Parking here isn't too bad, but I do tend to be lucky with finding free or street parking. There are metered spots all along the street, free after 8pm. If possible I would have someone in your party go put your name down on the call list while you look for parking. Wait time for me and a friend was about an hour or so on Saturday night, arriving at 8pm.The restaurant is pretty small so you might bump elbows with the table next to you, but you'll be too focused on the food to care. Their noodles are handmade, and if you're lucky enough to get seated in the back you'll have a first hand view of them making the noodles for you!Service: 5/5 I would say table turnover was pretty fast and the food came out pretty fast as well.Pork Belly Rice Bowl $5.45: Looks simple, but the pork belly melts in your mouth. You have to try it!!Tempura Soft-Boiled Egg $1.50: A different twist on a soft boiled egg. Mix the runny yolk in with your uni cream udon.Sea Urchin Udon $16.95: The BEST uni cream udon I've tried anywhere. The cream is so rich and doesn't taste like the ""sea"" which is sometimes common in uni dishes. The shiso leaf and masago on top complimented the dish really well adding another layer to the depth of flavor. The texture of the udon noodle was perfect, not too doughy or chewy. My boyfriend and I ended up eating up every last bit of the udon, uni, and cream! (We mixed some of the leftover rice from the pork belly rice in with the cream and it was sooo good.)Overall, I would love to come back and try more of their udon dishes, but I'm torn because the uni cream udon is so good I'm tempted to order it everytime! Marugame is a must try if you're ever in the area."
11/8/2018,20181108,3,4.33,"The uni pasta is their specialty so I had to try it. Even tho I hate uni sushi. But cooked uni was fine, I didn't have any problem with that, you couldn't really taste it. The sauce was similar to an Alfredo sauce which was weird to me. Is this supposed to be some kind of Italian fusion? It was edible but I didn't like it, neither did my friend who had the curry Udon which was just ok. So from the things we tried this place was meh."
11/9/2018,20181109,5,4.33,"My family hails from Kagawa Prefecture in Japan. That might not mean shit to you, but it does to people in Japan because Kagawa Prefecture is known for their udon noodles. Yup, they're a regular bunch of udon snobs, constantly nitpicking udon joints over the texture of the noodles, the flavor of the broth, and the combination of the two together. I have to admit a little bit of the snobbery has rubbed off on me because I've yet to find an udon place in Los Angeles that serves up quality udon. That is, until I tried Marugame Monzo.The udon at Marugame Monzo is on point. The noodles have the perfect consistency (just short of al dente with a nice mouth feel and slurp), and their soups have that nice umami punch to compliment the noodles. What I like best about this place is you can get traditional udon dishes or some more ""modern"" interpretations. Both ways to enjoy the udon are delicious. I'm a purist so I always go for the traditional dishes, but I definitely don't fault Marugame Monzo for branching out and trying new things, especially since they clearly know what they're doing.It's kind of like Iron Chef Morimoto. He always makes wacky food, right? But it's dope because he can also make traditional dishes. When he was an Iron Chef in Japan, all kinds of ""clans"" would battle him because he was a dishonorable Japanese chef for making weird modern dishes. They'd roll up and make their traditional Japanese fare and be all fucking hardcore about it. Meanwhile, Morimoto would make his wacky dishes AND ALSO MAKE THE TRADITIONAL SHIT! And his traditional dishes would taste better than his challengers. So delicious. So yeah, props to these guys for both keeping it real AND branching out. After all, this is America. Why not take advantage of the melting pot of cool cultures to try something new and different? Hey, as long as it tastes good, I'm down.Oh, one more thing. Be prepared to wait if you go during peak times. It's not Daikokuya levels of waiting, but you're gonna have to wait. Trust me, it's worth it, though. Besides, now that there's smartphones you can kill time by checking Twitter or doing whatever it is we do on our phones to waste time."
11/10/2018,20181110,4,4.33,"This was their signature miso udon as I remember, and over there was cold udon of my friend which I don't remember the name (I'm sorry). The broth was really nice, I finished all. It was a crowded place, you will have to wait for about 15 minutes or more, but it's worth waiting."
11/12/2018,20181112,5,4.33,I've always wanted to try a creamy udon place and this place is really good! I got the carbonara udon with pork belly bowl and my bf got the udon gratin with the beef bowl. Both of the udon was really tasty and flavorful and the noodles that were handmade was perfectly cooked and I enjoyed every bite. My pork belly bowl could use a little more taste but other than that the meat was very tender and soft! Will definitely come back and try their other signature dishes like the uni udon and the tomato seafood one!
11/12/2018,20181112,5,4.33,"Really great.  Quick service, good food, cold beer, beautifully-priced."
11/13/2018,20181113,5,4.33,"Get here quick and write your name down! There is always a line here every time I've came. Parking can be a little rough during busy hours so bring some change or pay at the lot in the back. The carbonara udon is my go to meal! It has never failed, there is so much flavor in every bite. I also have tried the sea urchin udon as well, also delicious but I always go with the carbonara. It is a very tight and close dining area and can get a little loud. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in the area."
11/15/2018,20181115,5,4.33,"One of my favorite restaurants in LA. Cold, fresh udon is so satisfying on hot LA days, and their tempura is the best anywhere. Watching the udon being made is a nice perk, but the quality of the food/ingredients is what makes this place."
11/15/2018,20181115,4,4.33,"My first time seeing this place, I was intimidated by the long lines and decided to try the ramen place right next door instead. After doing some more research, I realized that they serve udon and made a promise that I would come back for it the next time I'm back in town.On a Saturday afternoon, we walked in to put our name down (30 min wait) and decided to walk around Little Tokyo to pass time before we went back to check on the table. They don't sit incomplete parties so don't even try - make sure everyone is seen by the hostess or else they will not seat you. We ordered the miso carbonara and the sea urchin cream udon and both were creamy and delicious! There's not a lot of uni which is a bit disappointing but nonetheless, I'd still get it again. The carbonara wasn't too rich and the bacon gives it a lot of flavor. The udon was thick and chewy and each bowl comes with a big ladle for slurping :)"
11/16/2018,20181116,4,4.33,"Arrived with 2 other friends on a Friday night and we waited around 20 minutes. It's located in a small space in Little Tokyo - so parking is always a headache. Took some other Yelpers advice and parked in the Aiso Street lot nearby. Not sure I believe the overall hype of this place, but I did really enjoy the Beef Udon I got. The beef was really impressive and both was so good. The noodles taste fresh and chewy compared to store bought. The calamari was nothing special, so will not recommend folks to try. Next time I definitely want to come back and try some of their more unconventional Udon bowls."
11/17/2018,20181117,4,4.33,"Really enjoyed the meal here, the fresh, handmade, chewy thick udon absorbs alot of the rich creamy seafood flavour of the sauce. And the uni actually had a slightly charred/smokey flavour. There was a big lineup for a weekday lunch, around a 45 minute wait. Make sure you go in and put your name down on the list."
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.33,"Worth the wait. Came here super hungry but the 20 minute wait flew by. I normally don't like creamy dishes, but decided to go for it today and got the creamy sea urchin udon. My husband got the kitsune udon, which is probably what I would have gotten if he hadn't. We also shared a lunch add-on of the negitoro rice bowl and a mixed tempura app. The negitoro came out first and was addictive. A nice ball of cool, fresh toro with a dusting of nori strips and scallion on top of warm rice with just a little mayo. A couple dashes of the shichimi togarashi and this was a perfect little bowl. The mixed tempura came out next, and this place really does tempura right. Crunchy, creamy, and not at all greasy. The plate included a giant shrimp, two shiso leaves, a hearty slice of kabocha, eggplant, and a whole portobello. Everything was great but I really loved the portobello: juuuust cooked through inside so it was soft and juicy under the light tempura shell. Our udons were both amazing. They make the udon noodles fresh (and right in front of you if you sit at the bar) and the noodles were chewy and perfectly cooked. My husband loved the tofu in his kitsune and practically licked the bowl dry he loved the broth so much. My sea urchin udon was amazing, and one of the creamiest things I've ever eaten. Each noodle was coated in a thick, buttery, cream sauce and the dish was studded with whole lobes of lightly cooked uni. I added a little togarashi to cut the heaviness and I couldn't finish it all, especially the cream sauce, but I really enjoyed it. Would absolutely come here again."
11/17/2018,20181117,4,4.33,"Decided to come try this place out after hearing about the hype. Was also recommended by a family member. We waited about 20- 30 minutes before getting seated (came around 2pm). I ordered from the lunch combo. You can get a small rice bowl donburi for $3-$4 extra. I paired the negitoro bowl with a shrimp tempura udon. The bowl was delicious and I highly recommend trying it!! As for the udon, the noodles were nice and chewy but the taste was average. I liked that the shrimp tempura came out separately. It was lightly fried and crispy. Overall, would give this place a 4.5 if I could. The hot soup udon was not anything special. I was told the fusion dishes are what this place is known for so will definitely come back to try some."
11/18/2018,20181118,4,4.33,"I'll keep this short and too the point. We heard about the wait and got there for an early dinner. 30 min wait and we were in. Staff lacks the personal touch, but the insane lines and volume of people has likely jaded the staff. It is obvious that our server and check in staff were just going through the motions. The tables are tight and squeezed very tightly. You will be shoulder to shoulder with your neighbor.The noodles were outstanding and the preparation good. The noodle making show behind the glass was fun to watch.Everyone was very satisfied with their meals and I must say the udon dish I had was the best udon I have had in the greater LA area I will be back.Sayonara"
11/19/2018,20181119,5,4.33,"Ahhhhmazing!!!! Came on a week day around 7pm and was lucky enough to beat the dinner rush by a few minutes. We ended up only waiting about 10 minutes for a table but by the time we were seated and ordering there was a steady line building up outside.Seating is available at the bar where you can watch the preparation of the freshly in house made udon noodles. Or regular table seating. No seating available outside. After browsing the menu and having a hard time deciding on what to eat I settled on the ever so famous Sea Urchin Cream Udon. BF went with the hot dragon udon. We ordered 2 shrimp tempuras on the side, and went with water to drink. SEA URCHIN CREAM UDON - $12.95- beyond perfect! The udon noodles were just the right thickness as well as the right consistency... chewy yet soft at the same time. The sea urchin to my surprise was a decent amount. Salmon roe topped the dish and added a little bit of more texture and saltiness to the dish. The creaminess if the broth was sooo good I wanted to pick up the bowl and lick it right then and there, but pretty sure that wouldn't be appropriate. 5 stars******HOT DRAGON UDON $12.95 not as thick of a broth but just as good. Spicy level was good but there was ground chili flake to add for more of a kick. Again udon noodles were cooked perfectly. You really can't go wrong with either dish. 5 stars****SHRIMP TEMPURA $2.00- these were pretty darn big. Crispy, golden, fried shrimp but the batter was so light it wasn't heavy. Came with Tentsuyu which is a Japanese tempura sipping sauce thats was flavorful. I like to add chili flakes to the sauce to give it more of a kick. 5 stars****Service was ok. Nothing spectacular but the food was that good that it made up for it.Parking is located on the street or in the parking lot directly across the street.I will absolutely be back to try many more items and eat the same items as well."
11/19/2018,20181119,5,4.33,"Once you get past the daunting 45 min to an hour wait time on the weekends, you'll be able to appreciate the magic of these delicious creamy Italian-pasta-like udon. I have craved the Uni udon since my last visit here, and it was just as delicious the second time around. The portions feel really small for the $17 price tag, but it's definitely worth it. I love being able to see the noodles being made through the clear glass windows, and not to mention the cute Hispanic eye candy that seats you at your table."
11/19/2018,20181119,5,4.33,"Normally long lines deter me from eating at a place but Marugame Monzo is quite the exception. I personally detest many types of noodle soup; pho, ramen, etc. THAT BEING SAID... Marugame Monzo has perhaps my favorite noodle dish in all of L.A. Their Mentai Udon dish is definitely worth the wait. I recommend all my out of town friends to come to this place on their trips.I also highly recommend their heavier udon dishes. 100% filling and satisfaction everytime. I can't recall a time I've visited and not been greeted by excellent service on top of excellent food. The beef appatizers are also quite exquisite. Definitely one of L.A.s finest."
11/21/2018,20181121,4,4.33,"Got the Mentai Squid udon due to a Yelp review. While the soup is tasty (and not rich) there is a lack of chewiness with the udon noods, possibly because the soup was too hot. I think I will get the uni udon next time if I feel like queueing for an hour - thank God for free parking on Sundays! The Miso Carbonara does taste rich, I could taste the cream.Takoyaki was good as an appetiser, sufficiently crispy on the outside. Though did not get 2 octopus per ball as some yelpers were suggesting.Overall I think there is more hype to this place than anything. Have found an authentic Udon place in the OC that serves chewy noods and soup that is not too hot to keep cooking the noods."
11/24/2018,20181124,5,4.33,"For a nice change of pace from ramen, udon a thicker noodle is a great option. Selection and choice are numerous all customizable with various tempura side options. You can go traditional with the kake udon with a simple tasty light broth or udon choices with a creamier broth, that is super savory. Then there are the fusion options that push the envelope closer to a pasta selection. Whichever your pick you will be totally satisfied. Comfort food at its best!"
11/27/2018,20181127,5,4.33,Great place to grab udon. Udon noodle is handmade which it is very chewy. Tempura udon is a must to order and tempura is very crispy.
11/29/2018,20181129,5,4.33,"Holy Shit! Simply amazing Udon. I ordered the pork belly Udon. I'm Okinawan and you know how we love our pork belly, which by the way comes in big fat cubes! I didn't add any condiments,didn't need too!"
11/30/2018,20181130,4,4.33,"Had dinner at Marugame Monzo last night with my buddy. We showed up around 9:45pm, had no clue the place closes at 10pm cause we normally eat at the other ramen shops in the area that close til like 1am. They still sat us and served us. We had to order everything before the kitchen closed.Pros:1. Fresh taste 2. Quick service3. Friendly service4. The fried chicken skin was different and unique from the surrounding businesses. 5. Good reasonable prices.Cons:1. I guess maybe I'm used to ramen bowls that contain a lot of things. I thought the soup was a little plain. I ordered the beef udon, and while the portion was plentiful, it lacked flavor.2. No parking like most ramen shops in this area. So you have to pay $6 for parking across the street at the parking structure. I always feel like I'm giving money away at that structure. You're forced to park there if you want to visit the area. But this isn't the restaurants fault. Only the lame system in that area.Anyways.. it was a good experience. Good food. Good prices."
11/30/2018,20181130,5,4.33,Wow. Great place if you love Udon! I got the uni udon which was delicious with lots of flavor. A bit creamy but wow was that amazing! Waited for about 30 mins and usually can find street parking or get validation parking nearby.
12/1/2018,20181201,5,4.33,"To be honest, I found this place one night when the line next door at the ramen place was crazy long, and wow I am so happy I did. I've been back 5 or 6 times now and never bothered with the ramen (we have much better ramen in NorCal anyway).I almost always go for the curry udon, but last trip we tried the braised pork belly appetizer and wow wow wow, next time I think I'll try the udon with that pork belly."
12/1/2018,20181201,5,4.33,"One of the most popular places in Little Tokyo. Start lining up a 11:00 am to avoid the 45 minute wait! Specialty udon are quite excellent, especially the sea urchin dish. This time I went with the classic beef udon with extra noodles. One of the best udon I have had, and comparable to the quality and texture of those I tried in Japan. Employees were very accommodating of my 1 year old daughter and even let us store the stroller behind the counter. Certain house rules are in place that you need to be aware of before dining here. Make sure your whole party is there because they will not allow him or her join your table at a later time, or order for that person. Parking recommended at the LT mall parking across the street on weekends for $10. Meals here are reasonably priced and worth the wait if you get stuck in line."
12/1/2018,20181201,2,4.33,"Over hyped. Literally. Lemme give you a quick run down: - Over priced - Long lines - Large bowl small portion - Tight sitting area Yep, definitely everything an LA diner wants. Got Curry Udon, Sea Urchin Cream, Udon, and that Squid Udon... sure they tasted great but for the price we paid, I am expecting more not some tiny kid portion for a super huge bowl, which was barely filled half way. Don't get too excited when you see the mega size bowls or the long lines and everyone claiming it's the best in town. IT'S NOT! .....yeah... I'm not coming back..."
12/3/2018,20181203,5,4.33,"The sea urchin cream udon was easily the best dish I had during my entire trip to Cali! I expected there to be a long wait as I walked up to Marugame Monzo on a Thursday night around 6 PM, but fortunately there was no wait at all. I was dining by myself so I was seated immediately at the bar in front of the chefs. I got a nice show watching the chefs hand cut the udon noodles. Negitoro rice bowl (5/5) - A nice little appetizer! The toro was minced up and quite tasty. The bowl was layered with a sweet sauce similar to eel sauce, drizzled with Japanese mayo, chopped green onion, and topped with thin stripes of seaweed. It was a small bowl so it served as a perfect starter dish for myself. I had to contain myself from ordering another one. Sea urchin cream udon (5/5) - Wow.. This is what dreams are made of! There are not enough words to describe how delicious this dish is. Despite being a cream-based dish, the sauce was thin but definitely not in a bad way. Handmade udon makes such a world of a difference! A server tried to take the dish away from me after I ate all of the udon, but I wouldn't let them! I wanted to save what remnants I had left of the sauce to dip my onigri rice ball in. This dish never left my mind for the rest of my California trip.Pork miso onigri rice ball (3/5) - This was the only negative from my dining experience. The rice ball was primarily rice with very tiny bits of pork. The amount of pork was so little that I was convinced I was eating just a ball of rice until I dissected the ball. I should have just stuck to ordering another negitoro rice bowl, but I wanted to try something new. Oh well. I just dipped the rice ball into the sea urchin cream udon sauce and that made it enjoyable.My rule when I go visit another city is to try new dishes and never try something twice in the same trip. Marugame Monzo ALMOST made me break my own rule just because of that sea urchin cream udon. Okay.. Honestly I did try to return the next night on a Friday night, but the wait was so long that I decided to eat somewhere else. But if it wasn't for that wait then rules would have been broken!"
12/3/2018,20181203,5,4.33,"Can't recommend this place highly enough. It's a far drive from the Valley but it's worth it. Not even Marugame Udon cuts it. Their udon noodles are fresh and slightly al dente. The broth is just so yummy. But their pork belly rice bowl is where it's at. I've had chashu in Japan a couple months ago and honestly, the only place that comes close to that flavor is the chashu from Marugame Monzo. If you're thinking of new places to try, this is it. It doesn't feel too heavy on the stomach so you'll have space to try some desserts at the plaza right across the street!"
12/4/2018,20181204,5,4.33,"Best uni udon I have ever had. Creamy with freshly made udon. Still drooling thinking about it.The sansai udon we had is also good. However, the pickle vegetables is a little too salty for my taste."
12/4/2018,20181204,4,4.33,Uni pasta was deliciously creamy and the noodles were nice and chewy. I wish there was bread to sop up all that creamy sauce =d
12/5/2018,20181205,5,4.33,"The best udon I have ever eaten and I have eaten at plenty of udon places to be confident in that assertion. I am a creature of habit so I always default to their beef udon, but do not sleep on their Italian inspired udon creations, bc they are just as delicious. So good and comforting; I absolutely love this place. The wait can be a drag, but it's never an unreasonable wait time. Udon noodle is prepared fresh on site which makes a whole world of difference."
12/5/2018,20181205,1,4.33,"Waited for 90 min but the Udon and service was definitely not worth the wait. The udon bowl was huge but serving portion seemed for a kid menu. Also, it's a Japanese Udon but all of the chefs are Hispanics??? Lastly, the guy who was handling the wait list was also rude and looked like he didn't want to be there....stay home next time buddy."
12/6/2018,20181206,5,4.33,"Baby sis and I were in the area for a Hello Kitty event at the Japanese Village Plaza. Feeling hungry, we found Marugame Monzo was right across the street from the plaza. Despite it being the middle of summer and a whopping 90+ degrees outside, we thought, ""Sure. Why not?"" I kept my fingers crossed for some AC.We arrived a little after opening. It was only a 20 minute wait. You can walk into the shop to put your name on a list and wait outside. At that point, there will be a ton of folks who will ask you if you're standing in the Daikokuya line, which is two doors down. Move along. Move along.When it comes to Japanese food, I'm a stickler for traditional cuisine. Granted, I took a plunge and ordered the sea urchin cream udon. Verdict? AMAZING! Light, creamy and that lovely urchin taste all blended well together. So much so, I wanted to shove my face into the bowl and lick it clean. Thankfully, the dirty look my sister gave me saved her from embarrassment. I also had the mini negitoro rice bowl, which was part of my combo. That, too, was good. Killed my entire meal. I must have been really hungry. The restaurant is small and usually packed. It had a cramped feeling. But, I didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. All my attention was on the dishes in front of me. Service was quick and efficient. Price was reasonable for the quality of food."
12/7/2018,20181207,5,4.33,"I'm usually not a huge fan of udon noodles due to the thickness and how slippery they are, but Marugame changed me! It's located next to Daikokuya so you have no shortage of phenomenal Japanese cuisine if you're in the area. There's usually a wait, but it typically isn't super long and I promise it's worth it. The place itself is pretty small but they churn through the folks pretty quickly, while still managing to be courteous and friendly. Parking can be found at nearby paid lots, or if you're lucky, street parking.The only dish I've only tried here is the Uni Udon and it's simply amazing. The rich flavor of the uni and the creaminess of the base really leaves a mark on your tastebuds that'll keep you wanting to come back for more. The portion when it comes out doesn't look that big, but the creaminess of the dish will leave you content. To this day, Marugame to me is still the hands down best place to get delicious udon!"
12/8/2018,20181208,4,4.33,"I LOVE THIS PLACEE. Food: I always get the sea urchin cream udon and it never fails me. It reminds me of a pasta + udon fusion. It is a must try. Portion: will fill you upService: The wait here is always long, averaging from 30mins - 1hr. Parking: ... you're very lucky if you can get street parking. If you want to save the trouble of driving around the block, just park in one of those private parking garages for $5 all day.Environment: This place is always a full house so it can get crampy, but the food will make up for it.Price: ~$17 but I think this is worthI can't wait for them to open another restaurant in South Coast Plaza!!!"
12/10/2018,20181210,3,4.33,"I think this place is popular for younger people who do not cook, or who do not know how to cook udon. I seriously think you can buy the Kikkoman udon sauce and Shirakiku udon noodle, and cook them at home instead of waiting 2 hours. I expected high quality undon, but not worth for waiting. My kids complained why I brought them here when we could have a better udon from grocery. I even tried udon in Japan and this udon is not really authentic to me."
12/11/2018,20181211,5,4.33,"Aside from the ridiculously long wait to squish inside a tiny restaurant, this place is amazing. A totally different take on udon from what I was used to (and changing my mind about not liking udon), with a thick cream-based soup that makes these fat & slippery noodles somehow a million times better tasting. Been here twice now and I gotta say it's the best udon I've had (I've tried the seafood tomato cream and miso carbonara options, as well as a taste of the sea urchin cream one). Once you're seated, it's not a terribly long wait for the food itself. Street parking is always difficult to find in Little Tokyo unless you're lucky, but there are paid lots all around."
12/12/2018,20181212,4,4.33,"Please note: 1) NO TO GO ORDERS period. This is because the restaurant wants the customers to experience the udon fresh. The staff told me if noodles are boiled/cooked and not served within 20 minutes, they will toss it out. 2) Double portions (aka extra noodles only, no extra soup or toppings) are only available when you place your udon order. They will not accept a ""double portion"" order aka extra noodles once you've received your udon. The reason being, they want people to eat and get out fast. Addition orders to modify existing udon orders will hold up the tables, as I was told. Finally, to keep everything consistent and streamlined, they did away the option to take out rice bowls too. Now for you Earth and animal loving folks, Marugame Monzo has only one vegan option: the Vegeta""ful"" udon ($14.95). Although labeled as vegetarian, the dish is vegan and the udon is made from wheat, without eggs as confirmed by the staff. The creamy mushroom broth is flavorful with dimensions although pretty salty. The udon made in house is fresh and chewy. I enjoyed the stir fry veggies consisting of cabbage, carrots, onion, bean sprouts, woodear, and mushroom that came on top of the soup. The Vegetable Tempura here are Not vegan friendly. The breading batter is made with egg. While I did enjoyed my udon, they could do better with the salt level and portions. After devouring my pricey $15 udon, I feel like I could eat more food. My co-worker also commented that she will be having a second lunch. Between us we spent $36 on lunch and neither of us were full."
12/12/2018,20181212,4,4.33,"I ordered sea urchin udon and kikage. Udon is so rich and creamy. Made right decision not to order lunch set which come w small bowl of rice. Udon alone made me fill. I wish kikage come in slightly bigger p lo ste fir bowl. When take it apart to eat, drop outside small plate and made a mess on table. And it is not hot either. Just warm. Quite a decent amount of shrimp in there.The other customers beside me didn't get the dip sauce for it . They order in lunch set. Would try other udon again if happen to be in area. Small place. Nit good for big group.After 12:30 , place is packed and outside , the line started."
12/12/2018,20181212,5,4.33,We had the best ramen! Mentai squid ramen was incredibly good and will definitely visit again our next trip
12/13/2018,20181213,4,4.33,"Simple things like udon are often difficult to execute well. Marugame Monzo makes really good udon. It's thick, chewy, and served with traditional and non traditional preparations. Personally, I like to keep things simple. My favorite udon dish is cold ume shiso. If I see it, I usually end up ordering it. Marugame Monzo makes a delicious version of this dish. They are generous with the ume and the shaved bonito. The dashi is solid and goes great with the noodles. I like it so much that I often drink some of the remaining dashi. Service here is quick, efficient, and friendly. Our food came out fast and we were out within an hour. I'd recommend visiting before noon to avoid the lunch rush. Parking can be tough since it's J-town. We usually park in a nearby lot since street parking can be tough to find. A great place for a delicious bowl of udon!

Do consider toppings and tempura sides to complement the perfect noodles.+ Okay Portion size (smaller than average with an option to order double portion +$2) but it's enough for the cream heavy signature udon bowls+ Quality of the noodles justify the price and the thousands of Reviews on Yelp can help you decide which udon bowls to try+ Space is Tiny but both counter and table seating available+ Udon is made from scratch and sliced into the perfect thickness which you can watch in action from counter seating & Voilà - the perfect noodles are now ready to cook!+ Wait is usually longer for larger groups and no waiting inside but the X minutes wait time really depends on time of day and day of week + Yolk of the tempura soft-boiled egg is perfection and totally IG story superZoom worthy!
12/15/2018,20181215,5,4.33,"Udon will never be the same again... I had the Sea Urchin Udon and tasted the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon and the Miso Carbonara - all yum! Favorite is the Sea Urchin- not fishy, the broth on all were great, perfect fresh udon. Craving somemore already..."
12/15/2018,20181215,5,4.33,Shrimp tempura udon was delicious! I got there on Saturday morning around 11:00 and waited in line. Service was super fast once we got it.
12/16/2018,20181216,4,4.33,"Getting a table was a breeze on a weekday for some odd reason. Only had to wait for 10 minutes at 6pm. I had one goal only - to try out the renowned uni cream udon. Since the noodle-prep counter was full, I was guided to a little table off to the side and missed out on the whole noodle making process.The uni cream udon was outrageous...ly creamy and smooth! For some reason, the sauce had that hint of smokey bacon flavor, which threw me off a little. While they were generous on piling uni in the bowl, the uni flavor didn't really pull together all that well with the cream base. Udon itself was perfect in texture (silky and bouncy) and well coated with sauce.The assorted tempura was a bit on the greasy side. Excess oil dripping off the individual pieces was somewhat of a sight. Most items came out unusually ""flat"", as if they were intentionally pressed against the fryer's wall to create that flattened affect.Will be returning to try their more traditional udon next time!"
12/16/2018,20181216,5,4.33,"This has to be the best udon I've ever had! Located right next to Daikokuya is another long wait for noodles. But I think it is definitely worth it. I ordered the miso carbonara and it was delicious, the creamy sauce and thick noodles were perfect! I've also had the uni udon which was also a great blend of flavors. The inside is small and can be cramped but it is what you'd expect for most places in little Tokyo. This place really has opened my eyes as far as what udon can be, coming from only having udon in a plain clear broth( which is still pretty good). The waiters have been attentive and helpful with recommendations. All of the food came out promptly and I can't complain about the service here. As for parking you'll have to get lucky and find a spot on the street, or there are a few nearby public lots."
12/16/2018,20181216,5,4.33,"Authentic and handmade Udon. There is a wait, but it is absolutely worth it. Look forward to coming back to this place."
12/17/2018,20181217,5,4.33,"OH MY GOD. SO GOOD. I came here with my bestie for lunch on a weekday and we only waited 5-10 min! I ordered the mentai rice bowl and the hot dragon udon, which was hot udon in paitan soup topped with spicy ground pork, bean sprout, and nira. Both did not disappoint. The mentai rice was so freakin good and oh man, the udon was amazing! The broth was so rich and flavorful, and it had the perfect amount of spiciness to it. Honestly, the broth tasted like crack. I wanted to drink it all. The service was good too and the food came out pretty quickly. I cannot wait to come back here again. My goal is to try all of their udon dishes!"
12/19/2018,20181219,4,4.33,"Udon noodles themselves were good but the uni udon was a tiny portion and ended up being more of a novelty type thing than something I actually enjoyed eating. For $20 post tax n tip, I would've skipped it. I found myself looking longingly at my neighbor's big steaming bowl of beef udon."
12/20/2018,20181220,4,4.33,Does this place serve the dancing squid bowl or know anywhere in the la area that does
12/20/2018,20181220,2,4.33,"2.5 stars. We got in 15 minutes before they close at 230 pm and the waitress was incredibly rude. She handed us menus before we were seated, two minutes later she seats us and asks to take our order but we were not ready and asked for a few more minutes. She rushed us with a glare and stated ""you need to be ready okay?!"" So feeling pressured we chose the beef udon, kakuni udon, and mushroom udon. When the food came the broth and noodles were just warm, not the kind of steaming broth you expect. The highly anticipated ""handmade noodles"" were no better and no chewier than store bought frozen udon. Believe me I know the difference I've had handmade udon in Japan. The broth tasted just like normal tsuyu, the only one with a different flavor was the mushroom one. The beef was soft, the pork belly could be softer. Overall a mediocre dining experience because of a rude waitress, and udon that was nothing special. They are known for their uni udon but I didn't feel like having something that creamy and heavy. Definitely not worth it to go back, though, even for that."
12/21/2018,20181221,4,4.33,"My party of 5 got really lucky. We got to the restaurant around opening and waited for only 10 mins for our table. Sure, it was crowded seating a party of 5 at a table meant for 4, but what do you expect when these restaurants are on the small side?! There's a lunch combo available every weekday. Order a bowl of udon and add a rice bowl for only $3-$4 (typically $6-$8). Score! Portions are pretty big so keep that in mind. I know everyone raves about the uni udon, but it wasn't very good. If I can describe it in its most basic form, it's watered down macaroni and cheese with uni on top. Pass. I would highly recommend the mad tiger (a cold dish) and the hot dragon (has Thai flavors). Both were 5/5 - a consensus shared among my party of 5. I would return for those 2 dishes alone!"
12/22/2018,20181222,5,4.33,"The umami flavor of their udon is amazing. I recommend coming here for lunch and getting the Udon + Rice Bowl special. The pork bowl + duck udon is my favorite combo. If you don't like fatty meat, try the chicken udon. If you like seafood, definitely have the uni udon."
12/23/2018,20181223,5,4.33,"Everytime I come here their food and service blow my mind! Wait time can get really long so make sure to beat the traffic by coming before rush hour aka lunch/dinner/weekend lol. I've tried their carbonara pasta and their famous uni udon and both are to die for. Overall, I would come back and try other udons!"
12/23/2018,20181223,5,4.33,"Freshly, handmade udon! Enough said. Small place and line can get super long but fast and friendly service so you're in to enjoy your bowl of udon in no time. Highly recommended for anyone ever make a trip to Little Tokyo."
12/23/2018,20181223,4,4.33,"This really is a great resturant, except for a couple of flaws you should know before going. The waitress at the front said that the wait was 40 minutes. The wait was longer, about an hour. There is no waiting inside and no food from other places allowed inside and the workers make you know it. There are signs saying it everywhere. The employees are nice, but try to make you leave once you look like you are done. The place is packed usually and it is very busy. Portions are small, but the udon noodles are the best in sight. The Beef Udon and the Duck Udon are delicious and I would recommend them both. The cold noodles are stiffer and the hot noodles are softer and better in my opinion. I recommend this resturant as a go-to place."
12/23/2018,20181223,1,4.33,"Today, I had dinner here with a friend and I WISH we had turned around after hearing it was going to be a one hour wait. I swear. NOT only did I find a piece of glass in my uni udon... but my friend is now throwing up from food poisoning. I'm currently fearing for my life as I ate all her uni. This might just be my terrible luck because a year ago I remember really enjoying the food. Or maybe the quality went down since this spot has blown up out of proportions. Either way, IM TRAUMATIZED FOREVER. I'm writing this review as I await the same fate as my friend. I'm reeeally looking forward to spending the rest of my holidays eating crackers and dying in bed, thanks Marugame!"
12/24/2018,20181224,5,4.33,"Stopped by for some Christmas Eve dinner with the family and stopped by one of the best Japanese udon tempura places...well...in the country really!! This place is outstanding in every way!! Always a wait but beyond worth it!! Their udon can be seen behind the glass that's freshly made throughout the day. Started with beef tataki which was tasty...then pork belly which was really tasty...then for the shrimp tempura udon which was out of this world!! The udon is so smooth and perfectly made...perfect amount of tenderness/chewiness that will satisfy any appetite!! Then the tempura maybe one of the top in the country!! From San Fran to NYC I would put their tempura against anyone!! Their Mongolian udon which is clams over udon soup's flavor was so clean and amazing as well!! Their uni udon was super rich and flavor was heavy but super tasty although it may be too heavy for some!! And finally got their mental cream udon which has a fantastic seafood creamy broth flavor!! Honesty this place is fast, efficient and totally one of the top udon places with the best tempura in the country!! Simply amazing!!!"
12/24/2018,20181224,3,4.33,"We got the beef udon and the seafood tomato udon. I see a very solid udon shop with some creative offerings, but nothing particularly special. Personally, I didn't even strongly prefer the seafood tomato (cream) udon over the beef udon. And I prefer Marukame Udon's (a Japanese chain with branches in Japan and Hawaii) beef udon, too."
12/24/2018,20181224,5,4.33,"Very authentic udon here and an interesting variety they offer here. Takoyaki was pretty good as well. Very quick service, even when they were busy."
12/26/2018,20181226,4,4.33,"We really enjoy this place. For our latest stop, I thought I'd try something different, and ordered the bolognese udon. Not exactly Japanese food, but it was super tasty."
12/27/2018,20181227,5,4.33,"My friends came to visit me in LA and I wanted to take them to get ramen, but came across Marugame and we were very happy that we did!We waited about 40 minutes to get a table, but the wait was well worth it! The service was excellent and our food came out in about 10 minutes! I ordered their special, the sea urchin cream udon, and I was very satisfied! The noodles had a very good texture and the broth was to die for! Even through the price was about $17, the food and the service made the experience well worth it!"
12/29/2018,20181229,4,4.33,"Gotta love a place that hand makes their own noodles! I've never tried hand cut udon before, and loved watching the chef cutting noodles right before everyone's eyes! I'll cut to the chase and review the 3 items I tried: Sea Urchin Udon - 5/5 - the reviews don't lie! Creamy and decadent sauce, very umami! Highly recommend.Curry Udon - 4/5 - I feel like I could've made this, but the flavoring was good regardless. Kyutataki - 2.5/5 - I was pretty disappointed in this dish. Maybe my expectations were kind of high. I grew up eating this during my summers visiting family in Japan. I expected a higher quality/redder meat since it's served so rare.Overall, I'd rate this place 3.5/5, but decided to round up for the review! I'm not sure if I'd wait an hour or more to eat here again. The texture of the udon noodles is almost identical to the Shirakiku Sanuyika udon you can get at Japanese markets, so unless I'm trying to get a creamy udon fix, I would personally think twice before waiting another hour to eat here!"
12/30/2018,20181230,4,4.33,"this place used to be good for me, due to the fact that I was not a married and did not have any kids back then but now that I have a kid the importance of high chair being absent in the restaurant is such a hassle so if you need high chair go somewhere else until your kid behaves in booster seat. food is good, personal favorite is mentaiko ika udon and uni udon(bit more pricy then other ones)."
12/31/2018,20181231,5,4.33,"What.the.heck.I didn't know how great udon could get. I thought I knew good udon. I was wrong. This place always has a line. There's a good reason. We waited for an hour. It was worth it.I love udon. This place is like a Mecca for udon officianados. It was amazing... and one for the record books. I had the creamy mushroom udon and it was creamy, savory and phenomenal - the umami factor was fantastic. I sampled my family's udon offerings, the curry was fantastic, the baked cheese one was not that memorable... the dip sauce option was pretty good...The texture of the udon was just spot on. I watched the process of the noodle making and it just adds to the experience. Don't let the line deter you, like all things in life.. good things are worth the wait!"
12/31/2018,20181231,5,4.33,"4.5Wanna try miso carbonara udon or uni udon? Marugame Monzo is just as high quality as their busy neighbor Daikokuya (ramen). Despite a loong wait (we were here for the holidays) and small portions, the service is fast and the noodles are perfect. I got the hot Sansai Udon for a solid $9.95 before tax. We also tried several other udons and it their Kakiage (shrimp and scallop tempura tower) for $2.95 before tax.Quick Tips:-Jtown has parking. It isn't free but it's parking.-Crowded and cozy inside. 8 bar tops, six 4tops, and one 6top.-They have a bathroom with far too many mirrors haha.. don't abuse this privilege -Their lunch special is the ability to add an extra mini don bowl (rice bowl) w/ your udon.Taste Sansai Udon 4.5/5Didn't want my heart to stop today from creamy udon, so I got a healthy veggie udon! Thick, soft noodles. Plenty of not-overly cooked vegetables: broccolini, green beans, carrots, scallions, tenkasu (tempura batter crumbs), large enoki mushrooms and other winter vegetables. The simple, yet fragrant broth was hot and fresh. My only gripe was that there could have been more noodles.Although I didn't try other udon bowls, I highly recommend this bowl.Tempura Kakiage 4/5A crunchy tower of tempura onions, shrimp, mini scallops and carrots. It was cold and difficult to pull apart, but was a great addition to hot broth udon.Price 4.5/5Quality is worth paying for, but -again- there could have been a lil more noodles.Service 4/5Speedy fast and kind. They use ipads for ordering. Would have been nice to have been checked up on"
1/1/2019,20190101,5,4.33,"I have been in love with Marugame Monzo since I discovered them in Vegas. It was quite upsetting when I heard their Vegas location closed down, but thankfully they also have a location in LA that is thriving. If you have never been to Marugame Monzo, they have the best udon noodles I have ever had in my life. These udon noodles are handmade Sanuki style where the noodles are thick, smooth and in my opinion perfectly chewy. Special ingredients are imported from Japan to make their noodles and broth flavors as authentic as possible. My cousin and I came here around 5pm on a Saturday night and the waitlist was over a page long. Our party of 2 during non peak dinner hours was well over an hour. Worth every minute for this delicious experience. After waiting in the cold, we started off with 2 hot cups of Green Tea ($2.25) which the staff came by to refill from time to time. It was a delicious blend of green tea which we both really enjoyed. As an appetizer, we shared an Assorted Tempura ($6.95) which came with Shrimp, Pumpkin, Mushroom, Shiso leaves and tempura dipping sauce. The batter was very light and crispy and perfectly fried. It was a great way to start off our meal. My cousin loves udon and seafood, so it was quite the struggle for her to decide on what she wanted. Ultimately she decided on the Mentai Squid Butter Udon ($12.95) which has a seasoned fishegg butter sauce with squids and onions. Being a devoted fan of Sea Urchin or Uni, I decided to get the Sea Urchin Udon ($16.95) which had generous chunks of sea urchin in a sea urchin cram sauce and topped with ikura or salmon eggs. My cousin and I both loved our delicious bowls of udon... until I offered to share a bite of my Sea Urchin Udon. She had never had sea urchin in the past, and people usually love it or hate it, so this was an experiment to see if she should get it in the future. My experiment went a little too well because my cousin was unable to return back to her Mentai Squid Butter Udon after my glorioussss Sea Urchin Udon. We decided to to-go her still delicious entree and get her a Sea Urchin Udon to enjoy since we are rarely in LA and I wanted her to be happy with her food too. Even after we got home, my cousin was already texting me about going back to Marugame Udon for more Sea Urchin Udon! I hate driving to LA, paying for parking and waiting around, but Marugame Monzo is worth it for me. I am sure my cousin and I will be back soon."
1/1/2019,20190101,3,4.33,"Saw a long line so was very excited to try this place. Ordered the uni pasta, beef udon, and some tempura. Perhaps it was a bad trio, but everything was way to buttery, creamy, and heavy for our taste. Unfortunately, we couldn't finish the food, it was just too much for our taste."
1/2/2019,20190102,5,4.33,Delicious noodles with too long lines and not super-great parking. Please open other locations!
1/3/2019,20190103,5,4.33,"Holy smokes! Who know Udon from this tiny place could be this amazing. They make their udon noodles from scratch, chewy perfect textures. My friends and I arrived at 915pm and they closed at 10. They couldn't guarantee to seat us since they closed at 10, they split our group up but was able to seat us and take our order before close.I really appreciated the hostess for being so accommodating! One of the reasons why I gave them 5 stars. The uni udon was so creamy but had very good flavor, it didn't taste like the ocean like most places. I got the niku udon (with beef) the broth could have been hotter but it was a sweet broth which I enjoyed. I ordered tempura as well, which was crispy and hot, the tempura was light yellow (which means they change out their oil) which is a plus! the curry udon has very good flavor with a little kick - very tastyIf you love udon, try this spot! It's next to the Ramen spot Incase you have trouble finding it"
1/3/2019,20190103,5,4.33,"I am usually not a fan of udon at all but this place has changed the game. The udon here is unbelievably rich when it comes to flavors. I never imagined that udon could even get this good. The reason is...its handmade.I came here on a Thursday night for dinner and the line was already out the door and down the street. I didn't understand why people would be waiting outside in the cold for over an hour, but it was love at first bite. We ordered the Uni udon and squid ink udon with the toro handrolls as an appetizer and sparkling sake to wash it all down. The toro handrolls were scrumptious and not to mention a bang for your buck. It was only $8 for an equivalent of 5 small handrolls that included seaweed, veggies, a sweet eel-like sauce, a spicy-ish sauce, and of course a big scoop of toro. If you get toro anywhere else, market price is usually around $20.The Uni udon won me over with its rich yet light and creamy broth, the pieces of uni, and the ikura fish eggs. The flavors blended so well together and the fish eggs were a nice complement. Simply amazing was what it was. I tell my friends that I dream about that dish because we don't have it here on east coast. The squid ink udon had a completely different taste. Equally as magical with the soft boiled squid and the exquisite blend of broth and udon noodle. You'll just have to try both of these dishes to believe how amazing it is. They really have perfected the art of udon.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the LA area. It is so worth."
1/4/2019,20190104,4,4.33,"I don't usually like udon, but this place was a game changer. I ordered the creamy uni udon. It was so delicious.Our appetizer of chicken karaage was also good. It came with lime and some curry powder which surprisingly go pretty well together. I would pass on the calamari next time though. Downfall to this place is the wait: get here early! Service and food is pretty fast didn't wait long for anything except the wait."
1/4/2019,20190104,4,4.33,"BEST UDON IN TOWN! Wow. If you're looking for a great slurp and good vibes then this is your place.Your cravings for all things udon will surely be satisfied here. I got the Beef Udon, and it did not disappoint. The flavor of the sweet sukiyaki-like broth, perfect chewiness and smooth texture of the udon, and thinly sliced beef topped with green onions and a soft-boiled egg orchestrated a symphony in my mouth. In my opinion this is an elevated version of the type of bowl you'd get at Marugame Udon. Get bar seating so you can get a front row view of how they make their udon in-house. It's magical.Portions are huge so come hungry, don't forget to add a nice tempura side and Sapporo along with your meal! There's usually a wait and parking can get hard in Little Tokyo, but definitely worth it."
1/6/2019,20190106,3,4.33,"Seeing how popular this place is, I actually feel bad to write this review. My experience was nothing enjoyable. The tables are small and you can literally hear the conversation from the people next to you, I felt part of their party. Service isn't great but they were attentive enough so meh, those kind of places are known for the food so I didn't really mind. The one thing I didn't like was that they didn't let my girlfriend and I share a lunch combo... like why ? Server just said it's house policy. I wasn't especially hungry before but as soon as she said that I lost all appetite. So we had to order a la carte the pork belly rice bowl and the udon gratin. For an a la carte portion, the rice bowl is a freaking joke, smaller than my hands (and I'm a 5'7 Asian guy) that should tell you how small it was ... the udon gratin was so fattening, full of cream, oil, cheese, bland chicken. We didn't like it. But I'll admit, we didn't come here with the right mind and we probably ordered the wrong things. So I'll be back for sure and I'll order whatever they will recommend me. And hopefully I'll be part of the bandwagon praising this place."
1/9/2019,20190109,5,4.33,"I ordered hot beef udon, my sister ordered hot dragon udon. They are both very good. The beef is fresh and very thin. And the portion is perfect! Will come again:)"
1/10/2019,20190110,5,4.33,"Definitely the best udon noodles I have had in the US! The texture of the noodle is perfect! The noodles are handmade from scratch in their restaurant and you can taste the quality. We were fortunate to sit at the front counter where we get to see them make the noodles. It was my first time here, and I got the spicy dragon udon while my husband got the uni. Mine was delicious! The broth wasn't too spicy in my opinion, just the right kick to it. My husband loved his but he said it was a little too heavy afterwards. We also got the assorted tempura to share and that was also a thumbs up. The batter it was cooked in was really good! Service was quick and to the point. I would definitely come back for more and try the other udon. The restaurant is quite small so there was a wait when we went on Sunday night, but they do try their best to get people in and out of there pretty quick. Wish they have one in my area because I would go here all the time!"
1/11/2019,20190111,4,4.33,"I'm not much of an uni person, so I can't say much about the one dish that almost everyone comes here for (Uni Pasta), but based on the single bite that I had from my friend's bowl, it was aiiiight... =P However, I can say that the tomato seafood udon was delicious! Creamy dishes tend to get the best of me at the very end, it's a big toss up between love and hate. I love it as I'm eating it... then I start to hate myself for eating it. My Tomato Seafood Udon was just right. The acid of the tomato flavors help breakdown the creaminess of the sauce, and the udon is perfectly cooked with a chewy texture. There was a generous portion of seafood in it too. YUMMM. That's not to say that I didn't leave the restaurant feeling guilty, I just felt... less guilty.Line is a nightmare, so prepare for a wait if you come during peak hours. Parking is also a nightmare, but with some patience and a few quarters, you'll be able to find somewhere to park within the two to three surrounding blocks. I can't say I'd come back over and over again, but for a place with big hype, I could say that the dish delivered. Worth a shot if you've never been."
1/11/2019,20190111,4,4.33,"My friends introduced us to Marugame and I think it's a great udon shop. It's a bit small inside but we got seated fairly quick. I normally love my noodles in hot broth but I decided to try their cold udon dish. I had the soft boiled egg cold udon (bukakke). They give you sauce on the side to pour onto your udon, comes with tempura batter bits, green onions, bonito flakes, sesame seeds and some grated radish. When you mix everything up and pour the sauce into your dish the tempura bits and grated radish soak up the sauce and stick in to the noodles and it's sooooo goooood! I broke the egg and used the egg yolk to coat my noodles which made it even BETTTTTERRR! Would definitely order again, it's refreshing and light.My bf had the Zaru udon (double portion) which is a cold udon but you dip it into a sauce (similar to tsukemen). It's sort the same as what I had but the noodles are place in a wooden dish and the toppings and sauce are separated. You add the tempura bits, green onion, garlic and radish into the sauce and then proceed to dip the noodle into bowl on sauce and eat from there. I want to say the sauce for dipping is the same as I had but my bf said it's more citrusy. He had actually ordered two Zaru udons with double portion (add 2$). -I have to agree that their portions are definitely smaller than what we're used to. Their double portion didn't really seem like double - which is why my bf ordered twice.My friends had the Uni Udon and the Beef udon - which I didn't try BUT looked and smelled great!"
1/12/2019,20190112,4,4.33,"I learned about Monzo while visiting the original daikokuya which is right next door. Both places usually have big lines but Monzos will make you question whether you have the ability to wait for it lol. I ordered kake udon which is pretty much the most plain flavor they have. I've never had udon before so I wanted to start with basics. It's just a clear soup with green onions and tempura flakes, and of course the fat udon noodles. I turned that into a ""lunch combo"" which is buy any udon at full price get a mini rice bowl for like 3 bucks extra. For the rice bowl I chose the negitoro which has fatty tuna chopped with green onions over white rice.  The udon was pretty good, very not very flavorful since I ordered a clear soup but I was expecting a lot more from it, kind of like when you get a plain ramen, still has a lot going on. The fatty tuna in the rice bowl was also flavorless, didn't taste like toro in any manner. The dish looked great though. I'm giving it 4 stars since the food was a 7.0/10 but I'll have to actually order something that all these people are raving about next time"
1/13/2019,20190113,4,4.33,"Pros: hand made noodles in house, unique udon concoctions (i.e. Miso Carbonara, Mentai Squid Butter, Uni, etc.), and reasonable prices.Cons: long wait times, crowded inside (I was nearly elbow to elbow with a fellow diner, although that was not the case for other people).I love udon, and my typical go-to closer to home is Fukada. So, naturally, I tend to compare other establishments to Fukada as the gold standard. I opted for the Sansai udon. I unfortunately cannot comment on their more famous menu options (such as the Uni) since I do not like uni and prefer a cleaner flavor profile, so naturally did not order it. - Noodles: Although house made, I actually prefer the noodles at Fukada, which are chewier and softer. FUKADA WINS.- Broth: Rich and flavorful, different profile from Fukada's but both delicious! TIE.- Toppings: Marugame Monzo is much more generous with the toppings than Fukada for the Sansai udon, which I appreciated. MARUGAME WINS.Service is efficient and fast. Interior is simple but clean. I also like how you can watch them make the noodles while you eat (especially if you get seated at the bar). Overall, enjoyed my food here. I honestly don't think I would wait for more than 15-20 minutes for the food (especially since I'm happy with having Fukada closer to home), but I recommend a visit."
1/13/2019,20190113,5,4.33,"This is my new favorite udon joint. We came in as a group of 3 and we had to wait for about 40 minutes to be seated. Long wait, but well worth it, because we ended up being seated in front of the window in which we could watch the noodle chef working with the dough in the kitchen. The udon we ordered was no doubt the best udon I have ever had. We ordered the Squid Butter Udon, the cold Bukkake udon, and the hot Kamaage, all of which I would highly recommend. Staff was so attentive and friendly, and our waiter even gave us extra broth for our cold udon (what a plug!) I will definitely come back again."
1/13/2019,20190113,4,4.33,"Great place! A little small, but the food (the seafood udon) is unparalleled! The parking is a a bit troublesome but there is a structure directly in front (one door to the right) which isn't as expensive as normal Los Angeles parking. The servers are knowledgeable to the product which helps when you have someone in the group whom has some allergies or just wants to try something different. Ask if you don't know. And enjoy the great udon with a twist of different flavors exploding your tastebuds into Asian oblivion! :)"
1/14/2019,20190114,1,4.33,"For a restaurant with so many great reviews, I would expect customer service to be at least average, but that was not the case as soon as we walked into this place. Waiting was not a issue, what was a issue is how the host said he did not know how long the wait time would be. I work in the restaurant industry, a estimated wait time is common knowledge for a host/hostess, so it's a little appalling when you go to a place with so many great reviews and a host/hostess is unable to give a estimated wait time to a party. Nonetheless, everything was still fine and we stepped across the street to a cafe and my friend and I came back 10 minutes later to check on our table for 5. This time a lady was in the front and told us they had already called us and we would have to put our name on the wait list AGAIN. I put our name back on the list and 5 minutes later noticed there was a table of 4 available, so I asked her if we were able to sit there and she said yes as long as our entire party is present. I'm more than confused why she didn't say we needed the whole party present to sit or even asked if the entire party was present, when my friend and I were just standing in the restaurant waiting. The rest of our party could have been right outside for all she knew. I told her they were right across the street and she said we can sit right when they all arrive. LITERALLY IT TOOK EXACTLY ONE MINUTE for my other three friends to cross the street and enter the place and this hostess had the audacity to give the table to another party. The guy host came back and asked us to wait outside and I told him the lady said we can sit there if my party are all here, and we are all here, so why is that table given to someone else. He had the audacity to tell us the lady made a mistake telling us that because that table is for party of 3-4, then 10minutes later literally sat us at the same size table as the other one, which was 2 tables put together. However, our server (a female) was very accommodating and was more than perfect in taking care of us throughout the meal. Our party of five got 2 seafood cream , 1 hot dragon, 1 kinoko cream, 1 carbonara, and some extra sides, and everything tasted delicious. After we devoured our udon, we decided to forget about everything that had happened and decided to tip 20%, until the guy server came back to our table to collect the bowls and I accidentally knocked over my tea cup. Tea spilled all over the table, dripping, and our entire party sees the guy go to grab a rag near the the hostess stand then drop it back down and walk to another table. Our jaws literally dropped and stared at him the entire time until he came back to us and asked if we were okay. Excuse you? Are you okay the fact that you saw us accidentally spill an entire cup of tea and you did not provide us any napkins to clean it up and allow the tea to drip from the table and onto our lap? No matter how delicious your food is, no customers will ever come back after experiencing such horrific customer service. I really hope the general manger checks yelp reviews regularly and puts his workers in check because I have never experienced such poor customer service at a place where majority customers writes such highly reviews about the food."
1/14/2019,20190114,1,4.33,"Im going to make this review nice and short. I will say the food tasted great, but if customer service isn't, overall experience will be horrible and that's what my group of friends and I experienced. Im not going to write the details as my friend has already did right below my review if anyone wants to know what happened."
1/14/2019,20190114,5,4.33,Sea urchin cream udon was really good and creamy! Service is pretty fast so my friend and I were able to get our food quickly. Would come back again!
1/14/2019,20190114,2,4.33,"Not sure what the hype is all about...had pretty subpar food. The ramen wasn't really good, my mom and I split the uni ramen, it came in this weird broth that basically tasted like ramen noodles in a cheese sauce. We also got beef carpaccio but the meat was somewhat sinewy and hard to chew. Bummed that this wasn't as great as I was hoping."
1/15/2019,20190115,3,4.33,"If this is the best LA has in udon, then it makes sense that it has such good reviews.Unfortunately, it can't keep up with NYC udon.The noodle profile was definitely solid due to it being made in the store.The cream sauce udon is definitely a weird take. It tastes alright but feels like it's straying from an authentic udon dish.Their broth is pretty basic, kind of plain. Usually I'd expect a more intense flavor profile from a highly rated udon place like this.Definitely worth trying even if you're from NYC, just to have the experience."
1/15/2019,20190115,4,4.33,"My friend and I ordered fried chicken skin for the appetizer and it was a really good amount to share between two people. It was crispy and light -- doesn't have the depth of flavor as the traditional grilled chicken skin but great to start out the meal.My friend thought her curry udon was very good but not as good as the uni udon that I ordered. I would definitely give the uni udon one more try. The noodles were so Q and the sauce was amazing! The salmon roe on the top was a nice touch, would have only been better with more. The reason I didn't give Marugame Monzo five stars is because the uni itself didn't taste super fresh... I didn't get that taste of the ocean I usually do with unni.We waited about 45 minutes to an hour to get in on Sunday night. Service was quick. I thought the price was reasonable (but I'm used to NYC and Boston restaurants)."
1/16/2019,20190116,3,4.32,"Skip. Line is consistently 2+ hours long - the wait is ridiculous & I'm not sure you would call this ""udon."" Was not my cup of tea, but might be yours. The uni udon that everyone raves about is thick, creamy and I could basically be eating pasta. Watching the chefs work & make the noodles was nice. The seating/table system here is so broken. If there are big groups or small tables, etc. no one gets seated until the party in front does - very inefficient. There's also no phone/text system, so you either have to stay close by or be on hold for hours. It's so awkward with everyone crowding outside. Everyone is basically hoping no one else shows up so their name gets called / everyone tries to bump up their place in line. Pricey, barely any service - not even water refills. Oh, and barely any uni in the uni udon either."
1/18/2019,20190118,5,4.32,So so perfect I ever had. Im not int to udon before. This place make me in to it.and Now my husband likes udon too!!!
1/20/2019,20190120,4,4.32,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, and I finally did! I wish they could have a better system to keep track of customers instead of just calling your name. You have to wait outside, and I had to wait over an hour. I'd be better if they could just text you your place in line and tell you when your spot is ready like most places. Uni Udon: A bit pricey, but I mean it's uni so I guess. It was alright I felt like the cream was too much like it could have been lighter and less like a pasta dish. Hot Dragon Udon: My boyfriend really liked it, and I tried some it was pretty good. Tempura Egg: Really good and is perfect to add to any udon dish."
1/21/2019,20190121,5,4.33,"Several people had recommended Marugame Monzo to me, so it easily made it to the top of my list. We went for lunch on a weekday right around rush hour. The wait time was about 30-40 minutes which kind of made me wonder whether it was really worth the wait. They handed us the menu while we were outside so we had plenty of time to look over their dishes. When we were seated, we ordered the sea urchin cream udon and two tempura dishes. The noodles and tempura came out pretty quickly, despite how busy the restaurant was. I'm not the biggest fan of cream udon, however I decided to try it since it was highlighted as such a popular dish. I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed the cream udon! Normally, I find noodles with a cream base to be overly greasy and heavy. However, Monzo's cream udon was savory, yet not overwhelmingly heavy. Paired with the tempura, there was a perfect balance of crispness and creaminess. Even if you don't usually go for cream udon like myself, I really suggest you give this dish a try!"
1/23/2019,20190123,4,4.32,"You don't have to read my review to know this place is good.They have new ideas of eating udon with their creamy uni udon and their potato gratin (and more!).I opted for a more traditional udon, bukkake cold udon. My udon felt refreshing and filling.The special soy sauce you pour over was somewhat sweet and savory. The noodles were perfectly cooked and fresh.After slurping my cold udon, I took a bite of their freshly fried crunchy shrimp tempura and finished with a sip of cold draft Japanese beer.It was a good day.*Note, I stood in line at 11. It's worth waiting 30 minutes earlier as the group that came later had to wait much longer."
1/23/2019,20190123,4,4.32,"Came here on a Saturday night and boy was that line long. My friend and I waited around an hour and 30 minutes. Would I wait again? Maybe if I was really craving it, but probably not since there are other great spots around the area. I had the Mentai Cream Udon w/ a side of shrimp tempura and the takoyaki. My friend ordered the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. He tried my udon and he actually said the mentai was better (but everyone has their own preference)! Anyways the mentai cream was amazing. I was literally so happy eating it haha. I've never had cream udon that was this balanced, but so delicious. It was literally perfect so I highly recommend getting that. The shrimp tempura was nothing crazy, I actually didn't love it because it was a bit too oily, and not as crunchy as I like it. The takoyaki was definitely really good too - perfect little appetizer to start. Overall, I'm a fan of this place. I definitely will be back. Now I just got to figure out how can I come here and avoid the long lines. Will update when I find that sweet spot. :)"
1/23/2019,20190123,4,4.32,"Went for dinner after a Rams and niners game. Yes. It was a really disappointing game. However,this dinner made up for it. We waited for 45 minutes and I would go back but not to wait for 45 min. Maybe 15? Anyways, I tried their famous cream noodle dish and it wasn't bad. It was as if I was eating pasta not a bowl of hot noodle soup."
1/24/2019,20190124,5,4.32,The wait sucks but it's completely worth it!!The uni pasta is what we get every time (from two times I've been here lol). You won't be disappointed ;) I also get so hungry waiting that I order a side bowl of I believe pork + rice with sauce drizzled on top. Everything is flavorful and you will lick your bowl clean. The service is solid and they do their best to keep patrons in and out to make it fun smoothly. I miss this place but just need to plan it out to wait the long line lol
1/24/2019,20190124,5,4.33,"I love that you can watch them prepare the udon noodles. The food is delicious and well portioned. For the amount of people that like to eat here, service is fairly quick too. I usually like to see if there's seating for one on my lunch break because it's faster to get a table that way than if you were to go with a friend."
1/26/2019,20190126,5,4.33,"I dream about the Uni Udon here.... that's how good it is!!! It's definitely PRICEY but it's so worth it. The creamy goodness mixed in with the perfectly chewy udon noodles. Just ridiculously amazing. It's the perfect portion size too so don't go ordering too many addition appetizers or other things. I've also tried their shrimp tempura as well which is not bad! The place gets crowded really fast I so recommend going early.... maybe at around 5pm? If you are ever in the little Tokyo area, this is a must try! Interior: a little cramped but not too bad~"
1/26/2019,20190126,4,4.33,"Their udon is amazing and perfectly chewy! We got the sea urchin creamy udon, seafood tomato udon, and a size mini rice bowl. All were really great, but I would like to try their other non-creamy udon. The ones we ordered felt too heavy. The tomato seafood one has a less fishy scent as compared to the sea urchin one, and a little more salty."
1/26/2019,20190126,5,4.33,So good! And great customer service. The restaurant is a little small through so I wouldn't recommend for a large party.
1/27/2019,20190127,5,4.33,just go and wait to eat there. it's dank af. the sea urchin udon is so good that i jones it weekly
1/28/2019,20190128,4,4.33,"FRESH UDON! You can literally watch them making it in front of your eyes!I tried Marugame Monzo before Marugame udon on sawtelle and it has RUINED me!! I can't eat normal udon anymore. It just cant compare to this place.The fresh udon here is AMAZING. The uni udon is the BEST I've ever had. The ""sauce"" or soup, whatever you'd like to call it is super creamy, rich and packed with uni flavor. And with the fresh udon and the fun big wooden spoon the whole dish is such a treat. You'll want to lick your bowl clean"

1/28/2019,20190128,4,4.33,Love this fresh udon place's mentai cream udon. Would have to say it's my favorite of all the ones I've tried but all are excellent. Glad I gave this place several chances after the first (:
1/28/2019,20190128,5,4.33,"It was worth the wait. Tried the cheese coma udon dish. I didn't feel great afterwards (might've caught the diabetes), but I think it was worth it? You have to try it because of the uniqueness and the service is great."
1/29/2019,20190129,4,4.33,"No reservations. You arrive and name gets put on a waitlist. Lots to look around in the area so wait isnt terrible. Approx 1hr. If you miss your call, they dont check in with a text or anything, but they're accommodating in finding you a table. I found this place for their high ratings on yelp for handmade udon noodles. The noodles were excellent, however their appetizer dish wasnt good at all. We had the beef tataki, overly harsh in spice and texture, nothing to jump for joy about. With a long wait, found the appetizer plate to be a letdown. The noodles however were good."
1/29/2019,20190129,4,4.33,"Quality handmade udon noodles in a small establishment in Little Tokyo. The Uni Noodle is a must try. Creamy and perfectly flavored broth alongside the udon, it melts in your mouth! It was just what I needed on a beautiful rainy day. Be prepared to wait as seating is limited. Not recommended for large parties of over 4. Servers were very kind, but as mentioned it is quite busy and the restaurant is very small. I had servers behind hitting my elbow as they were trying to take orders from the table next to me. If you don't like tight spaces, this is not the place for you. However, if you don't mind it, then you must try! Nothing beats fresh noodles being made right in front of your eyes."
1/30/2019,20190130,5,4.33,"Best Japanese udon noodles ever! Ordered the sea urchin udon, the broth was amazing, flavorful, thick and delicious. The udon was perfectly cooked, with a good bite. Definitely coming back here with some more friends next time."
2/1/2019,20190201,4,4.33,"This restaurant has a great menu with a wide variety of dishes-- from carbonara udon to mushroom udon, it's a guarantee that you will find something that is to your liking. The wait isn't very long during the week but it is during peak hours on the weekend. I did find a produce sticker mixed into my udon bowl which was pretty unsettling. The food was great and the wait staff was extremely attentive and accommodating."
2/2/2019,20190202,5,4.33,"I am still thinking about the udon and it's been over two weeks.We put our name on the waitlist on a Saturday afternoon and it was about a 40 minute wait. They don't take your number so expect you to wait outside and they call your name. The line goes by pretty quickly because I guess noodles doesn't take as long to prepare and eat.I loved the noodle master in the back! We sat at the bar with the window into the kitchen and watched him cut all the udon we were eating. He used a giant rolling pin that is hung on the wall. I never had udon that was THAT fresh and SO chewy before. I ended up coming back home and bought some udon in the fridge section of the grocery store and it really does not compare. If you ever get a chance to come here, you must, to taste what amazing udon is like.The bowl comes out nice and streamy. The chewy and fresh udon comes out in a large bowl. They even offer a $4 add on special with rice and meat which is a must get.... we were so full from our precious meal and regret not getting the add on.We tried the Uni udon but like everybody said it tasted like carbonara. They do give you a generous amount of Uni but it just doesn't taste the same as sushi quality Uni. It was heated up and kinda mushy and crumbly at the same time. Next time I will skip the Uni udon hype and go with their classic udon soups!Also we tried a cold udon with plum with a tint of sour. It was good and refreshing. I see this being a perfect summer treat. My friend who introduced this place to me also said they have the best tempera if you are into that. They looked super crispy and had a nice smooth yellow crisp.If I lived nearby, it would be hard for me not to come everyday... it was that good. The udon here is light yet makes you feel full as if you had a good hardy, healthy meal, especially if you add the $4 rice combo.I want to go back to LA just to come back here!!!"
2/2/2019,20190202,5,4.33,"We were first time in this restaurant, and I was impressed!!! I tried Squid butter udon, which I can say was one of the best foods I've ever tried. Flavor was nicely balanced, noodles were perfectly cooked. Definitely will go back to try something new. Great job!!!"
2/3/2019,20190203,4,4.33,"Their signature menu does not fail, but the tempura udon was not the best. The tempura was crispy and full of shrimp, but cannot say it was the beat broth or udon texture. Furthermore, there is that restaurant smell of uncleaned oil on a wood/humid interior."
2/4/2019,20190204,4,4.33,"I looove thick noodles, so udon noodles are my preferred type of noodle. That combined with all of the hype I've heard from my friends made me really excited to try this place. Between the 2 times that I was here, I ordered:- Sea urchin udon (4/5): This was my first time trying sea urchin, so I didn't really know what to expect. I felt like the small pieces just gave the creamy sauce a seafood flavor. Although it was tasty, it wasn't good enough for me to order again, especially at $17 a bowl.- Curry beef udon (4/5): Just your standard curry beef udon. It is worth mentioning though that the udon noodles itself are perfect. You can tell by the perfectly chewy texture (and by watching them make it in the window) that the noodles are their main focus. However, the dish as a whole isn't something that I crave like I do with other restaurants. Additionally, the portion sizes are kinda small, so you might not leave completely satisfied."
2/5/2019,20190205,5,4.33,"Quick review :I can't add anything that hasn't been said by other yelpers. This place is great, the udon lives up! Worth the wait? Maybe a short one, it's unique but so many great eats in this area. I really loved it though. The sea urchin cream udon was easily the best dish I had during my entire trip to Cali!"
2/5/2019,20190205,5,4.33,I always get the uni udon when I come here and sit at the bar if I can! The noodle master makes fresh udon right in front of you and it's quite the show. If you want to avoid the impossibly long lines I suggest coming 20 min before opening time on the weekdays and line up. It's a small space so seating is limited. The miso carbonara udon is also pretty yummy too but the uni is still my fave. Portion is just right as the sauce can be quite creamy.
2/6/2019,20190206,5,4.33,"This place is one of the top spots for udon. Besides the great taste, what makes it Susan's apart is that they make thier own noodles right before your eyes! It's an art and it helps you truly appreciate the spell that goes into an appartently simple dish. I had the creamy sea urchin udon and a tempura hard boiled egg. Delicious!"
2/7/2019,20190207,4,4.33,Got here just in time before the line got really really long and was fortunate to land the perfect seat right in front of the chef that cuts the noodles. He cut so many noodles! We made awkward eye contact for 3 seconds while I was eating my udon that he had probably cut an hour earlier and it really made my night.
2/8/2019,20190208,4,4.33,"I thought I loved udon then I came here and discovered I really love udon. I've been here twice--the first time I got the Champon, which had a hearty taste and impressive assortment of veggies in it. The flavor was on the blander end, so probably not the ideal pick for those who want a kick, but I tend to like my food blander than mostzThe second time, I got the Miso Carbonara which absolutely BLEW me away. It's like the perfect blend of udon and pasta and the sauce is to die for. I'm usually not a fan of creamier pastas, but this was genuinely delicious. I do wish the portions were bigger though, since it's not cheap!! My friend got the Hot Dragon one and really enjoyed it too. I do want to try their more basic udons, but I'm always so drawn to their signature ones since they're so unique. I'll def be back to try the other ones. The only thing that sucks about coming here is the wait. It can get really long and there's no waiting area so last time I was waiting out in the rain, but that should be a testament to how worth it is. So my advice is to not come on weekend dinners if you're not down to wait :/ But definitely do so on another day!!"
2/10/2019,20190210,3,4.33,"I like this place however this was my second time here and im still somewhat under impressed. The first time I had the sea urchin udon. It was good but lukewarm and more creamy than uni tasting. I've had better uni flavor in other uni pastas at other places This time I had the shrimp tempura udon. The shrimp tempura was my favorite part! It was delicious! Again, my udon soup was just lukewarm! And the extra order of egg was also straight from the refrigerator cold. I tried to warm it in my lukewarm soup but it didnt help much. After about halfway through my bowl, i bit into the egg and the eggwhite and yolk were still cold- kinda gross. Would I come here again? Probably if my friends really wanted to but I would def send back the lukewarm soup next time to warm it up."
2/11/2019,20190211,5,4.33,Hands down one of the best Udon places in Los Angeles been coming here on and off over the years and it has never dipped in quality. Come in if you've got the time to wait around and enjoy a nice bowl of udon. It's also a nice treat to watch one of the workers there make the udon noodles from scratch.
2/11/2019,20190211,1,4.33,"Worst service ever, food is decent but I had a really weird and bad experience with the seating. We came in with a party of 10 but not all our members would be arriving on time, they will not let you sit unless all the party is there. Understandable but if there is open spots (half the restaurant), I would think they would be more accommodating. They would not let our other party members order at all and they would have to register as a separate party. I was very unhappy and I feel that is not worth dealing with this staff for this level of food."
2/13/2019,20190213,4,4.33,"Marugame Monzo is located in Little Tokyo and it has been on my list for a really long time! I finally had the opportunity to try it during lunch hours. Waiting in long lines for food is just not my thing. On a Tuesday afternoon, there was no line and plenty of seating! The menu is broken out into a few sections: Signature Udon (mostly with a cream based sauce), Hot Udon, and Cold Udon. I ordered from the hot udon section which is on the lighter side (no cream or butter sauce). Kitsune Udon* Soup was a clear broth with a little sweetness * Deep fried bean curd pieces were spongy and they absorbed the soup * Noodles were thick and soft but still had a chew * Tempura egg was perfect - soft boiled with a crispy outer The noodles were delicious so I would recommend a double portion (+$2) to compliment the big bowl of soup. If you are dining in for lunch, take advantage of the lunch special - add a mini rice bowl to any udon order for an additional $3 / $4. Lowlights* Tables are really small but the bowls are big so it's a game of Tetris - be sure not to knock over your water glass or the sauces! * Booth seats are worn out so they are not comfortableOverall, it was a solid bowl of noodles! Udon know how delicious fresh noodles are until you have this place for comparison!"
2/14/2019,20190214,4,4.33,"I love Marugame Monzo when I want to eat udon noodles. Their culinary creation of udon noodles is yum. Especially, Mentai Cream Udon and Mentai Squid Butter Udon are my favorite dishes. Inside the restaurant is clean and cozy, and staff members have the knowledge to choose the menu. Also, their serving speed is pretty quick, so you don't need to wait a long time to eat udon. Looks like most of their staff members can speak the Japanese language, so if you are not good at speaking English, you don't need to worry about that. I think they choose a nice menu for you."
2/14/2019,20190214,4,4.32,The portion is kind of small (I had to order a side beef bowl to be full) but the sea urchin cream udon is definitely my favorite udon!!!
2/15/2019,20190215,4,4.32,"We were stoked to try their fresh handmade Udon noodles. We started with Beef Tataki, which was money. As for my main, I got their special Sea Urchin Creamy Udon noodle. It's tasty but a bit too creamy for me. My husband ordered a Mapo Tofu Udon. He said it was fantastic. Food and service was great! The only downside was the song that they were playing. It was too loud, which pretty much disturbed the restaurant ambience."
2/15/2019,20190215,5,4.33,"It was perfect weather for Udon cold and rainy. Stopped by after work I wanted to beat the crowd and my coworker and I were able to get a table as we walked in without having to wait in line. Our first time here, and I was anxious to try their sea urchin udon which didnt dissapoint. But I wished I had a double serving. My dish was cream based and definitely delicious I also noticed there was broth based ones too I will definitely have to return to try one. The place busy, the food came out quick it was great. Loved it cant wait to return"

2/15/2019,20190215,5,4.33,"Adventurous or traditional, this place offers both styles of udon which is really cool. Came here on a rainy mid-afternoon Sunday so it wasn't too busy at all. The place doesn't hold too many people so, like other reviews mention, there would probably be a wait at peak hours. It is really cool how many varieties of udon they offer here, but if you're bad at making decisions, the menu will tear you apart. I ended up going with Seafood Tomato Cream Udon which was essentially a tomato bisque-like sauce with udon, shrimp, and scallops. It was borderline an Italian dish. Very rich in flavor, with noodles slightly thicker than most udon noodles. I enjoyed it very much, but just a heads up that it is very rich. I did get to try the broth of one of their more standard udons. It was solid, but I'm not too complex. Overall, I would recommend this place. There aren't many udon restaurants compared to its more popular brother, ramen, so I would take the opportunity to eat here!"
2/15/2019,20190215,5,4.33,"Monzo is easy to find on Yelp with the great reviews and they definitely deserve it. There will likely be a wait but they are very efficient. For a sit down restaurant they have to pass through more people than almost any other restaurant. They get your order quick, the food comes out quick and the bill comes quick. There are tons of great options and we went with the vegetable udon and the kinoko cream udon so we had some diversity for our first visit. Both were really good and I tried to get every drop of flavor. This was my wife and my best udon experience. The udon is obviously super fresh as it's fun to watch them make it in the kitchen. The cream udon is similar to an Italian pasta dish that you definitely won't be disappointed you ordered. This is a typical 5 star experience with great food, service and a solid price!"

2/16/2019,20190216,5,4.33,All i can sy is that the handmade udon noodles were so good. this place is easily the best udon place in all of LA. thats no exaggeration either.
2/16/2019,20190216,5,4.33,Food is very good. Unique but delicious option for udon. But must spare your time at least 30 mins to wait before sitting in. Will be troublesome for big groups or if you have little kids.

2/17/2019,20190217,4,4.33,"Accidentally stumbled into this gem when we had meant to go to Suehiro up the street! We arrived at 11am on a Sunday and saw a massive line and instinctively got in it without checking where it actually led. The restaurant opens at 1130, and we were the second to last group to make the cut off, if that gives any idea of when to start lining up! I ordered the beef bukkake udon (udon served cold with chilled broth that comes on the side) and my bf got the hot dragon udon (spicy pork broth) and a negitoro bowl. All 3 were fantastic!! The cold udon was super refreshing even on a cold day, although next time I'd either hold off on adding the broth till the beef cools down or try not to mix in the beef, since it warms up the whole dish so it's almost lukewarm. The broth in the hot dragon udon was perfectly spicy with wonderful aromatic flavor. Per bf, negitoro bowl had a well balanced rice to fish to mayo ratio. The turnover is actually pretty fast, so don't despair if you don't make the first seating! We got our food in about 5 min and finished eating in less than 10-15 min! I want to come back and try the uni cream udon that I believe Monzo is most famous for - it looked incredibly rich and decadent, which my hungover body wasn't ready to handle today, but won't make that mistake next time! ;)"
2/18/2019,20190218,5,4.33,"One of my favorite things to eat is Udon. This place has amazginggggg fresh hand-pulled udon. In fact, you're able to see them make it right in front of you!! I'm not a big fan of uni, but I get the uni pasta just for the creamy sauce. It's truly heavenly!!"

2/19/2019,20190219,5,4.33,"In a town that's now over saturated by ramen spots (not a bad thing at all, mind you) it's great to see a Japanese udon noodle shop with the quality and authenticity as Monzo.Come here on a weekend for lunch and you'll see a line going down 1st street, especially if you're trying to get a first seating. Come during the week at 5 and it's fairly empty but by the time you're done eating at 6, it's once again packed with a line queued up for a table. Their udon menu has a lot of options. We got the classic beef udon in clear broth. There are many tasty looking cream soup udons but unfortunately that's not in my eating regimen at the moment so I got the always classic beef udon. Good size bowl, nice chewy typically hearty udon noodles and the beef was good. Soup maybe a tad under flavored compared to what I've had elsewhere but as I mentioned there are many other thicker and more flavorful soups to choose from. For me tho the real star was the bolognese udon which is basically their take on a spaghetti bolognese. Hearty sauce, not too salty with a gentle flavor that has beef Ragu with some chopped mushrooms and eggplant (?), but the bits are nice and small so you don't get that overpowering chunky vegetable taste which isn't my favorite texture nor flavoring. Big bowl that you'll want to scoop out the remaining sauce with the large wooden ladle spoon they provide. Excellent dish and I hope it stays on the menu as it's a ""special item"" for time being. Also of note is their braised pork belly appetizer which is 7 large chunks of braised pork belly in a mellow shoyu based soup. Very hearty and very filling, it's a much larger appetizer dish than I expected but every bite was sumptuous. Big chunks of pork tenderly cooked in a great tasting broth. Oh yea def a fan of this restaurant.I also tried the gratin udon, with chicken. It's very cheesy, which is good, but I did feel the cream sauce was a little thin and needed more flavor. It was good, but I think I prefer the regular bowl of udon soup or the bolognese. Worth a try tho if you're exploring the menu.If you come early when they first open, and are standing in line near the entrance, you can see the guy making the udon from scratch, rolling the flour, and cutting it into noodles. pretty cool!"
2/19/2019,20190219,4,4.33,"Yummy! This place was delicious. The only con I would have to say is the wait.Service: Service was extremely fast and efficient, they seemed very organized considering it's always packed.Food: We had the calamari as an appetizer. It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I had the hot dragon udon. It stated that it was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't that spicy. It was very flavorful and delicious though! I definitely enjoyed it. Also, it was very fulfilling as well. My boyfriend ordered the miso carbonara udon. That was also very delicious! The sauce was definitely creamy. I was surprised of how good it was!Definitely worth the wait!"
2/19/2019,20190219,3,4.33,What's great about this place is the food is fresh! The noodles are made freshly in front of you! Lots of variety of udon choices!! Word to the wise get here when they open as they filled up. Don't order the edamame as the price is too high for the portion. And the reason I couldn't give this place more stars is that the restaurant smells like sewerage from time to time. What a pity as the food is really good if you like udon!!!

2/20/2019,20190220,5,4.33,We came here on a Sunday and luckily found parking on the streets. Street parking is free on Sunday! We came around 12 PM and only waited about 30 minutes for a table for 2. We decided on the Carbonara and Creamy Tomato udon. The Carbonara had bacon in it and was really really creamy. It was really good for the first couple of bites but I think it was a little bit too much for one person to handle during lunch. So we switched udon bowls - so I was able to try the creamy tomato was well. I really enjoyed the creamy tomato - imagine like you're eating a tomato bisque with added bay scallops and shrimp. The udon was super fresh and delicious in the creamy tomato. I would definitely get it again!Come early!!!!!!
2/20/2019,20190220,5,4.33,"Sea Urchin Cream Udon all the way! I've tried different udons here but nothing compares to Sea Urchin Cream Udon. I'm typically not a udon person since I always prefer ramen and I never think udon taste that good but Marugame Monzo changed my mind! I definitely recommended! On the side note, this is located in Little Tokyo, the restaurant isn't that big and it's packed pretty much all the time so expect long wait when you go!"
2/20/2019,20190220,5,4.33,Favorite ramen place. I come here atleast once or twice a month! Kind of small restaurant and weekends may have a wait but their food makes up for everything.
2/22/2019,20190222,4,4.33,"+ a m b i e n c eReally nice cozy and small place. We went on a Thursday afternoon to get lunch, and only waited 10 minutes. Wasn't really crowded. Loved how we can see the chef stretch the udon noodles. Really awesome!+ f o o dI had the carbonara udon with the pork minidon as a set menu. Carbonara udon was great - loved the firmness of the udon noodle, the bacon strips were really tender, but the carbonara sauce was a bit diluted for me - it felt somewhat watery.The pork minidon (ricebowl with pork) was good - think slices of juicy pork, but that was about it.Nevertheless, really good overall! The first time I had the tiger udon, and that was amazing. Marugame monzo is a must try for it's well known fusion udon dishes.+ t i p sAs always, get here in non-peak hours! You'll save a lot of wait time. Also, try their exotic fusion udon dishes - I will definitely try when I come back."
2/23/2019,20190223,4,4.33,"[SERVICE] Super busy and small restaurant so there is inevitably going to be a wait so come prepared! I would not suggest bringing large parties here because it would be hard for them to accommodate you guys. Overall, pretty good service, our server seemed a bit annoyed when I was asking a single question about the menu but it didn't ruin my experience.[PARKING] Street parking or parking lot is the way to go. Those are probably your only two options when it comes to parking in this area or around Little Tokyo.[FOOD] Came here specifically for the sea urchin udon that is supposed to be extremely popular. I was a bit underwhelmed when I tried it and I think it was a bit more hyped up than what I was expecting. However, the quality and texture of the udon itself is really what impressed me! It's pretty hard to find places that make their own udon and to even be able to watch them make it in front of you was part of the experience that I enjoyed.[AESTHETIC] Small restaurant but all the dishes themselves are pretty picture worthy!"
2/24/2019,20190224,5,4.33,"YUMMMLoved my creamy udon. Portions are pretty large and filling. Got to sit in front of the noodle chef maker.. that was fun to watch. Super fresh noodles, perfect texture, definitely will be coming back again!"
2/24/2019,20190224,5,4.33,"Long wait but so WORTH it. They don't take reservations, it's first come first serve. Old school check-in on a clipboard and you wait outside. Just go that's all I got on this! Everything we had, we devoured - crispy chicken skin, eggplant, calamari appetizers were on point. And then the Udon.... please see pic below! Enjoy!"
2/24/2019,20190224,5,4.33,"Not really an udon person but I've had enough of it to be able to tell this place is quality. Pretty fast service and prep time. Wait times can get crazy, but they do a good job cranking out tables. Not much vegetarian options but they do it well enough that I won't complain. Their signature stuff is really what shines. Good ""twists"" on a classic, but nothing tacky, only tasteful. In the overall dish and taste! If the popular ramen joint next door is too packed, this is the spot for you. Very worthy neighbor in my opinion"
2/25/2019,20190225,5,4.33,"Best Udon EVER! You'll be telling your Udon to ""get in your belly"". My favorite is the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon, it tastes like Cream of Tomato... creamy deliciousness!"
2/27/2019,20190227,5,4.33,"Great concept! My friend and fellow Yelper Ruby L. and I were craving carbs after roaming around Little Tokyo, and Ruby suggested this place. There was already a line by the time we got here (around 5), so we signed our names on the sheet and were told to wait for 30 or so minutes. We were seated after around 25 minutes, and we ordered the Beef Tataki, Miso Carbonara Udon, and Uni Cream Udon.Beef Tataki- Seared rare beef thinly sliced, topped with pickled radishes, oil, and peppercorn. While tender, it definitely was not melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I felt that this could have been vastly improved with a sprinkle of sea salt, as I felt that all I could taste was rare beef. Additionally, I felt that there was too much oil, which coated my mouth in an unappetizing way. Good, but could be improved. 7/10Miso Carbonara Udon- Chewy, delicious, freshly-made udon enveloped in a thick, creamy sauce flavored with slight nuances of bacon and miso, topped with bacon pieces. I saw a lot of reviews about how it's very rich and filling, but I found that I was still hungry after eating this, but maybe I just eat a lot LOL. 10/10Uni Cream Udon- Fresh udon covered in a creamy, sweet uni sauce, topped with pieces of fresh uni. This is similar to the Miso Carbonara Udon, but the sauce is much more delicate, and it has a sweetness that the Carbonara does not have. 10/10I recommend everyone come try the unique selection of dishes served at Marugame Monzo!"
2/27/2019,20190227,4,4.33,"Delicious!!! Everything on their menu is amazing, and it's a good sized menu as well. Only downside is the wait time (never less than 25 minutes) because the restaurant only serves a few groups at a time. So, everyone is just waiting outside on the sidewalk, but the service is good and the food is worth the wait."
3/2/2019,20190302,4,4.33,Came back again and it's improved greatly. The food is always really good and my favorite thing to get is the creamy udons. I usually get a seafood mixed one but definitely would recommend coming here the servers are very helpful.
3/2/2019,20190302,5,4.33,"Food is delish , prices are reasonable, service is great! The udon noodles are on point! Our second time back here and even though it's an hour drive for us to get here it's worth it!!"
3/4/2019,20190304,5,4.33,"This place make fresh, chewing, smooth and awesomeness UDON! I love their uniqueness to showcase the versatility of udon dishes; from super creamy to straight up simple dishes, hot or cold. Strongly recommend to go off peak hour and small group, no more than 4."
3/4/2019,20190304,5,4.33,"Udon is the name of the game at this inexpensive and trendy Little Tokyo Japanese, where the noodles are made by hand, then cooked and flavored all sorts of ways (sea urchin cream sauce, carbonara).f you care to step up from ramen to udon, slip into this special udon emporium, where the noodles are made fresh in the open kitchen. Appetizers include tempura-fried chicken skin and raw."
3/5/2019,20190305,5,4.33,"My two friends and I decided to come here for dinner. They both had been to the location that was in Torrance so wanted to try this place. It was Tuesday, on a rainy day, so we didn't think there would be a wait. When we got there ther were 6 parties in front of us, but luckily it went by quick and we only wait about 10-15 minutes. The place is pretty small, but seems like people are in and out quick so the wait goes by fast. All of the options on the menu looked and sounded amazing, but ultimately went with the Miso Carbonara Udon. Let me tell you that if you're not a big fan of creamy foods then you won't like this dish, but man I loved it! It explodes with flavor in your mouth. The egg and bacon compliment the creaminess of the carbonara sauce. My other friend got the same thing and we both agreed that it was delicious. For 3 people with tax and tip it came out to $17.50. It was a great portion and all three of us were stuffed considering we were starving."
3/5/2019,20190305,5,4.33,Love this place. It is a bit small and the wait line can get ridiculous. But the food is Delicious!!! Worth the wait!
3/6/2019,20190306,5,4.33,"This place is worth the wait!!! It's a small place so a wait is inevitable, but their food is AAAAAmazing. Worth every minute of waiting and every penny.I would highly recommend the uni udon. It's so creamy and has a very rich flavor. My boyfriend got a beef udon (one with broth) and the moment he tried my uni, he regretted not getting mine. And every time he tried my uni udon, he kept saying, ""I should've gotten yours.""We got there during lunchtime so we did the lunch combo deal with the bowls. We got the pork belly bowls and they were good but not great. If I go back, I'd get a different bowl. I would recommend getting a bowl even without the combo deal during lunchtime because for some, just the bowl of udon might not fill you up.Parking: street parking. We parked at the Little Tokyo lot across the street and paid $10, but I saw that there was street parking"
3/7/2019,20190307,5,4.33,"It looks like there's a lot of Wayting, so I've waited and tried it. It's delicious. It's taken a little while, but the noodles are chubby and delicious."
3/8/2019,20190308,5,4.33,"This is my boyfriend's favorite udon place in LA! We went on a rainy weekday so there was no wait, but according to my boyfriend there is usually a long line because it's so popular. We both ordered from their signature udon menu; we got the miso carbonara and the mentai squid butter. The udon noodles in both dishes were super fresh and had a very nice chew to it. If you're looking for a pasta-type dish, I would recommend the carbonara. Otherwise, I would definitely get the mentai squid butter udon. The sweetness from the onions complemented the savory butter broth very well and had a different taste that you can't really get anywhere else. Highly recommend going here if you're craving udon!"
3/8/2019,20190308,5,4.33,"Handmade noodles made on the premises. Its fun to watch them make the noodles, but its more fun to eat them. Ok so my doctor tells me I'm too sweet so once in a while I will cheat and this is the place worth cheating for. The little rice dish with the toro tuna is to die for. I literally finish it so fast, I could swear someone else ate it. If the bowl was bigger, I'd eat it just as fast. OH man, my mouth is already watering from writing about it. I think its gonna be a Marugame Monzo day today. There is always a line so get there early. You can get some boba while you're waiting in line from the stores next door. For vegetarians, they also have a vegetarian option so its good for everyone."
3/8/2019,20190308,3,4.33,"We waited for 45 mins and had such high expectations given the Yelp reviews. But, we didn't like the noodles here, not for us...going back to ramen joints!"
3/8/2019,20190308,5,4.33,"Delicious, literally top 5 best restaurants I've been too. I ordered the pork belly braids and Bolognese udon"
3/8/2019,20190308,4,4.33,Good rice and noodles. Chicken has a weird taste and was soggy. reasonably priced and very busy.
3/9/2019,20190309,4,4.33,"I came on a weekday and waited around 10 minutes for a seat. When you walk in, you can see the open kitchen and the noodle masters at work. This automatically gives them all the points since seeing noodles being made in a place that advertises handmade noodles is v important. My friend and I both got the Uni Udon ($17) and felt the exact same way about it. The sauce itself is pretty tasty and creamy, but it just felt like we were eating any other generic seafood pasta. The uni flavor kind of gets lost in the cream. And although they are very generous with the amount of uni you get, the uni itself doesn't seem super fresh. In fact, it was for some reason hard?I gave them 4 stars because it was still a tasty meal, just not what I expected. I'll be back for their yummy udon noodles, but I'll definitely be trying something else."
3/10/2019,20190310,2,4.33,"2 stars only for their udon which wasn't anything extraordinary that needs an hour of waiting. We went at 5:40 and out our name on the list. They said it'll be about at least an hour wait. It was freezing cold so we went across the street to get tea at miyako hotel's coffee shop. The rest of my friends came in at 6:25 and went there and they said we already gave your place to someone else cause you weren't here. Mind you we called before to check and no one picked up the one. Anyways after another 15 mins we got seated. Food wasn't anything special at all. Service sucked. We were not even half way done and the came and asked if they can take the plates and we said no. They came literally 2 mins after and we said just take it. They brought the check immoderately and wait there for us to give them the car, it was one card so it was easy. He went and came back and when he saw us still sitting, the big head guy with a triangular head, told us with his broken English and with his hands to keep moving since other customers are waiting. I was shocked, no more of this place for us EVER."
3/11/2019,20190311,5,4.33,"The best udon in town!I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and it was delicious. I even drank the soup. I thought the portion size was perfect, but I have a small stomach and don't tend to finish a whole bowl. My friend complained that it was small even though he ordered a double portion. I came around 7pm on a Thursday and there were no lines. This is located in Little Tokyo, so expect parking to be difficult. Street parking and parking lots."
3/12/2019,20190312,5,4.33,"My new favorite place!! Came here for another birthday dinner. Must be prepared to wait. Be patient. The food is soo delish it's worth it. Tempuras are great tasting. Udon with cream was soooo good. Chicken skin was the bomb!! A must order! The regular udon was also good. Beef tatami was delish! The cold tofu dish was good as well. And chopped tuna on rice was pretty good as well. Overall everything we ate was super duper delish. I will definitely come back for more chicken skin, udon and tempura!! Trust!!!"
3/14/2019,20190314,5,4.33,"This Cream Udon is very rich and fulfilling. Bits and pieces of Ikura and uni in carbonara sauce. It is worth the wait (super long line outside). It is a popular restaurant beside another popular restaurant. So we suggest that you put down your names on both and whoever calls you first.... I'd say go for it. Unless your heart truly desires for udon. Crispy Chicken skin is only served at dinner time. Otherwise, any appetizers are just as good."
3/15/2019,20190315,5,4.33,"handmade udon, so good. if you have the opportunity to eat here, say yes. it's right next to boteaga. store sign is kind of hidden."
3/15/2019,20190315,3,4.33,"Food is so so. Not as good as i expected. I ordered the signature uni udon and the uni is over cooked and not tasty at all. I also had the sake steamed mussel. Which the soup was good, but mussels too small. Overall this restaurant is ok, but a bit overpriced for its quality."
3/16/2019,20190316,5,4.33,The uni udon is everything! I don't mind the wait time at all. Kudos to the staff for great service and delicious food.
3/16/2019,20190316,5,4.33,Arrive early!!!! This place is a must if you're in Little Tokyo and looking for good Udon!! (NOT RAMEN) Everything on the menu is delicious and beyond filling. Customer service is very top notch and worth every penny. As stated arrive early because this place gets verrrry crowded. It is located in the heart of little tokyo right next to one of my favorite locations Daikokuya! Enjoy!!!
3/16/2019,20190316,3,4.33,"We had high standards coming here...possibly falsely high as we had jut returned from three weeks in Japan. But still, the experience was underwhelming. The noodles weren't striking and the broth was just pretty good. Not a bad option for ramen, but we personally feel that it's overhyped based on its current Yelp rating."
3/18/2019,20190318,3,4.33,"I've never been an udon enthusiast, but I was reallyyy hoping that the Sea Urchin Cream Udon from here would be a game changer. Their silky fresh udon is handmade in-house and if you sit at the bar you'll have a front seat view of the neat udon making process. While undoubtedly full of quality ingredients, our bowls just didn't excite us. However, with all its glowing reviews, the bowls obviouslyexcite the vast majority, so you'll likely adore the food from here. To us, the broth was much too thick, creamy, and even slightly bland. The sea urchin flavor was barely distinguishable. Maybe we should have tried the Miso Carbonara Udon instead...I give this place major kudos for its freshly made udon though."
3/18/2019,20190318,5,4.33,The uni udon here is sooooo good. Worth the wait and super creamy. Will totally knock you on your ass and you know those calories are going straight to your hips! Hand made udon noodles really take the cake in this dish. My only complaint is I wish there was more in the bowl. My friend literally licked all the sauce in her bowl and we were ALMOST tempted to order another for each of us.
3/18/2019,20190318,5,4.33,Hands down best udon joint I've ever had. The wait can be annoying sometimes but I find it best to go when they first open before the lunch and dinner rush begins. Parking can be a hassle in LA but if you get lucky there's always meter parking or you'll have to pay for parking. I've been here a couple of times and I've tried their Uni Udon that everyone raves about and their Mentai Udon. Love that their udon is made fresh and in front of you. The uni udon is amazing! The texture is creamy and rich. Can't go wrong with this dish unless you're not a big fan of uni but even then I still think you should give it a shot. The mentai udon was delicious too. The broth was amazing and flavorful. Side note I like to add the soft boiled egg as well to pair with any udon dishes. The service is great. They're really tentative and nice. Will be coming back to try different dishes.
3/18/2019,20190318,4,4.33,"My friend have been raving about this place for some time, and everytime I eat at Daikokuya next door I see there's a line for Marugame as well. I don't eat udon too often, and don't really prefer it since their slippery noodle texture makes it hard to eat sometimes. BUT this place is legit tasty!! My friends surprised me by celebrating my birthday here, and the four of us were seated fairly quickly! My friends ordered the Hot Dragon, Carbonara, and Mentai squid which I followed suit since I love squid in general. I also added a soft boiled egg, while my other friend got the tempura soft boiled egg. Both were yolky, so kudos for making proper soft boiled eggs! Broth was creamy and delicious, thanks to the little fish eggs. I think the portion and level of decadence was well balanced for my taste buds! Will come back here again."
3/18/2019,20190318,5,4.33,"I've come here one too many times to not leave a review!I've tried this place years ago, and even until now, the quality has always been consistent, amazing handcrafted udon. I love the mouth feel and bounciness of the udon. It's cooked to perfection and drizzled with the right amount of sauce. And of course, the flavors of each speciality udon has always been delightful.I generally go for the uni, but decided on the carbonara bacon today. It was incredibly scrumptious! I had every last bit of it -- the only downside is that the portions aren't that grand. I'd recommend ordering an appetizer as well on the side if you want to be filled up. Service is always impeccable. Additionally, it's located in a great area in which you can sightsee, hunt down for some Japanese sweets, and more."
3/18/2019,20190318,5,4.33,"Have been wanting to go to this place for a long time but worried that it would be busy after reading some reviews about lines. I had just happened to be in the area and never thought I would have another chance so I went and there was no line. The space is kind of on the small side but it's a good environment. The staff was very friendly and there was a great selection of items to choose from on the menu. I originally was going to order the uni udon but found the duck udon. I love hot udon and I love duck so this was a great combination for me. The food came out fast and so did our appetizers. The broth was refreshing and still had a great bold flavor without being overly salty. The noodles were very chewy and were cooked very well. I enjoyed seeing them hand make the noodles as well. The service was overall very quick since they wanted to move customers out so they could shorten the line. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing it was a in and out situation, but at least the food was really good. Will stop by again if I'm ever in LA."
3/19/2019,20190319,5,4.33,"This place is so bomb - worth the wait. If you're into creamy, flavorful udon, you should definitely check this place out. I haven't tried any of the non creamy noods but I'm sure of their quality is just as good as the cream based noods, it's probably worth a try. Been here three for the urchin noods and have not been disappointed."
3/20/2019,20190320,5,4.33,"After reading reviews and mouthwatering photos, I had to give this place a try. You see, I normally do not like Udon. Just something about it that I'd prefer ramen or other type of noodles over udon. I figure, if I don't like it, I would just be out $15 dollar at the most. Besides, I am a sucker for fresh, handmade noodles. However, Marugame, you did not disappoint. Miso Carbonara Udon $12.50. A very flavorful, creamy udon that just hit the spot on a chilly, windy night. This dish have sprinkles of bacon, so if you are a meat lover, you probably will need to order additional sides to complete your carnivorous cravings. The place is cute. Good for date night, however, please beware of the line. The wait can be long, depending on your party size. (We got lucky, a table for two was pretty much easy peasy on a Thursday). Customer service was on point, we were checked up on and waters were refilled without being asked. I would like to try the other udon/menu items next time I am in the area. I will be back!"
3/20/2019,20190320,2,4.33,Food was just average. Order sea urchin udon it's their house special. The waiter was rude and impatient. They can't wait to close for their lunch break. Refused to do separate bills. Do not recommend here. You can just go to the next door 'Daikokuya' noodle is much better there.
3/20/2019,20190320,5,4.33,"we ordered urchin udon and udon gratinmy the gratin is super rich in cheeseif you were cheese lover, try this! You will not be disappointed"
3/20/2019,20190320,1,4.33,I would rather give 0 than 1 star to the waiter here. My friends and i ordered different udons and we wanna pay separately but they can't do that. Which is unbelievable. And they just rush u to finish.
3/21/2019,20190321,5,4.33,"When you arrive, put down your name and the number in your party on the sheet of paper that's in the front inside the restaurant. They will call your name as they go down the list. They will only sit complete parties. If you do miss your name being called, let them know and they will seat you next, as long as they have room. We made the mistake of waiting behind others the first time we went and didn't know their policy. It's first come, first serve based on the names written down. If there is a very long line and it's Thursday night, write your name down and quickly head over to MOCA in Little Tokyo, which is only a couple of blocks away and quickly see their exhibitions since it's free night. You can also visit the Japanese American Museum on Thursdays too - since it's free on Thursdays. We've done this once and it made the wait bearable. Once inside, see if it's possible to snare a seat by the kitchen. You'll be able to watch them make fresh udon. It's incredibly fun and interesting process. We once saw them train a new staff member to make udon and it was very educational in how specific the thickness and cut of the udon needs to be inorder to be served. We tend to order the traditional udon noodles such as kitsune udon or kake udon. My daughter loves the duck udon - although it is hit or miss when it comes to getting tender duck pieces or tough ones. The broth is always delicious and perfectly compliments the udon noodles. The service is quick and efficient and before you know it, you're out the door to enjoy more of Little Tokyo. Marugame is not a place to linger at since there are always many waiting to be fed.Very limited street parking - we did snag a spot on a Sunday. There is also lot parking nearby."
3/22/2019,20190322,4,4.33,"Udon is one of those foods that I can eat all day every day! With the lack of authentic udon places in Boston, it's a must for me when I find an udon restaurant while traveling. Marugame does hit the spot with some dishes but I thought a few of their other dishes were too Americanized. Some people may like the more Americanized flavors of udon, but I personally prefer more authentic Japanese flavors. I actually came here twice in my 3 day trip to LA simply because I love udon and wanted to try multiple dishes this restaurant offers! My favorite was the mentai squid udon. It was a perfect balance of flavor and you really do taste the squid. I also tried the curry udon and cold udon. I recommend both of those as well. Now for ones that I don't quite recommend if you want an actual Japanese dish are the miso carbonara and seafood tomato cream. There wasn't anything wrong with these dishes and the flavor was fine, but like I said before...it tastes like American pasta. The miso carbonara tastes exactly like Italian carbonara pasta except with udon. The tomato cream tastes like red pasta sauce. These dishes are basically what you might get at an Italian restaurant except with Japanese noodles. With that being said, I still do highly recommend the restaurant and hope to be back in LA one day to visit again!"
3/24/2019,20190324,3,4.33,"I ordered the uni udon (mainly because of the hype) and regretted it. My boyfriend ordered the mapo tofu udon and enjoyed it, and his was definitely better than mine but nothing amazing. We actually loved the calamari, which had a nice crispy outer layer and was piping hot, going perfectly with the mayo sauce. The rice bowls that come with the lunch special (we got pork belly and beef) were really tasty as well. I was really bummed because of the hype for the uni udon, which was okay enough for me to finish it, but by the end I was kind of forcing myself to scoop little uni bits out of the creamy sauce because in my mind uni=$$. Uni and creamy white sauce do not go together at all, in my opinion, because uni is already creamy and thick by itself. The noodles were a nice texture and you can see the employees making it behind a glass panel which was a nice touch. I added sour plum on the side which I love, and made getting through the meal more bearable. The mapo tofu was decent, but it was literally just mapo tofu with udon thrown in, kind of gimmicky. Maybe if we had tried some other menu items we would've enjoyed ourselves more, but this place was disappointing because the main dishes did not even come close to trumping the side dishes."
3/24/2019,20190324,5,4.33,This place is all the hype!Their beef udon noodles were so good; the udon noddles were soft yet al dente and just right! The beef was ridiculously tender and tasty! The soup broth was so good ...not too salty and just the right flavor. I don't know how one person can finish one bowl; it's so big!Their jumbo shrimp tempura was so crispy and good and their negiritoro don was so yummy; it definitely had an umami taste!
3/24/2019,20190324,5,4.33,"The best udon place! They handmade their own udon, very chewy and tender. The uni udon is to die for, creamy and satisfying. Best time to go would be the odd hours otherwise be ready to wait for a while to be called in, but worth giving it a try."
3/26/2019,20190326,3,4.33,"More of like a 3.5 star, and disclaimer I just came back from Japan so maybe I'm a little biased but I still had my opinions about this place.I've had this place bookmarked for about 7 years and I never got to try it because every time it was either closed or the line was way too long. Finally one day on a Sunday we decided to go and there was 8 parties ahead of us but they were all either not all there or whatever so we got the seat in about 10 mins, luckily. Parking can be tough too so that's a thing about this place as well.We ordered the uni udon and the shrimp tempura udon and added a negitoro don. The uni udon was good, but not exactly the richness that I was looking for and the uni was all chewy rather than the kind of uni prepared to melt in your mouth. I think the uni was like cooked or something which made it rather tasteless and I did not want to eat any of it sadly. The shrimp tempura udon was also tasteless and lacking in flavor, which was upsetting bc of how simple the dish is! The best part of the meal was the negitoro don, I really enjoyed that. The prices were pretty steep for what it was too, you don't get much noodles. It was kind of disappointing but I would want to try it again just in case I just got unlucky. Service was decent."
3/27/2019,20190327,5,4.33,"Bf and I went here the last time we went to Japan town. The wait was surprisingly not long in comparison to other restaurants in the area. Once you get there, make sure to write your name down on the waitlist. Maybe bring a jacket if it's cold because you have to wait outside. Once inside, the table set up is pretty tight so don't expect any privacy. It's also pretty loud in there. It's kind of cool that you can look into the kitchen.The servers were very friendly and took our orders quickly. We didn't wait long to get our food. We got: Curry Udon - I love Curry and Udon so why not mix them together?! It's actually really good together and the flavor is great. There's a little bit of a kick that builds up as you eat it. Miso Carbonara Udon - Bf got this one. It taste exactly as it's stated. I really liked it and the flavor of the sauce was just right. We ended up finishing both bowls! Definitely try it out if you're in the area."
3/27/2019,20190327,2,4.33,"Hmmmmm... I was blown away by the uni udon in the past... I'm not sure if my memory is failing me but I swear they used to give more sauce / broth. This time, it wasn't even enough to submerge the ladle they give you. It seems like what I got was pretty standard... Uni that isn't fresh and is cooked... so it's hard. but they give you plenty of it so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Would you rather eat more of crappy stuff or less but good? probably the latter right? Eh. My friend wasn't satisfied with the veggie udon either. Not sure why there's so many good reviews on that. Nothing was particularly good nor was it worth the $40+ that we paid. To top it off, I was still hungry. Oh, their tempura chicken for $1.5 for a small chicken breast isn't a terrible deal. It was some pretty good tempura.At least the hot tea is free."
3/27/2019,20190327,5,4.33,"Very delicious! Went with my hubby and mom. We ordered the beef udon, pork belly udon, creamy tomato seafood udon, takoyaki, and tempura.  All was really fresh and delicious! I think I should have ordered the creamy tomato seafood udon bc after tasting it from my hubby, I wanted to finish his bowl  would come back again, just parking sucks, but it's expected."
3/28/2019,20190328,5,4.33,"YUM. Love their signature udons. The last time I had Marugame Monzo, I ordered the tomato seafood which was bomb. My friend ordered the regular cold udon since it was a little hot outside and we found it very refreshing. They have so many different options to choose from and everything is unique. They cut their own udon in house too. I think it's best to come with 2-3 other people so you can all order different udons and share.They also have tempura here although I find it to be pretty mediocre. The batter on my tempura fell apart when I bit into it. I don't really mind though, because I come for the udon and not the tempura. FYI - I ordered chicken tempura. Maybe the shrimp is better hahMy most recent visit was Wednesday at noon. Still a short wait at that time but nothing crazy. There's usually a crowd of people in line on the weekends so plan accordingly! This place can't really accommodate large parties so keep that in mind too."
3/30/2019,20190330,3,4.33,"Didn't really get the hype when this place first opened up, still don't get the hype after finally trying the dishes. This place serves basic, good udon but it's definitely not mindblowing enough to where it deserves the hour-long waits. With my recent trip to Japan, I realized even further how basic the noodles here tasted. I ordered the Beef Udon while my friend ordered the Carbonara Udon. Both were good...again, not mindblowing.Only line up if you want to satisfy your curiosity of this place or if you're REALLY craving udon."
3/31/2019,20190331,4,4.33,"Parking is suuuuper tricky in this area, especially on Fridays/weekends. Sometimes even the surrounding paid lots are full!I had the uni udon, as it seems to be their signature dish. The broth was not too creamy or thick, but I think it was actually lacking in sea urchin flavor. The sea urchin is cooked, so the texture is not melt-in-your-mouth. By the end of it, I was scooping bits and pieces out of the broth because it was a $17 bowl of udon. Oh yeah, don't be fooled by the huge bowl or spoon/ladle. Portions are not THAT huge here. Udon noodles themselves were delicious- so fresh, so chewy. More of a 3.5 star, but maybe I was just not impressed by the uni udon flavor. I did love the noodles, so maybe I'll be back to try another dish!"
3/31/2019,20190331,5,4.33,"I can recommend the Cream Mentai Udon and Beef Udon.The rich flavors and delicious fresh Udon will make you miss the place when you leave.If you're hungry I recommend the Double portion for $2 more. And for Lunch time the Mini bowl add on is worth it. Get the beef bowl!I always look forward to little Tokyo for the Udon, as I already have a great local place for Ramen."
3/31/2019,20190331,1,4.33,"Arrived on a Sunday night with our two kids and put our name down for a party of three. We were seated about 45 minutes later, at which time I sent a text to my wife. She works downtown, and was just getting off work, so I invited her to join us. As the waiter was taking our order, I asked if we could hold onto the menu, as my wife would be there soon. The waiter said that would be a problem, and they would not be able to serve us. He summoned the hostess, who informed us that my wife would have to place her name on the list and wait for a free table. I pointed out that there was an empty chair at our table. Why can't she just sit there? The hostess said it's against the rules. I couldn't believe it and asked to see the manager. A gaunt fellow with bad teeth came cringing to our table, telling us that we would have to leave. It was against the rules for anyone to join us, he said, asking if I had read the sign. Well, I had read it, and the sign said nothing about our situation. The ""manager"" demanded we leave immediately. I replied that we would wait until my wife arrived (she had texted me that she was looking for parking) and then we would decide what to do. The ""manager"" scurried off, presumably to call the police. He returned just as my wife arrived and apologized profusely. We ended up staying for dinner, but we did not enjoy it much. The food was okay, but nothing to write home about, and by then our kids had lost their appetite."
4/1/2019,20190401,5,4.33,"Last meal in LA. This place was right beside our hotel in little Tokyo and always had a lineup. Seemed like a no brainer. Small place that requires some wait time but service was excellent. The server explained everything to us and the various ingredients used. True Japanese service I got the creamy sea urchin Udon and my wife went for the other popular creamy Udon. It tasted delicious with heavy flavours. My bowl was full of sea urchin, so well worth the premium. Udon was extremely long and chewy and tastes nothing like the frozen stuff at home. Would love to come back and try their other dishes. Every bowl around us looked delicious and filled with ingredients."
4/3/2019,20190403,5,4.33,"Hello my Yelpies,Came here for the first time even though I've heard so many good things about this place for many years. So glad I finally get to try it. Got here around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon. Wait time was around 15-20 minutes, but it was definitely worth the wait. We ordered the Ma Po Udon,the rich flavors and the delicious udon will make you miss this place when you leave. If you like spicy I definitely recommend their Ma Po Udon, it had the perfect flavor and the spice wasn't overwhelming. Their service was excellent, we were greeted by the door and food came out pretty fast. Without a doubt I'll be back again!"
4/3/2019,20190403,4,4.33,"This place has some solid udon noodles. Its especially cool cause you can see them make it fresh in the kitchen! However I gave it a four out of five because if the price for the quality. It was good food but our total came out to be around 20 per person for noodle and rice bowl (through lunch special). The rice bowl while also good was mostly rice. So again, not really worth the price. But, I'm from Dallas so maybe I dont understand the LA standard for food prices. I got the miso carbonara udon, which was good for the first few bites but it got super heavy for me. Small tip, they have this plum paste (extra dollar) which is very tangy and vinegar-y but that helps with the richness of the udon. Honestly, I was craving some kimchi with this. I also got the fatty tuna rice bowl, and though it was a lot of rice, it was prettyflavorful. They had a good amount of mayo with it, so that probably had a lot to do with why I liked it so much.My friend got the mapotofu udon which was also good, but honestly would rather just have the original rice dish. My other friend (I know so many friends ) got the beef bukkake udon. And yes that's the legit name, ya nasty. This was a cold udon dish, and I loved the texture of the udon. It was slightly more al dente than the hot dishes.. make sense. I would probably not come here again...cause I live in Texas huehue but if I lived here, I'd consider it if I was really craving udon."
4/5/2019,20190405,1,4.33,"Food was great, we were trying to enjoy a nice dinner out, but we were seated next to a group of four that were screaming all their conversations (if you'd call them that). Basically, neighboring table was horrible and very loud in a rude way. Couldn't even hear my date. I'm sad to say this place is a tourist trap and not worth coming to if you are looking for great food and a great environment."
4/8/2019,20190408,5,4.33,"Marugame Monzo has a huge udon menu with lots of options that you can't get at many other places like creamy mentaiko, uni, spicy beef, and miso carbonara. My brother and I tried their spicy beef and miso carbonara - both of which we liked a lot. The udon is made in house everyday and the texture of the udon was perfect - chewey, soft yet firm, and silky. I would definitely go back! If you go though, be aware that the line is often really long and I waited about an hour in line. It's helpful though if you go in a small group (like 2 people) because then you can sit at the bar seating, which speeds things up a little bit."
4/8/2019,20190408,4,4.33,"Wow I am having nostalgia from eating at this place! It was delicious and I loved the uni pasta they offered. The udon was also very tender and definitely with a tasteable superiority to other udons. However one critic I have is that the uni tastes nowhere near fresh to me. It was blended in with the sauce and they were generous with the portion in terms of uni, but the heat from the noodle ruined the texture and the taste of the uni. I still enjoyed my bowl nevertheless. I would go back there next time- but to order the white sauce with bacon udon."
4/8/2019,20190408,4,4.33,"All the udons we ordered, the sea urchin cream, miso carbonara and a cold udon ( forgot the name) were delicious. The cold udon highlighted the udon texture the most. I would definitely come back to try the other ones."
4/9/2019,20190409,5,4.33,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Little Tokyo.Uni Udon (5/5) - I don't consider myself an enthusiast for seafood but now I am excited to try more and more uni dishes. The cream had a slightly sweet taste, which I was told comes from the uni. There was a decent amount of pieces of uni floating around. As always, the udon was delicious. This is also one of their most popular choices. It is a bit pricier than the rest of their udon dishes but I will definitely come back for more anyway. Steak Tartare (4.5/5) - I have always been skeptical about raw beef (this one is seared) but I was curious and wanted to give it a shot. I was surprised to find that it doesn't taste much different from cooked beef at all. They drizzle some olive oil and season it a little, serve the sliced beef on a plate, and if you're sharing, it's up to you to swipe as many as you can before it's gone. Hopefully, I have dinner here again sometime soon because I am so excited to order more. ** I think they only have this on the menu during dinner timeMentai Squid Butter Udon (4.5/5) - This udon uses a broth base instead of cream. The broth is very flavorful, with an abundance of fish eggs and squid. I don't like squid that much so I didn't enjoy this dish as much as I should have and I probably won't order it again but if you love squid, then this is your calling! Beef Bowl (4/5) - A small bowl of beef and rice, flavored like Yoshinoya (but a little better). That's all.Pork Belly Bowl (4.25/5) - I enjoyed this a little more than the beef bowl. This one is tender slices of pork belly with seasoning and served with rice. Nothing special but still good and filling to pair with your udon. Overall, I always have great experiences at Marugame Monzo. The wait time is sometimes sorta long but at your own risk of losing your place, you can venture off into the Little Tokyo Village for a few minutes."
4/9/2019,20190409,5,4.33,"Oh my gosh, I didn't expect this place to be so good. I'm not a huge udon fan, I prefer ramen instead because I don't find thick noodles very appealing. Sometimes the broth at some udon places are bland or lack flavor. But what I ordered here had nothing but flavor. I heard about Monzo's sea urchin cream udon, falling under the ""specialities"" on their menu. It was the priciest udon dish, rounding up to about $18, but it was sooo worth it.A couple friends and I had are orders ready in less than ten minutes, fairly quick. My order looked and tasted delicious, the presentation was cute. On top, they placed some salmon eggs and decorative greens. As well as tiny pieces of sea urchin. This was my first time trying sea urchin and all I could say is that it's really soft and the cream brought out it's rich flavor. This dish reminded me of some carbonara or alfredo pasta. But this cream is a little saltier. And combining this with some firm noodles results in perfection. The flavor of this dish is out of this world. This is definitely better than any pasta I have ever had.If you ever have the chance to eat here, please do yourself the favor and order this dish!"
4/9/2019,20190409,4,4.33,"I would have never thought of having a bolognese udon...oh man...this is the first time I ever had an Italian Japanese fusion that actually worked. I see it. I get it...noodles...tomato sauce...Japanese or Italian ingredients? How can you go wrong? Well I've had other places here in LA that has attempted that and have just missed the mark, or have been just shy of success. This udon was delicious....noodles are made fresh daily...in your face. You can even sit at the counter of the kitchen and watch them being made. Bomb! Anyways...noodles were soft, the tomato meat sauce was good with the right amount of nicely chopped eggplant and mushrooms. I woulda preferred more of the udon broth but the consistency of the meat sauce made up for it. Def recommend this spot! Hidden between the overrated ramen joints."
4/10/2019,20190410,4,4.33,"It is good quality udon but the hassle of finding parking and waiting in long lines cannot be fun for a bowl of noodles. I happen to hit it between shifts and was able to walk in and eat. I will never understand why one would dilute good uni into a broth, but to each its own. There are many choices in little Tokyo and pick the one with the least hassle."
4/11/2019,20190411,5,4.33,"I. Love. This. Place. So. Much. My favorite spot to get udon. The uni udon is SOOOO delicious. The creaminess is incomparable. I've also had the kake udon and the cold udon and the clam udon, all of which were very delicious! It's pretty cool that you can see the udon being made through the window in the restaurant as well. Shop wise, it's pretty small, and it definitely gets busy during the weekends and meal periods, but believe me when I say that the wait is well worth it."
4/11/2019,20190411,4,4.33,I love their Uni Udon! Little pricey but still like it. Service is not really very attentive but i understand because they are busy. They are also nice.
4/12/2019,20190412,5,4.33,"A unique noodle experience! The flavors here are amazing. I ordered the creamy sea urchin udon and my friend ordered the curry udon + pork belly rice bowl lunch special. Every dish was so flavorful! The sea urchin udon was creamy and salty with a good portion of sea urchin. The curry udon was a bit lighter (not as creamy) and the pork rice bowl was well seasoned. Don't be fooled by the portion sizes -- they might look small, but you'll be stuffed!"
4/13/2019,20190413,5,4.33,A great LA SPOT. Guaranteed great meal. The squid and fish eggs version is so perfect. Best spot in lil Tokyo to eat
4/13/2019,20190413,3,4.33,We came here on Saturday after noon and had to wait between five and ten minutes to be seated. The service was really fast and we ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and Sea Urchin Udon. The ingredients were very unique and definitely couldn't find this in typical udon bars. The taste was a little strong for myself but overall this place did well.
4/15/2019,20190415,5,4.33,"What is better than freshly made udon noodles?! Little Tokyo had so much to offer in terms of soup noodles. I was so glad we made the choice to come here for lunch. Did not disappoint!I got the Spicy Dragon Udon and my husband got the Miso Carbonara, both super delicious!Great place for authentic and fusion udon noodle bowls!!"
4/15/2019,20190415,4,4.33,The Uni udon was very creamy and savory. I personally like the shrimp tempura udon my friend ordered better. Not many selections on the menu except udon.
4/16/2019,20190416,5,4.33,I could see how the noddle were made. I ordered the popular menu which is cream udon with rice bowl ($3) and my friend ordered curry udon. It was really tasty.
4/16/2019,20190416,5,4.33,"Fresh Udon Noodles is something I have never experienced before. So this, as you can guess was quite the treat. So savory and delicious with fresh ingredients. Thank you and may I have another bowl."
4/17/2019,20190417,4,4.33,"I came here on a Friday night with a group of 5 and the line was super long. That being said, it took us only around 30-40 minutes to be seated which didn't feel too bad in my opinion. The restaurant itself is pretty small and parking can be pretty difficult in this area. The entire staff were super friendly and had smiles the entire time I was there. I ended up ordering the sea urchin udon and I guess it was just not as amazing as I was expecting it to be. Now don't get me wrong, the dish is still good, but I think it pales in comparison to the miso carbonara (I had a small bite from my friend). I will definitely come back to try the miso carbonara or any other dish from here!"
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.33,"My friend came here Friday night. We parked at a nearby lot and walked over. We were advised to come before 7pm to avoid a long wait and turns out that advice was definitely true. However, even if you have to wait there's a bunch of cool stores and things to look at right across the street. We split the tempura and toro appetizer. The toro was really good! Definitely recommend adding the sauce to your rolls. My friend was too eager and kept forgetting but he really liked the sauce. The tempura was solid. Not my favorite but nothing to complain about! I got the miso carbonara udon which was pretty rich and creamy...as to be expected. It was so good though! It was hard picking one as all the options sound really appetizing. Definitely want to come back and try the tigers. Maybe next time a less rich one so I have a chance of finishing it all."
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.33,I drive 45 mins out from Rowland Heights for Monzo!!! I know they're not short of excellent reviews but I really want to make a point to add more love. Things to try:- Sea Urchin Cream Udon- Beef Hot Udon (able to add double portion aka extra noodles!)- Seafood Tomato (a new favorite)- Miso Carbonara (kinda heavy like Sea Urchin but has a bacon-y twist)Come for lunch to get a mini rice bowl for $3!! I love the beef bowl and spicy pork :). The line does get long though (30-45mins) but you can always put down your name and walk around Little Tokyo.
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.33,"Good udon, even better broth. Great selection, good ambience. Will come back."
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.33,My favorite creamy udon place ever! I will travel far and wide for the uni creamy udon. Freshly made and you will never go wrong
4/19/2019,20190419,4,4.33,"Marugame is right next to ramen place that is quite popular, yet it is still just as crowded. The good thing about Marugame is that it serves udon, which real is my jam. I really enjoyed everything that we ate, except for the carbonara udon because it was too rich, and best save for the thinner spaghetti noodle. If you stick with the traditional udon, you will leave happy. The price is great, the service is friendly, and the food won't disappoint. My favorite dish is the hot dragon udon. It was so good, and I especially like that the udon is pulled fresh right before your eyes. The duck udon was good too!"
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.33,Wait was short. Sansai udon has such a beautiful clean broth. The noodles are some of the best I've ever had.
4/20/2019,20190420,5,4.33,"In love with this udon house but it is always packed. I've been there twice, once with my old roommate and the other time with a friend.Strongly recommend those who love pastas and seafood-flavor soup to try mentai cream udon!I ordered mentai cream (or vice verse) udon the first time I went there, and omg I was in love with it as soon as I got the first bite of it. The texture of the udon was so good and the soup was just delicious. It's even better for me to eat it with shredded daikon."
4/21/2019,20190421,4,4.33,"Mm mm. If you love yourself some udon + uni, this was all of that and then some. This is a small ish restaurant just across from the main Little Tokyo plaza. Stopped by around 1:30pm on Easter Sunday, and there was a bit of a wait (nothing crazy, about 20mins). Like a majority of other Japanese restaurants, the tables are tightly packed. And right next to our table was a 2yo screaming his lungs off. The mom did step away a few times with the kid when there were a handful of stares. Just be warned, you'll be in close quarters with the rest of the patrons. The bud and I opted to share the uni udon and butter squid udon. Honestly, I really wanted the uni, but was willing to try others. Udon was perfectly al dente. Yasss. And the creaminess of the uni udon was everything I'd been craving!! The bud was not a fan of the uni udon (it is on the heavier side)...but it worked out bc I wasn't crazy about the butter squid udon. While still good, the butter squid option was more on the salty side, and the uni was more on the sweet. Uni was a bit brown, so def not the freshest I've ever had. But all in all, a pretty good experience. Would def come back for udon, when in the area. 4 stars."
4/22/2019,20190422,4,4.33,"BEST UDON EVER!!! The creamy tomato seafood udon was to die for with a plethora of seafood and the udon being perfectly cooked. Although the wait was over an hour. If you're willing to wait, it is worth it in my opinion!!"
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.33,"I came here with my husband and a group of friends based on the hyped reviews on Yelp, Marugame Monzo did NOT disappoint! Parking is a bit of a nightmare, there is limited street parking available and a few parking lots within a few blocks. We came here on a Sunday afternoon and waited about 30 minutes before being seated.I ordered the lunch time special, which is any choice of Udon order with a mini rice bowl! The mini rice bowl prices vary, I chose the Negitoro Rice Bowl, which comes with Fatty Tuna chopped with green onions over rice topped with Sweet Sauce with Mayo. For my Udon order, I chose the Hot Dragon Udon, which comes with Hot Udon in paitan soup, topped with spicy ground pork, bean sprout and nira. I opted for no bean sprouts though. The Negitoro Rice Bowl was delicious, the Fatty Tuna was very fresh and I really liked the sauce drizzled over the rice. The lump of chopped seaweed was great mixed into the bowl as well. The Hot Dragon Udon was spicy, but not overwhelming where you can't enjoy it. They do not skimp on udon, I was STUFFED after my meal! Staff were polite and food came out quickly, I can see why this place was so packed and the reviews are so positive. I am super happy we were able to make a stop at Marugame Monzo before our flight back to the DMV from LA. If I am ever in the area I would definitely come back here! :)"
4/25/2019,20190425,4,4.33,"There are a few times in my life where I will eat thick noodles: this was one of those times as we trekked to little toyko for some bomb udon. FOOD: I got the Kake Udon. This is basically the simplest udon... just the broth, some mushroom added, green onion. The broth was not overly salty, very flavorful. The noodles were just perfect--not too many where I wonder if the noodle torture will ever end--just a good amount where you feel satisfied afterwards. They are slightly chewy but firm enough and go well with the soup. The vegetables are plentiful and fresh. My friend got the carbonara udon which was very rich with cheese broiled on top but it tasted delicious. AMBIENCE: Very crowded. There was a line at 5pm already when they opened but we were seated quickly. It wasn't so noisy where I felt I couldn't hear my friends but it was definitely not a quiet place to have a deep conversation haha.SERVICE: prompt and water came quickly. Bathroom was clean and everything on the menu was explained to us very thoroughly. I don't even like udon that much, but marugame definitely makes me reconsider this sentiment with their soup!!"
4/27/2019,20190427,5,4.33,"I always bring people visiting out of town to Marugame Monzo. Hands down the best udon in LA! My favorite is Mentai squid butter. I usually don't eat squid. But they make it taste like fish! So soft and delicious.If there's a line, it's worth the wait and it moves quickly too. Service is always great and food is consistently good. Highly recommended."
4/27/2019,20190427,5,4.33,The absolute best udon you will find in LA. I ate udon in tokyo days in a row and this place is the only one that comes close to what I had there. Everything here is delicioousssss. It's also really fun to watch them make the noodles if u get a bar seat. I typically order the beef udon with a tempura egg or if u want something a bit different try the squid mentai butter!
4/28/2019,20190428,4,4.33,"Came in here Thursday night.It's pretty crowded, and the wait for the table is about 20-30mins for 3people. The place is not that spacious. By the way they will not give you a table if the whole party is not there. It's street parking only or pay $10 for parking structure. Well it took me 15mins looking for parking, I end up parking my car near Starbucks, I paid $5. On the other had, great food and A little pricey for me.We got the uni udon, chicken skin,beef tataki And mentai squid udon.All the food we ordered was good, a lot of flavor,and nice presentation.I just hope they made the udon a little warmer other than everything is good! I'm happy I was able to try uni udon!! Something new to me!! Happy tummy!"
4/28/2019,20190428,4,4.33,"Like it or not, when you become a parent the power in your household is shifted. Your actions must please the little people or peace will something you laugh about in a hysterical state. Anyway, in my household the monsters like noodles rather ""noonales,"" so noonales they must have. We came across Monzo on one or our many day adventures and it checked off the box - kid friendly, highly rated, decent pricing and of course serving noonales. Not to mention, I love udon - so win! Based on the reviews and the size of the restaurant, we came here expecting a wait. But, here's a pro tip - go right at opening and even if you aren't the first 10 people in line - you will still be seated in the first wave. And being one of the first people for the day has a lot of cool benefits - for one you know everything is super fresh and two, well you get to watch the dude make the noodles which he may or may not do throughout the day but who cares it's fun to watch. Although the restaurant is quite small, comprised of some half booth tables, stand alone tables and bar seating near the kitchen and in front of the large glass window where the master noodle maker is pressed and hand cutting noodles. And although the space is small they are able to push tables together to accommodate for larger parties. The menu is pretty unique, not only do they have the more traditional udon selections but they have a section of the menu dedicated to more unique stylings such as bolognese udon and uni udon. There are a bunch of add ons you can choose from to even further customize your selection - I highly recommend the seasoned fish eggs - think a paste of small fish eggs mixed with a salty sriracha sauce. And if you come during their lunch hours you can add a rice bowl to your udon for 3 bucks more! The first time I went I tried the uni udon. I've had this dish several times and I have concluded that I just don't like it. Nothing against Monzo - it wasn't bad but personally the creaminess was overpowering for me and I prefer my uni cold. But again I shouldn't have chosen that for breakfast. For those of you who like extra creamy give it a shot, compared to the other uni pastas this was my favorite. It wasn't fishy and didn't have a weird smell to it. The second time I stuck with the plain and simple kake and it was just great. My girls really enjoy the beef udon. What I like about the broth here is that unlike ramen broth, it's not overly salty. And as for the noodles, I love the texture of the noodles, chewy but not to the point where they was tough. And you can just taste the difference with the fresh noodles. On the kid friendly note - seriously what kid doesn't like noodles, soup and meat? The restaurant doesn't have high chairs but they do have booster seats. And they have the little Ikea bowls and cups for the kiddos which are pretty great! But no changing table in the bathrooms. They even have space near the front for you to store your folded strollers while you dine. A few things to note:- Being located in Little Tokyo you might be extremely lucky to find street parking (I've only been here on Saturdays) so you gotta park in a garage - there are a bunch - we park across the street."
4/30/2019,20190430,5,4.33,"I really loved this udon shop. I got the kitsune bean curd udon and it was so filling and fresh. You could see the noodles getting prepared in front of you so you know for a fact how fresh they are. The food comes fast and for a Friday night, the wait was not too long at all. I really loved dining here and would come back! They have many options that cater to all kinds of diet, meat eating, vegan, pescatarian, etc."
5/4/2019,20190504,5,4.33,"There is always a wait but it is definitely worth it. This restaurant definitely does the ingredients justice. They take the flavor of the ingredients and build their dishes around it. I've tried the mentaiko udon, the uni udon and the duck udon. All dishes were amazing. I've come back multiple times for the mentaiko and that will always be my go to dish."
5/5/2019,20190505,4,4.33,"Located off 1st St in Little Tokyo downtown LA. So you know parking is the pits over here you'd be lucky to get street parking. There is parking structure near by which fills up fast as well. This place had massive people outside waiting to get a table, they have a sign posted stating that you can't wait inside and to please wait outside till your name is called. Oh a big tip is that your party has to be all there to be seated. This place is small and fills up fast. We waited over a hour to be seated. I would give this place five stars but the wait knocks it down. The staff and service is great. Food comes pretty quick. This place is known for their in house made udon noodles. I got the miso carbonara udon it was tasty and good. I would get that again. They do not valid for the structure parking. Overall a good place and I recommend the udon. I'd go back again."
5/5/2019,20190505,1,4.33,"funny how they removed my first review. the first waitress made us feel like we are cheap , we didnt notice the no sharing of combo. it was really sad we were with our friends from australia. she was an old asian women who had a RBF. the udon wasnt even good. the carbonara was very watery and not creamy. the cold udon was lacking of a thinner noodle."
5/6/2019,20190506,4,4.33,Ordered Mentai Cream Udon.It was very nice. Flavor is just perfect. Would definitely come again!
5/7/2019,20190507,4,4.33,"Definitely come here if you love udon. You can taste the difference between freshly made udon noodles. Even if you aren't a fan of udon noodles, there are other menu items to choose from.I really wanted to try the carbonora dish, but was scared it would taste funny. I was about to order just a normal bowl until I saw the mapo tofu special and decided to give it a try. Tofu was silky soft and the sauce was well seasoned.Both tempura udon bowls were a hit with my kids."
5/8/2019,20190508,5,4.33,Amazing uni udon. One of the best places to eat in LA that you can't get anywhere else really.
5/9/2019,20190509,4,4.33,"Located off 1st St in Little Tokyo downtown LA. So you know parking is the pits over here you'd be lucky to get street parking. There is parking structure near by which fills up fast as well. This place had massive people outside waiting to get a table, they have a sign posted stating that you can't wait inside and to please wait outside till your name is called. Oh a big tip is that your party has to be all there to be seated. This place is small and fills up fast. We waited over a hour to be seated. I would give this place five stars but the wait knocks it down. The staff and service is great. Food comes pretty quick. This place is known for their in house made udon noodles. I got the miso carbonara udon it was tasty and good. I would get that again. They do not valid for the structure parking. Overall a good place and I recommend the udon. I'd go back again."
5/9/2019,20190509,5,4.33,"Found this place on Yelp before my LA trip and I'm soooo glad i found it! This place was amazing!Service was really fast! You put down your name on the clipboard and they call you in when there's a table available. We ordered fairly quickly since we were hungry, and the food came I would say probably within 10 minutes, maybe even less. We were all very pleasantly surprised.I got the miso carbonara udon, and it was amazing! Very creamy, but not overly creamy that you find it disgustingly heavy after a few bites. One of my friends got the curry udon, and it was really good too. It had like a smoky kind of curry flavour, it was an interested taste.The udons came in a huge bowl, but the portions were pretty small.I would definitely go again!!!"
5/9/2019,20190509,5,4.33,"I ordered the miso carbonara udon, which was definitely something unique. It's essentially udon noodles made with Alfredo sauce, with a subtle savory flavor. The sauce was very smooth and rich, without being too salty or overpowering. The portion size was a bit small (for my appetite).The wait (on a Saturday evening) was fairly long, at around an hour and fifteen minutes. Fortunately, the surrounding area of Little Tokyo has a bunch of shops and pre-dinner desserts to keep you occupied. Our waiter was very attentive and quick in getting us our orders and bill. I would definitely come back to try more of their menu."
5/10/2019,20190510,5,4.33,"A friend and I got lunch here around 12:00pm, and it wasn't too busy at that time (but we did notice that when we left around 1:00pm, there was a significant wait outside!). Sign into the waitlist inside, then they call your party by name. The inside is really traditional, which I loved the vibes of. It's a tad small, so I'd recommend small parties of 2-4 max, unless y'all are okay with (waiting for) the bar. In front of the bar, you can watch the chefs create the udon noodles from scratch!!! Really neat. We ordered the sea urchin cream udon (which seemed like their most popular dish) and took advantage of the lunch special, which lets you get a mini rice bowl for an additional $3-4. She got the kakiage (tempura) bowl and I had the nigitori (fatty tuna) bowl. Both arrived before the udon, and they were delicious! The fatty tuna is flavorful, soft, and savory in a salty way, and it balances well with the mayonnaise + scallion in the rice bowl. The texture of the udon is perfect -- slightly chewy, soft and firm. The presentation is gorgeous too, with the eggs sitting on top of a (sesame?) leaf. I found the eggs too sharp/bitter for my taste, but it was a great contrast to the thick creaminess of the soup. Every flavor was put together in a meaningful way, and it was a fantastic fusion dish, kinda like a cream pasta. Warning: if you take your leftovers to-go and leave it in the soup, the noodles will bloat and eat up all the soup! :'-) But worthOverall, super worth a try, especially if you like Japanese fusion. I'm personally not a big fan of traditional udon, but I loved the udon here and am excited to come back to try their other dishes!!"
5/11/2019,20190511,3,4.33,"Handmade udon in front of you sure is a show. The udon noodles were great, thick, chewy. The choice of vehicle you use to present the udon is the hardest part of it. For the cheese fix, I tried the UDON GRATIN around $12 which was baked for the maximum cheese factor. It was good, tasty and really heavy. When you pick up a chopstick-ful, the cheese comes up with it and each bite is ladden with it. The chicken inside the pan was nothing to rave about.The Negitoro mini rice bowl was an absolute MEH, $6.25. Nothing to describe except basic sushi rice with a scoopful of not very flavorful tuna. The udon had more taste.Also got some vegetable tempura. This was good, I very much enjoyed it but it is an app and they would not count this as a dish per person (hence, the lunch combo was not possible)May have to come back for the udon in other dishes. But of the two I had, I'm ok.Parking is free on Sundays just outside but it is very hard. There was a long wait around 5pm so plan ahead."
5/11/2019,20190511,5,4.33,"Love this place. The noodles are so perfect and there are a lot of unique kinds of udon here to try. The sea urchin uni udon is my favorite - and is the priciest udon to get. But the creamy broth, the bits of uni mixed in, and the roe on top make for a wonderful combination.Last time got the crispy chicken skin as well, and have had the tempura before as well which was great.Sometimes the wait can be long but if you see a lot of people waiting outside, it could be for Daikokuya next door. The longest I waited was about an hour and that was on a Saturday evening."
5/11/2019,20190511,4,4.33,"Fantastic udon, both creative and traditional types available. We were pleasantly surprised that the wait was only 30 minutes on Friday of graduation for a party of six. Of the 6 bowls we ordered, the mapo tofu was probably the fan favorite. I ordered the miso carbonara, so more on the creative side. It was good but wasn't life changing. Curry udon and beef udon were notable mentions."
5/12/2019,20190512,5,4.33,Definitely worth the wait! The miso carbonara udon was my favorite! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the flavoring of that creamy sauce is to die for! The hot dragon udon wasn't too spicy but had excellent flavor. The udon gratin was SOO cheesy and SOO good! Definitely adding this place to one of my go-to's when in LA.
5/12/2019,20190512,5,4.33,Small portion but uni udon is the best here. Waiters are really nice and $1 per hour parking structure near by too. Lunch special rice bowl is tiny too but also delicious!
5/12/2019,20190512,5,4.33,"This place is AMAZING, handmade udon noodles right in front of you. The lunch set with pork belly rice and mushroom cream is my favorite, my husband lives for the mentai squid butter udon. The people waiting in the long line for ramen a few doors over are suckers lol actually they can keep doing that because I dont want the wait at Monzo to get longer."
5/12/2019,20190512,5,4.33,OMG! This place was so AMAZING! Udon is made fresh right in front of you! Went here with my mom for Mother's Day weekend and there was a 30-40 minute wait which I would say is really reasonable. Both of our orders Mentai Butter Squid and Seafood Cream were very unique and well deserving of this review. I can't wait to come back again soon and try their other flavors!
5/13/2019,20190513,5,4.33,"What can I say? I love this place. The wait is totally worth it. Not only is their udon fantastic, (that goes without saying) the rice bowls that you can add on to your udon is equally simple yet delicious. We loved everything we ordered that day. Squid udon, cold summer special udon with nagaimo (although I believe this is an acquired taste), the fatty pork and fatty tuna rice bowl. Depending on where you are seated, you can also watch the Masters at work making that delicious udon noodles. Must return again!"
5/16/2019,20190516,5,4.33,"I LOVED this place. I'd wanted to go here for so long but just haven't had the chance. I finally went last night and it was soooo good. I already can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes. The thing that really stood out to me other than the incredible udon, is the service. They were so efficient and fast and just did an over all great job. Now onto the food, the Uni Udon was incredible. It was so creamy and flavorful. It kind of tastes like pasta! My boyfriend got the Miso Carbonara Udon, which both of us agreed was super yummy. I can't wait to go back and try more!! Instant favorite place in Little Tokyo!!"
5/17/2019,20190517,5,4.33,Ok this place is pretty great. Udon noodles were perfectly soft and chewy. The sauces were both delicious. Carbonara was definitely strong and flavorful; really can't go wrong with cream sauce and bacon. Then the sea urchin sauce was a tad lighter but very controlled and not too overwhelming.Only in LA for two full days but now I want to go back.Came here around 5:45pm on a Friday evening and the wait was only 10-15min. Not too bad!All in all - YUM!!!!
5/17/2019,20190517,5,4.33,"If you want you want to try ramen in a confident and relaxing place, this is definitely your spot in the city."
5/18/2019,20190518,5,4.33,"If you're a fan of noodles, you need to try Marugame Monzo. Originated in LA, this local shop makes their udon from scratch, and offer a great variety of dishes for each taste.My friend and I shared the Negitoro wrap. I had the udon gratin, and she had the Mentai Squid Butter Udon. Every single thing that I tasted was very satisfying and could stand on its own. The Negitoro wrap was very generous for the price. You basically built your own hand roll with fresh ingredients and fatty toro.The udon gratin was literally like a slightly more flavorful mac and cheese, and of course, with way better noodles. It is very creamy, so I took half of it home. If you're in the mood for comfort food, it is a big winner. I only had a taste of the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, but it was incredible how the seafood permeated throughout the sauce. The texture and flavor were executed exquisitely. There were thirteen people ahead of us, yet it only took around 20 minutes to seat us. The servers were super nice and thorough, and came back to check on us. The cherry on top was that we got seated right next to where they prep the noodles. It was so much fun to watch and the workers seemed to be having fun too!With affordable parking very closely at AisoParking Lot. Several fun things to do around the area. You really don't want to miss the opportunity to come to Marugame Monzo. It was a pleasure and I cannot wait to come back and try more of their dishes."
5/18/2019,20190518,5,4.33,"This is my favorite tempura and udon place. I really love their Wakame Udon and I order it with grated radish and pumpkin tempura. I like how they put tempura on the side instead of inside the udon so it doesn't get soggy. Also, it is so hard to find a udon place that has grated radish! I am so happy Marugane Monzo does - mixing some in with a spoonful of soup gives it a really refreshing taste. This place has the best udon noodles and the best udon soups I have ever tried."
5/19/2019,20190519,5,4.33,Best ramen place! Anything on the menu you get is amazing! It's usually two hour wait! Make sure you get there early!!!
5/20/2019,20190520,5,4.33,"I had a friend who was recommending this place to me, and as a lover of carbs, I knew I had to give it a try. It looked so unique to see udon noodles cooked in this way, and I was very excited leading up to my visit. From entering the restaurant to the end, the service was top notch. The waiters were very kind and so willing to help with any request that we had. In terms of food, I decided to go with one of their signature udon, which was the Miso Carbonara Udon and my friend went with the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon. They were both very delicious. The udon noodles were cooked perfectly, and the sauces were so tasty. For our appetizer, we went with the Fried Chicken, which I think was a perfect complement to our food. Just a heads up since this place is located in Little Tokyo there is not designated parking for it, but there are plenty of parking structures around and if you are lucky you may find some street parking. Overall, I highly recommend this place to anyone for its unique and delicious taste."
5/20/2019,20190520,5,4.33,"Hip and trandy udon place serves both authentic and fusion Japanese udon. Fluffy and chewy udon noodles made from scratch with perfectly seasoned sauce or broth were all very delicious. Uni (sea urchin) udon was not too rich but light & creamy with uni chunks and topped with ikrura (salmon roe). Luscious and comforting!Duck Nanban udon served in clear broth with generous tender slices of duck and chargrilled green onion was savory and delicious.Softboiled egg tempura (Ingenious and creative)!!! Do recommend ordering one on the side to enjoy with Udon. It is softboiled, so be careful not to spill it on your shirt when you bite into it.Can't wait to go back and try classic  Udons like Kake, Kitsune and Shrimp Tempera Udon!"
5/22/2019,20190522,1,4.33,"Just had lunch there. Got there at a couple min after 11:30. I was out of there by 12:00. During the length of my meal, the restaurant was filling up slowly but still plenty of seats by the time I left. The reason for the one star review is due to how rushed the service is...in a very bad way. I was seated at the corner of the bar. There was one guy next to me and another girl at the end of the bar. We were all solo diners. Our orders came out super quick bc face it, it isn't hard to boil some noodles and throw it in some broth. I was eating my tempura shrimp udon noodles and reading. I wasn't even halfway done w my meal when the waiter walks down the bar and plops our check on the table. Ok, no big deal. But the two other patrons take their cards out right away. I'm still casually eating my noodles while watching the guy behind the glass make the noodles. The waiter takes my empty plate from the shrimp and asks me if I'm still working on my noodles. Yeah you fucking Dick. I am.The other two patrons ordered more than i did, w rice bowls and extra tempura. The waiter, clearly seeing the girl at the end of the bar working on her rice bowl asks if she is still working on her noodles. Yeah Dick, she is. The restaurant still has plenty of seats so there's no need to treat eating customers so shabbily. This is such rude customer service. Yeah the food is good, I enjoy it, but this is not how you should treat your customers. My bill came out to 15 something. I just rounded up to 16 and closed out my billl. I only ordered the shrimp tempura udon and a glass of water. So it isn't necessarily cheap. This is the 4th or 5th time I've been here. Today was just exceptionally rude. Next time I will just go to suehiro cafe or the number of other options all around. If you want to be treated poorly for a chance to dine on some cooked flour and broth, be my guest."
5/25/2019,20190525,5,4.33,"A+If I could eat here everyday, and not gain weight - I would. Easily. What can I say to add to the glowing reviews? Not much - but just adding another gold star. Finally took my guy here - right before popping over to Japan for vacation. He really enjoyed their Curry Udon. I normally get the Carbonara Udon - I swerved and ordered the tomato seafood udon. Pretty Good - but honestly, not as good as the carbonara. Seafood is fresh and the dish is delicious. Noodles made from scratch - the prime seats are around the windowed ""bar"" area. Go there. Wait in line if you have to. Grab a friend or two, or not. Just go."
5/26/2019,20190526,5,4.33,The udon is amazing. I got the spicy dragon udon. The broth is flavorful and udon is perfectly cook. The hype is real and the wait is worth it. Strongly recommended if swinging by little Tokyo.
5/26/2019,20190526,5,4.33,Love this place. The udon is on point and the staff are friendly. I love how even though they may have a long line you are still attended in a timely manner. I definitely recommend this place. The quality is above and beyond.
5/27/2019,20190527,5,4.33,"Sooo delicious! I had the sea urchin udon and the octopus balls. The flavor of both were amazing but the sea urchin udon was absolutely spectacular. First time having sea urchin and I was not disappointed. The wait time was pretty high but it was definitely worth it. They get a lot of traffic coming in and the restaurant itself isn't too big but if you're willing to wait around 30 minutes, you will not be disappointed."
5/27/2019,20190527,5,4.33,"The only negative thing about this restaurant is the wait, there's always a lot of people waiting outside to be seated. I had the seafood tomato cream udon. I was expecting it to be more watery like other udon soups I've had but it had a texture more like a thick tomato soup or creamy pasta sauce. It was unexpected but very good. Inside atmosphere is nice and not too loud even though it's usually full of people. You can also see into the kitchen and how they prepare the udon noodles, which is pretty cool to watch while you're eating. Would recommend trying this place but be prepared to wait outside for a bit."
5/27/2019,20190527,5,4.33,We got there 15 min before 11 on Sunday and were able to be seated on the first round of seating. You will be entertained with watching them making the fresh udon and the uni cream and mentai squid butter udons were wonderful and would be highly recommended. We will definitely be back there again to try other type of udons.
5/30/2019,20190530,5,4.33,I came here with my bf and his friend for dinner because we heard it was a popular Japanese restaurant in Little Tokyo. It was packed and the wait was long but we just walked around to midori matcha to get a snack before we returned and then chatted for a while before we were seated. The server was cheerful and kind and we received our food promptly. Food was delicious - I liked the ankake mushroom soup I ordered and my bf and his friend each ordered the udon gratin. My bf who's French Canadian enjoyed the fusion dish a lot . I'd like to return to try their sea urchin udon at some point!
5/31/2019,20190531,5,4.33,"I LOVE THIS SPOT!10/10This restaurant makes the best udon, they even have a room inside the restaurant where the chefs make the fresh udon so you can watch them make the noodles in front of you while you eat. Also, EVERYTHING tastes phenomenal and you really can't go wrong with anything.Some that I highly highly recommend:===============================1. Sea Urchin Cream Udon - Creamy goodness, thick broth YUM!!!2. Mentai Shiso Cold Udon - Dainty, light and soothing on a hot day3. Spicy Dragon Udon - Not really spicy but the broth has a light kick4. Beef Taitaki - they grate fresh wasabi on top too which balanced the meatThe only downside is the wait, it can be way over an hour easily and there is not much waiting space so first thing you will notice as you walk up to the restaurant is a huge pool of people standing in front of the door. Be prepared for this.Other than that, the Udon here is amazing and try to come when they first open."
6/3/2019,20190603,5,4.33,This place is so yummy! This place doesn't take reservations and the line is rather long but quite good! I arrived at Monzo around 11:30am right when it opened and there was a bit of a line but was able to get in really fast. I ordered the Hot Sansai Udon and my sister ordered the Ankake Mushroom Udon. I love Sansai udon! It's my go-to udon. The vegetables and broth was light but full of flavor. The Ankake Mushroom udon had an interesting flavor and aftertaste but was still quite tasty. The broth was thicker then expected.Highly recommend coming here but be ready to wait outside!
6/3/2019,20190603,4,4.33,Pretty good and creative. The portion was quite small but it was delicious. I had the cream udon and it's basically Alfredo but with udon
6/4/2019,20190604,4,4.33,"Long overdo review, going to keep it short and sweet as everyone knows of the crazy wait and lines intertwining with the ramen spot next door. Come at off peak time as the wait is more bearable and shorter. Noodles are legit and can't be beat. Just like other hand cut noodle restaurants, you can watch em here. Dragon udon was supposedly spicy but we all know it's not spicy. Still good flavor in the broth and noodles are ridiculous."
6/4/2019,20190604,5,4.33,"I think out of the different restaurants where I've tried uni (sea urchin) pasta, this place makes it the best. The sauce is flavorful, the uni tastes fresh, and their noodles are made and cooked really well. The various dishes they offer using udon all look delicious. Along with the sea urchin udon, I would also recommend the udon gratin (unless you don't like cheese). I also really enjoy the crispy chicken skin appetizer. Since the location is small with limited dining space, the main downside is that there is always a wait. Whenever I come, I'm prepared to wait at least an hour, but of course the wait time varies depending on when you go. Parking can also be tough. I usually park on the curb on 2nd St and walk through Little Tokyo to 1st St. Regardless, this is definitely a great place to try!"
6/4/2019,20190604,4,4.33,"Solid place, most of the ingredients are fresh service is excellent! I love the udon so much! Too bad I'm on a low carb diet otherwise I would visit more often. The tempura is spot on! Well cooked in fresh oil!"
6/4/2019,20190604,4,4.33,"The wait wasn't that long when I went. My friend got the uni udon while I got the one with scallops (forgot what it's called). The udon texture was amazing. You even get to watch the chefs make the udon with their hands if you sit at the bar! Service was attentive and friendly. It did have a bit of a wait but I didn't mind. The inside it a little claustrophobic but nothing too bad. I would say that the uni one was a little too buttery/heavy for me so I'm glad I got the scallop one. But if you're into that, this is your dish!! I would definitely come back again."
6/6/2019,20190606,5,4.33,"Absolutely in love with this place, the only complaint I have is that I live far...I wish they open one in Buena Park, so I could go literally EVERYDAY!My favorite is mentaiko udon or pasta, it is very creamy and salty in good state and the noodle is cooked well. Everything just tastes so good!I am definitely going back for weekend dinner!"
6/7/2019,20190607,5,4.33,"Thank God the line at Daikokuya was too long and I was forced to try a new place that's, in my opinion, even better than its neighbor.There's so many options on the menu it's going to take me a while to try them all. I got the seafood tomato udon and omg this is like the perfect combination of Italian and Japanese. The fresh hand pulled udon had a slightly chewy texture and they put in a lot of scallop and shrimp and a little bit of squid. The creamy tomato sauce is so rich and addicting.. after a while it's a bit much but you just can't help but keep eating it.Also tried the squid tempura for $1 which is a steal. It's a huge chunk of squid body with a lightly deep fried tempura batter on the outside. Asked for some tempura sauce on the side it's the perfect little crunch to add to the meal.Friends got the mushroom udon, creamy miso carbonara udon, and cold noodle udon. All looked amazing I only had a bite of the creamy miso and it's another amazing Japanese Italian fusion. Will be back for more soon!"
6/9/2019,20190609,5,4.33,"Marugame Monzo is one of my favorite udon places to go to. The lines do get long during peak hours but if you go when they open, there's no wait. Their service is pretty fast, always refilling waters and making sure the customers aren't waiting too long. I do notice that they bring out the whole party's foods at the same time so no one has to sit and watch their friends eat first lolDefinitely recommend their uni udon, mentai squid butter udon, and the carbonara!! It is a bit pricey for udon but it is SOOOO worth. There's a parking garage across the street in the Little Tokyo plaza (facing shin-shen-gumi) or a $10 parking garage on the other end, facing Weller Court."
6/10/2019,20190610,5,4.33,"Wow!! Place is incredible. I'd found this place on yelp while looking for restaurants to try while in DTLA. I had Udon carbonara and son had beef Udon, so tasty. The place is small and intimate, very close sitting but didn't mind it.There is a waiting period but we'll worth it.Super plus, the staff were so friendly and welcoming, wish they were in the Bay area."
6/13/2019,20190613,5,4.33,I had the sea urchin udon and my wife had the tomato seafood udon. Both dishes were very good. I'm going to try the lunch specials next time. It was very busy at lunch on a Wednesday. Defiantly going back.
6/15/2019,20190615,4,4.33,Did not disappoint. Great ramen. Watching noodles being made was a charming plus. Dragon ramen was delicious. Tempura is small. Toro great. Pork belly rice excellent. Octopus balls great. Agedashi tofu okay. Great meal overall.
6/16/2019,20190616,5,4.33,"The buttered squid udon with mentaiko. Wow. I mean wow! I never had squid like these, the texture and taste was just perfect! I am a mentaiko lover so the sauce really worked for me. My only regret is not getting extra noodles (you can only order the extra when you place the original order). And they have such an interesting menu in general--I definitely want to try something else when I come back to LA!"
6/17/2019,20190617,5,4.33,"While visiting LA for vacation, my friend and I heard this restaurant had amazing udon. It definitely did not disappoint! We only had to wait about ten minutes to get seated even though there was a crowd outside the restaurant. I ordered the miso carbonara udon which was amazing. Not too rich to finish, but still deliciously creamy. It tasted like carbonara with an Asian twist- the sauce definitely tasted like Italian Japanese food I've had in Japan. My friend got the kitsune udon which was very light and flavorful. The udon was perfectly chewy and it was fun to see them hand making the udon in front of us! If I'm ever in LA again, I would definitely stop by again!"
6/18/2019,20190618,5,4.33,"Wow wow wow. What an explosion of flavors in my mouth. This place was amazing. From the fresh noodles to the combination of seafood flavors. People, please don't come here and order the usual, beef, chicken, etc. please try their seafood, sea urchin, squid udons. Promise, you'll never find this anywhere else! I ordered the cream mental udon and i was blown out of the water. We were going to eat at the very popular ramen place next door but switched last minute as they had no seafood choices. Thank you food god. Thank you for showing us the way to this heavenly place"
6/18/2019,20190618,2,4.33,"We went to have a dinner this last weekend. It turned out the food portion was significantly small especially the meat portion. We mentioned that to one of our servers and she said everything was weighted by the scale. However, we knew that the portion of the food was way too small because we were there two months before. The broth still tasted pretty good, but the food portion is small."
6/19/2019,20190619,5,4.33,"Every time I'm in Little Tokyo, I have to get the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. I've also tried the Mentai Squid Butter Udon which is great also, but I'm always going back for the uni. The Negitoro (fatty tuna) Rice Bowl is also a must! Too bad it's such a tiny bowl. If you have a big appetite, one bowl of udon is probably not enough. I was able to finish a bowl when my appetite was small.Prepare to wait because there is always a line and they don't take reservations. Luckily, it's Little Tokyo, so you can check out the little shops nearby while you wait."
6/19/2019,20190619,5,4.33,"Very good udon, selection, and ambience. The restaurant is small so there is often a wait around lunch and dinner time. I ordered the Japanese mountain vegetable udon and it was great!"
6/23/2019,20190623,1,4.33,"As soon as my bf and I took a seat. A bus boy came up to us telling us we can't bring drinks in (we waited 30mins in the heat and next door has tea) we are thirsty so we grabbed a drink next door due to thirst and limited area to stand in the front. The bus boy is extremely rude, louder tone goes ""this time only! No more!"" Like really? And while my bf went to use the restroom, that same guy goes and pushed my bf chair in. Like dude he knows he was sitting right there??? He had like a man bun trying to look like an Asian Justin Bieber.. Everyone else was sweet. Not him. He was loud, and obnoxious. We were just trying to have a nice lunch date, and other people who waited did the same and gotten a drink next door too. Don't see the problem here. He even tried moving our drinks.. kinda weird/rude. Udon was okay.. had better in Hawaii."
6/23/2019,20190623,1,4.33,Waited for an hr. Large table opened up and they broke off tables to accommodate 3 - 2 seaters. Not a place for medium size parties.
6/24/2019,20190624,5,4.33,The food was so good. Best udon I ever had.
6/25/2019,20190625,5,4.33,"If I could eat here for every single meal and not die immediately, I freaking would. THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB DOT COM!!!!!! I get their creamy mushroom udon every single time I go, and want to cry literal tears of happiness at how delicious that menu item is. I absolutely love the mushroom and creamy broth, I always add chicken as well as a tempura egg too! SO so good!!! My family also shares the pork belly and takoyaki appetizer every time too. The wait can be long at times, but it is so worth it. No joke. My mouth is watering thinking about the fresh udon they make in front of you. Ugh, TOO. GOOD."
6/26/2019,20190626,5,4.33,Had the mushroom creamy udon with chicken and my friend had the creamy sea urchin. I thought it tasted like a fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. Thought it was really tasty - albeit a little messy with the sauce splattering when you try to get the noodles. Had the beer and my friend had the green tea. Nice to see Asahi on tap
6/28/2019,20190628,5,4.33,"Reaction: My absolute favorite Udon place, been here well over 10 times.Pros: Udon is handmade in front of you, fresh, and crazy good. Your bowl is customizeable, you can have double portion of udon, add the many many toppings they have, as well as the tempura fried versions of those toppings. Portions are hugely generous, and they have spices and toppings like garlic and seaweed.Cons: Long wait times during lunch and dinner hours (though table turnaround time is quick). Can't accomodate for seafood allergies (all udon is cooked with fish flakes in the broth).Compliments: Tempura toppings (soft boiled egg, chicken, etc.) are amazing, and double portion is perfect for a big eater like me.Complaints: Some of my friends think certain udons like the carbonara and the uni one are too creamy and thick for udon. Also cold udon isn't really my thing.Differentating Point: The most genuine and best udon you can get anywhere near LA.Etc: My go-to is the beef curry udon!"
6/28/2019,20190628,5,4.33,Best place for Udon in Los Angeles hands down. Lots of options. Try the mountain vegetable udon for vegans. Any beef udon for the carnivores. ⁎*
6/29/2019,20190629,4,4.33,It was a forty minutes wait in a Saturday evening. But it worth it. The broth was very special and creamy. But their duck udon and beef rice were just ok. So I only recommend their speciality udon.
7/2/2019,20190702,5,4.33,"This place is amazing! It's my favorite udon spot in LA. It doesn't matter what you get, the noodles are always so chewy. I would recommend the curry udon and the sea urchin cream udon. There's always a line here though, so get ready to wait around 20-30 minutes. The place is pretty small so the seats are quite cramped and close to each other. However, the food is always worth the wait here!"

7/4/2019,20190704,5,4.33,"We ordered two different cream base udon noodles and they were wonderful! The uni one was very flavorful and it wasn't overly salty like how some uni can be. My partner who usually doesn't like udon, actually enjoyed this handmade noodle! It definitely felt like something new and delicious! We would come back whenever we're in LA again."
7/4/2019,20190704,5,4.33,"This is the only restaurant I had to wait in line at while in LA, but the 20 minutes was definitely worth the wait. We arrived at 11:40am on a Monday and the restaurant was already full and there were 4 people ahead of us in line. We glanced at the menu while waiting so we could order as soon as we sat down. We were seated towards the back, which was nice because we were able to watch them make and cut fresh udon noodles. I asked the waiter which was better between the miso carbonara udon and the mentai squid butter udon and he said the mentai, so I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and my mom ordered the Duck Nanban Udon. Both were delicious! You could really taste the difference in their fresh udon and the broth was surprisingly tasty. When I first saw the mentai squid butter udon I was hesitant because it was totally different from what I've ever had or expected, but I really did enjoy it and the squid was good! The duck nanban udon was also tasty and filling. I wouldn't wait to eat here on a regular basis, but I'd certainly visit again to try their unique udon dishes!"

7/6/2019,20190706,5,4.33,This place is real tiny so prepare to wait!! Me and my friends came in a party of 6 and they charge auto 18% gratuity so make sure you know to split up or prepare beforehand. I got the Uni Pasta and it was amazing! The noodles where perfectly silky and the cream sauce was full of flavor and a good consistency. I'm not really a fan of Uni or the Roe on top but it was the most popular on the menu so I figured I would try it. surprisingly I ended up loving it! My bf got the Miso Carbonara Udon and that was even more delicious!!! I wish I had gotten that one instead because it was AMAZING! It didn't taste neither too eggy or miso. It perfectly blended the flavor of Japanese miso and Italian carbonara. My friend had gotten the Udon gratin and that was suuuuper creamy. Honestly it was the most aesthetic with super yummy cheese pulls. My friend had added seafood too. So dank
7/6/2019,20190706,5,4.33,"The udon at this location was amazing, I was a first timer here and it was really crowded initially. But after getting in and receiving our noodle, it was obvious why there was so many people waiting to get in! The creamy sea urchin is their signature dish and it did not disappoint. The roe and the sea urchin eggs were delicious and complimented the creamy sauce and thick udon noodles."

On this occasion my friends and I were in cosplay and thought that we wouldn't stick as much if we were ate Japanese food for dinner. We were wrong, but the other patrons didn't seem to mind our voluminous wigs and vibrant outfits. It just seemed like another day in Little Tokyo. lol Anyways when we got there there were a TON of people waiting outside. However, seats moved rather quickly and about an hour later we were seated. Just be sure to sign your name at the hostess counter!  Udon is made fresh in house and if you have a party of one or two, it's possible to sit at the bar to see it made it front of you. Totally worth the request, but on this occasion I had a party of 4. The service was pretty quick and everyone (except me) demolished their bowl of udon. I ordered a double portion ($2 more for more noodles) and packed the leftovers for the next day. (Tip: ask for two containers one for noodles and one for soup. On the next day I heated up the soup in a pot and threw in the noodles when it was almost boiling just to warm it up).There's so many different broth options and I guess depending on your mood there's something to fit your preference.

Turns out, no surprise to me, I am a ramen person. Marugame's udon is awesome, but to me, the gap between fresh udon and freezer section udon that you cook yourself is just infinitely more narrow than the gap between fresh ramen and commercial ramen you can purchase and prepare.Maybe I'm spoiled because I have access to excellent udon in grocery stores around here, but regardless, when you compare the processes of an udon shop and a ramen shop, the proof is in the pudding. Ramen noodles, once cooked, must be eaten immediately before they start to lose texture. You're supposed to almost burn yourself in the process of rapid and violent slurping. On the flip side, if you watch the line cooks at Marugame, you'll notice they cook the noodles, rinse them and cool them in their constantly flowing sink, and drain them in baskets whilst they await their bowls of broth. Translation: the extremely short shelf life of ramen indicates that unless you have a near-professional set-up at home, you really can only eat the best stuff in a shop. The longer shelf life of udon indicates that it's much easier to hack yourself.All of this is an extremely long-winded way to say that if I have an extra hour in my life, I'll spend it waiting in front of Tsujita before I spend it in front of Marugame Monzo. Relevance? Marugame is directly next door to Daikokuya, half a block from Shin Sen Gumi, and a two minute walk from Men Oh. Not to mention, about a half dozen other very passable ramen shops. So if I have to compare MM to what else is available in the area, there's no contest for me.That's not to say the bowls at MM aren't great. My mentai squid butter udon was very satisfying, the fishy (in a good way) broth lubricating the perfectly chewy noodles. My husband's hot dragon udon was less satisfying, but we probably just should have gone basic and ordered the carbonara or the uni cream. Adding tempura is kind of a must, and the kakiage is the pro move: a tumbleweed of onion and other veg embedded with tiny scallops.And although the wait is long, the throughput is fast, especially since half the parties ahead of you in line will likely be no-shows. I could tell you that Marugame is my favorite udon in town, but that wouldn't mean much, like telling you my favorite minor league baseball player or the best song the Spice Girls recorded after Ginger left. It's fantastic, if you're into that sort of thing. Me? I'll be around the corner, face-deep in a bowl of tonkotsu."

7/8/2019,20190708,4,4.33,"Quick Summary:- Line is long and intimidating, but the pace is pretty fast- Portions are lightWe visited the restaurant, when there was a large event happening in the city, so there was a lot of guests waiting in front. I'm not sure if this is the usual occurrence, or this line only formed due to the convention, but the wait didn't feel too awful. It was around 45-60 minutes. Despite the restaurant's small interior and limited seats, the guests entered and left at a good pace. When we sat down we browsed through the speciality orders over the classic ones. I felt that we can eat the classic ones at other places, and it was the specialties that gathered a lot of the audience. All of the specialty dishes were out of this world and some, since I've been eating classic udon for some time, felt unique to me. After discussing for some time, I ordered the mentai squid butter udon and my relative ordered the ankake mushroom udon. Lots of good things about the mentai squid butter udon. First compliment is that the dish wasn't fishy at all. My relative, who doesn't favor fish dishes, was reeling slightly to the smell of the fish egg, but when they tried it, they were surprised on how the taste had no trace of fish or the grimy sea aftertaste. The squid was so tender and it did felt like I was eating a slice of butter. The mentai fish eggs popped on every chew, and they wrapped and caught well with the udon. Near the end of the eating session, it was hard to scoop up the mentai eggs, so I regrettably left some stuck on the bowl sides. I tried a little bit of the ankake mushroom udon, and this was unique too. However, I would keep my mentai squid order. The overall dish is subtly sweet, and I'm not fond of sweet tastes in savory dishes. In both dishes, the udon is chewy and very bouncy. It requires a good amount of chew, but it is also cooked thoroughly without any toughness. I love udon, so lots of praise. I put the stars to four, only because this has been my first visit, and I would need to try the classics to get my final and true rating."

We had the beef and dipping use on and it was fantastic. There's a few untraditional styles available, which my friends ordered, and they are good. However, I always side with the traditional broths and styles. The seats at the bar faced the kitchen where the noodle making magic can can enjoyably witnessed upon every slurp. Absolutely fantastic!"
7/10/2019,20190710,5,4.33,"We came around 4:30 pm on a Saturday during Anime Expo weekend expecting a huge crowd. The wait actually wasn't too bad.There were several groups of people waiting outside, but some of them were spillovers from Daikokuya. Looking at the waitlist inside, there were 8-10 groups ahead of us. If they call your name three times and your party isn't there, they will move on. This happened to a few of the groups they called so we actually got seated relatively quickly.We sat, ordered, and received our food within 40 minutes of adding our names to the waitlist which was pretty impressive.I tried the miso carbonara udon ($13.75) and mixed tempura ($7.25). Their dinner menu has beef tataki but we came a bit too early for that. Would love to try it next time, though.Miso carbonara udon: If you tend to find good alfredo sauce (not the sad imitations that are more water than cream or cheese) too rich and creamy, this will probably be too rich and creamy for you, but for me it was heaven. It was delicious and flavorful without being salty or too thick. The noodles were just the right texture-- so good you can't complain. I've been thinking about this dish pretty often since my visit and can't wait to eat it again...Mixed tempura: One piece of shrimp, two shiso leaves, one mushroom, a mysterious thing (looked like cut sticks, had a texture between mushroom and yam???), and a squash slice were included. I was sad there was only one piece of shrimp, but it was big. The mushroom was delicious and crazy soft and juicy inside the tempura batter. Would probably just order them on their own if possible."
7/10/2019,20190710,5,4.33,"If I was a wheat noodle kinda gal this would be the place to go...they have hot and cold soba noodle dishes...loved the mini bowl with spicy beef and rice...the broth for the hot soup dishes is off the charts, love the quaint atmosphere and Japanese decor along with the bar seats that invite you into the world of ""how to make Japanese Noodles"" Service was also great minus the fact he forgot our fried calamari"
7/10/2019,20190710,4,4.33,"Last weekend the wife and I drove up to LA to catch the Kaiju and Heros exhibit at JANM. As we pulled in across the street to park we saw a huge line outside thinking that it was for Daikokuya. We then realized it was not only for the ramen shop but also Monzo which is an udon shop. The wife made a split second decision to jump in line and we were able to get the last table for the first seating. Based on yelp reviews we decided to order two of the signature Udon dishes, the sea urchin and the carbonara. We also ordered a mini rice bowl on the side, kakiage and negitoro. The food came out pretty quickly and overall it was a nice meal, never had udon served with a rich and creamy sauce before, very much a fusion dish. Next time we up here, I ill have to dry one of the more traditional udon bowls."

7/12/2019,20190712,5,4.33,"I've been dying to try Marugame Monzo ever since I moved to LA. With law school and other things going on in life, it was hard to find time. I finally moved downtown and decided I HAD to head over. Going on a weekday is a must - I tried to go on the weekend and found myself faced with the option of waiting for hours or going somewhere else. I was too hungry to wait.My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday, and there was a few people on the waitlist ahead of us. The other parties were bigger, so we were seated almost immediately. We looked over the menu as they brought us some waters and sake. I already knew what I was going to get - the sea urchin udon - but we needed to decide on a dish for him. He chose the miso carbonara and we got the negitoro don to share as an appetizer. First of all - the sake was so good. Not too sweet and not too strong. I would definitely buy it again. Next, we got the negitoro don. The fish was really fresh and the sauces all worked well together. There was a really good fish to rice ratio as well, which you don't always see. Finally, our udon came out. Do you know when you've been waiting for something for so long, and then when you finally get it, it doesn't live up to your expectations? This wasn't one of those times. It was so creamy and flavorful and the udon was absolutely perfect. It was amazing. The miso carbonara was good as well, but nothing incredible like the uni udon. The food came out super quick and service was great as well. I can't wait to come back!"
7/12/2019,20190712,4,4.33,Amazing Udon and appetizers. I had the uni udon which was a spiritual experience. so good. The menu is a bit on the pricey side of udon shops.
7/14/2019,20190714,5,4.33,"This place is soooooo good, Ive been wanting to try it out ever since I saw the reviews on yelp. I went on a Saturday around 5pm and there was no wait at all so my friend and I got lucky!I ordered the Sea Urchin Udon & my friend ordered the Carbonara Udon! The sea urchin udon is the most popular item on the menu and I was torn between the uni and squid, but ended up with the uni. The noodles are cooked to perfection and the sauce to noodle ratio was balanced. I also loved the fish roe that was a garnish on top of the dish. The uni itself was not overpowering at all and did not have a huge fishy taste in my opinion it was really worth ordering if you're fond of seafood and uni in generalMy friend ordered the Carbonara, although I liked my seafood one better, his dish also tasted really good. I would recommend this for someone who really likes a creamy a bit more roasted meaty taste. The bacon tasted well with the sauce and udon noodles.The portions are light however, it was enough for the both of us since we had eaten a few hrs before. The food came out quickly and the servers were very attentive and kind. I would definitely come back to try the other items on the menu!"
7/14/2019,20190714,4,4.33,"I decided to stop by Marugame after my uke class since I was in the area. It's always difficult to decide between grilled skewers, ramen/noodles or sushi while in Jtown. All that gluttony!! With the blistering heat- I went with noodles. Instead of the famed sea urchin udon (which is what people usually order), I decided to get a summer item. Udon with mountain yam dipping sauce was the winner since I wanted to try something different and refreshing. It was fun trying to slurp the stringy yam alongside the udon. I'm happy to say that no yam went on my shirt! Next time you're in Little Tokyo...be a little adventurous and try their summer items. Change it up because you won't regret it!"
7/15/2019,20190715,5,4.33,"This place usually has a pretty long wait, but it is SO worth it. The restaurant is a bit tight but honestly it's fine. The service isn't amazing but it is a small restaurant so I didn't expect much. What's great about this restaurant is that they make their noodles in house and they taste amazing. The texture and flavors of their different udon noodles are great. Definitely worth swinging by to check out!"
7/16/2019,20190716,4,4.33,"We came on a random week day for lunch, and the wait was still an hour. It's located in Little Tokyo, so get your name on the list and explore a bit while you're waiting (just make sure you come back in time, or else they'll skip over you).We were seated at an awkward corner of the bar area, which turned out alright because we got to see them making the fresh udon. The restaurant can get pretty stuffy at times, and there's a lot of movement going on. I ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon along with some appetizers. The food came out pretty quick! I was 100000% satisfied with what I ordered. The taste was AMAZING, and the bowls are huge! Oh, and everything was less than $15."
7/16/2019,20190716,4,4.33,I am a ramen person so my review of the udon is probably biased.But is this place good. The chewy noodles and the thick soup allowed the flavor to transfer from the soup onto the noodles. I would recommend ordering double portion...cause after the firat bowl...you would want to get a second.
7/16/2019,20190716,2,4.33,We come with high expectations based on the high review ratings. Unfortunately all dishes we tried taste so bland. The uni udon which is the store signature dish has no taste. The tuna salad wrap and the seafood salad all taste so bland and have no fresh seafood taste at all. I won't recommend this restaurant.
7/17/2019,20190717,5,4.33,"My favorite cream udon place ever! I live in Anaheim and travel over here just to eat lunch for their uni (sea urchin) udon or any of their other creamy udon dishes. I usually do their lunch special where you can add a mini rice bowl for like $4 more. Can only split credit card two ways. Very busy place, Can be a long wait, and restaurant is small and service isn't always the best (servers can seem rushed or a little bit unwelcoming), but the food is totally worth it."
7/17/2019,20190717,5,4.33,A real go to if you love delicious noodles. There is often a line but it's totally worth the wait.
7/19/2019,20190719,3,4.33,"Came to Monzo right before closing on a Tuesday night. The place was starting to empty out, so we were asked to order quickly and order everything we wanted at the beginning. Came here with Mr. Booth after seeing Joywave rock out at the Moroccan Lounge. This was Mr. Booths first time having Udon, and I don't think he was a huge fan. I was expecting it to be more similar to Marukame Udon in Hawaii, but if you think they are the same, they are NOT.Food was good here, but since we were so rushed we quickly ordered and over ordered on the sake and the beer. After finishing my Udon and paying the bill, we realized that we still had a full beer left, and half a bottle of sake. Unfortunately I was done and unable to drink anymore. Mr. Booth chose to be a sissy as well, so we ended up leaving the booze on the table and left.Overall, a good meal, but also not the best Udon I have ever had. It would have been nice if they would have also given us the toppings or spices to add to the Udon. However, since they were closing we were mostly ignored with the hope we would quickly leave. I would rather go to Marukame."
7/19/2019,20190719,4,4.33,"Fair amount of waiting as always. We went at 3pm on a Sunday and it was about a 30 to 45 minute wait for 4 people. The rice bowls were amazing and so full of flavor, but I felt like the udon was only okay this time. The curry udon, for example, didn't have much flavor unless you added a ton of chili to it. The tororo udon dish was also a little tasteless. The udon gratin was definitely great though."
7/20/2019,20190720,4,4.33,"If you're trying to get seated within a reasonable amount of time, you should come right before they open. The restaurant is actually bigger than I expected so it'll fit quite a few groups at opening. I got in line at 11:10 and was able to get seated right as they opened the doors at 11:30. The group in front of us were saying they came the day before and it was over a 2hour wait. That's crazy!F O O DOf course the sea urchin udon is a must try. The broth is extremely thick and creamy that it's almost difficult to scoop sent slurp. I must say that the uni pieces they give you are so miniscule that I wouldn't even count them as uni pieces, but more like leftover crumbs. Nonetheless, the taste of uni is very present and delicious. I love that they make their udon in house and fresh because you can really taste the difference. The Mentai also was surprisingly delicious! It comes with a lot of flavor and squid pieces, but BEWARE! There are little eggs in the dish that WILL get stuck in your teeth! Although everyone in my group came to try the uni udon, the Mentai easily became the table favorite over the sea urchin. S E R V I C Ethey are very quick to bring the food out because most people order their popular dishes. We finished eating within 30 minutes of being seated. They know what they're doing and they do it well. P A R K I N GWe parked across the street and I think you pay per hour so it was $8 since we finished eating so quickly."
7/20/2019,20190720,2,4.33,"We had some delicious food here after a very long wait. I know this place has amazing reviews, and I was super impressed with our food, but EVERYONE in my party got sick. We all had really bad bathroom visits for hours after our lunch. It is really unfortunate that this happened, because the squid butter udon was unique and tasty, and the noodles themselves tasted so good. I usually have a stomach of steel and can eat just about anything, but it really messed with us. I'm sad about it."
7/21/2019,20190721,4,4.33,Came in on a Sunday night and we had to wait for almost an hour. I'd have to say that it's worth the wait because their Miso Carbonara Udon is TO DIE FOR!!! I just think that their serving size is not much. I don't know if they weigh the noodles but I hope they add a little more to even out with the price. Lol anyway it's really good!
7/21/2019,20190721,5,4.33,UNI UDON. ALL I GOTTA SAY. Ok I lie I have more to say but this place is SO delicious. It's definitely a staple in Little Tokyo! The creamy uni udon is this delicious mouth-bomb-explosion of deliciousness. It seems pricy but it's so worth it. They also handcut the udon in-house so if you have a chance to sit at the bar you should! It's entertaining to watch them roll and cut. Takes away from any awk silences you may have on a first date. I also would recommend the mentai squid butter as a second choice if you don't feel like ballin out. Honestly all the options are very good! Don't contemplate on trying this place out. Just do it! NO RAGRETS.
7/21/2019,20190721,4,4.33,"We were so happy to see this place after coming back from Japan and eating at Shin Udon. The food was good, but as as expected. We had the gratin udon, miso carbonara udon, kake and Tofu Mabo udon. We all tasted each other's bowl. This is good prob a 1 time experience and not multiple times."
7/23/2019,20190723,5,4.33,A little place inside Little Tokyo. Some of my friends suggested this place since they visited as well during their LA trips (some even went back to this restaurant twice in 2 days in a row!!!). I highly recommend the carbonara udon. It was creamy enough where it won't have you feeling bloated at the end of the meal. The bacon bits really highlighted the entree. I suggest getting there as soon as the shop opens as the place fills up quick! Definitely one of the best udon places I've been to :)
7/24/2019,20190724,5,4.33,"I'm usually not a huge fan of udon, but the dishes at Marugame Monzo are delicious! I've only been here twice, but everything I've eaten was extremely flavorful. The first time I came here, I waited about two hours because I got caught in their busy dinner hours, but, on my most recent trip, I came right when they opened for lunch and only waited about 20 minutes. My suggestion would be to come early to beat the crowd and, if you do have to wait, you could easily pass the time by visiting the many shops in the surrounding area.The dishes I've had here are the mentai squid butter udon and the mushroom cream udon with chicken. The mentai squid butter came with pieces of squid and bits of fish roe on top of a creamy, buttery sauce. The mushroom cream udon had a variety of different mushrooms mixed in with the creamy sauce. You get a choice of adding chicken or seafood for an additional cost, so I opted with the chicken. Both dishes were extremely creamy, rich, and flavorful.Marugame Monzo is definitely worth giving a try. Although the wait time can be a bit crazy, I honestly believe their food is worth the wait."
7/24/2019,20190724,4,4.33,The udon gratin was so good and had a lot of cheese (see pictures) but after a few bites it was too heavy for me... took me two meals to finish this delicious monstrosity
7/25/2019,20190725,5,4.33,"Favorite udon place, they never disappoint. Never had a problem with any of their food here. Only recommendation is to remember to put in that extra noodles whenever you order your udon"
7/25/2019,20190725,5,4.33,"Let me start by saying that I don't order beef or pork broths and I've been trampled on time and time again by udon and ramen places that serve me basic miso/soy sauce broths. Not at Marugame Monzo. The fish-based broth (dashi) is so flavorful and umami that I had to ask my waiter several times whether it had beef bone in it or not. Give me the honest answer, guy! But yeah, from what I understand the dashi broth has fish flakes and kelp in it so it's pescatarian-friendly. Honestly, if I find out one day that the broth is actually made from baby cow tears and pig's blood I would probably still eat it. There's also vegetarian and vegan options, I believe, and given the quality here, I would trust those. I ordered the seafood tomato cream udon and let me tell you, I was initially a little nervous at that combination of words. When it came, however, it was rich, creamy, and mouth watering. I'm honestly spacing out and daydreaming about that dish as I write this review. It was like pasta and udon joined hands and transcended our plane of conscience. We had to wait about 40 minutes, but I would say it was well worth it. I came with a large party and there was no talking during the meal, just slurping and grunting. I take it they liked their meals too."
7/27/2019,20190727,4,4.33,"The line for this place can get pretty insane but if you're willing to wait, the food is pretty good.FOOD 4/5: I got the sea urchin udon and my friend got the miso carbonara udon. They were both very creamy and flavorful. You can really taste the uni - a little overpowering, but is balanced with the creaminess and thickness of the udon. We also ordered the negitoro bowl and the ikura bowl. Portions were a little small for the price, but both tasted very good!SERVICE & AMBIENCE 4/5: Efficient service and nice interior. PRICE 4/5: It is pricey, but that's expected because of the uni."
7/29/2019,20190729,5,4.33,"Although there's usually always a wait here it's worth it. The noodles are firm and slurpy, the soup is so savory. I've had the carbonara udon before which is delicious but isn't very traditional and not always worth getting if you're in the mood to try true udon. This go around I got the hot beef udon and it did not disappoint, my friends around me wish they had gotten mine as it's not as heavy as the cream based signature dishes.Monzu is so worth the wait, I've never had a bad time here and you can't go wrong with any of the dishes."
7/29/2019,20190729,5,4.33,"I love udon so hearing about this place already drove me more nuts than I can ever get about food. The udon is homemade and made in front of all the customers! I recommend trying out their signature udon as that's what they specialize in. My boyfriend and I tried the Hot Dragon Udon and Mushroom Cream Udon. My boyfriend enjoys spicy and he was amazed by the presentation of how it came out too. I got the mushroom cream and my... oh boy... the cream. I love it. I even tried drinking the leftover cream since I basically ate everything. It was SO good. The udon was perfectly al dente. The table next to us also got A BUNCH of jumbo shrimp tempura and they smelled so good. I'm definitely coming back to try more of what they have to offer. I've heard that they're Sea Urchin Udon is also very creamy and delicious. I didn't mind waiting a couple of minutes... (30-45 minutes) since it was across the street from Little Tokyo Plaza; however, do come back in time since you have to sign up physically on a piece of paper. The interior is also small and the table are close to each other so it might feel a bit clustered; however, the food makes up for everything!! So good!!! I understand why this place is rated so high!"
7/30/2019,20190730,2,4.33,"Don't waste your time in line. Not sure why Marugame Monzo has all this hype. Yes, the udon noodles has great texture. Yes, you can see the magic of the creation of these noodles. However, the broths for both udon bowls were subpar. The uni udon broth was really creamy, and didn't really complement the uni well. The beef udon's broth was just mediocre and not outstanding, which is what I expected with all the hype around this place. I'm actually starting to wonder if I went to the wrong uni udon place in LA, if so would someone please redirect me? The tempura was decent. But it's rare that tempura can even be messed up in the first place. Overall, the udon seemed way overpriced for what it is. Tip: no outside food or drinks, so we chugged our drinks before heading in. However, the table next to us seem to have purchased milk tea from the place next store and seemed like the staff was nice enough to hold it somewhere for them."
7/30/2019,20190730,5,4.33,"The Nazi Foodist grants a 5-star review to this restaurant. From traditional to modern Udon, this place has it on lock! Amazing food. Amazing service. No need to say anything more."
8/2/2019,20190802,1,4.33,terrible restaurant，there is a pubic hair in the dish， it is make me want to vomit. the manager even not feel shame about it. scurviness！
8/2/2019,20190802,5,4.33,Ok... 4 years later I am changing my review. I think their service has improved alot and food has remain delicious! I love the texture of the udon noodles! and the broth is amazing! Will be coming back soon!
8/2/2019,20190802,5,4.33,"A great 5 star hotel, good and amazing food, classy waitresses and also gives you value for your money. Went here on a date and the experience was not disappointing, it is a place I would recommend to anyone anytime."
8/2/2019,20190802,5,4.33,"Bless, finally found a place that just sell udon noodles! Dreams really do come true, I've been waiting and searching and sadly barely found out about this place! I've first heard about this place from JKnews team on YouTube where they first did like a few episodes where they went on food adventures, just go on utube and type in ""jknews udon noodles"" LOL, first vid . ANYWAYS , Came right when they opened at 5 so got seated right away, it's not that big nor small, service was great, attended to your needs and concerns right away. You get to see chefs making the noodles behind the glass window they have in the middle of the shop and there are seatings around there as well. I ordered the gratin? Udon which is a cheese cream based noodles , very delish but slightly heavy (expected) noodles were bouncy and thick. My friend he got the mushroom udon, TO MY SURPRISE it was soo good and I highly recommend trying that as a first timer JUST because I feel as if that's the epitome of an OG udon dish but just amped up. You barely taste the mushroom taste so all the mushroom Haters can't even hate , broth was packed with flavor but also very light and not salty at all and just perfect for a hot summer day. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"

8/3/2019,20190803,5,4.33,Best udon in little Tokyo! The establishment is quite small and we were welcomed to a 30 minute wait. Unfortunately they don't let you call ahead so that was a bummer. However service is fast once you are seated! The udon broth is magnificent! I ordered the seaweed udon and it felt like the perfect amount of food as it wasn't too heavy!I suggest putting your name down and then walking around or finding something to do as there is usually a wait during peak hours. The menu is diverse and has options for everybody!
8/3/2019,20190803,4,4.33,"I'm always debating whether to go to Marugame Monzo or Daikokuya, but lately, I've been really feeling Marugame Monzo (especially since they take cards). Love the curry udon! Wish they made a legit vegetarian udon though."

The place is really teeny and we got there right before dinner traffic, when we left there was a line out the door and it makes sense why, so goooood!! I went with my family, party of 4, we ate at the bar and it was cool to watch the cooks prepare the fresh noodles."
8/4/2019,20190804,4,4.33,"I love udon so we came here to try to see what all the hype was about and man were we pleased. Ordered their signature miso carbonara and the udon with braised pork. They were both sooo good! The bowls are big but the portions are just right. The meat literally just melted in your mouth. I love have this carbonara didn't have peas actually and because it's with miso, it was ""lighter"" than the typically creamy carbonara sauce which I prefer. Price was a bit expensive at 14$ for a bowl and the wait is insane. Thus I docked one star but enjoyed the food otherwise and would recommend!"

8/10/2019,20190810,5,4.33,I followed this homemade udon place from Yelp and it is a good good decision. The service was super nice . The homemade udon is so soft and tastes just perfect. The best cold udon I have ever had from my life. Highly recommended for noodle lovers.

8/10/2019,20190810,5,4.33,My favorite udon spot in LA! Been coming since they opened. The curry udon is INCREDIBLE
8/11/2019,20190811,5,4.33,"We stumbled upon this place by accident as were looking for Daikokuya and accidently waited in line for Monzo (the signs outside aren't super clear and both restaurants have people waiting outside!). Only were we seated and the menu put in front of us did we realize we were at a different restaurant. This turned out to be a good mistake as I'm a fan of udon just as much as I'm a fan for ramen.We were seated in front of the kitchen which was cool as there was a glass window where we could watch the chefs prepare. The first thing I noticed when opening the menu were their signature udon dishes such as the miso carbonara udon and sea urchin cream udon. I asked the waitress which was the most popular dish and she mentioned the sea urchin cream, which is what I ordered.I was pretty happy with the dish although I have to mention I was surprised the signature dishes are more like a pasta than udon - essentially pasta sauce with udon instead of pasta. The sea urchin cream udon was (as you'd expect) extremely creamy and full of flavor. There were a few sea urchins in the dish as toppings which was nice. Overall I'd recommend Monzo but if you're expecting a hearty soup noodle, stick with the traditional udon options they offer. If you're up for something different, go with the signature dishes!"
8/11/2019,20190811,5,4.33,This place is my favorite udon place. Everything I've had was absolutely fantastic. I recommend the rice bowl combo with the udon for lunch! It's really good and you can't beat the price! Line gets long but you can put your name down and come back later!
8/12/2019,20190812,3,4.33,"Came here for lunch on a weekday and was blown away by how long the line was... really?! For a party of 3, we waited about 30-35 minutes- had to keep running to our parking meter to add more time. Aside from that, once we were seated, the service was top notch and quite efficient. We were seated by the kitchen, so it was fun to see the chefs in action. A very hot summer day, I got the cold Bukkake ramen hoping to feel refreshed. I have to say that I was not super impressed with my dish at all. Sure, the ramen was chewy and super fresh, but other than that, there was no flavor to my dish despite using all the sauce that comes with it. I wasn't a super big fan of the mushy radish in particular. I got to try my cousin's carbonara ramen, which tasted 100x more flavorful and more delicious, so I guess I will have to come back to try that next time I am around..."
8/13/2019,20190813,4,4.33,"Best Udon Ever!First time coming to Marugame Monzo. Their specialty is udon which they make the noodles in house. I wasn't lucky enough to be seated at the bar to see the chefs make the noodles in front of you. Marugame Monzo is located on First Street next to Daikokuya. There's more people waiting at Daikokuya (just an observation). I ordered the spicy udon and a side bowl of tuna bowl. (Sorry I forgot the name). The bowl was super delicious but a bit expensive. The udons were heavenly delicious and soft. The broth was above average in my opinion. It's on the lighter side. If you want the best udon ever, definitely try this place out!"
8/13/2019,20190813,5,4.33,"I'm not big on udon, but Marugame Monzo changed my whole outlook on it and now I'm a fan! I've heard this place gets pretty packed so I was already expecting to wait a while, but luckily our party of 4 was seated in 20mins. We sat right in front of the bar where they make the noodles, which made the experience even better. I ordered the vegeta""ful"" udon and it was seriously amazing! It was a huge bowl filled with all kinds of veggies, udon, and the most mouth-watering broth ever. Even my friends (who are huge meat eaters) couldn't believe how delicious the veggie broth was. Can't wait to come back!"
8/14/2019,20190814,4,4.33,"Came in here for lunch and got in here a minute before they opened at 11:30am, so there was no wait. This place tends to be packed but customers also eat relatively fast and leave.You can watch a worker make fresh Udon from the glass window inside the restaurant. I ordered the Carbonara Udon and my friend ordered the beef Udon.The noodles are delightful. The flavor of the beef broth is delicious and light. The Carbonara sauce, though the waiter did warn me, is heavy and thick in cream. The portion size seemed more on the small size, but I liked the authenticity of the hand made noodles. There is no restaurant parking, however, there is a private parking lot across the street you can pay for. It's also conveniently located in J-town for sightseeing.Overall, its a great little restaurant to get fresh, hand made Udon, I just wish the portion size was larger."
8/14/2019,20190814,4,4.33,This place was extremely tasty. It's located in Little Tokyo so of course parking is a little hard to find and you also have to pay for parking. The wait was 15 minutes for a party of 2 which isn't bad at all considering they're usually pretty busy and the restaurant space is small. The staff is friendly and the food comes out really quick as well. The uni udon is definitely the winner for me. The cream sauce was so flavorful and buttery. I thought that they gave a good amount of uni for that price and the ikura was definitely a nice touch as well. The udon gratin was a little heavy for me. It was so cheesy that you get mouthfuls if cheese which is a little hard to eat. I probably wouldn't order that entree again but it was definitely cool to try it. The tempura is really fresh and a good size as well. Definitely come check them out :)
8/14/2019,20190814,5,4.33,"Solid!!!! We are so happy! Marugame is legit! We've wanted to come by for a few years now but have avoided it because of the long wait (it's quite small inside). However all the stars aligned and although we didn't plan on going, there was no line when we walked by on a Sunday (about 15 minutes after they opened) so we went in and were sat immediately at the last available table! The service is friendly and very efficient- we actually took a long time to order because we were sharing and super indecisive. We ended up with the beef udon (hot) combo with the pork belly rice. We got the double portion of udon which is a lot of food for two people (better off with a single portion unless you both are starving). Everything was delicious! The consistency of the noodles were perfect and the broth was well-balanced. The rice bowl was salty, savory, and fatty. We loved all of it! Can't wait to come back!"
8/16/2019,20190816,4,4.33,"Pro tip: come in a party of 2 and get seated right away! (Not actually a pro tip) But actually though, came around 1 PM with just one other person and despite there being a waiting list, we were able to get seated instantly. Sucks that the Signature Udon bowls don't offer the Double Portion for $2 or the side of rice at lunch ): My boyfriend and I ended up splitting the Miso Carbonara which was very interesting but still very good. Reminded me very much of a creamy pasta. We instinctively kept calling the broth ""sauce"" instead of broth LOL. Came out to about $15 + $2 in tip which seems like a fair price for a bowl of udon at a popular restaurant. We were seated by the bar where we got to watch a worker hand pull the udon noodles which was very neat!Would want to come back and try other bowls if I were ever in the area again (:"
8/16/2019,20190816,1,4.33,"Got the hot dragon udon and it was extremely salty, after speaking to the waiter and asking if I can get a little extra plain broth he insisted that I replace my entire bowl. He recommended the tempura udon so I sent mine back to get the tempura udon without the flakes in the soup. When the udon came out it didn't come with the shrimp tempura on the side like a ""tempura udon"" should have. I asked the waitress about the tempura shrimp I was supposed to receive and she was like ""you're not understanding and its your fault. You ordered it wrong."" Her tone got hostile and undermining, making it such an uncomfortable situation for our table to continue eating. We each had about a bite of our food and had to leave. We didn't touch the eggs or the tempura yet they charged us for everything and the lady did not apologize for speaking to us in a rude manner or the entire ""misunderstanding"" as a whole. However, the waiter who originally replaced our order came out and was so polite and apologetic towards us, admitting that there was a miscommunication whereas the waitress who intervened was still aggressive even though she said herself she didn't know what was going on."
8/16/2019,20190816,2,4.33,"Food is good, but the hostess has a real attitude problem. If we could bypass her and then get our food directly, this place would be perfect. She is arguing with another customer as I am posting this, I'm scared."
8/16/2019,20190816,1,4.33,"We were so excited to eat here today and once we got our food one of the orders ended up being way too salty despite the sea urchin and tempura udon being great. The third udon was so salty to the point of being inedible and we asked for additional broth to dilute the saltiness. The worker insisted on replacing the bowl and we were so appreciative of his tableside manner. We replaced the hot dragon with another ""tempura udon without tempura flakes in the broth"" but keeping everything else the same. However when the new bowl came out they forgot the protein part of the meal which would be the two tempura shrimps on the side. We asked the closest hostess if she could call the waiter over so we could ask about the protein portion of the udon. She refused to call him over and tried to settle it herself while telling us ""its your fault you didn't order it right"" after going back and forth with her we lost our appetite due to the rude service and condescending tone so we cancelled the third udon. She then proceeded to tell us we weren't understanding her but also she's she was confused herself. We just asked for the original waiter to come back and when he did he apologized for misunderstanding what we ordered and offered to bring it out, simple as that, no verbal aggression and no demeaning attitude. The hostess continued to stick by our table speaking with her hands while waving it around about an inch away from my face which was very uncomfortable. Of the three of us, one of us didn't get a chance to eat at all after waiting in line and the two of us got about a bite in without touching our extra eggs or the tempura shrimp and we had to leave due to the hostile hostess and the extremely unwelcoming service we received from her. I suspect there has been many more instances similar to ours however people don't speak up due to the rushed atmosphere and pressure to quickly eat and get out as well as the hype of the restaurant itself. We received no apology from the hostess but rather just blame as if the food coming out wrong was our fault."
8/18/2019,20190818,4,4.33,"I've never been a big udon fan...until I went to Marugame Monzo. The one thing that always threw me off about udon was the texture, this restaurant has been the only udon that I liked (and the only udon that I crave). Funny enough, it's one of my favorite restaurants in little Tokyo :) Brought my family here today, it was their first time and everyone loved it! My dad and sister both got the carbonara udon, which I thought was really unique! I didn't expect udon to be put into a creamy broth... or for it to taste so delicious!My usual order here is the uni udon. It's very heavy and very filling, but also very delicious.Service here does feel a little rushed though, other than that, everything else is great :)"
8/18/2019,20190818,5,4.33,"Every time I've come here, I arrive right when it opens so I've never had to wait too long. As a vegetarian, I've had the mushroom cream udon, the cold sansai udon, and hot sansai udon. The hot sansai was my least favorite of the three (though still good) because I thought the pickled vegetables were a bit sour. The mushroom cream was really delicious and flavorful, and the cold sansai was refreshing. I don't think I can ever get tired of coming here!"

8/18/2019,20190818,3,4.33,"A little disappointed. The Uni Udon barely tasted like uni. It's just some cooked uni in carbonara sauce, but the carbonara sauce overpowers the cooked uni. Would've been better if they blended raw uni into the sauce instead. Girlfriend got the miso carbonara udon... also slightly let down, didn't really have a taste of miso.The Miso and the Uni udon tasted almost the same except the miso one had hint of bacon because of the bacon pieces in it and the Uni has a hint of Uni for the same reason.Definitely wasn't worth $20 for the Uni one.However it was overall delicious, just wasn't what I expected. I wouldn't wait here for an hour for this, maybe for the traditional udon they have, but I probably wouldn't come back.Don't get me wrong. The food is good, people. Just don't expect the Uni udon to have a strong flavor like it would if you had it in sushi form. Maybe like 10-15% flavor. Maybe someone else had a different experience."

8/18/2019,20190818,4,4.33,"Came to the little Tokyo location several times already, finally getting around to the review.This place would probably be a full 5 stars except that there are some inconveniences that limits its upside for me. Pros:- Food is very very good. My favorite is the flying tiger cold noodles and it has never failed me. My wife prefers the Sea Urchin backed udon, and that one is also amazing if you are looking for a more creaming experience.- The portions initially don't see like they are significant, but as you get through it, it is very filling. Cons:- Parking is difficult to find. I typically park in the hotel parking lot beside Marugame, however it is a hassle to get in and the park fees eventually add up. - The location is extremely popular so unless you get in line before they open for lunch or dinner, then expect lengthy wait times. Overall, this has consistently been a place that I would take my out of town friends to enjoy. However it is hard to make it my personal go to place due to the inconveniences."
8/18/2019,20190818,4,4.33,Awesome udon and good service. The only drawback is the arduous long wait as demand overwhelms the number of seats available. Parking is also challenging as it's in the heart of Little Tokyo.
8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.33,"I've been wanting to try the creamy udon varieties here for so long but 1) little Tokyo scares me with their tough parking situation and 2) the line here has always been intimidating. However, when my friends and I decided to spend the day in the area to shop and eat anyway, we braved the crowd and put our name down for Marugame Monzo. -Recommendations/what I got: *Udon Gratin w/seafood (+$2) and chicken: hot gooey cheese that is definitely cheese and noodle pull worthy for all your glamour food shots. *Butter Mentai Squid Udon: more of a soup Udon than the rest of the dishes we got but good, buttery seafood flavor. I enjoyed the fish/squid eggs as well as the perfectly cooked squid pieces. Typically some places have lower quality, chewier squid but Monzo's is soft and plump. *Miso Carbonara Udon: the bacon pieces were thinly sliced and essential for carbonara but maybe pork belly would make an interesting addition to the dish. The creamy sauce had a sweet and savory flavor to it. The noodles were fresh and perfectly chewy. You can tell love was put into them as you see the kitchen staff roll and cut the dough right in front of you!-Menu: they have a good mix of ""classic"" udon choices, these specialty seafood udons, appetizers and other traditional Japanese fare -Price: $12-14 for the dishes we got, the classic udons are normally priced at less than $10 per bowl. Portions are big enough to share too! -Atmosphere/Location: small restaurant and huge popularity makes for a packed house every time but the tables are a comfortable size. You do have to wait outside as there's no room at the front of house. You also pay at the front register. -Service: the staff was kind and courteous, updating us on our wait time and offered us menus outside so we could decide on our food before being seated. Luckily we only waited 45 minutes on a Saturday evening because we put our name down around 6 pm? I think when we left an even bigger group formed outside. Not to be confused with it's less unique (yet somewhat satisfying nonetheless..) fast food style colleague: Marugame Udon. The latter simply doesn't have the reach. Carbs? Never heard of them. Do yourself a favor and try their specialties!!!"

8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.33,"Who ever thought that chicken carbonara could be morphed into a udon soup!!?? Well here at Marugame Monzo they do just that, and it was amazing.

We were lucky enough to sit at the bar facing the kitchen where we could see noodles being made!"

Yes it's a little pricey for udon but the variety and the fact that they are freshly made on site makes it worth a visit. The side rice you can get is a little underwhelming but the udon is the star. We will be back to eat our way through the menu"
8/20/2019,20190820,4,4.33,"Came here for lunch while on a Monday afternoon and there was a small line formed when we arrived. It took about 15 minutes to get seated and food arrived fairly quickly. The restaurant is pretty small so if you come with a large party, it may take a while for you to get seated. I ordered the Curry Udon and while it was good, I didn't expect the broth to be so thick. I've had curry based broth before but this was more like noodles in curry sauce. Nonetheless, it was still very good. The noodles are all hand made which I loved. I tried some of my friend's broth (he ordered the Udon with tempura chicken) and it was light yet flavorful. Next time I come back I'll stick with the traditional Udon."

8/22/2019,20190822,5,4.33,"It was relatively easy to get a table for 2 on Wednesday evening, we came around 7:00 for dinner. You put your name down and wait outside for them to call you, we probably only waited around 10 minutes for our table! We were seated at the bar so we got to watch them make the udon fresh! They seem to have logistics down pat here because we probably only waited about 10 mins for our udon to come out after ordering. I got the Miso Carbonara and it was deliciously creamy, exactly what you thought udon with carbonara sauce tastes like except the miso really pulls it all together. Be careful when handling your udon as the cream sauce can splash if you're not careful! My friend got the cold beef ramen and she said hers was delicious as well!"
8/22/2019,20190822,5,4.33,"This place is a gem in Little Tokyo - the udon is chewy, dense, and overall amazing. The Miso Carbonara is to die for and the Chicken Udon is delicious - strongly recommend."

Both my husband and I were sorely disappointed. I give them points for accommodating are stroller since we had our newborn with us and they actually had room at one particular table where we didn't need to leave the stroller at the door and carry the carseat. I fully expected to collapse and leave the stroller. I ordered the udon gratin and my husband ordered a pork belly udon combo with tempura rice bowl. All of the food was mediocre. Nothing. special. at. all. The gratin had dry chunks of unseasoned chicken breast that was probably boiled to death before mixed in with the cream sauce that was watery and not very tasteful. My husband's udon broth was very basic, a bit too salty, and the meat was tasteless. We expected the pork belly to be thinly sliced tender meat like it typically is with ramen - it was about a 2"" x 2"" chunk of tasteless meat. We went on a Friday around 11am and got seated right away. If I had to wait in the usual crowd, I would have been even more upset with the food."

It's hard to describe but you'll know it when you taste it. We didn't try any of the creamy udon as they seemed too rich. We also got tempura and fried calamari appetizers which I wouldn't recommend. The batter was soaked in grease. All I could taste was grease. Regardless, I give this place 5 stars because I came for the udon and it was fantastic. There is a parking structure around the corner for like $2. If you park on the street, the metered parking is quite expensive."

Things move very quickly here, and everyone was very pleasant. +1 Pricing is pretty reasonable. You get what you get...+10 Udon is really good! I can see why people enjoy this.-1 Portion size a bit too small for my liking...We ended up getting:1) Miso Carbonara Udon ($13.75) // I like this one the most. Probably because the flavors were more familiar...The ""soup"" was very thick- more like a dipping sauce/curry type than anything. 2) Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($17.95) // Yum! Allen is not a huge sea urchin person, but he really enjoyed this dish. It's a bit pricey imo, considering we got such little amount of urchin. However, flavor was well integrated. Sauce is the same situation as the miso carbonara. 3) Bukkake Udon ($8.25) // a cold udon that Hurnan ordered. Sadly it did not look as appetizing as the rest of ours. It also seemed a bit flavorless...(check out her review lol)OH YES. The rice bowl with pork belly was REALLY delicious! One downside is that they don't have an option for extra udon?! (Can someone correct me if I'm wrong?) I would eat their udon plain- it's that good! Overall, I would come here again! But not wait in line that long...in the 90+ weather heat..."

I can see why people enjoy this.-1 Portion size a bit too small for my liking...We ended up getting:1) Miso Carbonara Udon ($13.75) // I like this one the most. Probably because the flavors were more familiar...The ""soup"" was very thick- more like a dipping sauce/curry type than anything. 2) Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($17.95) // Yum! Allen is not a huge sea urchin person, but he really enjoyed this dish. It's a bit pricey imo, considering we got such little amount of urchin. However, flavor was well integrated. Sauce is the same situation as the miso carbonara. 3) Bukkake Udon ($8.25) // a cold udon that Hurnan ordered. Sadly it did not look as appetizing as the rest of ours. It also seemed a bit flavorless...(check out her review lol)OH YES. The rice bowl with pork belly was REALLY delicious! One downside is that they don't have an option for extra udon?! (Can someone correct me if I'm wrong?) I would eat their udon plain- it's that good! Overall, I would come here again! But not wait in line that long...in the 90+ weather heat..."
8/31/2019,20190831,4,4.33,"This is udon refined. Reimagined. Reconceptualized. A bowl of it makes a good, homey meal... but for those willing to expand their horizons and taste wheat flour noodles like never before, Monzo is the place. It's a small shop in Little Tokyo, right next to Daikokuya. Parking in the area is not the best; there is a paid lot on 1st & Judge John Aiso Street, and meters if you're lucky. We came on a Saturday evening around 6, and the wait was about 20 minutes. The bar seating has a cool view into the kitchen, where you can see them prepare and cut the dough. They have both hot udon and cold udon options. Some of the more popular ones include miso carbonara, sea urchin, and mentai squid butter udon. For those not feeling too adventurous, they offer beef and shrimp tempura udon. Double portion is +$2, which can only be ordered in the beginning. I recommend it, they don't give a lot of udon. You can also order toppings like boiled eggs, vegetables, and tofu. Other menu options include alcohol and rice bowls.The Mentai Cream is udon with white cream sauce topped with greens and fish eggs. Basically tasted like alfredo. I enjoyed the noodles a lot, they had a smooth and chewy texture. Came out hot and fresh. The scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly, and added variety to the dish. Left wanting more. Zaru is a cold udon accompanied with a dipping broth. They instruct you on how to eat it, which is nice because I would've probably poured it into the bowl and douse the noodles. Personally, a traditional bowl of udon is satisfying for me. But dinner was worth the wait and parking struggles. Marugame Monzo is an experience like no other, with their creative offerings and solid noodle making."
8/31/2019,20190831,5,4.33,"This place is amazing and offers some of the best udon in town. The broth is extremely creamy and rich (at least for the sea urchin which is roughly $18) and I hear that their noodles are made in house. Nothing but good things to say about the service here. My girlfriend is allergic to shellfish and the server was super helpful in letting us know and making sure that she was good to get a bowl (they use fish broth). During lunch hours, they have a lunch special in which you can get a rice bowl (with the option of meat included in the bowl, such as pork belly) for an additional $4. Parking isn't the easiest but there are lots around. Be aware of long lines. While we only had to wait, I know that it can get nasty"

It's busy on the weekends for sure.Wife had the Beef Rice Bowl... I had the Tuna Rice Bowl...and we split the Butter Udon /Seafood broth.Really great. We sat up at the kitchen and got to see the big make some Udon by hand. Pretty cool.

9/1/2019,20190901,5,4.33,"I loved marugame monzo! One of the few udon places I've had in LA because I normally go for ramen, but this was such good udon :)) it was so flavorful and the noodles were soft, which I liked a lot, because that's how I prefer them.I got the Squid Butter udon and it was rlly buttery. My friend got the carbonara, and she really enjoyed hers as well. The fusion was unique, and I'll definitely be back for more."
9/2/2019,20190902,5,4.33,"Hands down the BEST udon in LA and Orange County!!!!The undisputed heavy weight champion of udon is Marugame Monzo! Handcut udon, not machine made. Tasty and perfectly chewy without being tough or hard. Delicious flavor; try the uni. Go inside and put your name on the list. Be patient...they will get you in ASAP. Can't wait to come back!!!!!!"
9/2/2019,20190902,5,4.33,"This place never disappoints, you'll wait in line, but nothing beats fresh cooked food. The Udon is to die for, pork belly melts in you're mouth. One of my top tens!"
9/2/2019,20190902,5,4.33,Best place to take first timers. It's an experience to see them make the noodles at the bar. I highly recommend getting the cream based noodles it's like eating Alfredo pasta but Japanese style. Also a tempora boiled egg on the side hits the spot!
9/2/2019,20190902,5,4.33,Amazing food. Felt rushed but it's a small place. They already have the bills printed by the time you order.

9/3/2019,20190903,5,4.33,"One of the best restaurants in Little Tokyo! I absolutely love that there are so many things to order on their menu despite being an udon speciality restaurant. I definitely want to recommend their mentai cream udon but if it's a hot summer, go for their cold bukakke udon~. Double portion is only 2 dollars more so you can take advantage of that too. We came straight at 5 and there was a line but it quickly disappeared as everyone was seated. We were eating by 5:20 so it's not a bad wait at all if you go right when they open."

9/4/2019,20190904,5,4.33,"A perfect twist on udon is what this place is; it's a little hard to find but they have a black banner hanging if that helps. Located in little tokyo, this small restaurant has many creative interpretations of creamy udon. The sea urchin one ($17.95) was decadent, as well as the miso carbonara which comes with bacon ($13.95). It's filling since it's so creamy and rich, but it's delicious. I'm definitely coming back to try other flavors."
9/4/2019,20190904,5,4.34,"Really impressed with the taste, speed, and efficiency of this restaurant. Unlike many other restaurants in Little Tokyo or even K-town, they have not resorted to using Yelp waitlist. It's a good old-fashioned pen and paper waiting list here. Go early to wait, they open at 11:30 and the line builds fast give how small the restaurant is. My party of there was the first seated and we arrived to wait in line at 11:00. Service was prompt and no-fuss and our order was taken immediately. We ordered tempura shiitake mushroom and eggplant, agedashi tofu, two of the mini dons (toro and ikura), a special cold udon with Japanese yam, and finally the house special uni cream udon.Food came out promptly but we were entertained by the live noodle making. Udon isn't like Chinese hand pulled noodles and is actually hand cut/sliced. It was cool watching the process happen in front of us and not gimmicky. The tempura was okay, the batter was not as crispy as I would have liked, but the dipping sauce was excellent. Agedashi tofu was crispy and a good starter.The mini dons (rice bowls) that we ordered with our lunch specials were so underrated! The rice was hot and seasoned with sweet vinegar and the accompanying toppings were tasty and fresh. We enjoyed the toro don so much we ordered a second one. The dons really are mini but I think $6 for an individual don (not with lunch special) is super reasonable.The udon is obviously good. There are 3,000 other reviews that tell you that. Udon cream udon is truly one of my favorite dishes ever. The flavors are delicate - garlicky without overpowering the mild and sweet taste of the uni. Eat it fast so that the uni doesn't overcook! Loved the ikura touch on top - both as beautiful garnish and a fun textural component. The uni cream pasta is one of my favorite noodle dishes, hands down.The special cold udon with Japanese yam is a take on the traditional Japanese soba with yam. The udon texture was crucial here since the sauce was much lighter and milder than that of the uni cream udon. Again, it did not disappoint. Be forewarned, Japanese yam is very slimy and some might not enjoy the snot-like texture. Overall, the udon is tender and chewy, just as it should be. Order the uni cream udon and a toro don, you will never be disappointed."

9/5/2019,20190905,5,4.34,"Be prepared to wait! You'll know you've arrived if there's a small crowd outside, but the line moves quickly and the restaurant is very efficient at seating and serving people. I ordered the Miso Carbonara Udon and it was delicious! It was rich and creamy and the udon noodles were probably the best I've ever had. You could tell they were freshly made by their texture. My mom ordered the mixed tempura and the order seemed a little small, but it was freshly prepared and piping hot when it landed on the table. Our table also ordered the duck udon (delicious broth and again, those delicious udon noodles) and the tempura udon (classic flavored broth, nothing to write home over, but those udon noodles!). Would definitely come here again-it was well worth the wait! (Plus if it's a hot day, there's a bubble tea shop next door you can grab a drink at while you wait.)"
9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.34,"We came here on a busy Saturday night, and the wait actually wasn't that bad, it was around 30-35 minutes. The service and staff was great! We got two appetizers, calamari and takoyaki. They were pretty good. As a first timer, I got the sea urchin udon and it was sooooo creamy and delicious. I would recommend that you try out their signature udons - it's not like the usual udon and broth that you're normally used to. I thought it was pretty cool how you could observe them make the noodles on the spot too. Definitely planning to come back more to try out their other dishes :)"
9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.34,Amazing!!!! The noodles melt in your mouth. I guess when you have a noodle making station right in front of your seat the noodles will be amazingly fresh. Small place but very well taken care of. Highly recommend and plan to go back. Just look for the place with a lot of people waiting outside.
9/9/2019,20190909,5,4.34,"Came here on a super pipin hot day around 2pm and the line was still super duper long. We put our name down and were able to walk to Twinkle Brown Sugar and back to get drinks while we were waiting... when we finally got in we ordered the mentai squid butter udon, curry udon, hot dragon udon, and the mini beef rice bowl. We also got a soft-boiled egg, tofu tempura, and shrimp tempura, for add-ons.Udon: UGHHH delicious!!!! Was really surprised by the unique flavors they had. Mine was the mentai squid butter and I was definitely a lil worried about what it'd taste like, but it had a familiar flavor of those light seafood italian pastas. There was plenty of squid in it. I actually thought it'd have a more creamy and buttery texture but it was p light and liquidy. Curry udon was also super duper good, soup on there was a good thickness. Hot dragon tasted like ramen LOL which is not my preference but still pretty goodMini beef bowl: not bad!! there was a bunch of choices and she said this, the tuna one, and something else were the popular ones. It wasnt really special though so i probably would go without this next time. The udon is surprisingly a big portion so id rather save room for thatToppings: they give these to you on the side, not inside the udon. Shrimp tempura was whatever for me, egg was pretty good but the highlight was definitely the fried tofu for me!!! Please get it guys!! As an agedashi tofu fan I was super happy :POverall I loved the food!!! I love Japanese food and I love udon!!! Service was just alright though, they kept coming back to our table to take our order because I wasn't ready, so I felt rushed and pressured (but i get it was busy). They also messed up my friends order of shrimp tempura and accidentally gave us fish cake. When we said it was wrong, the guy responded really awkwardly and didn't know what to say, almost like he didn't know what to do or that we were the ones that got it wrong LOL?? But the person who took the order quickly came to our rescue and was like oh oops my bad. Anyway the food was too good for me to drop a star on that!! Highly highly recommend"
9/10/2019,20190910,5,4.34,"Taste: 5Value: 4.5Service: Incredible! 5Outstanding experience furthered with outstanding service.  We were running late coming here for lunch, which closes at 2:30PM. However, when we got there at 2PM, despite them being very very busy, they did their absolute best to accommodate all of us waiting and on top of that did it with a smile! I was very impressed with their service.The food itself was extraordinary! We had the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and the Miso Carbonara Udon. Both of them were unique, well executed, and flavorful. Possibly the best udon we've ever had. You can't go wrong with either of these choices, but if you were forced to pick one, we felt the Mentai Squid Butter Udon was ever so slightly more unique!Parking can be rough here, but there's a parking structure on Judge John Aiso St and E 1st that's fairly cheap.Overall a very very good experience! Highly recommended, would come back!"
9/12/2019,20190912,4,4.34,"Okay, honestly, this is my second time here & i LOVVVEEEE it. The first time I visited Cali we came here & got their signature uni pasta, i personally don't like uni bc of their fishy taste but i mean it's their signature dish. I ended up rly liking it though, the fishy taste is hidden under the creamy sauce & bc the uni is chopped up in pieces, you can't really taste the fishy taste. So 5/5 for that.The second time, i ordered like their chicken creamy pasta, so basically it tasted like chicken Alfredo but with a lot of cheese (as u can see) but i actually really liked this dish. My friends tried whatever the first pasta on their menu was & another creamy pasta.I think most of their creamy pastas are made the same way but just have different things in it. Like one was a creamy bacon pasta & the other was a creamy chicken & mushroom. Both pretty much tasted the same, just different proteins!My advice like most popular places around there - come early because there is usually a wait & you wait outside. Also, they will not seat you unless the whole party is there. Lastly, i took off a star because i just wished the server there was a little more attentive but being such a busy and small place, guess i can't blame him!"
9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.34,"Came in at 1pm on a Friday to a no wait!(perfect for a quick lunch!)The food came out within 5-7 minutes, it was priced fairly, and the udon was really good.I got the Mad Tiger Udon, which is a cold based udon - where you pour in the sauce yourself and mix it. It was really tasty as all the flavors came together. However, the ground beef didn't really stick to the noodles. I ended up eating all the udon before actually eating the meat, so maybe I'd use a chopstick/spoon duo instead of purely chopstick next time.My friend got the Miso Carbonara Udon, which tasted like a glorified creamy carbonara pasta version! Still very good and tasty!I heard lots of good things about the uni pasta, so that's probably on my next to try list in the future!"
9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.34,This place is right in little Tokyo and it's sooo good. I got the seafood udon and it was so creamy and delicious. I was seated right next to the kitchen and got to watch them make the noodles and it was pretty tight. It satisfied a craving I didn't even know I had and now every time I'm back in Dtla I'll have to hit up this spot
9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.34,"Monzo's has the best UDON noodles in town in my opinion. My two favorite's are the miso carbonara with bacon and the sea food with cream tomato sauce. I like them both because they are cream based, and give a more heartiness to the soup. Both have great flavor profile and you feel very satisfied after eating them. I do like to add a tempura and my favorite is the pumpkin tempura. Its just the right amount of crunch, and dips well in the cream soups. One of the reasons that their udon is so good is becuase it's freshly made every day. You can see them prepare the noodles in the glass window in the back overlooking the kitchen. In full view the udon chef stretches the dough and then finely chops it using a special noodle chopping device.  Coming to little tokyo i want a nice experience that says Japanese to me, and Udon noodles helps me find that kind of experience, and nothing says that better when they are the freshest thing on the menu!"
9/16/2019,20190916,4,4.34,"Delicious udon made fresh in the shop! You can see the worker rolling and cutting the dough, certified fresh! The location is small but luckily it wasn't very busy when we went (unlike Daikokuya next door) so we were seated right away. Service is fast and friendly, but seats are tight. Food: - Uni udon ($17.95): Popular dish, but a little overhyped IMO. The broth is a creamy base with uni flavor infused in. Besides that, it came with 2 small pieces of cooked uni, a shiso leaf, and some salmon roe on top. The broth reminded me of Alfredo sauce, and I didn't particularly like cooked uni. The roe, however, was delicious. I'm usually not a fan of large roe but this was great. - Hot dragon ($~12): The Bf really enjoyed this dish. Really flavorful and had a nice kick. - Mountain yam Udon: I had a bite of this but it was so great. The mountain yam purée is poured on top of the udon and makes for a slimy broth. I think I will enjoy this dish next time. Overall, I think any udon dish here is tasty because of the chewiness of their udon. You shouldn't have to spend $15+/bowl in order to enjoy the udon."
9/16/2019,20190916,5,4.34,"Whenever there's a chance for me to go to Marugame Monzo in LA, I always try to make it. Especially if I'm with friends who love udon. It's a great small place right in the heart of Little Tokyo next to Daikokuya Ramen and a boba store that just opened recently. Timing is a big thing here at Marugame is you want to beat the wait. The seating can be pretty limited since it's a really small space. So I'd definitely recommend coming in with at most a group of 4. Anything more would be a much longer wait. We came at an odd time on a Saturday afternoon (around 2PM) so the wait was only 10-15 minutes long before being called in for a party of 2. It was still lunchtime so there was a lunch combo menu and me being the person who was too ambitious got a cold udon w/ soft boiled egg in addition to eggplant tempura and even a mentai rice bowl to make it a lunch combo. Everything came out and the udon bowl was MASSIVE for me. I definitely overordered but I also had no regrets because everything was amazing.The quality of the udon is apparent with the chewy and dense texture from the udon while the sauce used as a nice concentrated version of their dashi stock and really coated the noodles well. The eggplant tempura was fried to perfection and the mentai rice bowl provided a sense of guilty pleasure with the Japanese mayo squeezed on top with sprinklings of dried seaweed. It was definitely a filling meal but what I liked was the refreshing taste from each food and how they complimented each other well too. I do want to try their creamy pasta in the future if I have the chance the comeback but I definitely recommend making a stop by here if you're ever in Little Tokyo."
9/18/2019,20190918,5,4.34,"Udon is one of my favorite things. The way Marugame Monzo is able to incorporate so many different ways of making it tingles my tastebuds. The first time I went, i tried their bacon carbanara. This was a pretty hearty dish that eveloped the springy Udon with a rich creamy sauce. Scooping every bit of sauce and regretting not ordering double portion, i planned my next visit.My second visit was on a hot summer LA day where outside was pushing 90 degrees. I ordered their Mad Tiger Udon to help me cool off. They say you beat heat with heat right? While this dish was cooling, my personal preference would have been to have it a little bit spicier although good, was more of a mad kitten Udon. Again though i regretted not ordering double portion.Fast, Delicious, Hearty, Refreshing, These guys got all your needs covered."
9/19/2019,20190919,4,4.34,The wait time here is not crazy long. We arrived during dinner time and were seated less than 10 minutes. The place is compact and busy. There are absolutely no substitution but you can add topping to your ramen. I ordered Hot Dragon it's not too spicy it's the perfect amount of enjoyable spicy. Also if you are person who doesn't like drinking out of glass bring your own straw. Last but not least Parking is pain so be ready to keep your eye open for spot. You don't have to valet your car if you look around you will find spot or public parking lot. Just remember if they are charging you $15for parking keep looking.
9/24/2019,20190924,1,4.34,"Had a bad experience here today, celebrating my birthday here for lunch and my parents wanted to order a lunch combo which comes with an added rice bowl for 3 or 4 dollars. My dad wasn't very hungry so they decided to share the udon and rice bowl combo. After I told the waitress (midage woman with penciled eyebrows) they were sharing, she seemed upset and said it's going to be an additional charge of 2 dollars, which is regular price for the rice bowl and walked away before we could say anything. We flagged her down in less than a 1 minute and told her that we will just order an extra order of udon and cancel the rice bowl. Again she walks away mumbling something and I watch her go to the food station and waits for them to scoop a bowl of rice with the premade meat. She sets it on our table and says ""it comes out fast sorry"" she brought this bowl of rice out way before any of our orders come out which doesn't make sense. Because we all sat there staring at the bowl of rice getting cold. We all knew she did this intentionally. Even if it wasnt intentional it didn't make sense to bring that out within 1 minute of ordering while waiting for the other food. Never checked on us once, never refilled our water. Very rude. Probably will not be back! Some people need not to be in customer service."
9/27/2019,20190927,5,4.34,"Was trying to go to Marugame Udon, but came here by accident!- Braised Pork Belly with soy sauce 100/100THIS WAS THE TASTIEST ITEM.The pork belly was so soft and tender. They give you 5 square chunks of pork belly goodness in this sweet soy sauce soup (which is also tasty!).Better than the udon TO BE HONEST. *MUST TRY*- Creamy Carbonara Udon 4/5With a few pieces of bacon (yummy!) this dish is VERY creamy and probably needs more salt added. VERY VERY creamy/milky. It was kinda bland and too milky for me but overall the dish was good. *wouldn't get again*- Mentai Squid Butter Udon 4.5/5 It comes out with a bit of soupy like broth that's mixed with tiny fish eggs, and lots of sliced onions. The SQUID is the best part! It doesn't look like squish and the taste and texture is amazing. The dish itself is a bit acidic and sweet.*maybe get again?*Overall I thought this place was pretty good! Came here at 5:30pm and did not have to wait. The service was superb and the restaurant is beautiful. You can see a man making the udon noodles from scratch. I would bring my date here."
9/29/2019,20190929,5,4.34,"The cream sea urchin udon and duck nanban udon were phenomenal!We did a yelp search for ramen, but got this udon place instead. When we arrived 10 minutes before it opened, there was already a line forming at the door. I take that as a good sign.We opted for seating at the bar, which is where you can watch them make and cut fresh udon and the whole cooking process. For appetizers: the fried chicken was deliciously moist, yet light and crispy. If you are going to be eating something rich, like the cream sea urchin udon, I recommend the house-made cold tofu, which helps refresh the palate.As for the sea urchin udon, it was umami packed! Udon was fresh and springy. Broth was Super rich and creamy, full of flavor, coats the tongue nicely, and you also gets the occasional salty explosion of salmon roe.The duck nanban udon was also delicious. A lighter, but flavor packed broth with sweet, earthy, charred spring onions and tender slices of roasted duck. Must visit."
9/29/2019,20190929,4,4.34,"Keto or low carb friendly? (I'm not a dietician)No it's an udon place. So I was planning on watching the family eat bc trying to stay away from udon. The waitress thought we were sharing so she didn't allow second mini rice to be part of the combo. Charged full price for the second mini beef rice. Which is fine, only $2.75 difference, but so you know... if you have more people than udon bowl.. for lunch they won't allow more than one mini bowl. I did order a fried calamari but that till didn't count.As for the food, good as usual."
9/29/2019,20190929,4,4.34,"Nice ambiance and very friendly staff, but the wait is always very long and you cannot make reservations. I think the udon is good, but it's not the best I've ever had and does not warrant the 30-45 min wait for 2 people."
9/30/2019,20190930,5,4.34,Came in here with no expectation so i was really surprised on how good the Udon was.I was never a huge fan of Udon but this place can for sure change my perspective. Come here with an open heart and open stomach.Very good.
10/1/2019,20191001,5,4.34,"My fav udon restaurant ever! First time here was in 2016 and I'm still coming back in 2019. PSA it is not the same as Marugame Udon, not even close. The udon flavors are very unique and interesting. I've gotten the Mentai squid butter udon and seafood tomato cream udon which were both so delicious. The noodles were just chewy enough, the bowl was flavor-packed, and portions/prices were decent! I think I actually like the seafood tomato cream better because of that extra umami flavor that the tomato gives the broth. I've also tried my friend's Udon Gratin, which was basically like baked alfredo and cheese on top of udon. It was super delicious as well, but very heavy/fatty so I personally wouldn't get it because I would prob get sick of it after eating half.Be prepared to wait at least an hour if you're coming on a Friday or Saturday night! Last time I came, my friend and I (party of 2) waited for almost exactly an hour. And what's super important is to PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THEM CALLING YOUR NAME. They call it 3 times in a row but they don't say it that loudly and the sound gets dissipated in the outside air. So you should stay alert and stand close to the door if possible because I witnessed several people lose their place in line from not hearing their name being called. Service is pretty good!! The employees were all really nice and food came out quickly despite the store being packed. Parking is always a struggle if you don't want to pay a ridiculous amount because it's downtown. Can't wait to come back for a 4th time :-)"
10/1/2019,20191001,4,4.34,"The wife and I have been here many times and it hasn't disappointed so far! The wait is usually long (an hr when we went last Saturday), but the person who called out the names gave a pretty accurate estimate of the wait time when I asked so we were able to walk around Little Tokyo for a bit and came back in time. Just keep track or else you'll lose your spot if you're not present when they call your name. Anyway, we started with chicken skin and then the wife got the regular kake udon with a side of tempura shrimp and tempura egg while I got the tempura chicken udon and tempura egg. ALWAYS get a tempura egg! It's worth it! The udon is made in house so it comes out fresh every time."
10/2/2019,20191002,4,4.34,"We came to this udon place because of all the amazing reviews. We waited an hour for seating and there were A LOT of people waiting. Seating area was cramped like any noodle place. We ordered the beef bukkae udon and the sea urchin udon. Both were yummy. The sea urchin udon's broth was a bit too creamy for me. Taste wise, it was the perfect balance of sea urchin, and it was not fishy at all. I had a taste of the beef bukkae udon and it was pretty good, it was a cold udon and I'm usually not a fan of cold udon, but this changed my mind. Overall, it was a delicious meal!"
10/5/2019,20191005,5,4.34,Craving udon and fusion udon try this place out. It does get busy so try to go in the afternoon when the line is shorter. Service and the environment and great! I order the mushroom cream udon and it was delicious. The mushroom sauce was thick and very filling. Hope to come back soon and try the other items on the menu.
10/7/2019,20191007,5,4.34,"Came here Saturday at around 2:40pm and waited 20-30 min for a party of 2. Normally it is much more crowded.Udon: The first time I came here I tried the spicy dragon udon and beef udon before. The spicy dragon is really heavy and I ended up liking the beef one better. The beef udon is sweet and comes with a good amount of meat! I also tried the ankake mushroom udon, which had a rich broth. It had a mushroom taste. I read a review about it saying that it didn't taste like mushrooms...but to me, it definitely did. It didn't fill me up as much as the spicy dragon or beef because it doesn't come with meat. I had a bite of the Mentai squid butter udon and the meat that came with it was very soft and tender. Sides: I liked the Pork miso onigiri. It was way better than the ones they sell at Mitsuwa (which was the only one I've had, so take my advice with a grain of salt)They only have the braised pork belly after 5. I will definitely order next time for dinner.Parking: I parked at the Lil Tokyo structure that is a flat $12 for all of Sat & Sun."
10/8/2019,20191008,5,4.34,"With the closing down of Oumi Sasaya in Lomita, this place is now my favorite udon restaurant in So-Cal. They have a wonderful combination of traditional and trendy ways to serve udon. My favorite for traditional: Cold Udon with Shiso and Umeboshi. The sourness of the plum combines nicely with the fragrant, herbal flavor of shiso. The noodles are firm and tender at the same time and this cold noodle dish makes some hotter LA days seem miles away.The trendy choice: Mentai Squid Butter. I love the combination of butter and mentaiko. Mentaiko has a spicy/fishy flavor that can be a bit sharp. The creaminess of the butter combines well with the salty umami bomb and makes for a wonderfully rich eating experience. As the udon noodles are handmade, they stand up to the heaviness of the sauce when most places tend to have udon that's too soft and falls apart.There are plenty more delicious options at this place. I always love adding a tempura egg to any dish and you can't really go wrong with their udon because of the quality of product.Cheers!"
10/8/2019,20191008,5,4.34,DroolDreamDie-forDeliciousI plan to return. We stumbled here after hangin' around Lil Tokyo. I didn't have any expectations so I was so surprised at how delicious everything was! It was well-worth the outside wait. I also enjoy watching food get made so spring sitting by the udon-rolling man behind a window was like a show with a meal. I wonder if he feels like a caged attraction. We are attracted to the food though! We delighted on the udon gratin specialty dish. So so so yummy and delectable and luxuriously rich. I guess we had stayed until the next menu became available so chicken skin with ponzu graced our palates next. So carefully cooked! Until next time!
10/8/2019,20191008,3,4.34,"Came for lunch, not busy at all. Had the cold Udon. There are more chopped green onions in my bowl than the udon. So many Ramen places in the area, this is my first time here, also will be the last time."
10/9/2019,20191009,4,4.34,This place is good! I got the cold udon with sour plum and it was refreshing and filling. Ambiance is nothing to write home about but friendly staff and yummy food.
10/9/2019,20191009,5,4.34,"Easily the best udon I've ever had. I first tried the Marugame in Honolulu, Hawaii then later tried the one here in South coast plaza. The only let down was that they didn't have the deep fried hard boiled eggs. But overall a 10 out of 10."
10/10/2019,20191010,5,4.34,"TDLR: Mapo tofu udon is aight. TRY THE GRATIN UDON, MENTAI SQUID BUTTER, or THE UNI CREAM UDON. SIDE DISHES: NEGITORO or KAKIAGE.ALSO PARKING IS A BITCH SO GOODLUCK. Tips: Try to park further for cheaper parking. But let's be real anywhere in DTLA cost money to park. Also the restaurant DOES NOT take reservations and full party must be PRESENT.Taste: I have been here multiple times and I have to say the udon never fails to impress me. After eating their hand pulled udon, one can never go back to frozen udon =/. The noodles have this bite and elasticity that no other udon can replicate. This is the best udon shop in LA county hands down. I recently had their mapo tofu, it was all right. It didn't scream MAPO TOFU flavor to me. I prefer the uni cream, mentai squid butter udon, or the gratin udon. For side dishes I have tried the negitoro and the kakiage which are both magnificent. I highly recommend the Negitoro. The grounded toro was so smooth and flavorful!Service: The waiters are genuinely super nice and approachable. Once my friend complained about the look of the uni, the bowl was quickly replaced with a fresh one."
10/11/2019,20191011,5,4.34,"I had a friend ask me today ""You post such good photos on Instagram, what should I eat for dinner"" and without a second though I told her she needs to get down to Maragume Monzo. This restaurant holds a special place in my heart, it really is my go to for warm comforting noodles. They have a great selection of specialty udon but nothing really does it for me the way their traditional beef udon with a tempura soft boiled egg does. Yes there is a wait, it's little Tokyo, go for a walk and enjoy living in LA, you won't be disappointed."
10/11/2019,20191011,5,4.34,Had the beef udon which was very heartful. The service was also fast and accommodating. Overall very good service and very good food.
10/12/2019,20191012,5,4.34,"Honestly my FAVORITE place for udon! Whenever I'm in the LA Little Tokyo area I have to stop by. However, there's almost always a really long wait so be prepared to wait! Their signature udons are the way to go, in my opinion, as their regulars are well... just regular lol. So far,I've have the Uni, Mentai Squid Butter, Carbonara, and Udon Gratin. The Uni is my FAVORITE. It's creamy and they don't skimp on the Uni. It comes with Ikura on a leaf and the saltiness from the salmon eggs help balance the creaminess. I am a huge fan of mentaiko and I really recommend the Squid Butter if you are too! The Carbonara is also very creamy and the saltiness from the bacon helps balance it. Let me tell you, they give you a good amount and big pieces of bacon in the carbonara. If you LOOOOVE cheese then the Udon Gratin is the one for you! It's very cheese and creamy, however the chicken that it comes with is very dry. All and all the food here is amazing. I find the portions to be a good amount, as I always have to ask for a to go box for my left overs. They make their noodles in house which is really cool! The service is always good and I definitely recommend you try it!"
10/13/2019,20191013,5,4.34,"I first tried this chain in Las Vegas, which for some ludicrous reason closed. But not to worry its first shop still remains open in a lityle spot in Little Tokyo, LA. We waited about 30 minutes to try their famous Uni pasta. I think I have never tried another uni pasta so rich in flavour. They also personally make their noodles from scratch and take pride in all their noodle dishes."
10/13/2019,20191013,5,4.34,"I'm an udon kind of girl and this place by far serves the best udon I've ever tasted on the west coast! My favorite items are the beef udon, mentai squid butter udon, chicken karage, and pork belly bowl! Best nights to go are Tuesday's or Wednesday's since it is not as crowded."
10/14/2019,20191014,5,4.34,"I think this place is great. Located in Little Tokyo, so parking can be rough and there is most times a long wait to be seated. So, I have a few recommendations. Come with a party of no more than 2, ask to be seated at the bar if the wait isn't too long. It's really fun to watch the noodles being hand made! Also, come during the week or on a Sunday so you can find some street parking! Finally, don't forget to walk around and explore the Japanese Village Plaza!Now, for the food. I tried the fried calamari once. It was good, but a little heavy on the batter. I've tried the Onigiri Rice Ball with pork miso twice, it's very good! As far as the udon, I've had the beef udon which I thought was good, but nothing spectacular. I've also had the miso carbonara udon, this is exceptionally delicious IMO. Lastly, I had the sea urchin cream udon. As a result of trying this particular dish, I have come to the conclusion that I do not like sea urchin. The customer service here is good, considering how busy and small this place is. At times, it does feel a little rushed, but I still give this place 5 stars."
10/15/2019,20191015,5,4.34,"Before I start rambling I'll say...go here! It's worth it to try. Avoid Saturday afternoon at 12:00 or even 1:00 or even 2:00, there WILL be a line, you WILL be held hostage in it. Definitely come on a weekday towards the end of peak lunchtime. I came on a Monday at 2:00 and was seated right away.Since I was alone and not incredibly hungry I played it safe and ordered traditional Udon broth...It was PERFECT! I used to live in Korea which had a plethora of phenomenal Japanese restaurants. This is the closest i've found to that authentic clean broth flavor & fresh, soft, chewy yet melt in your mouth noodles, (albeit at Los Angeles prices). I also got the chicken tempura and DELICIOUS pumpkin tempura on the side....I look forward to coming back and being more adventurous with the other sauces. I have this vicious cycle I go through with Udon & Ramen restaurants. I always crave it, then go, then like it but balk at how I could make it myself, then I try to make it myself and it's tasty but not AS tasty and the key is the NOODLE. The broth I can semi-recreate since I love cooking, but I've never made noodles and the ""instant noodle packets"" can't even look these handmade noodles in the EYE. The claim to fame at this restaurant is the noodles and the open kitchen where you can watch the noodles being made is such a nice touch.So GO HERE! Don't be like me, be adventurous and order the cool dishes they're known for, looking forward to trying the carbonara and bolognase next time."
10/15/2019,20191015,5,4.34,I generally prefer thinner noodles but udon noodles are the only exception! They hand make and cut them fresh here and prepare batches in their little see through station so you know exactly what they're doing. I come here often when I visit LA and I usually get the regular beef udon! I've also tried the sea urchin udon and the miso carbonara udon. The sea urchin was really yummy and I would recommend it to anyone who likes uni pasta. The miso carbonara was a litttle heavy and I wasn't able to finish it! It also comes with bacon in it. Its really small inside so the wait gets a little long. I usually park at the lot on judge john aiso street just across the crossway on the other block (to the right of the restaurant when you're facing the street from the storefront) It's $2 for the first 2 hours and its a pretty close walk! I could usually expect about a 30-40 min wait for lunch if it's busy
10/20/2019,20191020,4,4.34,"I like to call this the gourmet udon restaurant simply because their udon offerings are not what you see at a typical Japanese restaurant. I've heard great things about their signature udon in which the Sea Urchin Cream, Miso Carbonara, Hot Dragon and Mentai Squid Butter udon are the most well praised by people, so I decided to take a trip to Little Tokyo to see what the hype was about. To avoid long lines, we opted for an early dinner by coming in around 4:30PM on a Saturday, and luckily no wait! We were seated promptly in front in which we could see the udon being freshly made and prepared. This is honestly what makes the udon here so good! Do note that you cannot add extra udon for the signature udon, but you have the option of adding double portion of udon the hot & cold udon. You must however order the extra udon when you first place the order as each bowl is freshly prepared. I hope to come back to try their non-signature udon one day, but I have a feeling it will be hard for me to gravitate away from their signature udon. || L O C A T I O N / P A R K I N G ||Located in the Little Tokyo district, neighbored by Daikokuya & Boteaga. The parking structures or street parking would be the best choice when you're in Little Tokyo. You may be able to find some free street parking near Arts District, but that is quite a bit of a walk (15~20 minutes). || F O O D ||Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($17.95): One of the pricier udon on the menu, but I assure you it is well worth it (that is unless you're allergic to seafood). I've had uni pasta at Cafe Hiro in Cypress so I really wanted to try this out after hearing so much praise from my uni loving friends. The amount of uni in the bowl was a generous amount, and it paired so well with the udon. This is very rich and creamy, so If you're not a fan of that, it might be a bit too much for you. We opted for an additional shrimp tempura and soft boiled egg, and it did not disappoint. Miso Carbonara Udon ($13.75): I'll never have carbonara sauce with pasta noodles again. Who knew that carbonara sauce would work so well with udon. The carbonara sauce was smooth and creamy and the aroma of the bacon was strong as there was a good amount of bacon in the sauce. With the chewiness of the udon, all I did was just slurp and slurp the entire bowl with no breaks.  Takoyaki ($4.95) I'm a huge fan of takoyaki, so I always get it whenever I see it offered on the menu. Now I'm not trying to claim the title of Takoyaki queen, but I've had my fair share of good and bad takoyaki. Coming at 3 pcs instead of the usual 5pcs, I did have some sort of expectations to hopefully justify the higher unit price of takoyaki. Unfortunately, other than the size being a bit bigger than the takoyaki from other places, it was disappointing for me, which made it difficult for me to give them a full five star review. While I did think that the crispness and texture was better than most places, the ratio of the squid and batter was way off. Had the takoyaki been the usual size, I think the ratio wouldn't have been so off. Wish the squid chunk was a lot bigger than it was as I felt like I paid for a ball of fried batter."
10/23/2019,20191023,5,4.34,Best udon I've ever had. I got the carbonara udon with fresh seaweed and green onion. Highly recommend!!
10/24/2019,20191024,5,4.34,"Delicious chewy udon with an extensive amount of menu options. The line can be discouraging, but there's a reason for the 45 min wait. The udon is amazing. We had the traditional beef and dipping udon and it was fantastic. There's a few untraditional styles available, which my friends ordered, and they are good. If you love cheese, the au gratin is a great choice. It was a little too rich for me to have more than a few bites, but it proves that this udon may just be the perfect vehicle for any sauce or broth. We were seated at the bar facing the kitchen where the noodle making magic can enjoyably be witnessed upon every slurp. Absolutely fantastic!!"
10/25/2019,20191025,5,4.34,Marugame Monzo is a game changer and sets the bar at the highest level for quality and taste for Udon. I'd put Monzo ahead of Marukame in Waikiki and then some. Great choice for lunch or dinner.
10/27/2019,20191027,5,4.34,"We were in the area on a Saturday night and wanted to eat something good. We live in the OC so we wanted to make it worth it (took us 1 1/2 hours to get home!). This place did NOT disappoint. We arrived around 7 pm and were seated around 30 minutes later, and our food came maybe 10 minutes later. So quick! Luckily, we were seated at the counter right in front of the window where we could see the udon being made. We ordered the sea urchin (uni) cream udon with shrimp tempura and mentai squid butter udon with fish cake tempura. Total $40 with tax for 2 people.I've had uni twice. The first time was amazing, second time I think I got a bad batch and haven't had uni since (this was years ago). So I was hesitant to order it, but I like creamy textures, and after reading the reviews, I went for it. I'm so glad I did! It was my first time having salmon eggs too, but the saltiness complimented the creaminess so well. There was a looooot of uni as well, I kept finding more under the udon, and had uni all the way to my last bite. The shrimp and fish cake tempura was good too and didn't have too much batter.The mentai squid butter udon was amazing (didn't get to take a pic unfortunately). The broth was buttery and flavorful, and full of fish eggs galore. The squid had a tender texture, not too chewy. I'd definitely get this if you aren't sure what to get.I think we got lucky with a short wait time and where we got seated. There were a lot of people waiting outside, also for Daikokuya next door, which was discouraging at first since I was staarving. But there were only 6 people ahead of us and it went quickly. If you're close by, try it!"
10/29/2019,20191029,5,4.34,Omg a must try when you're in LA! Definitely try the uni udon and top it off with a side of mentaiko for a few bucks... mix it in with the uni udon and you'll get a great satisfaction in your mouth! Definitely give it a try
10/31/2019,20191031,4,4.34,"been here a few times, it gets busy so come early! love it when they are making fresh udon behind the glass window while you sit and enjoy your bowl of udon. love the sea urchin udon. but everything is delicious and so heart warming. had their fried soft boil egg as well, so yummy!"
11/3/2019,20191103,5,4.34,"Marugame Monzo has become one of my staples in LA. Everytime friends visit, I want to take them here. The food here is really authentic and tastes great. I hadn't really had their appetizers before but recently tried their Beef Tataki, which was fantastic and plated so beautifully. Their Chicken Karaage also tasted very fresh. I really like their plain hot udons, although their specialty ones are fun and taste great too. The food comes out quick and the servers are all very friendly and on top of it. I would recommend trying to sit at the counter if you can and have a party of 2 because that itself is an experience. I really liked watching them cut and make all the noodles."
11/3/2019,20191103,5,4.34,"Okay. So... Today being only my second time here, after having forgotten the name, or location until passing it on the way back to the office the other day. I knew my friend and I were coming here together after having told him about it so many times! (But never being able to actually bring him there! Haha And so we arrive. About 5:30pm, (Sunday 11/3/19) we walk in and we are seated right away at the bar, and in front if the ""Noodle Window"" we got some edamame and a little salad. Then for dinner we had the Carbonara Udon, and the Kale Udon with Shrimp and Pumpkin. It was so delightful, light and delicious, filling, amazing! (The Carbonara could have used more udon to go with that fantastic sauce, I transferred some from my KALE)! Really happy I have found you again! That being said. This was such a wonderful experience, I was in a group of 4 last time, so I didn't sit at the bar. But I loved seeing it while I ate. Just made it feel like I was really getting something special. And we did! They were more than happy to provide containers for my leftovers, and they were all very kind servers. The kitchen staff, looked and were very tidy, clean and professional! Coming from working in a world of food and TV, I think this place is a gem. Our bill for 2 was $39.00 and some change. I think honestly it's very affordable. I always say, it's not a meal, unless it's $30 a person. In this case it was only $20each Hahaha! That's just my LA talking! ‍ ‍"
11/7/2019,20191107,5,4.34,"Marugame Monzo is located in the heart of Little Tokyo, so you know this place has legit and freshly made udon. I have been here three times now and each time I come here, I try a new bowl. The most recent visit I came here on a Monday afternoon around noon. It was packed despite being a weekday. However, for a party of 1, I was seated immediately. The service was amazing here. Shortly after being seated, a waiter comes up to me to take my drink order. A few minutes later, another waitress came over to take my udon order. The food came out relatively fast - my udon came out in less than 10 minutes. The waiters were constantly checking up on me to see if I needed anything else or refill on my water. I am a slow eater, but I was in and out of the restaurant within 45 minutes. Overall, this has the freshest udon in the LA area and one of the best service despite their busy rush hours."
11/7/2019,20191107,3,4.34,"Bowls are huge, portions not so much. The udon here is yummy and handmade, which you can see through the glass windows. I also was not too impressed with the appetizers - beef tataki was sliced very thick and not as tender as one would expect."
11/8/2019,20191108,5,4.34,"Party of 3 around 4 pm on a Saturday= very short wait.I tried the mushroom cream udon this time ($13.75). It was a little saltier than I expected, so I ended up drinking a lot of water afterward. Still delicious, though. I think I prefer the miso carbonara udon overall, but I tried a single piece of the shiitake tempura and that was as delicious as the first time I tried it."
11/9/2019,20191109,5,4.34,"OMG! The foods are so good here! We ordered: . Miso Udon. Duck Udon. Eggplant appetizerWe drove 1 hour to get here , it worth the drive. ."
11/10/2019,20191110,5,4.34,I've been wanting to try this place for so long. Many previous attempts failed due to long lines. I came here with my mom on a weekday for lunch around 12:15 and were seated right away. The udon is delicious. The soup is so clean and refreshing.We also got the calamari and it was good.
11/11/2019,20191111,5,4.34,"This is my first time in Lil Tokyo and this place is an absolute MUST to visit. Udon is one of my favorite foods and this place makes it so fresh right in front of you. Went on a Saturday and the wait was about 30-45 minutes, which isn't bad at all. The restaurant is small but very cute inside!For appetizers, I ordered the karage (Japanese fried chicken) and it was probably the best I've ever had. The breading was crisp, and the chicken was juicy. It came with mayo and curry powder on the side to dip in! A friend recommend me to order the sea urchin udon and told me that it was the best on the menu. He was not wrong. The dish is a creamy udon dish- it had a lot of uni in it! It was definitely worth its price and so good. I loved every bite of it. If I could, I would go to this place everyday to try everything on the menu. Will be coming here again the next time I'm back in LA!"
11/11/2019,20191111,5,4.34,"If you like authentic udon, then this is the place to go. You can see the noodles being made right if front of you, if you sit at the bar. Everything is very fresh and delicious. I also love their rice with mayo and fish. Its a busy place in little tokyo so either come early or after the lunch rush. Its always worth the wait tho."
11/11/2019,20191111,5,4.34,"Yummy udon... had the mushroom udon with seafood stock and added seafood. Delicious, and the experience enhanced by watching the make noodles in the kitchen"
11/15/2019,20191115,4,4.34,"This restaurant is unique because they're making udon fresh! You can see them rolling out the dough and cutting it through a large window into the kitchen. In addition to hot soup they also have cold (broth less) udon options. Loved it! The restaurant is small, so expect a wait during peak meal times."
11/15/2019,20191115,4,4.34,"Love this place! Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Only wish they offered more choices for wines by the glass and better quality. Forget going on the weekend, line is too long. Go during the weekdays."
11/17/2019,20191117,3,4.34,"I'm not a big fan of udon noodle but for what it is, I guess it's a pretty decent restaurant. Without even having to taste other udon places, I'm pretty sure this one is up there with some of the higher quality restaurants. But it didn't convert me and I don't think I will be coming back, not because of the quality of food or customer service, but just because I'm not that big on udon noodles. If you like udon, I suggest you try this place out. Otherwise, if you're a Ramen junkie like me, better to just stick to Ramen shops. It was a bit crowded inside and there's not a lot of space but it's still more spacious than DAIKOKUYA for sure. I like that the chefs make the noodles fresh right in front of you and again the customer service is pretty good so no complaints there."
11/18/2019,20191118,5,4.34,Best udon ever! I came here on a Friday night around 6pm before it gets packed so I didn't have to wait in line. I got the mentai squid butter udon and the miso carbonara udon with my bf. Both taste really good. The miso carbonara udon is very creamy and the mentai squid smells very nice. They make the udon in store so it keeps all the water to the udon and leave it very soft.
11/20/2019,20191120,3,4.34,"I wish the food were as good as the reviews say but I didn't find it to be that great. SEA URCHIN UDON (wouldn't order again): I was excited to try the Sea Urchin Udon but wasn't that impressed by it. There are a few restaurants in K-Town that execute AWESOME sea urchin noodle dishes. However, I found Marugame's to be overly rich and just okay. I noticed tables nearby that ordered different dishes that looked far better than mine.SQUID BUTTER UDON (wouldn't order again): It wasn't terrible but was edible. My wife said she would have preferred less onions and more broth. It was a bit dry and had a heaping pile of onions. OCTOPUS BALLS APPETIZER (wouldn't order again): Small appetizer of 3 octopus balls. There's the tiniest piece of squid in the center with mushy breading and some sort of BBQ sauce on the exterior. I took one bite and put it down and my wife and I just looked at each other lol.FRIED CHICKEN APPETIZER (would order again and again): This is the best dish of the night. It was served with a lemon wedge and curry powder on the side. I pushed my ramen and the octopus balls aside and went to town on the fried chicken.SERVICE: Wonderful and very friendly. We visited on a Tuesday night around 6:30 and were seated immediately. We really enjoyed watching the kitchen make the homemade udon noodles. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place or return for anything aside from the fried chicken appetizer. I really wanted to like this place and came in with an open mind but it was a severe let down. ** If you want delicious Sea Urchin Noodles, go to EMC Seafood & Raw Bar and thank me later ;) **"
11/22/2019,20191122,5,4.34,"It's worth the wait guys!!! Tried several of their udons , love them all! Also love their appetizers! Will def be back in the future. Ordered their snow crab new dish yet it was sold out that day. Hope to have it soon!"
11/26/2019,20191126,5,4.34,"the taste of the udon is amazing. they have a different kind of udon, and also the classic type of udon, which is very tasty. My nephews really love this place, so do all the family :) Lovely"
11/26/2019,20191126,4,4.34,"Wife and I had dinner here on a Tuesday night. Small place with limited tables so we had to sit at the counter. Had fried chicken, beef udon and some kind of seafood udon. Food was excellent and inexpensive.  Highly recommend this place. P.S. three of the chefs in the open kitchen were Latinos and the noodle maker was part Asian and Latino. I mentioned this because I've had great experience with Latino sushi chefs in NYC and also my son is part owner of a pizza place with a Mexican pizza maker, who makes terrific pizza."
11/27/2019,20191127,4,4.34,"Great for: date night in little tokyo, if you're craving asian and italian at the same time, if the line at daikokuya is insufferable, if you want to see noodles being made.Food: We had the carbonara and udon gratin, takoyaki, sake. The carbonara and gratin had very different flavors, and they kind of complimented each other. Carbonara was creamy and smoky bacony while the gratin was cheesy and cheesy. The sake helped cut through the creaminess of it all but boooo, they only give 3 takoyaki pieces. (we want more takoyaki!)Ambience: Casual, gets crowded enough closer to 7pm, nice enogh good for dates, friends, and families. We sat at the bar in front of a glassed chamber where the chefs make fresh udon noodles. Dinner and a show.Service: Not gonna lie, this was a bit disappointing. Our servers were great but the restaurant refused to seat me because my party of 2 was not present when the restaurant was half empty and my partner was circling the block looking for parking. I understand you can't seat me when there's a line, but when the restaurant's half empty, can't you let a girl rest her legs?Parking: Street parking in little tokyo sucks.Did not like: Waiting for a table when there are empty tables. Not enough takoyaki!"
11/30/2019,20191130,1,4.34,"Comparing with the price, way small amount of foodddd!!!!! They should give more food on that price! It was not worthy of the wait for the quantity of food.It's even the better to get a recipe and can make at home by myself."
12/1/2019,20191201,4,4.34,"I love coming to this place for their signature udon. I've tried the- Miso carbonara (4/5): I did not taste the miso in it. It basically the pasta, but replace the noodle with udon- Vongole Udon (4/5)- Seafood Tomato Cream Udon (4/5)- Sea Urchin Udon (Uni): 5/5 I thought the uni was not cooked, but the last time I went, the uni was cooked!My ultimate favorite will have to be the uni udon. but since it is creamy, it is a bit heavy so I would recommend sharing."
12/1/2019,20191201,1,4.34,Very disappointing. We usually frequent maragume udon on Sawtelle but didn't want to travel that far. Found this place from another review and after waiting about 35 minutes found it to be far less satisfying than maragume.
12/1/2019,20191201,5,4.34,the best udon I've ever had in my life. The service was amazing and I got to see them make the udon from start to finish and everything in the dish seemed fresh nothing frozen! Totally worth the drive and the traffic to get there
12/2/2019,20191202,5,4.34,"I gotta be honest...I am not a huge udon fan but Marugame Monzo is a game changer! I was introduced to this place by a friend who lives nearby. I later found myself taking back other people here. Everyone I have taken has loved it and wants to come back. Waits can be bad depending on timing and day. I've came on a Saturday and only had to wait about 10 minutes. I also came on a weekday for dinner and had to wait about 20 minutes. I believe though that it is worth the wait. Their homemade udon bowls range from $10-$20. My favorite is their popular uni one which is super creamy and full of sea urchin goodness. Another really popular one is their miso carbonara which is basically the same thing but without uni and has bacon on top. They also have creamy udon bowls such as their tomato cream one. There are also curry udon bowls and clear traditional broth udons. They even have cold udon dishes as well. Besides udon, they have rice bowls as well. I have tried a few one them and all of them have been excellent. And the cost for each is so cheap. Lunch prices are a little cheaper than dinner prices and they have specials. Oh and I love their appetizers, such as their tayokai. Yummy!The staff is quick and nice. They will make sure you get everything pretty quick. I like that you can see the chef make the noodles right in front of you. The inside of this place is very casual. There is the bar area and table sitting. It is small inside hence the waits sometimes. Monzo is one of a kind and I highly recommend it."
12/4/2019,20191204,4,4.34,"Udon gem in Little Tokyo! What we ordered:*Udon Gratin~ $12.95*Sea Urchin Cream Udon~ $17.95*Assorted Tempura~ $7.25We'd give this place a higher rating if only it weren't for the long lines. The udon is delicious, and watching them make in front of you is amazing. The Udon Gratin is our favorite since we are lovers of all things cheese. The most popular dish is probably their Sea Urchin Cream Udon, if it's your first time, definitely try it. If you're coming back, see what else they got. However, this place is not worth it if you're going to be waiting over an hour. If you're in Little Tokyo and would like to try it out, we would suggest coming early on a weekday. Come before they open, so that once they do, you can put your name down and come back. If the wait is still too crazy long, we suggest trying Daikokuya ramen next door (if that doesn't already have a line as well). We think this is a must if you're visiting LA, but don't plan your whole day around it, hang out in little Tokyo and if the lines look good then hop on in!"
12/6/2019,20191206,5,4.34,"It's worth the wait, but even better if you beat the rush crowd. It's cool how you can observe how the udon noodles are being made. First time, I've tried the mentai squid butter udon and the karaage chicken. The udon broth was very flavorful (the butter sure did the magic) and pretty heavy. The next two times I opted for mapo tofu udon, which I was skeptical to try at first, but it's very good. The spicy soybean sauce pairs well with udon and the silken tofu complements the chewy texture of the noodles. I'll definitely be back to try more adventurous flavors."
12/7/2019,20191207,5,4.34,"Yum yum and YUM! Fresh homemade udon. Unique flavors. We went on Sunday at about 11:30. The wait was 30 min. If you only have 1 bowl, make it creamy uni."
12/8/2019,20191208,5,4.34,"HANDS DOWN 5-STARS! Huge thank you to my gf for introducing Marugame Monzo into my life. I am now a believer in Udon. I was never that attracted to Udon dishes like I was for Ramen. Now I strongly love udon especially the way they make it here. The lines can get real long so make sure to get your name down quick. Their service is so friendly and kind. They will come out, shout your name few times with joy and if you're not speaking out, they will cross your name from the list which is fair and just how I like it. We ordered their creamy sea urchin udon with mini bowls of rice with tuna tartare and pork belly. This udon dish was worth $18. It was light, creamy, salmon roe popped with a nice salty flavor while the Uni was creamy and non-fishy. This is how I liked it. We enjoyed pouring chili oil and eggs into both bowls. This place was so delicious that I officially claimed Marugame Monzo as a must-eat every time I'm in LA.Thank you again Stacy D, I love you so much for this!"
12/8/2019,20191208,5,4.34,"BEST UDON PLACE!!Atmosphere: It's located really close to the Little Tokyo/Arts District metro stop! The shop is pretty small and the tables are pretty close, but I really like the vibes here. Definitely would only come with one friend though!Staff: The staff were friendly and made sure to come check up on us and refilled our waters constantly.Food: Omg best udon ever. I've never been to a place that's dedicated to just udon and this place has such a great variety. The MISO CARBONARA is heavy, rich, and super creamy and the DUCK NANBAN has a clean broth and great noodles!Price: It's a little pricy because the portions can be a little small, but it's a great thing to have once in awhile!Wait: I've been seated right away all the times I've went but I've noticed there can be a line if you come at certain times!"
12/8/2019,20191208,5,4.34,I love this place! I had the miso carbonara udon and it was so good! The wait was a little long the first time we came but the second time it was shorter so I think it depends on the day. I suggest calling them and asking before coming. The place is small but it's so worth it!
12/8/2019,20191208,5,4.34,"Had the udon gratin with a tempera jumbo shrimp and soft boiled egg. Amazing flavor and good portion size. Service was attentive and quick. The wait was a bit long but that is expected. I would recommend coming on an off hour, but definitely will be coming back. Hands down the best udon place I have been to."
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.34,"Delicious and satisfying! Ordered the uni udon and a rice bowl and,my favorite on the menu, the sour plum cold udon with mushroom and a side order of takoyaki.There's parking at the corner, $1/two hours. They don't seat you until everyone in your party arrives, and you'll have to wait outside. With the cold weather, we've been looking for soup spots, so this spot will be in our lunch rotation for sure."
12/9/2019,20191209,4,4.34,"A really good udon place that's always packed!The wait was about 40 minutes for a table of 2, so we decided to go to the place next door that specialized in sake. We finally get sat at a small table in between two other couples. We ordered this snowflake nigori because we're idiots and wanted the most expensive sake at the restaurant and it was literally the worst thing we've ever drank. (Super thick consistency and a lingering taste). Essentially if you never brushed your teeth and decided to drink milk right after that's the film it left in your mouth.The 4 stars is for the soup itself. The cooked uni wasn't very good but the broth itself was amazing"
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.34,"Pretty good, the area is pretty small so the waiting line is pretty long but the udon was delicious. Definitely recommend the bacon one but it's more Italian than udon. Expect to feel and taste like pasta."
12/9/2019,20191209,5,4.34,"Long, long wait--I won't kid you on that (granted I was visiting LA during a holiday weekend, I think you will still hit a crowd no matter when you go). I had time to go get boba next door and then ordered 2 drinks at the bar 2 doors down and watched TV for a bit before coming back and checking. But, very much worth it. They do made the noodles by hand (and you can see them do it), and it really is the best udon I've ever had."
12/15/2019,20191215,5,4.34,"Lives up to the hype!!! The udon is so so amazing...i highly recommend that you order one of their signature udon bowls. So worth the wait, would go back in a heartbeat."
12/16/2019,20191216,5,4.34,Hands down the best food in Little Tokyo. Udon noodles are all hand made in front of you in the restaurant. They have all kinds of noodle dishes ranging from traditional Japanese udon to crossover European style udon such as Udon Carbonarra and cheesy udon gratin. Not to mention everything on the menu is under $15. There's typically a line out the door so get there early!
12/17/2019,20191217,5,4.34,This place is honestly my favorite place to get Udon. I drive almost 2 hours and willing to wait an hour for this place. My goto is the chicken tempura noodles with double portions and the fried chicken skin. The noodles are perfectly made and the texture is just the right amount of chewiness. The double portions is the right amount to feed a big boi like me. The broth is perfectly salted and is extremely comforting on cold days. Highly recommend this place to anyone who is seeking a warm delicious meal to comfort themselves and their loved ones.
12/18/2019,20191218,5,4.34,"I can't believe I just found out that there's a Marugame in Little Tokyo, but I'll definitely be frequenting this place!! It's different from all the other Marugames because this location offers unique flavors, and they also have some small rice bowls as well (it's also a traditional sit down restaurant where they take your order vs the cafeteria style Marugame usually offers). I got the Negitoro Mini Rice Bowl (SO GOOD) and I also tried a bit of my friend's Mentai Squid Butter which I also really liked. The line was extremely long when we went but it surprisingly went by very quickly. To kill some time my friend and I went to the Little Tokya plaza right across the street. !! I recommend parking at Judge John Aiso parking structure as it's so much cheaper than the parking structure in the Little Tokyo plaza, and it's not much further down the street !!"
12/18/2019,20191218,4,4.34,"I come here for one thing and one thing only. UNI CREAM UDON. This is by far the best thing here and makes this place extremely famous. I love the creamy texture that is presented. The only downfall of this place is the small amount of uni on top. You don't get a ton of Uni but overall, the udon is nicely flavored without the fishy taste. The restaurant is small and can be a wait, but once seated, the service is great. Highly recommend trying this restaurant!"
12/20/2019,20191220,5,4.34,"Loved it. Got there at 11:40 am on a Friday for lunch and by the time we finished, there was a line down the block. Will definitely return."
12/22/2019,20191222,5,4.34,"I love noodles. All kinds of noodles. Ramen, Soba, Lo Mein, you name it. But one of my favorite noodles by far are Udon. I just love the chewy texture of a nicely handmade Udon noodle. And the place I really enjoy is Marugame Monzo. You may be familiar with the cafeteria style Marugame Udon restaurants that are springing up more and more around Ca. This is the slightly more high end original spot in Downtown LA. Only table service and slightly more sophisticated udon varieties. There's still handmade udon (you can watch them being made by hand) as well as a variety of tempura. Some of their unique offering include a Carbonara Udon which I've yet to try.. but looks very very good. I had the Curry Udon (as did my friends), various tempura and everything was really stellar. Wonderfully chewy noodles, savory curry broth and crispy tempura. Udon Heaven! I'll be going back again soon."
12/25/2019,20191225,5,4.34,"What's there to say about the Marugame at this location that hasn't already been said? They make the noodles right there, so they're thick and chewy every time. They have an eclectic menu, so if you're an adventurous eater then you'll be pleased at their wide range of options from uni cream udon to mental squid butter udon. My recommendation: if you enjoy their speciality udons, I would order an extra serving of noodles since they tend to skimp with the creamy dishes for whatever reason. It may take a few tries to find an udon that you like, but I'd encourage you to keep trying or even sample a spoonful from a friend since this the best place in LA for noodles. However, the wait is understandably long and parking is a nightmare, so you'll have to pay for a spot in one of the nearby lots. Personally, I enjoy the mushroom udon since the broth is light yet flavorful. The Mad Tiger udon is a type of bukakke udon topped with spicy beef and it's soo delicious, it's probably my new go-to order."
12/25/2019,20191225,4,4.34,Best Udon place I have ever been to. A variety of udon to choose from for every person along with spectacular appetizers. A definite recommend for any japanese food enthusiast.
12/26/2019,20191226,1,4.34,"We waited outside for more than 40 minutes. They finally called our names, gave us the menu, and told us to wait. After that they didn't call again. When we realized people after us getting in, we talked to the waiter and saw our names crossed out without even being called in while we waited outside all the time. It's really frustrating."
12/27/2019,20191227,4,4.34,"Knocking down one star because the wait was horrendous. What made it horrendous were really people's manners. There's something about people waiting in lines that make manners go out the window. Anyways, aside from the hour long wait due to 16 parties ahead of us, almost everything else was good. Pros:- Delicious fusion food (miso carbonara was great)- The noodles are made fresh on-site- Service was quick and simple- Guy managing the wait list was a trooper esp with the people who didn't have manners - Come during lunch to add a mini rice bowl for $3-$4Considerations:- Little Tokyo parking sucks. Just know you'll be paying for parking- It's a bit tight inside- The gender neutral restroom is also the men's room. People got confused. Just use any restroom that's open for use in my opinion. - Be considerate and not be a jerk while waiting in line. Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. Have everyone in your party with you and don't make excuses when they're not there and you're called. Don't cut in between people because you don't want to walk around them esp when those people are in mid convo but have to stop to accommodate you walking in between them not just once but twice. Cons:- The wait. Now that I've been here, I don't plan on waiting here again. Food was amazing but it's a novelty so don't feel the need to self-torture myself again with the wait. - The back where the restrooms are located aren't very cleanly kept. What we ordered:- Miso carbonara udon (4/5; deliciously creamy but most of the bacon pieces were literally just the fatty parts)- Creamy urchin udon (4/5; also a creamy delicious dish but it overpowered the flavor of the uni. You get the uni texture without the uni flavor according to the person who ordered it)- Beef and fluffy egg udon (4/5)- Fatty tuna mini rice bowl (no comment)- Ikura mini rice bowl (5/5)"
12/28/2019,20191228,3,4.34,It's not worth the price compared to what they give and the service is very mediocre. My udon came lukewarm and the pork belly was mostly made of fat. They gave me three pieces of pork and my bill came out to almost 15$ with nothing else in my meal.
12/28/2019,20191228,5,4.34,I always get the nikutame with two shrimp tempura and a potato croquette. Never disappoints - so good and affordable!
12/29/2019,20191229,4,4.34,"First off, the line is extremely long here. I recommend putting down your name and go get ice cream or something at honeymee. Shouldn't be too bad of a wait after that. Udon: 3.5/5. I'm not a bad fan of udon, so I don't know what good udon actually tastes like. Overall, it's not bad. They also make it in front of you, so that's cool. I don't really have a favorite at this restaurant. My family members like this place, so we go here a lot for that reason. The Uni udon is not that great. I wouldn't recommend getting it. Small chunk of Uni with udon. Not worth it. Also, not the best quality Uni as well.The beef fluffy udon was interesting. The soup was a bit sweet for me. It's an odd taste. I wouldn't recommend it.The other dishes are decent. My family members like it.Overall, it's decent. It's 4 stars because the food was not bad, but I'm sure people who like udon will find this place good. For that reason, I think it's more fair to give 4 stars.Also, side note, it would be great if this place can implement the yelp waitlist to avoid the long lines."
12/29/2019,20191229,5,4.34,"I went here back in September for my birthday and it was amazing. The place is really small, but we were seated really quickly. Parking here is pretty tough, but there is a couple of parking garages you can park at like we did. There are a couple of places, not just the one we visited, but it's definitely a place to come visit. I got the fettuccine one and it was really good."
12/30/2019,20191230,5,4.34,"Don't let the long lines stop you from coming here! There is always a crowd of people standing outside in front of the restaurant. When I checked in the waiting list, there were 9 people ahead of me. The place doesn't look very big, so I thought I would have to wait about an hour, but thankfully it was more like 40 minutes. Ordering and receiving the food was really quick. I suggest looking at the menu while you're waiting for a table.The lunch ""special"" gives you the option to get a mini size rice bowl for an additional $3 or $4, along with your order of udon. I tried the mentai (roe) rice bowl and negitoro (tuna) rice bowl. These were both underwhelming for me. I don't see anything special about paying a few extra dollars for a little bowl of rice. Rice was disappointing... but the udon was good! I tried three different udon bowls. From my favorite to least favorite:Mentai Squid Butter Udon: seasoned fish eggs, butter sauce, squid, and onions....creamy and delicious. Perfect portions of mentai, squid, and udon. It was not even heavy like I thought it might be.Udon Gratin: baked cream sauce udon with chicken, onion, and cheese. This is for all the cheese lovers. There is seriously a TON of cheese. Good chicken to udon ratio. Seafood is an extra $2.Curry Udon: hot udon in a special curry-based broth with pork belly slices and green onions. The curry was tasty, but there was not nearly enough pork belly. Meat lovers would be disappointed. Also got a side of crispy tempura, which were battered and fried just right. Lots of tempura options for approximately $1 to $2. I recommend the soft-boiled egg tempura. Marugame Monzo lives up to the hype after all!"
12/31/2019,20191231,4,4.34,"This was the perfect place to go to on a cold day. The wait wasn't too bad (Tuesday night), the food came out quickly, and the service was good. We ordered the following:Takoyaki - it comes in 3pcs and was perfect for our party of three. Takoyaki tasted freshly made and was the perfect dish to open our meal. Mentai Squid Butter Udon - This dish was very light and felt like a soup-y udon dish for me. It's great if you're feeling sick, but I definitely prefer the creamier sauces for udon instead.Sea Urchin udon - I preferred this udon suave better. I haven't had uni before so I can't tell if it's good or not. I wasn't blown away by it or anything. But I did really enjoy the fish roe eggs. It was like a salty explosion in your mouth with a bit of alcohol/cooking wine taste. We decided to shared everything since we had a very late lunch and was still somewhat full. So the portions were perfect for us. I would recommend ordering more for a regular meal though. The udon noodles were delicious and the flavors were good so I can definitely see myself coming back. But since I didn't really care for the uni here, I may just try the Mentai next time."
1/2/2020,20200102,3,4.34,"Maybe it's because I had high expectations but it wasn't that great. The wait was pretty long so make sure you come earlier to secure a seat. We had a bit of a predicament because this table of 7 was 8 names below ours but got seated before our table of 5, so we were kind of annoyed. Once we got seated, they took our order pretty quickly. I got the miso carbonara udon. It had a very smoky taste due to the bacon. It felt really heavy but still pretty good. I don't think it was worth the wait though. My other friends got the uni udon and they were expecting it to be better. It was good but not worth $18. They also thought it was going to be fresh uni but it was cooked. My other friend got the hot dragon udon and the flavor was good but the noodles were lacking. Overall, the flavor was good but not outstanding. It was heavy but not filling. I would come again if the wait wasn't as long."
1/2/2020,20200102,5,4.34,"WOWWWWW. This place is amazing! Their uni udon is where it's at. They don't skimp on the uni and the sauce is flavorful yet not overdone. I don't know how describe this one, but it has me licking my bowl well after I'm done. I've tried their bolognese and miso carbonara too and they are both fantastic. Their calamari tempura is a nice big cut and soooo buttery and tender. Their negi-toro don is also fabulously done. The wait is always around an hour, but we just put our names down and explore Little Tokyo a bit always making sure to come back 15 minutes before the anticipated wait time. I always go to Café Dulce and grab some bacon donut holes to-go. You have to be present when they call or else you'll be crossed off the waitlist."
1/3/2020,20200103,5,4.34,"AMAZING Udon! Great staff as well even if they're super busy! Hubs and I ordered the hot dragon udon and everything tasted amazing. It came out super fast and everything just came together. The broth was nice and tasty and the udon was nice. Everything tasted very fresh and I loved it. We waited a little while outside but like others say, it's worth the wait ! I also ordered the iced green tea and it was super refreshing. I usually dont like green tea at places but this one was delicious. I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back if we are in the area !"
1/4/2020,20200104,5,4.34,"This place is so delicious. I typically don't like udon, but the handmade udon here is perfectly soft and chewy. We came on a Friday night around 6, and waited about an hour for a table for 4. They come outside and call your name 3 times, and your group has to all be present to be seated. Pay close attention because it's hard to hear your name. We ordered 4 different udon bowls. You must try the Uni udon! It's so creamy, rich and delicious. Plenty of pieces of Uni too! The hot dragon udon was also delicious! The broth was rich and spicy, reminded me of the ramen soup. We also got the duck udon! Highly recommended, a lighter soup to balance out the creamy soups we got. We did not like the miso carbonara, I usually like fusion foods but missed the mark. It lacked miso flavor and was not a great creamy carbonara sauce. Overall, the wait can be long and disorganized but very much worth it for the tasty udon dishes!!!"
1/4/2020,20200104,4,4.34,"5 stars for the food, 4 stars for the atmosphere and experience. They open at 11:30, we got there at 11:15 and the line was down the block. They will not seat you until your whole party is there. I thought we would never get in but we did at the first seating - the space can hold a surprising number of diners. We were seated at the counter where we could watch them make udon noodles. Not super fascinating, mostly a lot of dough rolling . The tempo here is fast- quickly sit, quickly order, food comes out fast , bill is delivered, leave. I get it, there is a line outside waiting to get in so this makes a perfect place for a fast lunch, but not a social lunch outing. I would not come here for dinner for 2 reasons . 1 the rush and 2 the neighborhood isn't the best and parking isn't easy. There are people waving you into lots for $20! Also a parking structure across the street for $12 - other than that you'll need to walk and I wouldn't be comfortable doing that at night. So why eat here? The udon! Fresh and sooooo yummy. I had the shrimp tempura udon that came in a delicious simple broth with tempura flakes and green onion. For $4 more at lunch, we could add a small bowl. We got the nigiri - tuna poke. The shrimp tempura come on the side and are huge and delicious. They have many specialty udon and some with creamy sauce that I was advised could be rather heavy. I loved keeping it simple so I could taste all the goodness. Writing about it makes me want it again! You will feel the same- so be an early bird , get there early (I'd recommend at least 30 min before opening) and enjoy your udon!"
1/4/2020,20200104,5,4.34,"This place is awesome! We came 30 minutes before closing and we were worried that we wouldn't be able to get seated before closing time due to the large number of parties waiting before us. However, the waitress was really friendly and assured us that we would be taken care of! The waitress handed out menus to the waiting parties presumably so that they wouldn't take too long to decide on what to order once they were eventually seated. I had the uni udon and the Negitoro rice bowl and they both came out really quickly. I had a lot of uni in my bowl and was pleased with how it tasted. It was really creamy and the udon was cooked really well. If there was any complaint, it would be that there wasn't enough of it for me! The Negitoro rice bowl was delicious as well! The rice was really tasty and the fatty tuna melted in my mouth. I added a lot of the spice flakes and I would 10/10 order it again."
1/5/2020,20200105,3,4.34,"Went to this restaurant at around 6 and there was a long wait time. Something to keep in mind is that no reservations are allowed and your entire party must be present to be seated. I ordered the hot dragon after reading previous yelp reviews. The broth had a smoky flavor which was unlike any other broth I've had. The ratio of topping was off too; there was barely any ground pork and an absurd amount of bean sprouts. I got a soft boiled egg as an additional topping and expected them to add it into the ramen. Instead, they gave it to me on a separate plate, and the egg was cold. Could be a hot take but I thought that this place was only only ok... However I will admit that there are probably better things on the menu (I had some of the crab and egg udon my mom ordered and it was decent) so perhaps a second chance is in order."

1/6/2020,20200106,4,4.34,"The GOAT standard of udon is Marukame Udon in Waikiki, but this place is pretty good too!I ordered the Kakuni Udon (fatty braised pork belly with green onions). I really liked the texture of the noodles and the taste of the broth (definitely the best part). Flavor wise, I thought that the pork belly was just okay and I think I only received three pieces. Given the portion size, I think that the price for a bowl is a bit high. Whether it's fair or not, I'm comparing it to the GOAT that is Marukame Udon in Waikiki for price, portion size, taste, etc. I also ordered some tempura on the side: tofu, pumpkin and eggplant - all pretty good, but my favorite was definitely the pumpkin! Piggybacking off many of the posted reviews, the street parking around the restaurant is pretty brutal and if you come around peak lunch or dinner time, there will definitely be a wait! I parked in a structure about 3-4 blocks away and I think I waited for about 25-30 minutes around 5 pm on a Sunday night... which isn't too bad."

1/7/2020,20200107,4,4.34,Love udon! The broth was rich and flavorful. I would come back to try all the different noodles on the menu.
1/10/2020,20200110,5,4.34,"Tried the negitoro bowl, tuna belly bowl, mentai shiso cold udon, sea urchin creamy udon, and WOW everything was so bomb. The consistency of the hand-pulled udon noodles was incredible and even though udon isn't my go-to noodle dish... if it's made with this attention to detail and a fresh array of ingredients, I really can't complain. I can't wait to return and try the other bowls and udon choices. A tip for getting a table quickly is by coming not before the restaurant opens but in the middle of the day. We came at a random afternoon hour and there were only 5 waitlist spots ahead of us. Ironically, when we came 6 minutes after the opening, there were at least 11 spots. And make sure to stay nearby so that when the servers call your party, you won't get crossed off the list! Get a parking spot in the Judge John Aiso garage since it's much more reasonable compared to all of DTLA. After your udon meal, walk a few blocks back towards that garage and step inside Fugetsu-do for some amazing daifuku and mochi (and most importantly, a 1 hr parking validation pass). If you can feasibly finish your meal under an hour, you're all set for free parking this way."

Literally the usage of udon noodles and cream-based sauce (carbonara, Alfredo etc) is GENIUS. I was off putted by the idea first but bro it really comes through. I highly recommend the Sea Urchin Udon as well as the Mushroom Cream Udon. Both are fantastic choices. Will be looking forward to coming back here!"
1/11/2020,20200111,5,4.34,"My favorite udon place in LA. Stopped by on a busy Thursday evening. It took about a 30 minute wait for our large party to be seated. We ordered the creamy uni udon, duck udon, chicken curry udon, small tuna rice bowl, beef rice bowl and some beef rice balls. The uni is a must order if you love sea urchin. Its a creamy rich broth with some salmon roe at the top. You also get a generous portion of uni. The other udon's were delicious. Very light yet rich in flavor and the noodles had great texture. The small rice bowls are nice appetizers if you want something small. Overall, this place is a great place to enjoy some authentic Japanese dishes. It can be tight for some, but don't expect a long wait. Food comes out quickly and you can tell everything is really fresh here"

You can also tell that the udon is fresh by the nice texture it has as well as being able to see someone hand rolling and cutting up the udon by the bar.I got the Uni Udon with the pork belly rice bowl: super creamy with a good amount of that delicious uni seafood-y flavor. The pork belly bowl was okay, mostly used as a way to cut through the rich flavor of the uni. The pork belly though was really beefy if you're into that!My fiancé got the Udon Gratin with the Negatori rice bowl: the dish is usually made with chicken, but we added seafood and it made a big difference. A super cheesy, rich, and slightly heavy dish but the seafood gives it a good amount of flavor and different textures. The Negatori rice bowl was really good, tasted like a deconstructed tuna roll.

They make it fresh as you're ordering, and you can see the workers in the kitchen rolling/cutting dough, which is pretty cool. They do have some traditional udon (beef, kitsune, cold udon etc), of which I tried the sansai udon (cold udon with mountain vegetables served with cold dashi broth), and it was delicious, but the broth could have been more savory. Their highlights are some more fusion options such as miso carbonara, mentai squid butter etc. My mom had the mentain squid butter; the broth was quite interesting, and I think the fish roe added a very nice flavor to it. Service was extremely mediocre by Japanese standards. The waitress asked us if we wanted any drinks, we said hot tea. She came back with two ice waters, and had we not asked for the tea, she would never have brought them ""Oooo so you were the one who asked for the tea"". I don't think that would have been acceptable in any other Japanese restaurant. We also asked for ""a minute"" to read the menu. She came back in exactly 1 minute and asked if we were ready (hint: ""a minute"" does not mean 60 seconds in spoken speech. It means give people about 3-5 minutes because by 60 seconds, I only have finished glancing over the menu once). I wonder if it was this one particular waitress who was an anomaly - the other waiter who greeted us by the door was very courteous.Overall, it was an interesting experience, but I didn't leave craving for more."

1/15/2020,20200115,5,4.34,Went here for the first time the other week with my friend and my mind was absolutely blown. I got the sea urchin udon and it was amazing!!!
1/15/2020,20200115,5,4.34,"I love noodles. All kinds of noodles. Ramen, Soba, Lo Mein, you name it. But one of my favorite noodles by far are Udon. I just love the chewy texture of a nicely handmade Udon noodle. And the place I really enjoy is Marugame Monzo. You may be familiar with the cafeteria style Marugame Udon restaurants that are springing up more and more around Ca. This is the slightly more high end original spot in Downtown LA. Only table service and slightly more sophisticated udon varieties. There's still handmade udon (you can watch them being made by hand) as well as a variety of tempura. Some of their unique offering include a Carbonara Udon which I've yet to try.. but looks very very good. There is always a line here. ALWAYS. So if you're impatient then move along. Is it worth the wait. Absolutely. And a line is really good sign. I had the Curry Udon (as did my friends), various deliciously crispy tempura and everything was really stellar. Wonderfully chewy noodles, savory curry broth and perfect tempura. Udon Heaven! I'll be going back again soon."

1/17/2020,20200117,1,4.34,"My order of udon with clams was too little udon. They were short. Manager should train employees more. Some wouldn't scale quantity properly, but by eyes. First time I was satisfied so I came back but no more. The quality went down. The price doesn't much now. I knew udon restaurants in Japan."
1/18/2020,20200118,5,4.34,"Came around 6:30pm on a Friday. Short wait for a party of 2, maybe 15 minutes. Make sure you have everyone present when they call you, or you won't be seated.I ordered the sea urchin udon. It was amazing. The noodles were creamy, and the uni flavor came through better than I thought it would. There was suprisingly quite a bit of uni as well, maybe a spoonful. Cooking the uni got rid of the slimy kind of texture associated with raw uni. The cooked uni had the texture of like tiny little cooked fish eggs. The udon was so fresh as they make it in house. It had a nice bite to it, wasn't too soft or too chewy, and the sauce stuck to it pretty well. Towards the end, the cream gets pretty thick, and it gets really filling. The ikura helps to cut down the fat nicely and adds a salty kick to the dish. However, I wish there was more of it since the dish gets pretty heavy. If you're looking for something light, I don't recommend this. The portion was quite big, and considering how filling the dish was itself, it was definitely worth it. I would come on an empty stomach if you plan to get any of the udon with cream sauces. I would come again."
1/18/2020,20200118,5,4.34,"This is the number 1 Udon place in LA in my books. And one of my favorite quick food spots in LA. So good. Everything is fresh made, and top quality. I always get Tempura Udon, add a tempura egg and a tuna rice bowl. All great, no complaints. It's popular and gets really busy, so Its good get there before it opens and be ahead of a line."
1/19/2020,20200119,1,4.34,"So we were waitIng next door as one of the staff said we should because the line was an hour plus long. We also left our contact info. However when we went back to check in our status (which we checked a few times), Denise said it's not her responsibility to make sure we are by the door every second.Terrible attitude, terrible service, I'm not sure a why I would recommend anyone to come here."
1/19/2020,20200119,5,4.34,"Excellent cream udon, ended up returning twice during our 5 day trip. Absolutely amazing, try the creamy udon, well worth the wait."
1/19/2020,20200119,5,4.34,"Totally authentic Japanese Udon in Little Tokyo. They hand-make their udon noodles, which are chewy and delicious. They also don't take reservations, so prepare to wait in line. All the udon is delicious and some of them are unique like the tomato one. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"
1/20/2020,20200120,5,4.34,"After failing to catch Howlin Ray's before it closed, Marugame Monzo caught my radar for its high ratings and fantastic reviews. And so, we ventured off to Little Tokyo. Little Tokyo was poppin on a Friday night, with many people waiting outside at 8PM for their spots at the dinner table. Marugame was a perfect example of this, as my boyfriend and I waited 30 minutes before finally being seated. No biggie though, as the lady managing was really kind and respectful. The waiter inside was also extremely nice and had nice manners. I got the Seafood Tomato Cream Udon ($15) and my boyfriend got the Hot Dragon Udon ($14). We also had a Fried Calamari ($7) to share. The calamari was perfectly fried in a nice golden color. There wasn't a lot but each one tasted rich and not too oily! The Seafood Tomato Cream Udon was exactly how you imagined it to taste. Creamy yet slightly sour from the tomato taste. There are also bits of shrimp and scallops in it. It was the unique I was looking for. Delicious at first, but after having more and more, the cream gets heavy and I grew sick of it. The Hot Dragon Udon had an amazing flavorful broth which I loved if it wasn't for how spicy it was. Everyone was so nice here, and the food tasted of quality. I can see why this place has such nice ratings!"
1/21/2020,20200121,4,4.34,"My bf & I finally got around to trying the udon here at Marugame Monzo a couple of Saturdays ago. We came early around 11:30 and waited approximately 15-25 minutes. Restaurant space is small with some seating at the bar and a few tables, but interior is very clean and service is very fast.My bf ordered the Mentai Squid Butter Udon w/ lunch special rice bowl add-on (beef). This mentai udon has a strong fish flavor and was very salty after a while. My bf was drinking a lot of water. Their beef rice bowl was good, reminds me of better quality Yoshinoya. I'm not typically a fan of udon, so I ordered the standard Beef Udon to try as a gage for the udon here, and I enjoyed it! The broth was very light and the beef has good flavor (same beef as the rice bowl, I believe). We also ordered the Takoyaki, which was standard.Would come back again if I'm craving udon & willing to wait."
1/21/2020,20200121,5,4.34,"10/10 my favorite udon place of all time. The miso carbonara is perfect. The portion size is filling, and it goes well on a cold night. The noodles were soft, and the bits of bacon make for a perfect compliment to the base. The braised pork belly was amazing! I would honestly just go back here for this appetizer. I highly recommend trying it. It's soft and tender. There's a lot of flavor, and it pairs well with rice on the side. I honestly can't wait till the next time I come here."
1/21/2020,20200121,5,4.34,"There seems to always be a line outside and I understand why. The udon here is really good!! My friends and I all got the miso carbonara and it was delicious. At first, we thought the portions were a bit small for the price but honestly it was filling enough. Overall the sauce was really creamy and flavorful and the noodles were soft and had good texture. Worth the hype!!"
1/22/2020,20200122,4,4.34,"It's a good quicK lunch/dinner spot. We were there Sunday, so the line was not bad. We got seats right away and started ordering our food. The udon and tempura were good but not the beers in the world. I will not wait for hours for it."
1/23/2020,20200123,4,4.34,"+2018 or 2019: Parking is usually difficult in Japan town, so parking lots or street parking are the norm. We parked a bit farther away, but came here to eat after playing some games. My friend and I walked in on a random weekday. I guess they have a lunch & dinner menu, but we were seated right away. The decor was lovely and there were seats near the glass window to watch the chef's at work!1. Sea Urchin Cream Udon (4/5) - A bit too heavy for me. I don't think I finished the whole thing and had my friend finish the rest.2. Handmade Traditional Sanuki Udon (4.5/5) - I did like, but I would probably get a different and lighter udon. I remember liking the taste of the hot beef udon, but I might be more of a fan of traditional and lighter flavors.+2020: I learned to park closer, on San Pedro or I like to park at Joe's, since it's right across the street thanks to the Yelp reviews! :) The wait was maybe 10 minutes for 2 of us around 1pm on a Saturday! A lot busier, but people were coming and leaving. We were still able to view the workers hand-making the fresh udon, which was lovely! We were asked for our drink order and provided some time to look over the menu, since it was my BF's first time!1. Sea Urchin Cream Udon (4/5) - Soft & chewy noodles, mixed with sea urchin cream, and ikura (salmon eggs). Still heavy, but my BF reallyyy liked this dish! He said the texture of sea urchin has a creamy texture similar to that of cheese. ROFL. Not sure about the quality of the sea urchin, but it's about normal. I just prefer fresh uni.2. Add a bowl for $3-$4! - Negitoro Rice Bowl (4.5/5) was super soft, fresh, and had a lot of flavors as well! Something about fatty tuna, sweet mayo, and seaweed over rice just plays with you!3. Mentai Squid Butter Udon (4.5/5)- Seasoned fish eggs mixed in with butter sauce, squid, and onions. The dish was probably my favorite item so far! It had so many flavors and textures. What a fun combination! If you prefer a lighter option to the sea urchin cream udon and on the sweeter side, this one is for you!*Side-Note: I know the dinner wait is super long and they don't have reservations for whatever reason."
1/24/2020,20200124,5,4.34,"I used to eat Marugame Udon in Japan, the price you pay here is about same as I in Japan. Udon and soup is so good, you can add tempura or onigiri and it was about &11. Perfect for lunch!"
1/24/2020,20200124,5,4.34,"Wow!! Handmade Udon in house, excellent service, and delicious food. Prices are not too bad either. The pork belly is amazing, and other sides are too. But of course they specialize in Udon. So definitely try one of their many Udon dIshes. Everything is made with quality ingredients. I'll be back for sure!"
1/25/2020,20200125,5,4.34,First time eating there with hubby for lunch. Not bad of a wait for 2 people. The place is small but very welcoming and friendly. We both got their newest Udon on the menu. Hubby got the Fluffy Beef egg and I got the snow crab egg udon. It was delicious. Will definitely stop by again the next we drive to downtown LA.
1/27/2020,20200127,4,4.34,"Hubby and I were back here this past weekend...found ourselves in line 15 minutes before opening waiting patiently. After everyone got seated, the restaurant was probably still 1/3 empty. But shortly after, it did fill up.Because we were on a food tour, we decided to be conservative and only order two things. I cheated and added an ikura bowl to my order. I would recommend you skip the ikura bowl. Even though it was only $4 combo'd, I think it's still a lot of just a bowl of rice, one small shiso leaf and literally no more than 1 tablespoon of ikura.As for the noods, hubby picked a seafood tomato udon while I went with one of the seasonal specials crab and fluffy egg. The fluffy egg is what hooked me. I do have to say, though, that I ended up wishing I got something else. I preferred hubby's seafood tomato better than my dish. My main issue was that as the udon cooled, the soup thinned. Portions are ""manageable""...meaning, if you're hungry, definitely go with the double portion. Even with my rice bowl, I wasn't at capacity when we left.One complaint is the fact that they make it super obvious they want you in and out, swooping in on your table as soon as you have an empty food bowl or if you looked like you were done with your food, dropping the check as soon as hubby was done with his food (I was still eating). A dude took away hubby's bowl before I could ask him to leave it because I wanted some of the sauce. Same guy also hung out right next to our table chit chatting with a coworker...I could feel him looking over every 30 seconds to see if I was done with my udon. You can be sure the moment I set down my utensils, he pounced! All told, hubby and I were only there for 40 minutes.Anyway, great food but enjoy it quickly!"
1/27/2020,20200127,5,4.34,Such an absolutely delicious spot that you HAVE to go to. There's almost ALWAYS a long line whenever I go here. But it is well worth the wait. The udon is so delicious and the noodles and fresh and hand made daily. You can even watch them rollout and make the udon noodles. Everything here is absolutely delicious. I would eat here everyday if I was rich enough.
1/27/2020,20200127,2,4.34,"My first time here was in 2013. I remember being wowed by the food. I came back a few times and I was happy, however, this time only to be disappointed with the food. The quality of the food has gone down.The broth for the Uni Udon bowl was subpar. The Uni, which is one of their most popular items, was tough, not creamy, and not what you'd expect from fresh uni. The Uni Udon broth didn't complement the Uni well and my Uni Udon came lukewarm. Tempura can rarely be messed up in the first place, but they messed it up. The tempura was oily and tasteless.  Portion sizes were small and pricey (Uni Udon $17.95).  and not what you'd expect from fresh uni (maybe the cooking process/heat changed the texture? *shrugs*)Overall, the udon seemed way overpriced for what it is. It's not the same place as before. The quality of the food has gone down."
1/28/2020,20200128,4,4.34,"The noodles were freshly made, you can see the cook doing what they do for noodles here. Did the shrimp tempura bowl, really good both flavor. Also tried the shrimp onion over rice. Both were enjoyable."
1/28/2020,20200128,5,4.34,My all time fav place to eat in LA! a must try if you're ever in the area. I usually get the Miso carbonara udon.
1/29/2020,20200129,5,4.34,Miso carbonara udon was very good. Just tried a lIttle of the uni udon which was also very good. Udon gratin was ok. Too rich for meThe quality of the udon noodles is excellent.
1/29/2020,20200129,4,4.34,"Marugame makes their own udon noodles and you can tell that just from the taste. They are tender and delicious. You can also see the chefs making the udon behind the glass. I got the sea urchin creamy broth and my boyfriend got the carbonara. The garlic clams were really flavourful, but a little expensive for what you get. The sea urchin udon was good, it wasn't overpowering and had great balance. We also got tempura shrimp on the side. It was well done with a great crunch. If I came back again, I would definitely want to try a clear broth!"
1/30/2020,20200130,2,4.34,"The lunch service is way too rushed, my gf and I sat down for like 3 minutes and were asked 3 times if we are ready to order. Then we havent even finished our udon yet they drop off the check. When we leave they didnt say good bye or thanks like the other Japanese restaurant. Too rush!"
2/3/2020,20200203,5,4.34,"Marugame Monzo is by far my favorite udon restaurant. I'll gladly make the trip to Little Tokyo. The udon is handmade and cooked in house. You can even see the action in the kitchen if you sit in the bar area.Be prepared for a wait. Regardless of what time you arrive, there will most likely be a group of people waiting outside. I've even arrived right before closing at 9:45 PM and there was still a wait.My favorite is their Uni Udon! It is so creamy and hearty with a strong uni flavor. My boyfriend isn't a fan of uni so he opts for the Miso Carbonara, which is also very creamy with a strong bacon flavor."
2/6/2020,20200206,4,4.34,"Stop everything you're doing right now. You need this in your life: Mentai Squid Butter Udon. Do you want to feel like you're winning? This is the bowl of soup and noodles that you must order. Albeit, everything else looks good too. Marugame Monz is probably the best udon joint in all of Los Angeles. If you haven't been, then you're missing out! With so many choices of spots to eat in Little Tokyo, you must check Marugame Monz out. Note that this place does not do any take-out orders."
2/8/2020,20200208,3,4.34,"My bf hyped this place up for me and when I finally got to try it, it wasn't even all that to me!! Kinda disappointed actually because I didn't think the udon had much flavor. I mean it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. My bf seems to disagree and thinks its sooo good. Yes it was creamy and had a nice texture but it just lacked flavor. I also got the mini rice bowl and liked that better. Lol. Now that I could've had more of. Service was super fast. I think they just wanted people in and out ASAP because of how busy they were."

2/8/2020,20200208,4,4.34,"I'm not big on udon or ramen,so personally I though this place was gonna be an expensive let down. Surely,I was mistaken! This place is great,and is a great place for a leisure lunch meal with friends. I got the udon gratin,and I can say that is all I ever get when I go! It is always so well made,I feel that I dont need anything else to be satisfied. Will definitely recommend. But do come early,as the wait can be long."
2/9/2020,20200209,4,4.34,"This place definitely lives up to the hype that surrounds it! I came here on a Saturday night around 5:30 PM, and even though the restaurant had only been open for 30 minutes, there was a line outside and the inside was packed. We put our names down and were able to be seated within 30-40 minutes, which was honestly faster than I expected given the small amount of seating and the number of people waiting outside. Once inside, we were lucky enough to be seated at the window to the cook station and could watch them making the noodles by hand. I was here with 2 other people, and we all ordered different types of udon. - Shrimp Tempura Udon: the noodles were delicious and definitely the highlight. The broth was not super flavorful, and the tempura flakes that came on the top were really soggy by the time I got the bowl, which was disappointing. The shrimp tempura that came with it was crispy, though I wish it had come with tempura sauce. - Beef Udon: my favorite of the bunch! the beef was tender and super flavorful, the noodles were perfect, and the broth was great. I wish we had ordered a soft boiled egg for this because I think that would have made it perfect. - Carbonara Udon: creamy and heavy, this tastes just like the Italian dish. There are large pieces of bacon, as well. The portion of this bowl looked a lot smaller than the others as there is no broth. The service here was prompt with ordering and delivering the food, though they did not come by after to check on us or refill our drinks. Overall, this was a delicious meal. Parking is limited in the area to meters and parking garages."

2/12/2020,20200212,4,4.34,"Miso Carbonara Udon ~$15: Good flavor for carbonara as it had the right savoriness. The udon noodles were a good sub from the traditional carbonara one might get from an Italian restaurant. I enjoyed the pieces of bacon. My only knock is the amount of food one gets. I had to go to the nearby market to get an onigiri plus other items to fill me up. Nevertheless, I would get it again because of the taste."

This place is not too big, and very popular, so you're gonna have to wait no matter what! My favorite is the beef udon, incredible broth with thinly sliced beef, with whatever tempura you'd like to pair it with. The creamy uni udon is also a favorite, although quite a rich, indulgent dish that's better shared than inhaled by yourself. You're gonna wait if you don't come early! And even if you do, there's a line before it even opens."

We got the bukkake udon, mentai squid butter, beef with fluffy jidori egg udon, and miso carbonara udon, and one negitoro rice bowl.We all enjoyed the food and the ambiance was very relaxing and what you would want from a shop. The pricing per person is roughly $13-15 pre tax.Check it out if you're an udon fan. My personal fav was the miso carbonara because it was rich and creamy. Next fav would be the beef with fluffy jidori egg udon because the soup reminded me of a chinese egg drop soup."

2/16/2020,20200216,4,4.34,"Checking another place off my LA bucket list!We came for the sea urchin cream udon but tbh it was underwhelming. We thought that the sauce/cream would be uni flavored (instead, think Alfredo sauce but not quite as heavy) but really it's just the pieces of uni added in that gives the dish its name. This was my first time having cooked uni and I definitely prefer it fresh as the appeal of uni to begin with is its creamy texture, which is lost once it is cooked. The flavor was still alright though. The udon noodles themselves were thick and chewy and I loved them! Since we weren't too hungry we also got a negitoro rice bowl. Nothing crazy but hits the spot. It comes with a cute little scoop of fish and it's garnished with seaweed and mayo, a tried and true combo.We got lucky and came on a weekday night and since we were only two people, were seated almost immediately. I'm open to trying other dishes but I would not be willing to do the typical long wait."

2/17/2020,20200217,4,4.34,"I've heard such great things about this place from friends and been trying to make the trip to LA to try this out. We had a party of 8 and we were seated within an hour on a Sunday, which wasn't too bad. I got the Creamy Uni Udon since it seemed like that's what they're known for. My girlfriend got the Carbonara Udon and we also got to try the Curry Udon. Typically, I don't go for the cream based dishes, but I wanted to give the Uni Udon a try since it seems to be the star of the restaurant. It didn't wow me. It was good, but it wouldn't be something I crave or order again. My girlfriend got the carbonara udon and she really enjoyed it. It's also a creamy udon like the uni but it was had strong bacon flavor as oppose to an uni flavor. The curry udon was really delicious! It wasn't too salty as some curry based dishes could be. The udon also had really good texture and tasted really fresh. The portion sizes here are not that big. It comes out in a huge bowl but the actual food you get is not that much. One last thing that didn't excite me about this place, and this is all personal preference, is that their dishes are very lacking in protein. Most of the dishes is just the udon mixed with some sort of sauce. I tend to like my meals to be heavier in protein and this place just didn't do it for me. I did add an order of shrimp tempura but it was still not enough. It was a good meal but nothing I would wait an hour for. A definite must try but I won't be a regular."

Not going to lie though after a while it can start to feel a little heavy so I reccomend some pickled red ginger or something to cut the creaminess.

I have no doubt that it was an honest mistake and I wasn't mad at all, but when I brought it to another servers attention that this wasn't what I had ordered she replied, ""You didn't order this?

I love the taste and consistency of the broth/sauce, the texture of the Udon, and the saltiness of the Ikura and Uni pieces really complimented the overall dish! 10/10 would recommend this dish for Uni lovers. My SO got their creamy mushroom udon, which he said was also top tier!Marugame Monzo gives a combo for a donburi (Rice bowl) to go with your Udon for an extra $3/$4 depending which rice bowl you choose! I really love Ikura so I got the Ikura Rice Bowl for $4. It was simple and delicious! The negitoro udon had more ingredients, such as japanese mayo and eel sauce! Also very yummy!"
2/22/2020,20200222,5,4.34,"Wish they would expand their location or open a new one!! Waiting is the only negative part of this restaurant. It was my second time and I opted for the cold udon which was so good. The noodles were bouncy and all the toppings complimented the cold sauce. I also got a shrimp tempera on the side which was super crispy and delicious. My friends all ordered different things - miso carbonara, mentai squid, both fluffy eggs with snow crab and beef. They were all yummy. The miso carbonara is a little heavy for my liking but the mentai was a lot better and lighter. The fluffy egg reminds me of a donburi or gyudon? as it has a slurry sauce.Parking is terrible but it's Little Tokyo so it is to be expected."
2/22/2020,20200222,3,4.34,"Emmm.. food was flavorless, it was a very simple dish mostly watery. I didn't like the food too much. And I think that they are pricey. Customer service is good, clean restaurant, good located but parking is terrible. Probably I'm not gonna go back because it wasn't my type of food. Sorry."

2/25/2020,20200225,5,4.34,Really delicious udon! Luckily I went with my bro during not so busy hour so there was no wait.The sea urchin udon was good and I also got to try the new item from the menu and I love it!For lunch you can add a mini rice bowl of different kinds and I got the Ikura bowl and finished it all.I'll come back again and try the other items on the menu.
2/25/2020,20200225,4,4.34,"This restaurant is in the middle of a kinda sketchy strip mall but don't let stop you! The chicken is delicious. It's super tender! The chicken is covered in a sauce that you can choose the spiciness of. I got mild which had a nice flavor but wasn't spicy. I got the slider so the chicken was between two buns with coleslaw, pickles, and Dave's sauce. It was a great combo! The standard menu item is 2 sliders, but I ordered one and it was more than enough. They give you a hefty portion of fries and Dave's sauce goes great with them. PSA: try the chicken and fries with honey!All in all amazing fried chicken!"

2/26/2020,20200226,5,4.34,Hands down best udon ever. The wait wasn't that long far a party of two on a Saturday (Maybe 20 minutes?) but it is a snug place so get cozy. I got the butter squid udon and tempura and it was super good. I honestly don't have anything negative to say about this place! If you want dessert I'd recommend the mochi store like 3-4 stores down (on the right side once you exit)!
2/27/2020,20200227,4,4.34,"This place usually has a line outside, but we got here around 6:40 on a Wednesday night and didn't wait at all! I ordered the Hot Dragon Udon. It was just the right amount serving wise and very flavorful. The spice level was said to be a medium, but it was actually pretty mild, so don't be afraid of the ""hot pepper"" sign pictured on the menu.The food came out quickly, too. We were in and out in an hour, give or take. I recommend trying Marugame if you are in the Little Tokyo area!"

2/29/2020,20200229,2,4.34,All the great reviews had me to come to Monzo out of all the other udon places but it was a disappointment. The noodles didnt taste chewy at all and the broth was just bland and cold when served.
3/1/2020,20200301,5,4.34,"If you've tried Marugame in Hawaii or even their locations in the south coast plaza or Glendale galleria, you'll definitely like this one! This is a little different in that you are seated and you order from the waitress as opposed to standing and ordering in line. We ordered the miso carbonara - this dish was SO good! I usually don't like creamy foods too much but this was the perfect amount of creamy to be light and flavorful. We also ordered the curry udon - also SO good. Flavor was definitely on point for the curry and the udon isn't too thick that it doesn't absorb the flavor. I would definitely recommend this place!"
3/1/2020,20200301,5,4.34,"Try to get here early as there is a typical 20-45min wait. The staff are super friendly and the location is small and cozy.It is the best place for udon hands down! The quality of the food is unmatched. The udon noodles are hand made and flavor of their broths is well balanced. We enjoyed sitting at the bar to see the freshly made udon. It's quite a process to see. There are several different styles of flavors you can choose from, ranging from the simplest more traditional udon to a richer more creamy style.They also offer rice bowls that will are just done well. Although their udon is what they are known for, make no mistake, these rice bowls are just as delicious! If you or someone you are with are not feeling like soup this should be your next option. They may seem very simple but simple done well can be packed with flavor!As for the pricing, it is extremely reasonable for the quality you get. Udon can range from $9 to $14 and the rice bowls are $5 to $10. Any additional add-ons you would like will cost extra but it is often not necessary unless you feel like a change of pace. We had the clams and the fried rice was just perfect for the kiddos. Parking can be found across the street in a ""Pay Per-Hour"" parking structure or you can find street metered parking which can be free depending on the time. Definitely worth your money!"

Got here around 7pm on a Friday, and the wait wasn't bad - around 30 minutes, was expecting more of a line but no complaints! We ordered the uni (sea urchin) udon, hot dragon udon and the mentai squid butter udon. The uni udon was well balanced - creamy sauce with fresh uni sprinkled throughout and topped with fish roe. The hot dragon had a lighter clearer broth and the perfect amount of spice for a good kick without overwhelming the other flavors. The mentai squid butter udon had a soupier broth than expected, not as much of a cream base as the uni, but otherwise a light squid taste and not too fishy. Overall, udon was freshly made in house and perfectly chewy!Parking can be a bit of a hassle in Japantown but well worth it for fresh udon!"

3/3/2020,20200303,5,4.34,"Not much more can be said about Marugame that hasen't already been written. Each bowl starts with perfectly chewy noodles which are made in house. Signature udon dishes like the miso carbonara and the sea urchin udon are perfectly creamy, luxurious, and full of umami. For those wanting a lighter, clear broth, both the kakuni (pork belly) and beef options are excellent. The new beef with fluffy jidori egg udon has that extra layer of egg savoriness making this bowl quite satisfying. I usually stick with the hot or signature options but they also have cold udon if that's what you're looking for. This place can get busy at times, but it's definitely worth the wait."

They have hand made noodles and a dizzying array of choices with which to serve them. If I lived nearby I'd be back weekly to move through the menu. There are also lots of other interesting looking Japanese joints along the same block. Park in the Aiso lot one block away for $3!"

Our waitress was attentive and really nice.I ordered the mentai squid butter udon, and my friends ordered the miso carbonara udon and beef udon. The squid butter udon was delicious, and it had a good amount of squid. The broth was flavorful (although a little too salty for me), and the noodles were so fresh. They had a chewy texture, and I could definitely tell they were handmade. I tried some of the miso carbonara, and it was rich and creamy. This is also a very popular dish that I would probably try next time. The prices were pretty reasonable for each dish, and the portions are more than enough. It's a unique spot to try if you're in Little Tokyo!"

The broth was very flavorful, the Udon was excellent and all meals were hot upon arriving to our table. The server was knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant."
3/7/2020,20200307,3,4.34,This place was really good but I really don't like that you're not allowed to order takeout and they give small portions of food. I came in starving and I was still hungry after one little bowl of miso carbonara. It was delicious but it just was disappointing that I was still hungry after waiting for 45 minutes to be seated.. they really need to change that.
3/8/2020,20200308,5,4.34,"Noodles are my favorite food in the world, so I don't say this lightly: BEST UDON I HAVE EVER HAD! Please please do yourself a favor and venture out to Little Tokyo for the best udon of your life. If you don't like it, take it to-go and mail it to me please hahaha! The mushroom cream udon was absolute heaven. At first, the portion looked kind of small and I was worried I'd still be hungry after, but the cream sauce is so filling and so good. I was stuffed. For fans of mushrooms, this is definitely for you. The cream sauce had an intense, rich cream of mushroom flavor with hints of Asian spices. The Japanese mushrooms were delicious and plentiful, and the sautéed onions added great flavor to the mix. The handmade noodles were chewy and thick! I nearly drained my bowl--the cream sauce was so good by itself and with the noodles. It took my sister and I over an hour to get to Marugame Monzo and we waited for about 45 min before being seated, but I'd gladly do it again."
3/8/2020,20200308,5,4.34,"First time visiting this place, and my goodness it was so packed that night, (which is totally understandable because it was a weekend night for dinner). One of my friends had recommended this spot because they were known for their udon and broth. I was really eager and excited to try it out so we waited for about 45 mins before getting stated. We had a party of 5 that evening and I cannot get over how much I loved their food! I can happily say that this was probably the BEST udon I have ever tasted yet! I ordered the carbonara udon and I was so content with my experience here. The broth was rich and had such a creamy taste that I fell in love with the dish. The udon noodles were cooked to perfection and it was just enough of portioning for me to leave with satisfaction. Pricing for this place was fair and affordable, I have no objections for their menu. Pros: Service was so quick and the servers were very attentive made sure our meal went well. I also loved their chicken karaage appetizer; the chicken was super juicy and the sauce paired with this dish was really delicious! Cons: This spot is really close to little Tokyo so the area is really busy during the evenings. Most people will have a hard time finding parking, but there are local garages that may cost $10-15/all day parking. If you're lucky you might even get a street meter parking! **10/10 recommend trying this udon spot if you're in the area. I am amazed and home to come back to try their other udon soups. * NO REGRETS!"
3/10/2020,20200310,5,4.34,"There are a lot of great places to eat in LA. If you told me I could only pick one to eat in LA I would probably lose it... and then eventually pick Marugame Monzo. I will never say no to someone suggestion this for lunch or dinner. If you like Udon at all, definitely come here.When you do decide to come here though, get ready for a wait. If you're anywhere near peak hours, it's probably going to be 30 minutes to an hour wait. Get in, put your name down and be ready to hang out with the folks in the Daikokuya line. If you're feeling brave, cross the street for a quick walk around Japanese Village Plaza, but don't go for too long. If they call your name and you aren't there, you'll give up your spot. It's Little Tokyo so there's a very good chance you're going to be in a parking lot. I'm hesitant to post this because I love how easy it is for me to park currently, but here it is. The Aiso Street parking lot is the best (in my opinion) for eating in this area. You don't have to navigate the crazy Little Tokyo Mall parking or fight the crowded Japanese Village Plaza. If I can avoid driving on 2nd street in Little Tokyo, I am extremely happy.When it comes to the food, I'm totally biased here but I love carbonara. So my favorite dish here is going to be the Miso Carbonara Udon and I will always get it as a combo with the Negitoro Rice Bowl (the Pork Belly Rice bowl is a very close 2nd). It's Japanese noodles with an italian twist, what's not to love. An Udon + Rice bowl combo is pretty heavy so prepare for a bit of a food coma.It's a pretty small restaurant so probably don't bring the whole squad for this one. Each table seats about 4... maybe you can squeeze more but you'll run out of space pretty quick."
3/10/2020,20200310,5,4.34,"I come here often, at least 3 times a year if not more sometimes. It has never failed to be consistently good and the udon quality is always top notch (you can see it being handmade with precision). Ambience and service is of really great quality and the food is always comforting and very satisfying. My favourite (and usual) order is the mentaiko squid butter udon and the tempura egg is a guilty pleasure. One of my top recommendations for anyone who is in LA either visiting or residing!"
3/12/2020,20200312,5,4.34,"One of my favorite restaurants in LA! I've gone here 4 times. I've tried the carbonara udon, udon gratin, seafood tomato cream udon, and the sea urchin udon.I felt that the carbonara udon and udon gratin were a bit heavy, but I loved the sea urchin udon and seafood tomato cream udon. Definitely a super unique restaurant because of the various udon options they have. I personally prefer udon over ramen, so this place hit the spot for me all 4 times. I highly recommend the seafood tomato cream udon bc the sauce isn't as heavy and there are more toppings than a lot of the other choices. Service is great, usually very busy and had to wait about an hour on a busy night before. There's a parking structure right across of it!"
3/13/2020,20200313,5,4.34,"First time trying this place, I arrived at 4:45pm and there's already a short line outside. I asked the staff for recommendation and decided to try the miso carbonara udon. Got my udon within 5 minutes! Quick service! The texture of the udon is chewy and the sauce is creamy. Portion looked small at first but it was actually just right for me. But for people who are hungry or usually eat more then it might not be enough. What makes this place special is if you sit at the counter you can watch the staff hand making and cutting the udon right in front of you! Takeaway: - Come early if you want to avoid the line- Price is so worth it with the food quality + service + overall experience you get from dining in. - Staffs are attentive - Would definitely come back to try out other items on the menu"
3/14/2020,20200314,5,4.34,"Best noodles in town! I didn't think udon can be this tasty, but honestly the noodles are perfect. Fluffy and soff."
3/16/2020,20200316,5,4.34,"This place is definitely worth the hype! I've been trying to come here for the longest time, but lines have always been too crazy. Thanks to coronavirus, I finally got to try it with no wait at all. Although it was sad to see a usual 1-2 hour wait restaurant, with hardly any customers, the food was still amazing. We got the beef udon and the mushroom cream udon which were both hearty and flavorful. The mushroom layered so nicely with the creamy sauce and the udon was perfectly cooked. I'm over the long waits at restaurants, but I would definitely wait for another bowl of creamy udon."
3/19/2020,20200319,5,4.34,"Handmade udon noodles made in front of you sets Monzo apart. I'm not even a huge udon fan myself (unless it's hōtō), Monzo's noodles were amazing when I tried. The wait can be fairly long at times, but it seems well worth it given the quality and flavor. I went with my family so I was fortunate enough to sample a few of their plates. It's safe to say you can't really go wrong with what you order. A great spot in Little Tokyo!"
3/24/2020,20200324,3,4.34,"Meh. Been coming to this place for the past 4-5 years and it's gotten old real quick. The wait nowadays is just ridiculous to get in and it's honestly not really worth it. Past few times I still leave fairly hungry. I've tried everything on the menu already and the dishes that stand out are the uni udon (surprise), the mentai cream udon and the Vongolè udon. All are great when imagining a udon Italian fusion. For regular hot udon, I'd recommend the kakuni. This time I ordered the miso carbonara and it was allllllright...nothing to rant or rave about. If you want this type of flavor and a better portion size, just hit pasta e pasta by allegro down the street. I would say the ambiance in here is decent. Great date night, but the tables are close af so you can always hear what another table is saying...as I mentioned before. Meh."
3/29/2020,20200329,5,4.34,"This is the best udon place I've ever been to. The lines are often long but it is expected because the food is so good. I love the variety of flavors they offer. I would recommend getting Uni udon or miso carbonara. I honestly didn't like udon that much until I tried this spot. It is definitely worth trying. The only annoying thing about eating here is finding parking nearby, everything else is amazing."
3/31/2020,20200331,5,4.34,"UNI UDON! That's the only thing I usually get here because its the best thing here in my opinion. I tried the Mentai Squid Butter, Mushroom Cream, Miso Carbonara but UNI just hits it for me everytime."
4/9/2020,20200409,5,4.34,I went to this location with my cousin and my aunt. We went on a Saturday night and the wait was about an hour. My cousins been to two locations one in Costa Mesa and this one. She says the LA location is better. We didn't order any appetizers but ordered three different udon noodles. Gratin udon was really good but my favorite was tomato seafood one. Although I wanted to try their uni udon but my cousin doesnt like that too much so we ended up picking carbonara udon instead. The guys are cooking the noodles right when you order and you can see all the chefs inside the kitchen. The place is fairly small and you have to have everyone there in order to get seated. Tables are kinda close to each other but it doesnt bother me. Parking is a hassle since you have to pay for parking but its worth the hassle I think for some good udon noodles. Next time I go I will have to try to uni one since thats my favorite. Definitely a must place you should visit if you are near LA area. I am waiting for all these craziness to go away so I can go back to this place with my cousin again. Yum yum yum.

5/9/2020,20200509,5,4.34,"My favorite restaurant in Little Tokyo, hands down. My go-to order is the mentai squid butter udon, but the miso carbonara is a close second! The only downside about this restaurant is that the wait is really long and they don't do Yelp waitlist (but you can always walk around Little Tokyo when you wait), and parking is a little bit of a pain but it's always worth it! Would recommend this restaurant to anybody!"
5/10/2020,20200510,5,4.34,"Marugame Monzo is one of the best udon places I've ever tried. Not only does it have great traditional udon choices, they have many tasty twists/fusions like the infamous creamy uni udon and the udon gratin. They make the udon noodles in house and right in front of your eyes at the bar seating which is super fun to watch!(Review is regarding the last time I visited in December 2019)At that point, I believe the hype has died down so wait times aren't as crazy as they used to be. My friend ordered the miso carbonara udon and I got the hot dragon udon. Both were delicious! The homemade udon had a perfect chewiness to it and the broth in mine was so good. It was perfect for the cold winter weather and left me extremely satisfied in the end. Her udon's creamy sauce was also super light and wasn't as heavy as many cream sauces you'd have in Italian pastas. Very fulfilling for its price point and leaves me wanting to come back for more!"
5/21/2020,20200521,5,4.34,"This is my and my family's favorite udon spot in LA! This is a small spot located next to Daikokuya - definitely make sure you put your name on the right waitlist. We typically come by during off hours to reduce our wait time. Usually 3-5pm we don't wait longer than 20minutrs to get seated in a weekend. If you come during typical lunch or dinner hours, you can wait upwards 1hr for a small party. Their udon noodles are so chewy and soft, at the same time. We've tried multiple items on their menu and they've all been hits! My favorite is their special gratin udon, and my boyfriends favorite is the creamy uni. When we came closer towards closing time, it seems like the loaded up his udon with more uni than the typical portions...FYI: store does not allow take out (typically) so you'll only be able to eat in the store."
5/24/2020,20200524,5,4.34,"The food is super good. I had the carbonara udon and it wasnt too thick, it was really good with the udon noodles and we also had the pork spare ribs, the juice from that was really good too. I wanna try the other dishes they have, they seemed interesting"
6/8/2020,20200608,4,4.34,"Monzo is finally open again! 12-8pm, takeout only. Got duck nanban and curry udon takeout. Arrived around 6:15pm and there was one open street parking space in front: first space, 10-min limit, food pickup only. I knew takeout wouldn't match the dine-in experience, but I'm sorry to report the food is a little off. The duck which used to be succulent was a bit chewy. While I don't mind carrots in Japanese curry stew, I wasn't expecting it in the curry udon. The onions were wedges rather than long, thin slices. It's almost as if the cook got confused and thought he was making stew. I'm wracking my brain to remember what they replaced in the curry. There is definitely something missing. Longer green onion slices? Shimeji, Shitaki or Enoki mushrooms? Regardless, the curry and duck udon broth were both as good as I remember. I'll return in a few days to try again."
6/12/2020,20200612,5,4.34,"*PRE-COVID-19*I went to Marugame Monzo one afternoon & it was very crowded. We had a big party but the most we waited was about 20 minutes max. We were seated & ordered & food came out pretty quickly!! I got the Curry Udon and it was very good!! Creamy & had that Japanese Curry taste (alike from Coco Ichibanya's curry). I also tried my friends Miso Carbonara & that was very flavorful and creamy as well. Both are well worth their prices & even though the portion may look small, they're still filling."
6/13/2020,20200613,5,4.34,SO YUMMY. Also say YES to extra noodles. They're huge portions. And perfect for rainy days in LA. Also their customer service is speedy. Great place for your hour lunch :)
6/14/2020,20200614,5,4.34,"We have always been fans of this place. My all time favorite is the uni cream udon & my husband's is the mushroom cream udon. We love the sides to like the tempura soft boiled egg and fish cake, the chicken skins, etc. We waited impatiently for them to open up during the quarantine and finally opened We love eating here during lunch because of their specials. The rice side dishes are amazing too. (Old picture attached)Our To-go order (clockwise): duck nanba udon with soup separated, tempura soft boiled egg and tempura fish cakes, uni cream risotto, uni cream udon, & beef jidori egg udon. Mentai cream udon in the middle. The tempura is best eaten fresh but the cream udons absorb the sauce and may arguably become even more delicious. We are big fans. Highly highly recommend"
6/18/2020,20200618,5,4.34,"Karaage 5/5Tempura (fish cake, shrimp, chicken, shiso) 5/5 Shiitake Tempura 4/5Agadashi Tofu 4/5All hot udon I've tried 5/5This is my all time favorite udon restaurant. Nothing else compares (in Southern California). I'm always excited to visit Marugame Monzo. I haven't been disappointed yet by a bowl of soup from here. The udon is prepared perfectly every single time. The bite and chew of the noodle is perfection. Every broth I've had has been very savory and flavorful. There are no reservations for this restaurant and your whole party must be present to be seated. I only try to come only on weekdays to Marugame Monzo because otherwise the line is quite long. And even on weekdays there is a wait. But it is worth it!"
6/18/2020,20200618,5,4.34,"This place was amazing! By far the best udon we've ever had. The braised pork belly was great, too. The service is excellent, and the place has a really vibrant, funky atmosphere."
6/24/2020,20200624,5,4.34,"The best uni udon I've tasted. I could probably eat two servings. It has a very creamy consistency, but not heavy. The udon is freshly made and you can you see through the kitchen and see the udon being made. There's usually a wait and seating is limiting so he prepare for that."
6/27/2020,20200627,5,4.34,"Honestly, this place is comparable to some of the udon restaurants I've visited in Japan. My favorite is the uni udon and curry udon! I prefer the ""creamy"" udons to the traditional udon with broth here, because I don't think the broth itself is too much different from other places. Come early as there is a bit of a wait during dinner times, but come hungry because the portions are on the large side :)"
6/29/2020,20200629,4,4.34,"I heard from a friend that Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles is not as crowded and bustling as it used to be. All of the little restaurants (sushi, ramen, etc) do not have the big crowds waiting outside to eat. I asked my little sister, Truc, if she wanted to go eat Marugame Monzo with me! We both love the udon shop but hardly eat it because there is usually a long wait (and we hate waiting). So let's go out and dine-in! As long as we practice safe precautions and proper hygiene, we should be okay..As soon as we walked in, I waved the host down and told him 4 people. He asked to check our temperatures.And as soon as we sat down, we were instructed to use the QR code to read the menu on our phones. I really like this idea! Completely contact-free menus by using up-to-date technologyTo my right, I can see the chef roll out dough for the udon. They're known for making fresh udon right then and there!I was also excited that I also got to re-visit this place with NO WAIT. As much as it was great to dine-in without having to wait over an hour, it was also sad to see how empty the restaurant was. It even felt more empty because they sat us every other table to maintain the social distancing guidelines. There was also multiple hand sanitizers throughout the restaurant for hand hygiene.Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon. Hard crushed sea urchin cream sauce udon topped with ikura (salmon egg). This used to be my favorite specialty udon for years and the reason why I always return to Marugame Monzo. However, today's sauce was not as thick and creamy as I remembered (although the flavor is still there). The udon is soft and chewy. The urchin is slightly charredMiso Carbonara Udon. Creamy white sauce and egg tossed udon with bacon and hint of Miso flavor. This reminds me of a fusion dish with Italian influence because of the eggy carbonara sauce. It is almost like the Pasta Carbonara dish but with a hint of miso.Mentai Squid Butter Udon. Seasoned fish egg butter sauce with squid and onions. This became my new favorite and tastes as good as I remembered it! There is plenty of small crunchy eggs in the butter sauce. The squid is cooked perfectly as it is soft and just a tiny bit chewy. The butter sauce is also very flavorful and rich.Mapo Tofu Udon. Japanese style Mapo tofu sauce on top of udon. Everyone wanted to try this dish! We just made mapo tofu with rice last week and were talking about how to make mapo tofu. We decided that mapo tofu on top of udon sounded interesting and figured, ""Why not just give it a try?"" While the flavor of the mapo was there, it was definitely not spicy at all! Not having the spicy spices in it that is iconic of mapo tofu dish was disappointing. The only spice came from the black pepper.Paying for the check was the same routine - They give you the paper check and you sign. Also!! Only credit/debit cards accepted! No more cash..Pros:-No wait!! It is so empty.. -Obeys social distancing guidelines with every other table seating -QR code for menu options -Temperature check arrived the door -Food is still good! -Udon still freshly made in front of you Cons:-Street parking is easy now cause everyone is scared to go out Tip: Accepts only CC"
7/5/2020,20200705,5,4.34,"After many years I finally got to try Marugame Monzo and it lived up to the hype! I got the miso carbonara udon and the Karaage fried chicken. The miso carbonara was thick and creamy (maybe too thick for some people) but SO FULL OF FLAVOR! And for the Karaage, I've been trying to find one that matches what I had in Japan and this is by far the best! The pieces of chicken were a bit big for my preference but the crispiness and flavor was amazing! For Covid-19 they are doing mostly Togo orders but I demolished this in the car and it was still piping hot when I picked it up. Will definitely be back!"
7/8/2020,20200708,2,4.34,"Drove all the way there to try the sea urchin udon and squid butter one along with the karaage fried chicken. Taste wise, everything pretty decent but service wise they didn't give us any chopsticks or any utensil, not even napkins. I cant believe I had to tip them when it was just takeout. So other than the chicken, we had to wait to go home to eat. Pretty disappointing. The chicken was good, a little salty ngl. The udon might have been soggy by the time we went home, but the sea urchin udon was definitely much better than the squid butter one which was way too salty."
7/11/2020,20200711,4,4.34,The hot udon bowls are worth the wait as it's scrumptiously savory and very nice noodles.
7/12/2020,20200712,4,4.34,"Great food, we had 3 different kinds of udon and it was delicious. Uni, Tempura, and the Beef. The 4 stars is for the the waiters gloves. I expected the gloves to be changed after the table was cleaned. But same gloves to service the new utensils, new food. I didn't think that was appropriated."
7/17/2020,20200717,4,4.34,"Always enjoy supporting in Little Tokyo but situation called for an Uber Eats order than a typical call in so it led to limited options.Cold Udon is the move while it's so hot out and the beef specialty seemed like the obvious choice. We also went with the funkier butter mentai with squid. The beef broth packed a punch even though it looks like not a lot. There is so much tasty beef and fresh daikon in here. Mentai squid was not as creamy as I thought - it was a broth but definitely buttery! I could have drank it all after I was done but stopped myself. It will also freak people out if they are not into the idea of fish eggs. Both dishes had delicious udon. I will say that these are small and pricy. It doesn't really fill you up if you're a guy tbh. The boyfriend definitely had a sandwich later in the night after dinner. For the ladies, depends on your appetite. More than just OK but I'm not huge on the price for what you get - 3.5 stars!"
7/22/2020,20200722,4,4.34,"Heavily instagrammed in my first year at USC by lots of my friends so I finally got a chance to go! I ordered the Uni sea urchin cream udon because really I went here to try creamy udon just like everyone else. It was pretty good; for the price I expected it to be a little creamier but the consistency of the sauce was a little watery; almost like a warm milk. However, the uni flavor was complemented very well by the ikura salmon eggs that always make me feel like I'm consuming Nemo's brothers and sisters. pretty good though; if I went again I would order the carbonara udon which is another cream udon for cheaper than the uni. If you've ever tried the uni pasta from EMC seafood, this is basically that with a lighter consistency."
7/23/2020,20200723,5,4.34,Sooooooooo freaking good! Always come here when I'm in the area. Highly recommend the uni and the pork belly appetizer (dinner only)
7/23/2020,20200723,5,4.34,"Great place, consistent. Favorites include bukkake udon, miso carbonara udon, mentai squid butter udon, takoyaki"
7/28/2020,20200728,4,4.34,"The quality of the udon here is the best in Los Angeles. The menu is limited because of COVID but my favorite items include the chicken skin, negitoro bowl, and the uni udon. The noodles are so light and have a nice bite to them. I can't finish all the udon and it still tastes good the next day. I come here for the signature udon flavors and I hop over to Marugame Udon if I want the traditional hot/cold udon flavors (less wait time)I hope that they continue to offer take and delivery after COVID, because the udon still tastes absolutely delicious. I would definitely order from here more often if they offered take out because the wait times are normally around an hour or so. It's also super difficult to find parking in Little Tokyo. That being said, I would not order any of the fried items like the takoyaki or assorted tempura for take out because they aren't packaged very well (bundled up all together sitting on top of each other) and it tends to get really soggy."
8/6/2020,20200806,5,4.34,"The best udon noodles in LA. Their signature dish like the sea urchin, carbonara, and beef udon is the best ones. It's fairly pricey but it is worth the try."
8/9/2020,20200809,5,4.34,"Note, that my review is for a takeout order. I ordered through Caviar and got the Uni Udon. I guess it was as good as it could be for takeout! The sauce was creamy and good, def fatty but worth it. The UNI they had in there was delicious and I've never tasted such soft udon noodles in my life.The UNI meat def gets 5 stars!The tempura was crunchy and the batter was great, it was still good when it got here!Tofu was soft, but I'd skip that for to-go next time. Same with the egg. You can tell the egg was cooked to perfect consistency though.For takeout, this wasn't bad, I can only imagine how good dining in must be!Everything cost about $35. Expensive but it's for a unique flavor!"
8/13/2020,20200813,5,4.34,"Love Love Love this place. My favorite is their uni and also their curry udon! Their service is very good, when I went last time, they had something in the udon so they took care of it, asked if I wanted a new one and also took the price out of the check!"
8/15/2020,20200815,5,4.34,I've always wanted to try this place as I live literally 5 mins away. Finally decided to pick up the uni sea urchin cream udon for lunch and LET ME TELL YOU I AM IN LOVE!! I am a huge uni lover and I've tried uni pasta/udon before from various places and I think this place is my favorite. It's so creamy and you can also taste the uni. Not to mention you can also see chunks of uni in the udon. This dish is reasonably priced and pickup was super easy. Will definitely come back and try out their other dishes!
8/17/2020,20200817,4,4.34,"The last few times we were in J-Town, we really wanted to try this place but never actually got the opportunity until this past weekend. There are so may different eatery places out there that it's hard to choose, once I saw Uni Sea Urchin Udon, I was sold. Uni is one of my ultra favorite things to eat! The only reason this place didn't a full 5 starts is because the Uni was cooked. I honestly thought the steaming hot udon would be topped with fresh uni, instead it was cooked uni and just tasted like chicken. Everything else, however was very tasty. The Udon was perfectly cooked, the broth was seasoned beautifully, with a just the right amount of creaminess where it's not too heavy. My husband ordered the the Hot Dragon Udon that had more of a spicy kick to the broth. They do serve their Udon in a generous size bowl. I would definitely be back and try other items on the menu. The location has very limited outdoor seating, I think two or three 4-seat tables with an umbrella on the sidewalk. Service was fine, nothing outstanding or memorable."
8/22/2020,20200822,5,4.34,"First time trying this place and had to get it ToGo... lemme tell ya I'm shook! It's so so so good... even with waiting almost an hour before eating. I can't wait to go back and have it at the restaurant! The udon was literally to die for along with the sauce. I gotta say I liked the sea urchin one better than the miso carbonara just because the miso ones a little bit heavier. It's more something I'd like on a rainy winter day. The sea urchin one was perfect tho! Light but packed with flavor. Ordered ahead and picked it up -- super simple process. Oh, and the tempura was amazing! I got the shrimp and mushroom tempura they were still so crispy even Togo!"
8/25/2020,20200825,5,4.34,"This review is long overdue from last year. I have never tried this style of udon and on my virgin visit, after much anticipation, I must admit to a the most orgasmic udon experience. I had the mentai squid udon and went to food heaven.. Worth every minute of the long wait (I did go off peak after the main lunch hours so that shaved some time off). Definitely lived up to the hype in my opinion!"
8/29/2020,20200829,4,4.34,"I've heard wonderful things about this place and it does not disappoint. As it was quite warm, I opted for cold udon, specifically the Beef Bukkae Udon which was perfect for the warm summer night. The flavor of the beef mixed with the cold udon was exactly what I was looking for that evening. It might have had a little too much daikon for me but overall still very delicious. Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes next time. I did try the outdoor dining during COVID. The space is tight, only able to seat 2 parties at a time. But pick-up is a great option and many people were doing this option when I was dining out."
8/30/2020,20200830,5,4.34,Absolutely love this spot. This is my number one udon spot and we'll drive from 30-40 mins away just for this!
9/4/2020,20200904,3,4.34,"Interesting take on udon/carbonara (can't tell which I'd rather pick). Apparently they use egg noodles which tasted good, but felt like I could've made my own for a fraction of the price. Bacon plus some Alfredo and udon noodles came to about ($15); creamy miso carbonara udon.This spot received tons of reviews and their main dish is the uni creamed udon. That I for sure did not try and uni just is not my thing. But it was good nonetheless and filled me up. You can park right out front and grab food it's pretty quick. Only 5 minutes wait time. I was able to get about 2 meals out of my dish but probably won't have any cravings in the near future. Maybe for those who love uni I'd suggest it...Enjoy!"
9/5/2020,20200905,1,4.34,I ordered a uni sea urchin udon today and extremely disappointed as there is NO uni in it at all. Called and received an excuse saying what I ordered is just a uni 'cream' udon. Are you kidding me?? $22 for cream?? I've bought it before and I know it should have uni in it. This restaurant is trying to be dishonest with their food and customers.
9/10/2020,20200910,5,4.34,This place was amazing! The udon noodles were so tender and flavorful definitely recommend!
9/13/2020,20200913,5,4.34,Stopped by this place while visiting LA and this was one of the best udon shops I've been to and that's counting Japan's udon as well. Super friendly staff and nice outdoor seating. I would 100% recommend the Mentai Cream Seafood Udon and fried chicken. Without a doubt I would come back again if in LA.
9/14/2020,20200914,5,4.34,Still obsessed with everything here. Even post-COVID. Got my usual mushroom cream udon and karage. Both were delicious even with take out! OUTDOOR SEATING! This whole street blocked off a part so restaurants can have outdoor seating. Great idea! I would def try eating out here next time!
9/14/2020,20200914,4,4.34,"Seafood udon. Sit down and enjoy it. It's my favorite item here. I once went twice in one week, it's that good (pre-Covid) the line outside is worth the wait. I'm always big on eating in restaurants with clean restrooms, says a lot about the all around care the business is pursuing. They pass the test. I would love for one to walk in and the restaurant be larger in size, but I guess that would take away from the family vibe which makes this a very special place!"
9/16/2020,20200916,5,4.34,"Had a chance to visit this place during my trip in LA and had a wonderful dinner here! Since it's Sip it's all outdoor seating and thankfully the line on a Wednesday night wasn't too bad. Got there around 6:25 and we're seated about 20-25 mins later. I had heard that the udon noodles here were great and that's what I was really excited to try here. I ended up ordering:*uni udon- this dish I was told was the specialty of this restaurant and it did not disappoint. The broth was rich creamy and very delicious. I enjoyed every bite! The udon noodles were also soft in texture and tasted delicious. Overall I would go back here just for this dish. It was simple, unique yet very tasty and I would highly recommend one to go try it again!"
9/18/2020,20200918,5,4.34,"Its tough dining out during Covid 19. They do have a limited menu. They staff wears face mask and gloves, they sanitizer in between guest.Of course we all know this about Marugame, the food is yummy and yes the udon is still freshly made and hand cut. They were the busiest restaurant on the block. I am sure there is a wait during dinner. They also do take out if you dont want dine there."
9/22/2020,20200922,5,4.34,"I came here on a Friday night with two other people. It was slightly packed but that's a given because it was Friday night. It's a very small place, you would order inside and pay before you get your seat and food, which makes sense. The waitress/hostess was very nice and she gave really good recommendation. I ordered the infamous uni creamy udon, my bf order beef tataki udon, my friend ordered the vegetable udon. We were able to get seated within 15 mins, not bad. We were able to get seated within 15 mins, not bad. They sanitized and wipe down everything super quick.The food came out super quick, maybe less than 10 mins. OMG let me tell you, the uni .... BOMMMB AF. I don't like uni but the sauce covers the taste and it's subtle taste which is good for me. My friends all told me they liked their order as well, they were too hungry to even tell me how good it was. Definitely worth the a visit next time I come down from the Bay Area."
9/26/2020,20200926,5,4.34,Delicious! I got the gratin seafood udon and Julia got the uni sea urchin udon. I would highly recommend a traditional udon if it's your first visit but if you've got two orders to have definitely get the gratin udon. We also got the hot dragon to go for dinner tonight... it smells so good!
9/26/2020,20200926,5,4.34,"Awesome food and service. Well prepared for social distancing and all staffs are wearing masks. Felt safe to eat at the outdoor seats. Had urchin udon, mad tiger udon and takoyaki. Urchin udon was my favorite it was really delicious. Two other dishes were also very tasteful."
9/29/2020,20200929,5,4.34,"Still up and going during Covid. They have a small Seating area outside. If you don't mind the noise from the busy street on First and the theatrical homeless people, go for it."
9/29/2020,20200929,5,4.34,"We went out to eat at a different spot on this particular night but didn't realize they were only taking reservations so we ended up driving around LA trying to find a spot to eat and we ended up here. It was a nice surprise because the food was delicious. We ordered the tempura appetizer, carbonara udon and beef udon. Definitely recommend all three! I loved the beef udon so much, I ordered a bowl to go. The staff was also friendly and the wait was not long. They sanitized the chairs and tables after each customer left so that made me feel better. Outdoor seating was well spaced out and you order inside then they'll bring the food out to you. Nice spot and I would definitely be back!"
10/5/2020,20201005,4,4.34,"Suprisingly underwhelming. Lots of reviews raving about the Uni Cream Udon here. I love Uni Cream with noodles so of course I had to make a stop here. First off, its not the best. The dish is good, but it is lacking in uni flavor. That may be because they don't really grind up the uni here. So what you're getting is more like a creamy udon topped with uni, rather than a Creamy Udon that has uni flavor infused into it. If you're an Uni lover I'd recommend it, because this dish simply has Uni in it, you will like it. Luckily for me, I am from Seattle and my favorite spots for Uni noodles are there."
10/9/2020,20201009,4,4.34,"Lookie here fellow yelpers, I'm not into udon in particular. I hate waiting. It's just not my thing for any kind of food, but I'll give this place kudos for the handmade component, and really good tempura. Their udon is served in many various ways, from traditional to... more traditional to... deep traditional, the types you can get in Roppongi or some hot spots in Tokyo. Get a specialty udon, and a side of tempura. Really, it's a can't miss if it's a first timer thing. But I mean, I don't crave going back there at all but I definitely enjoyed my meal."
10/13/2020,20201013,5,4.34,"Omg this is has to be my number 1 favorite place to get udon! My husband and I came to LA for the weekend and wanted some good udon, when we came across this restaurant! It was busy but we got our table within 15 min! And we sat outside underneath a tent.I love creamy broth udon and so I tired out their special which is the uni sea urchin cream udon and my husband got the shrimp tempura udon! Both were fantastic and delicious! The broth from the sea urchin was creamy and a lot of flavor. The shrimp tempura broth was light and flavorful! We also got the assorted tempura, which was delicious because the tempura was light and crispy! I highly recommend coming here and getting one of the signature udon dishes!! Definitely would come back again!"
10/20/2020,20201020,5,4.34,"During my LA date, we stopped here for the udon Carbonara and it was delicious! We also got the pork belly rice bowl . :)"
10/24/2020,20201024,5,4.34,"I've never been here on a weekend but during weekday lunch when they were open for dining before covid, it was busy but I never had to wait long for a table and normally would get a table immediately. Maybe luck was just always on my side. Recently I placed an order for takeout and it only took 10 minutes for it to be ready for pickup. I've tried the miso carbonara, cold udon and beef udon. All were seasoned well. The noodles were fresh and the texture was perfect. I'd have to say the miso carbonara is what I crave the most. The staff is hospitable. I highly recommend this place!"
10/28/2020,20201028,5,4.34,"I love Marugame Monzo! Idk how many times I've been here but it's good and worth the wait every time! (Parking suckssssss but where in LA does parking not suck... there's a parking structure right across the street next to the small japanese hotel)Ive literally tried every single dish, and I think they're all really tasty! The uni udon, red dragon, Wakame (forgot official name), carbonara, beef, cold udon, they're all sooo tasty. I love how tasty the housemade udon noodles are, and the soups are great.Unfortunately, due to covid, they're not serving the nigitoro plate which was my all time fave :( so sadThe service is always great, never have had an issues. I highly recommend this place because they need all the support they can get!"
11/1/2020,20201101,4,4.34,I ordered creamy sea urchin udon ramen and I must say it was very creamy and dreamy Oh man!! It was really delicious. Worth every buck they charge!!
11/2/2020,20201102,5,4.34,"my husband and i went here since he was craving noodles. so glad for that and we ended up here. he got the beef and fluffy jidori egg udon. i just got the beef udon. i thought the broth was really good. it was super light and full of flavor! and the noodles was perfect texture. we got this spicy ground pork bowl. that was really good and it was spicy which i loved!! it was really good. i was sad when my husband finished it, that means no left overs. i can't wait to go back here!!"
11/4/2020,20201104,5,4.34,"I love Marugame Monzo! I have been to their restaurant for dine-in pre-covid and recently did takeout. They make their noodles fresh in-house and you can tell! The texture of the noodles is absolutely perfect and has that right amount of bounce! I ordered the cold bukkake udon and it is my favorite by far. Since it's been hot lately, I've been craving cold noodles and this blew me away. The beef was flavorful and the cold broth packs a punch of flavor. I also ordered the shrimp tempura, mushroom, eggplant, and fishcake. All of these delicious. The takeout packaging was very secure. Overall I had a great takeout experience and I can't wait to get more takeout!"
11/5/2020,20201105,4,4.34,"I got their uni udon, and it was absolutely delicious. The fragrant after taste of the uni and the creamy sauce were such a delight.The only reason I docked a star was because I would have really loved to get more fresh uni on the dish itself. The pieces we got were cooked from the infusion, and while this presumably worked its magic with the delectable sauce, it left me craving some more."
11/9/2020,20201109,5,4.34,"Food and service is terrific. Took me and my friend here to eat and the workers are extremely kind and patient. Their uni udon is amazing and so is their tempura udon. There are a lot of places to be seated and none of them are too close to each other. Overall, I would come back again to enjoy more of their dishes."
11/11/2020,20201111,5,4.34,"The uni udon here is to die for. It's super creamy and honestly just a huge fat and carb bomb which is probably why it's so good lol. Tbh I would've preferred some fresh uni, but it's still good nonetheless. The carbonara one is also really good. I would honestly visit more often if they opened a location a bit closer to my area, the drive to LA can be pretty bad sometimes lol"
11/14/2020,20201114,3,4.34,"Marugame Monzo specializes in very unique types of udon, mainly creamy flavored ones, that few other restaurants make and serve. I really like the uniqueness of the concept, but in reality... I'm not such a big fan of the taste. I've tried their squid mentai udon, uni udon, beef and jidori egg udon, and their tempura. I gotta say the squid mentai and tempura was pretty good, but what places actually makes BAD tempura?? Overall, I think the issue is just that the soup bases for all their udon is just wayyyyy to creamy. I like the original more brothy types of udon better. Also, when its that creamy, its hard to make it HOT, which is something that I expect from the udon I eat- so these ones comes out kinda lukewarm. Finally, all these unique flavors just don't go well! As an example, the beef and jidori egg tastes better in like the ""don rice dishes"" because its flavor goes well with bland rice, but not really with a bowl of cream soup- the flavors clash!  In terms of ambience, they're doing outdoor seating now because of COVID. They do a pretty good job of social distancing so I have no complaints on that end."
11/15/2020,20201115,2,4.34,I've been coming here for awhile and usually am very satisfied with the food and service but this past time neither was too great! The broths weren't labeled and they forgot the shrimp tempura for the shrimp tempura udon. I didn't think that would be something I would have to double check!
11/16/2020,20201116,5,4.34,Uni udon is amazing.  Never had anything like it. A must try. The broth was super creamy and flavorful and noodles are the beat udon noodles I tried.
11/16/2020,20201116,5,4.34,I just love this place so much! They are always friendly and fast weather i dine in or order takeout.
11/19/2020,20201119,5,4.34,"The noodles here are just amazing. I got my order delivered and it took nothing away from the experience as the food was well packed and still hot upon arrival. My wife and I ordered the Uni Udon and the Mentai Butter Squid Udon along with an order of assorted Tempura and Chicken Karage. I'd probably skip on the Tempura next time as that's the only item that didn't survive the delivery process so well and was mushy but that's of no fault to anyone really, it's just how it is.The Mentai Butter Squid was the star of the show for me. I added an egg and seasoned fish eggs -- both were a good choice. The buttery brother is outstanding and nothing like what I normally expect out of Udon. My wife preferred the Uni w/ an egg and borrowed some of my fish eggs. The Uni Udon is also delicious but very heavy and will likely fill most people up long before they finish the bowl. The Karage is very good. Juicy and crispy on the same level as Suehiro's Karage which up until now was unsurpassed by the many restaurants we've tried -- but then MM comes out on top with the seasoning. Highly recommended.My only complaint is that I didn't order extra noodles so that I could have enjoyed both broths the next day as there was still quite a bit left over and I hated to pour it out."
11/22/2020,20201122,5,4.34,"Delicious! We got take out and it was still delicious! They pack the noodles separately and both dishes were still extremely hot after a 15min drive home. The food was perfect and my only hiccup was the pick up experience, but I understand things are tough on the restaurant staff right now. My fiancé ordered the mushroom cream udon bc it had a lunch deal with small rice bowl. He probably wouldn't have chosen this flavor it if it wasn't a deal, but was so good! Rich but not too heavy and udon was still nice and chewy. I slurped up all the cream soup I got the beef and jidori egg rice bowl and it was my kind of heaven. So perfectly soft on the eggs and perfect salty/sweet/savory flavor balance with fresh green onion. This is one of my favorite dishes and they made it perfectly. Even for takeout!"
11/24/2020,20201124,5,4.34,"Finally got a chance to try out this spot now that Little Tokyo isn't quite as busy as it was pre-Covid and it really lives up to the hype. Parking is expensive as per usual in LA. We were seated within 15 minutes of arrival in their outdoor tent setup and our food was served shortly afterwards.I ordered:Takoyaki (5/5): LOVE their takoyaki! They were served piping hot; the batter was light and crispy on the outside and perfectly gooey on the inside. The kewpie mayo, takoyaki sauce, and bonito flakes gave this appetizer incredible flavors.Mapo Tofu Udon (4/5): Didn't quite get the spicy flavor that mapo tofu normally has but could overlook that. The silken tofu paired well with the sauce which had a good amount of minced vegetables and meat. Their udon noodles had the perfect firmness and texture."
11/24/2020,20201124,5,4.34,"It was my first time visiting and trying this place out. Currently, they have outdoor seating along with the other restaurants on the same street. I felt safe that they kept sanitized pens for customers to use and clean tables to sit for dine- in. The food is delicious and their udon noodles are perfectly cooked! I was able to try a cream soup udon as well as a beef udon. Both were great and I would definitely come back again!"
11/25/2020,20201125,5,4.34,"Food was great! Our food was ready in a very timely manner, which was astounding considering how busy they were at the time. My friends had the Shrimp Tempura Udon and the Beef Rice Bowl, while I had the Miso Carbonara Udon. We had no complaints! The Miso Carbonara was very light and creamy, and as for the Shrimp Tempura, the noodles were nicely cooked and the broth tasted great. Definitely coming back here soon whenever I'm in Little Tokyo:)"
11/30/2020,20201130,5,4.34,"Marugame Monzo never disappoints!Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon (5/5) - I love uni and I absolutely love this dish. The uni flavor is light and the salmon roe adds a little saltiness and smokiness to the cream. My favorite restaurant and my favorite dish!Takoyaki (5/5) - The takoyaki was flavorful, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. No complaints here."
11/30/2020,20201130,5,4.34,"I have not left reviews for a long time, but this time I really wanted to share a good place and delicious cuisine. I am a fan of Japanese cuisine, and my husband supports me in this, I have long wanted to eat good noodles! A friend advised my husband, said a good place and great prices and portions, which is also important! And here comes Bingo !!! We had a wonderful time and ate deliciously, Noodles with beef are now my love, I have wanted a nutritious broth for so long, and I was happy with everything! You can also positively order Miso carbonara udon, it will also not leave you uninterested , there is good beer on the menu, in general my rating is 5 out of 5 !!!"
11/30/2020,20201130,1,4.34,What happen to Monzo? The noodle was horrible. I got Uni cream Udon which has been my favorite for a long time. But it's changed. Taste of cream was same as usual but noodle was disgusting. Getting frozen Udon noodle at Marukai is much better.
12/3/2020,20201203,3,4.34,"I want to love this place but every time I go I can never finish and have to take my meal home. Sounds like a great problem right? I mean I'm still hungry after I leave its just that the majority of the broths are SO rich I can only take a few bites before I just can't anymore.After my last order I won't be coming back, but still three stars because the ingredients are quality and I know people who do actually enjoy the dishes here so I feel like this is more of a 'me' problem and less a 'them' problem.Parking here is all street or you can pay in one of the nearby lots."
12/5/2020,20201205,5,4.34,"When my OC peeps hear me rave about ""Marugame"" they usually think I'm talking about Marugame Udon at South Coast. While also considered a great spot in my book, I'm actually talking about another udon shop, out in the heart of LA's Little Tokyo, called Marugame Monzo. Monzo is next level as 1) they make the udon in house so they have a ""QQ"" texture (like boba LOL) and 2) their udon flavors are out of this world, not something you've probably come across before at your typical Japanese restaurant. Though this is just an update to a previous review, I'm here again to praise their uni and mentai squid butter udon, except this time under the circumstances of COVID 2020. I'm glad to say that they are still both marvelous! Their takeout quality is as good as when you were to eat it dining in as when I inhaled it in the car, I was reminded of the good ol' times when I visited them almost a year ago. Like before, the dishes were presented well, very flavorful, ingredients were fresh, and the portions were still more than fair (as is the price)! The food met my expectations in every way so I was very pleased! Now on to service..... we called in the order 10 minutes before they opened and they were able to put it all together in about 20 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. No too bad! Pickup was relatively easy as they prepared the food in time so all we had to do was come in and pick it up without any waiting time or contact. The staff was very friendly and wearing masks/gloves when we arrived so that was a plus. All in all, Monzo has still got it down to the tee so don't let COVID stop you from ordering a meal that will surely satisfy your tastebuds. They're amazing, and it's great to see how they can consistently deliver good quality food and service during these times!"
12/6/2020,20201206,5,4.34,The food is amazing and even with COVID they still provide the best service for to go orders. Highly recommend the Udon Gratin. Or the original udon.
12/7/2020,20201207,5,4.34,"Best udon in LA! Since COVID closures, I have ordered as take out and it's just as good to-go."
12/13/2020,20201213,4,4.34,"I went here with a group of 8 pre-covid right as they opened for lunch. The moment we walked in, they saw our large group and immediately started moving tables around to accommodate all of us. Talk about service! The interior is intimate and definitely reminds me of noodle shops in Tokyo. I've now been here a handful of times and while I've tried a lot of the menu, my go to is the hot beef udon soup. The real star at this restaurant is the hand made udon noodles so be sure that your order entails this."
12/14/2020,20201214,4,4.34,"I finally tried it!!!! I've been waiting to try this place for over 2 years.Ordered takeout since it was COVID, and we got the mentai squid pasta and the uni udon. Both were absolutely delicious and it was way more filling than I anticipated--probably because the sauce was really heavy and rich with flavor. I would come here again once I feel like it's safer to go to Little Tokyo again."
12/15/2020,20201215,5,4.34,"Dishes at Marugame Monzo are delicious! I've only been here twice, but everything I've eaten was extremely flavorful. The first time I came here, I waited about two hours because I got caught in their busy dinner hours, but, on my most recent trip, I came right when they opened for lunch and only waited about 20 minutes. My suggestion would be to come early to beat the crowd and, if you do have to wait, you could easily pass the time by visiting the many shops in the surrounding area.The dishes I've had here are the mentai squid butter udon and the mushroom cream udon with chicken. The mentai squid butter came with pieces of squid and bits of fish roe on top of a creamy, buttery sauce. The mushroom cream udon had a variety of different mushrooms mixed in with the creamy sauce. You get a choice of adding chicken or seafood for an additional cost, so I opted with the chicken. Both dishes were extremely creamy, rich, and flavorful.Marugame Monzo is definitely worth giving a try. Although the wait time can be a bit crazy, I honestly believe their food is worth the wait."
12/15/2020,20201215,2,4.34,"I placed an order for chicken curry udon delivery via Uber Eats.I hastily, and confidently, but prematurely, gave the delivery service as well as this establishment a five star review, on Uber Eats, for the food and finalized it and submitted the review.Then I started eating the curry udon. Now, i don't take giving Japanese establishments mediocre or poor ratings, because I know they take it dead serious.The udon was good, the rich curry broth was delicious. The toppings, seaweed, radish, red ginger, were great. What was not good was the chicken meat. It's safe to assume just about anyone can taste the difference between chicken that was cooked when fresh, from chicken that was either frozen too long, or somehow kept thawed in refrigeration too long and getting close to turning, and lost the fresh flavor only to be replaced with old, somewhat foul and off tasting flavor. I have a pretty sensitive palate, so maybe my taste buds magnified the taste, but the chicken was without a doubt, off. From this genre of food, I am very very surprised to have this experience.Anyway, we didn't get sick, but the chicken was simply not pleasant to eat. All other ingredients tasted fine.Management if you read this, take note, you need better quality control on your chicken meat, somewhere along the supply chain or your kitchen.Maybe mine was an isolated case. I don't know."
12/16/2020,20201216,5,4.34,"I really wanted to try this place for the longest time. The first time I came, the wait was too long and I had to go catch my train. I eventually did come back another day, coming when it opened. The place was already packed. The perfect Thai spot!!! So clean, and seems ""upscale"" but has very reasonable prices and the food is REALLY good. Service was excellent. Wait staff were friendly and helpful. I ordered the udon with clams. The broth was flavorful and just the right amount of Udon. Perfect portion to leave some room for dessert. You can't beat their dinner special - appetizer, soup or salad, entree, and dessert."
12/20/2020,20201220,1,4.34,I ordered the Uni Cream Udon takeaway on 12/19/2020. A disgrace to the word cream. The cream was literally water. I've had the Uni Cream Udon several times before and it was not even comparable. I'm super disappointed and feel sad I wasted $20 on coloured water + noodles. Just a heads up to anyone else going here to avoid their takeaways!
12/28/2020,20201228,5,4.34,Honestly hands down the best Udon outside of Japan. Even during COVID and having takeout I was floored. I loved this place pre-covid and still do. Please keep them in business!
12/29/2020,20201229,5,4.34,This is best place for us on period in my humble opinion.  It's been here forever and especially now there is no long wait. Before the pandemic I was there with my brother and we ordered 5 entrees and they were all good. Handmade noodle is always a welcome addition here. Servers and service is
1/2/2021,20210102,5,4.34,"You better believe that the hype for Marugame Monzo is REAL! The udon is amazing as well as the service and that is going to keep me coming back.I've only been two times but I can definitively say that it is one of my all time favorite udon spots. The Miso Carbonara Udon is BOMB! It's extremely rich, creamy, and decadent. The sauce is sweet, unctuous, and packed with flavor. The udon noodles are the perfect texture with the perfect slurp factor and bite. It can't get any better than this! My only complaint is that the portion is kind of small. Whenever life is back to normal, I would love to continue to support them and return with friends to try more of their menu!"
1/3/2021,20210103,5,4.34,"I first ate here a few years ago, and thought their udon was good. Today, I returned with my family, and OH MY! The best udon I've ever had, no question. All four of us had different dishes, two of us had hot, two cold. Each one was delicious in their own way. Uni Sea Urchin Cream, Mentai Squid Butter, Cold Udon with Soft Boiled Egg, and Mad Tiger udon dishes ... All were excellent. The udon noodles were al dente. Broths in the hot dishes were yummy. I also had a pork rice bowl, and that was very tasty too. Attentive service. Certainly will return to MM in the future!"
1/8/2021,20210108,5,4.34,"I told my sister I was craving creamy udon and she recommended me this place. The sauce is creamy and thick, the noodles are soft, and the bacon just ties it all together. I ordered the Miso Carbonara Udon. Tastes as good as it looks!"
1/10/2021,20210110,5,4.34,when i say marugame monzo is one of my favorite places for udon i mean it. the wait (esp for dine in) has always been hella long and still is post quarantine. but its worth every single minute of the wait. its much faster for to-go though.we got the mentai squid seafood udon and i loved how creamy it was and rich the flavors were. but despite so the udon was still super bouncy and just the right texture. i hate it when my udon gets too soft because of the broth. the sauce was soo good and just wrapped every noodle so well.the cold beef bukake udon was the perfect contrast to the creamy seafood udon. the broth was refreshing and i loved the radish that went with every bite. the green onions and beef added so much flavor and texture to the bite. i couldnt help but keep wanting more. we decided to make this one double portion because its a personal favorite!right now theyre to go only but i cant wait to come back and dine in again. theres something about the udon coming out fresh from the kitchen that makes it that much better.
1/10/2021,20210110,5,4.34,"I've been coming here for years. I'm usually not a fan of udon, but udon here is one of the best. My favorite is Mentai Squid Butter Udon. Big portion. Worth the price. The takeout order still tastes good and is fresh!"
1/11/2021,20210111,5,4.34,"This review has been severely overdue since I've been coming here for years now. I found monzo desperately looking for a place that could fulfill my craving after my trip to Tokyo & this was it! The shrimp tempura udon is so light & perfect. I can't get enough. Ever since COVID I'm pretty sure they changed the shrimp tempura, but honestly the noodles & broth are enough on their own. I hope the original tempura will come back, but either way I'll be continuing my support for this place!"
1/11/2021,20210111,5,4.34,"Best ramen we've found in the downtown area, and we've tried many."
1/13/2021,20210113,5,4.34,"Handmade Noodles, Great Broth, Awesome staff. I love this place. Its one of those places that if someone was visiting out of town and they're like what's something i can't get I'd bring them here. Pre covid you'd have to wait in line outside. No to go orders. But service and staff were quick and food was consistently delicious.Udon Gratin with seafood is my #1 choice but they have it off the menu for now since it doesnt travel easily. (usually service in a pan as pictured). P.S. One of the fanciest bathrooms in little tokyo."
1/24/2021,20210124,1,4.34,"They have standard Covid safety measures (hand sanitizer, masks, table to block off entrance, etc) which is good! Takes about 15-20 minutes for takeout.I've always heard good things about this place and the uni cream udon so ofc I had to give it a go! However, after trying it I was disappointed. It was a smidge under $20 for just this dish and the portion was ridiculous. Yes uni can be expensive but I was expecting more noodles. They should really consider getting smaller containers as well since it's deceiving to the customers and would also be in their benefit. The container looked to be half full as if someone ate half of it and I took home the leftovers. The ""cream"" was thin and watery and barely covered the noodles. The only positive thing is that the udon was bouncy and had a good consistency (I believe all their noodles are hand made in house but I could be wrong)"
1/25/2021,20210125,5,4.34,"The Sea Urchin Udon here is literally one of the best udons I have ever tried! A few years ago, my friends and I really wanted to try this place out. We went to LA to try it out and it became one of my favorite Udon restaurant. This place is very popular so we did have a long wait time after putting our name on the list, plus it was a weekend. I've gone on weekdays and the wait is not as long and sometimes I get seated right away. Also usually street parking is available and free on weekdays :) I tend to always ordered the Sea Urchin Udon, which is one of their most popular dishes. I got to say this dish is a game changer for me. Literally one of the best udons I have ever tasted. I have been coming back to this location ever since and the consistency and quality of the food is always the same. TOP TIER!!! The noodles are handmade and texture is perfect. The Sea Urchin sauce and meat is so good. One of my favorite dishes to eat is fettuccine alfredo and this dish would be like a soup version of it. Their side dishes are good too, like edamame or karaaga, but did not make an explosive impression, but was tasty as well. I definitely recommend coming here! This place is one of the only places in LA that I am willing to drive all the way to LA for."
1/25/2021,20210125,5,4.34,I am not a fan of cream pasta or cream soup or anything creamy but wow here? I gave myself a challenged ordered cream uni pasta oh my godbest pasta i have ever tasted so good. I hate cream pasta but i cant say I hate this pasta. I plan to visit every weekend here to eat this dish only so good.
1/31/2021,20210131,5,4.34,"1/30/2021- outdoor dining is open! We got here around 5:30 pm and to my surprise, was able to grab a seat without a wait. They have about 20 seats outside. At night, they turned on some heaters since it was a chilly evening. Service- they came to check on us frequently and made sure we didn't need anything. You order and pay at the front of the restaurant, they seat you."
2/2/2021,20210202,5,4.34,"A little gem in Little Tokyo that lives up to its name and the hype. I've gone to this place twice and I have been impressed both times. The first time I went, I tried the mentai cream udon and the second time, I got a simple shrimp tempura udon with my partner getting the beef bukkake. I'd say they were all solid choices for its rich flavor and the yummy broth, but I do think that you should get the cream udons for the unique Marugame Monzo experience. I think for some, the portion may not be enough with just one bowl of udon, so might be helpful to order something extra. Be aware though! The store is extremely tiny and can only seat a few. You'll find yourself waiting outside most of the times (which is terrible when cold) and also right in the middle of the sidewalk off a road. It's also a little difficult to eat and talk inside the store because of how loud it is, so it's not the best date spot in my opinion. Excited to visit again when covid ends and the weather warms up!"
2/4/2021,20210204,3,4.34,"I was convinced to try this just by reading the reviews, I ordered Uni Udon and was disappointed to receive a big bowl which was very deceiving because it was just a tiny portion inside I feel like I received a lunch special portion size, it's not worth $22‍. Taste is just ok."
2/5/2021,20210205,4,4.34,"been here multiple times but didnt get the chance to write them a review.so i came here and had a togo order. called ahead over the phone and quoted 15 minutes.i got mentai butter squid udon and fried chicken for a party of two. fried chicken was uhmazing. mentai butter squid was good.order indeed was ready within 15. drove home and ate it.happy tummy, happy me.would i come back? i would say so."
2/14/2021,20210214,5,4.34,"We've been coming here for a while now, and this place never disappoints! We ordered the mentai cream seafood udons and made them both combos (beef mini rice bowl and mentai mini rice bowl) for an additional $3 each.Despite their smaller than average portions, the flavor profile of the udon was spot on; the noodles were fresh and soft and the broth was creamy, but not too heavy. The udon filled me, but my boyfriend needed the rice bowl to be fully satisfied. With their current COVID situation, we had to place our orders before being seated outdoors. All staff were wearing masks and we felt very safe when dining!"
2/14/2021,20210214,4,4.34,First time here and it was amazing even during covid!! Came here on a Saturday afternoon no wait you ordered and paid for your food before you get seated. Food came out super fast and their creamy udon was so bomb. Would recommend their uni udon! They also check your temp before you order inside the store. Can't wait to come back and try their other udons!
2/15/2021,20210215,3,4.34,"Great Udon, but they skimp on their takeout portions. I spent around $30 for 2 servings and received enough food for 1 person (and barely at that)."
2/16/2021,20210216,5,4.34,This is one of the best spot for cheap quick udon you don't need to wait more than few minutes to get your noodle as you order at the counter and sit downThey so got Other stuff such as rice balls and fried tempera and chicken
2/26/2021,20210226,5,4.34,This place will not disappoint! Been here several times. The food is delicious and so flavorful each and every time. The customer service is on point and the servers answer all your questions. It's obvious they enjoy their job and take pride in it. I recently ordered via phone (due to covid) . When I arrived food was ready and hot. My favorite dish is the shrimp tempura. The shrimp is big and the batter doesn't overpower the shrimp and def not doughy. This place owns up to the hype for sure. Can't wait to revisit.
2/28/2021,20210228,5,4.34,"This place is ELITE. Hands down the BEST udon I've ever tasted. I loved the creaminess of the sauce that paired well with the thick fresh udon. I'm not much of a seafood eater so I can only vouch for the carbonara udon, but I'm sure the seafood options are just as amazing. The bacon bits added the perfect amount of saltiness to pair with the dish. It was the perfect lunch portion size and I would 100% definitely recommend this place to everyone."
3/7/2021,20210307,5,4.34,Finally trying this udon place in LA. I am amazed by how delicious the food was. Highly highly recommend you all to go with the basic Carbonara. It never disappoints you!!! Will definitely come back to try more dishes here! :)
3/9/2021,20210309,3,4.34,"We came here for the Uni Udon~ I would actually give them a 3.5 stars because the experience wasn't bad. The uni udon was good here but lacks flavor compared to other places. The cream sauce had a subtle hint of uni flavor but the actual uni itself was overcooked and had no flavor. We also got the Mentai Squid Butter Udon, 2/5. The squid was overcooked and the overall taste did not have any flavor."
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.34,Not a fan of univ but the udon was great! Just enoug uni flavor with the creaminess of the sauce is good. The pork rice bowl was delicious too! Great place for take out
3/12/2021,20210312,3,4.34,We got to-go to eat in the hotel. Uni cream udon was great! The mixed tempura was okay. It was really greasy (most likely cuz they fried at too low of a temp) and they didn't include squid like it said on the menu but the shiso was good. The duck udon soup was also only okay -- my husband said the broth was too salty.
3/13/2021,20210313,5,4.34,"I dined here a while back, and feel bad that I never gave this place the review it deserves! The miso carbonara udon is to die for. I think about this dish a lot, and will always order a carbonara udon whenever I see it on any menu. And of course, none of the ones I've had match Monzo's. It's soooo creamy, so bacony, definitely not a dieters meal haha. But it's worth the calories. They seem to have a limited covid to go menu, I'll have to try it out soon!"
3/14/2021,20210314,4,4.34,"I've tried both their shrimp tempura udon and beef udon. The udon itself is good, but I wish it wasn't so expensive to order extra sides of ""jumbo"" shrimp tempura."
3/14/2021,20210314,5,4.34,Open on street during covid. Stopped by last week and must try the Matcha IPA from Kyoto. Food is always stellar here. A go-to across from Miyako Hotel
3/15/2021,20210315,4,4.34,"For dinner, udon seemed like an attractive fare. Rather than the bog standard chicken or kitsune udon, however, I decided to sample Marugame Monzo's avant-garde renditions of udon. Parking around Little Tokyo remained unchanged; paid parking lots dotted the area, and finding street parking w/in 3 blocks remained quite annoying. Seating abounded around Marugame Monzo; the rightmost lane of the street next to the restaurant, cordoned off, became outdoor seating. The various establishments on the block all shared this area, hence lacking clear delineation between one shop's tables and another shop's. Luckily, Marugame spared me the food court whack-a-mole game, involving a search for empty or soon-to-be empty tables. Checking in with an employee or putting a name down on a waitlist resulted in wait staff leading me to a table.I managed to sample the following:- onigiri w/mentai mayo | $2.25- takoyaki | $4.95/3pc, $10.95 8pc- karaage | $7.25- mentai cream seafood udon | $14.25The onigiri, on paper, sounded like the standard salted cod roe rice ball with mayo. The mayo, however, carried the salted cod roe flavor, creating a creamier texture at the cost of omitting the texture of the roe. It also arrived hot, a nice touch especially given the briskness of nighttime outdoor dining.Both the takoyaki and the karaage seemed inoffensive. They served their purposes as a scarf-down-and-move-on street food well. Only those actively searching for takoyaki karaage might have more input.The mentai seafood cream udon, with shrimp, bay scallops, and salted cod roe, tasted like a chowder with Japanese characteristics, thanks to the inclusion of cod roe and udon. It managed to taste less heavy than clam chowder yet richer. Overall, my meal weaved between orthodox and noveau. The experimental nature of the udon worked out successfully. For those looking for something distinctly Japanese without adhering to tradition, look no further."
3/20/2021,20210320,5,4.34,"Wow. I'm completely impressed and in love with the Udon at Marugame. I enjoy Udon a lot - especially in some soup but the Udon here doesn't compare to the noodles you van buy at the store. If you cook the Udon from the grocery store this soft, it will get really mushy. But here, because the noodles are made in house and are so fresh it still has the bounce and chewiness associated with Udon.We ordered the Monzo Kaarage, a Mabo Tofu Bowl, Miso Udon Carbonara, and the Mentai Cream Seafood Udon.The Karaage is easily one of the best I've ever had - soo juicy with dark and white meat. I wish they provided a sauce to go with it but it was perfect. Their Mabo Tofu was equally good and I enjoyed the bite I did have of it. The tofu is really soft and pillowly as well with great flavor to the sauce.The wait wasn't too bad and the line went by pretty fast. Our food also came out quickly and service was great."
3/20/2021,20210320,5,4.34,"WOWZERS!!! We finally were able to eat here since the wait wasn't too bad! We came here on a Saturday around 3pm just when restaurants are opening back up again during the Covid pandemic. There were only three parties ahead of us, so we were seated fairly quickly! Right now they have indoor and outdoor dining. I got the sea urchin cream udon (obviously! It's the most popular thing on the menu). The noodles were so fresh, and the sauce was perfection! Just the right textures and so flavorful! Honestly can't give anything less than 5 stars for this phenomenal dish!"
3/20/2021,20210320,4,4.34,"Great food, every time. The delivery can be a bit tricky, don't let that come between you and this gorgeous food."
3/21/2021,20210321,5,4.34,"Had a long wait on a friday night but was totally worth it! I got the pork curry, cream udon, and beef bowl with my boyfriend. We agreed the beef bowl was the best! It is like yoshinoya but 10000000x better. The cream udon was good but not as flavorful as I expected. Only wish is that they had more seating available!"
3/23/2021,20210323,5,4.34,Came here the other day and was seated within minutes! All tables were spaced out and all workers wore double masks at all time. The gratin udon is FIRE. I personally love the miso carbonara miso but both are hits. Love the texture of the noodle and how you can taste the freshness. Order the chicken karaage as an appetizer. So crunchy and yummy!
3/31/2021,20210331,5,4.34,"LOVE their Udon! Been here a handful of times and never been disappointed. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I appreciate the extra safety precautions they took during the pandemic. When we went this past weekend, we were a party of 5 so it took a little longer than usual (which is expected) but we were patient."
4/2/2021,20210402,5,4.34,"This spot still remains on top of my favorite places to eat at! My friend and I decided to catch up at one of our favorite spots! Can't go wrong with freshly made udon and the weather was perfect when we dined outside (Before indoor dining was allowed)We went around 12pm and waited about 15minutes to be seated! Staff was very attentive and eager to server us! I ended up ordering the Mentai Squid Butter udon and made it a combo with the small bowl of beef rice! My dish was yummy like how I remembered! I do recommend the Uni or Mentai Squid Butter if you love seafood like me! Strong seafood flavors and quality seafood pieces! Not to mention they give plenty of squid pieces! The udon is freshly made, not overcooked/undercooked but just the perfect texture/consistency. I tend to always come here to catch up with really good friends of mine so hopefully the next time I come, its a blast like always!"
4/2/2021,20210402,4,4.34,"I came here with my boyfriend during COVID-19, so I think they changed their hours now, because before they used to do the lunch hours, closed for a few hours, then reopened for dinner. I'm just glad that they open all day now, and when I went it wasn't super busy, so getting a seat outside had no wait. I was super excited to try this place because of all the photos I've seen on Yelp or on Instagram, so of course my boyfriend and I both ordered the Miso Carbonara Udon.The Miso Carbonara Udon was really good. Really rich and creamy, the bacon bits in it were okay, but they complemented the sauce well, and the amount of noodles was a good portion size. However, it did get too thick and rich towards the end of my meal, and I wish that they made the bacon a little crispier. Overall, 8/10. Overall, the service was decent because our servers didn't really check up on us and kind of just got us in and out, and the price point is reasonable for the portion size and the quality of food. There could be improvements on the food, as well as the service, but I definitely recommend trying this place if you're in the area, and now, the wait times are not as long as they were before COVID-19, in addition to being opened all day!"
4/5/2021,20210405,5,4.34,"Indoor dining is back! It feels surreal to be eating inside the restaurant again while the chefs hand slices udon in front of us. Although the take out here was decent, nothing beats udon being served to you freshly prepared.They have QR codes on the dining tables that you scan to view the latest menu. Bummer that they still don't have their monzo salad and tomato cream udon, as they were my boyfriend's favorite before the pandemic. I ordered my favorite, the uni sea urchin cream udon. The noodles were smooth and perfectly chewy, and the cream sauce had a nice hint of uni flavor with generous pieces of uni mixed in. The ikura roe is a nice touch of saltiness, as the flavor itself is pretty light considering it's a cream sauce pasta.My boyfriend ordered the Mapo tofu udon - the mapo tofu flavor was very light and almost unnoticeable within the broth. We added shichimi pepper to it, which gave the dish a nice kick! If you're expecting the bold flavors of Chinese mapo tofu, this dish is not it. It's more of a light soy broth with tofu, eggplant and hints of spice.Their a la carte tempura is great value. Ultimately I think I ordered too much, since the calamari tempura is a pretty hefty chunk of fried squid that was impossible for me to finish on top of the full portion udon. But for $1.50, it's totally worth giving a try! Also for those who have never been to this joint, one note is that they do not serve wasabi with the udon! Traditionally for the soy based cold udon, you eat the noodles with scallions, tempura flakes, grated daikon radish and wasabi as dipping sauce toppings. Monzo does not carry wasabi which is pretty wild. All in all, I'm so glad Monzo resumed in and outdoor dining, and can't wait until they bring back some OG menu items :)"
4/5/2021,20210405,5,4.34,"My friend took me here for my birthday lunch and it was the best choice ever!! It is located across from the little tokyo plaza so you can choose to park in the parking lot for $10 max and walk across the street to this restaurant. They offer both indoor dining with limited capacity due to COVID19 social distancing protocols as well as outdoor dining option as well.I ordered the Uni (Sea Urchin) Cream Udon, which was on their specialty recommended list. The bowl might look big and intimidating, but the portion was actually adequate and not too much at all. I love the creamy blend of their handmade udon mixed with the freshness of the Uni and Masago. I personally am not a fan of soupy udon so this dry udon option was definitely perfect for my taste. However, I might be down to try other types of udon that they have in the future (never say never right?!!)"
4/5/2021,20210405,4,4.34,"QUICKIE REVIEWGenuine Udon had here.FOODThis is what I tried:-Bukkake Udon with Soft boiled Jidori Egg-Mapo Tofu UdonOf the two, bukkake udon is the one you want. It is more flavorful and has a bolder taste.  Udon itself tasted fresh and with a nice golden yolky egg.PARKINGNo. Street parking is what you are looking for (there is a parking structure across the street in Japan town).SERVICEGood. Waiter was prompt and courteous.PRICELess than $40 for two.TIP/OTHER THOUGHTSI got there at 5pm and barely beat the rush for dinner.  Come earlier if you want to play it a bit safer."
4/6/2021,20210406,5,4.34,This place had great soup great udon texture. Large portions and great service. They offer out door dinning and have fast service and good selection of alcohol. 10/10 would recommend for all udon lovers
4/6/2021,20210406,5,4.34,"SOO GOOOD!! The people were so nice and the food was just amazing. The udon was so fresh and delicious. The spicy ground pork rice bowl though....10/10. Garlicky, spicy, green onions..YUM! You can get a mini bowl (that's still very decently sized!) for $3 if you get udon."
4/10/2021,20210410,4,4.34,"First time trying this place! My boyfriend and I came here for date night on a Saturday night and this place and the place next to it (Daikokuya) were PACKED. Street parking is really hard here and we ended up circling for like 15 minutes before giving up and paying $10 to park at the lot across the street.Put our name down at around 8:00ish and waited about 30 minutes to get a table. They're doing indoor and outdoor dining right now.I ordered the uni cream udon, my boyfriend got the curry udon with chicken, and we both got the beef rice bowl to share. We kinda made a mistake getting the extra rice bowl because the portions here are HUGE. For the uni cream udon I'd rate it an 8/10. The flavor was good and it was nice and creamy but it didn't really have much uni flavor/actual uni in it. As for the curry udon, the flavor was good (I thought it just tasted kinda like boxed curry lol) but the chicken was pretty dry. The beef rice bowl was kinda just ok and a little plain but we put some of the broth from the curry udon over the beef and rice and it tasted 10x better. Overall, I'd say this place is pretty good. The workers are super nice and it wasn't terribly pricey all! They also are very good at cleaning and disinfecting the tables and chairs in between people so I love to see how covid conscious they are. I would definitely come back here again."
4/10/2021,20210410,5,4.34,"This place is the bomb! Great food, great service. Flavors are delicious, all dishes were on point. Must come! That is all."
4/11/2021,20210411,5,4.34,"Does not disappoint! Must try their signature hand made soba, Creamy Uni and Miso Carbonara. Excellent side dishes include Assorted Tempura and Karaage Chicken. Small location, so expect a wait."
4/15/2021,20210415,5,4.35,"OMG! I was amazed by how delicious the udon was! It's definitely the best udon I've had in Los Angeles so far! The flavor, the texture...everything! The portion is good too, the fry chicken and tempura were also well done!I am down for going again!"
4/18/2021,20210418,3,4.34,I went here twice during the early months of the pandemic for take out and I love their carbonara udon. The cream was rich in flavor and the noodles were fresh. Only reason why 3 stars rather than 5 is because the portions are ridiculously small for the price. The container was one-third full at most and I feel like the portion should at least be bigger especially since an entree udon dish is almost $20.
4/20/2021,20210420,5,4.34,"I looooooove this place so much! Probably been here over 10+ times and always has exactly what I am in the mood for.Trust me on this, you can't go wrong with the signature artisan udon or some OG authentic broth packed simple beef udon. You know why? Because the noodles are on point that it pretty makes every dish amazingggggThe tempura assortment is so good too! I am not sure why they have broccoli but I love the shirmp, shiso, mushroomFood : 5Vibes : 5Cost : 5Best for : When you are craving some broth udon"
4/21/2021,20210421,5,4.35,I came here for a birthday lunch and it was so delicious. Indoor and outdoor is available as of this weekend and limited due to covid restrictions. The udon is amazing and of course you have to stick to their specialties. Parking is a disaster as expected in this area so make sure you plan for this.
4/27/2021,20210427,1,4.34,Please update your hours. Yelp and your website both have inaccurate information and calling your phone number (listed on Yelp and your website) isn't any help either since you don't have a voicemail or any kind of message for customers. We drove out to your location based on the inaccurate information you left in all your public-facing channels (which indicated you were open today) and only when we got to the front door was there any sign that you were in fact closed today (and yesterday). It really is not too much to ask for you to update any one of the three avenues you have available to you for communicating with your customers.What a waste of time.
4/30/2021,20210430,5,4.34,"The uni udon and the carbonara are my fave! It's very flavorful and travels well. We usually order through Postmates and while it's pricey, we found a way to stretch our dollar and make one order 2 meals. After finishing the noodles, we pop the bowl of leftover sauce in the fridge. The next day when lunch time comes around, we boil a small portion of pasta and toss the cooked noods directly into the cold saucy bowl with a splash milk or a nob of butter. The emulsion of the cream sauce, pasta water and the extra bit of dairy come together beautifully! It's a poor mans trick but helps justifies our purchase when we're craving a creamy bowl of udon."
5/2/2021,20210502,5,4.34,"Udon is one of my favorite noodles. So glad I got to try Monzo! Indoor dining was available late April 2021. You can also see in the back (because it is glass) where they prepare the udon by hand :) My friend and I shared the uni cream udon (warm) and mentai udon (cold) because I couldn't decide between the two. UNI CREAM UDON - 4/5 The flavor was great and loved the uni pieces, though not too much ""seafood""/""ocean"" umami flavor. Still was really good, but can get a bit heavy. Great choice for those that love alfredo type of sauces. MENTAI UDON - 5/5I LOVED the refreshing taste to this because it reminds me of the ocean...especially eating this on a hot day in LA! The noodles were more firm and had more texture than the uni cream one because it was a cold udon, so I ended up liking this one the most. My friends tried the beef fluffy jidori and miso carbonara, which they all enjoyed. They are from SoCal and swear by this place being the best for udon (and I now believe it!)"
5/2/2021,20210502,4,4.34,"Came here for the uni pasta and it was delicious! Quality of the uni was pretty whatever but for the price point, it was worth it. Be warned though that the uni pasta was pretty heavy and I started food coma-ing halfway through the meal. I also added a small beef rice bowl for an additional $3 and that was also pretty good. Boyfriend got the ikura bowl for an additional $3 and loved it. Overall, it's worth a trip to try to the uni pasta. This place is more like a try once and enjoy but wouldn't come back here often."
5/4/2021,20210504,5,4.34,Stopped by for outdoor dining on a Friday around 2pm with a group of 4 people. Wait was only ten minutes since it was off-hours! I ordered the uni udon. The broth was so creamy!! I'm a sucker for thick broths. I loved the homemade udon noodles themselves too. Perfect texture. I just wish there was more fresh uni! Also did anyone else struggle eating with that big ol' wooden spoon? Lol!
5/5/2021,20210505,5,4.34,"Handmade udon, I mean what more can I ask for? The udon noodles are always on point. I have pretty much ordered every item on their menu. This place is consistent and the employees are nice & helpful."
5/8/2021,20210508,5,4.35,"I enjoy their pork belly bowl here. I know they are known for udon soup, but I'm not really a soup person. Only place I know that has it. Its is really good and I recommend it."
5/9/2021,20210509,4,4.34,"From the outside this place looks very small but it can fit a good amount of people. They do make you wait for your entire party to arrive before they seat you. Anyway there are a variety of options to choose from on the menu. I got the Assorted tempura bowl. It comes with tempura shrimp, chicken, shiitake mushrooms, and eggplant over rice.All the food that came with the bowl was good. Well seasoned and with a nice crunch. The rice was good. I enjoyed it because it wasn't bland. They put soy sauce and some other seasoning over the rice to give it a nice taste. Together, this made for a good meal and I truly enjoyed it.I would definitely recommend. It's a nice casual spot in little Tokyo. The staff is nice and the food is good. I would like to come back and try some of the udon noddles in the future."
5/10/2021,20210510,5,4.35,"I've been to Marugame Monzo a few times and this place never misses! Udon is such a comforting dish, the perfect nap-inducing form of noodles with broth in my opinion. Make sure you come hungry because a bowl of their udon is quite filling, and you should definitely do your best to save some room for their tempura or appetizers. I got the Kake Udon yesterday, which is probably the simplest udon on their menu. I've also tried the mapo tofu udon, but I wasn't a fan of the ground meat in the udon - that's just a personal preference though. I really like the Kake Udon for the simplicity, and it's still delicious. The broth is amazing and there's probably nothing more satisfying than slurping udon noodles out of the giant wooden ladle that they give you.The staff is also very friendly and they seated our group of 5 relatively quickly (it took about 5-10 minutes at 6:30PM). They don't take reservations, so get there early unless you don't mind waiting or walking around until your name is called. It can get really busy there at dinner time, so keep that in mind.Definitely recommend!"
5/10/2021,20210510,5,4.35,"5 stars for the udon gratin alone. Absolutely delicious, VERY cheesy, perfectly chewy thick udon - just a really comforting yummy dish. I have also tried the carbonara, but it didn't taste anything like miso and the bacon was more rubbery than crispy. The dish still had good flavor but I definitely wouldn't order that one again. Try the udon gratin!"
5/10/2021,20210510,5,4.35,"Soooo good. I was expecting there to be a line on a weekend but surprising there wasn't. I ordered the squid udon and it was amazingggg. The broth was so flavorful and I really liked how they included eggs in the dish as well. I think out of all of the places I've tried in LA during my visit, Marugame is my top 5"
5/11/2021,20210511,5,4.35,"Marugame Monzo is the best place you can go for udon in Little Tokyo or even all of SoCal. They make their udon noodles fresh in store, so the noodles are always bouncy and delicious! I know most people like to eat their own bowl of noodles but if it's your first time, I'd recommend getting a couple different entrees so you can try. Their most popular dish is the uni cream udon. If you've tried the uni pasta from EMC, it's kind of like that, but think a lot more soupy and creamy. I'd say the uni flavor isn't really intense! I'd recommend getting the uni udon along w one of their soup udons. You can never go wrong w a shrimp tempura udon or even the beef."
5/11/2021,20210511,4,4.35,"The uni udon is my fav! Super creamy but can get you pretty filled up quickly. Uni was quite small though, not sure if it was really worth the $17. The line moves pretty quickly too even on a Friday night, compared to a lot of ramen places in Little Tokyo. Outdoor seating is a little awkward. My group and I were seated at an uneven surface ground and the table would wobble. Had to take a couple napkins to fix the leg. Little pricy but not too bad."
5/14/2021,20210514,5,4.35,"Believe the hype. Marugame Monzo is famous for their fresh, handmade udon noodles. Located on a bustling block in Little Tokyo, the restaurant is small, thus the inevitable wait list. They've added tables outside under a tarp during the pandemic, and are now open for indoor dining as well. At lunchtime on a weekday, we waited just 20 minutes to be seated. The Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon was something out of my dreams. Reminiscent of a creamy carbonara, but with a delicate lightness and rich umami flavor, the dish was brimming with uni. Seriously, there was fresh, tender uni (and ikura!) in every bite. The star of the dish were the noodles, which were easily the best udon I've ever tried. They were flavorful on their own, and cooked to perfectly chewy al dente.My fiancé got the Ikura Oroshi Udon, a cold udon dish with plentiful salmon eggs that stuck to each incredible noodle. The Assorted Vegetable Tempura was also very good. I look forward to returning to try more of their menu."
5/14/2021,20210514,5,4.35,"Freshly made udon noodles?!SAY LESS. The noodles were the perfect blend of soft and chewy with a slight bite. You can tell their freshly made. I got the carbonara udon and it was sooooo creamy. Kinda heavy, but so good. I did wish the bacon was crispier to give it some texture, but the flavor was spot on. Also tried the tempura and you can't go wrong. Highly recommend."
5/15/2021,20210515,5,4.35,The best udon ever! I love going here everything is freshly made the staff is also really nice! It's always packed but worth it!!! Trust me!!
5/16/2021,20210516,3,4.35,It's quick and inexpensive udon.  I wouldn't say it's the best udon I've ever had but it's a different fast food experience.  The food is decent for what the price is and the staff has been friendly. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there. It's one of those places that if I was already in the area then I would go.
5/16/2021,20210516,5,4.35,"I still dream about their mentai udon, it was so creamy and delicious! Glad we stopped by here."
5/23/2021,20210523,5,4.35,"WOWWWW!!!! THE UNI UDON! just wow... i came here on a sunday afternoon around lunch time and had an 1.5hr wait to try their uni udon... first bite and i am in creamy heaven. tastes kinda like a seafood alfredo. the flavors exploded in my mouth and the creamy sauce married perfectly with the salmon roe, uni, and udon. this dish is kinda heavy, but its so good. i wished they had some protein like grilled shrimp or something because i kind of got bored of eating just noodles. overall would def come back!"
5/23/2021,20210523,5,4.35,"soooo good!!! The wait is super longgg lmao but worth it. I wish they had a better waiting system so you didn't have to wait in front of the restaurant (maybe like a texting/calling system?). I got the uni udon and the takoyaki. The udon was soooo creamy and actually had a uni taste in the cream/soup. It also had fish eggs! I added the egg as a side, but don't think I will next time since the noodles itself is pretty filling. I wish they had actual raw uni as a garnish though. There was tons on uni in the dish, but they cooked it with the soup/noodles. The takoyaki was firee. I've tried some takoyaki in the past and it always tastes super doughey, but this one is so good! This place is pricey, but I think it's totally worth it...I mean you're paying for uni and salmon egg haha"
5/24/2021,20210524,1,4.35,"very bad. And impersonal service. I don't know they can't bring outside drink. When I bring my drinks into the store, I follow their policy. Because it was very hot that day, the heat is killing me. I asked the waiter to give me a glass of ice. I planned to put it in my own drink and wait until after we finish the meal, then I can still keep my drink frozen after leave the restaurant . I did not drink any sip of my beverage in the store. Afterwards, their manager came over and told me that if I drink any more my own drinks and don't follow their policy, They will need me to leave. (With a unpleasant tone). It made me very embarrassed. I don't think it's necessary to ask me to leave just because I got some ice? And needs my friend and I to leave because of a tiny matter. Shouldn't be that mean to your costumer. I just want to keep my tea cold after I leave the restaurant, is that really matter? Never come back for this. Please manage your service,Just be easy going. I am not bring wine or what, I am here for your udon not fcking tap water or soda."
5/25/2021,20210525,2,4.34,"Not that nice to their costumer. Udon is good but their rice bowl is just so so, try their tempora is very good."
5/29/2021,20210529,3,4.34,"The reason I gave a three star is because I think the place is a little overrated. I think they could integrate more flavor in the soup/sauce.Mentai Squid Butter Udon: good! The flavor mostly come from the mentai. The soup doesn't really have any flavor. I didn't expect this would be a hot dish - but it is!Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon: it's good, but I wish the uni is mixed more into the sauce.. the thing that really gave flavor is the fish roe on top. When it pops in your mouth I wish they put more of those eggs."
5/31/2021,20210531,4,4.34,"This is my second time dining here and best believe the first time was really good! That's why I came back! I ordered the famous uni cream udon, chicken tempura udon, mentai mayo onigiri and the monzo's fried chicken. The food was prepared quickly and the service was really well-paced. They brought out the onigiri and chicken out first. The onigiri felt lacking of the mentai (pollock roe). The chicken tasted like it was fried with rice flour as opposed to regular flour because the texture was almost gelatinous(?). It was really good, but for some reason I felt like one of these 2 appetizers weren't fully cooked or there was something odd because both my boyfriend and I had a stomachache shortly after eating. This was my first meal of the day so I believe it was something in the food. Nonetheless it was still delicious though! The uni udon was creamy heaven. The chicken tempura was served aside from the soup which was nice of them so the tempura batter wouldn't get soggy. One thing we realized after eating here a 2nd time was that the udon soup bases aren't ever really hot? They are always warm enough, but never hot to enjoy on a cold night like today. That's sort of a bummer along with the odd stomachache which resulted in the 4 star review."
5/31/2021,20210531,5,4.34,It's famous for a reason! The udon they have from their special one to their traditional one taste delightful!I tried the udon carbonara and wow!! Flavorful and dish that you just want more!
5/31/2021,20210531,5,4.34,"Love this place and have been a patron for years. The beef udon and pork belly rice bowl are my favorites, and the mental squid butter udon is amazing."
6/1/2021,20210601,5,4.34,Their udon is soooo good! I came here after doing the Hollywood Sign hike so I was very hungry and it was actually kind of cold for Southern California. The wait on a Saturday evening for a group of 7 was pretty long (about an hour and a half) but it was worth it. I got the beef and fluffy Jidori egg udon and it was delicious! Even the broth was very good. I'd definitely come again.
6/1/2021,20210601,5,4.34,"Their food is so goood. The broth for beef udon is really refreshing, definitely no GMO. The chicken is really juicy with a little hint of lime, Yummy!!! Def come back and recommend to friends around"
6/3/2021,20210603,5,4.35,"I recommend the miso carbonara, I got it without bacon: Light creamy soup that's the perfect amount of salty and flavorful while not having too strong of a flavor. Absolutely yummy, Flavor is wonderful but if you're lactose Intolerant this dish is not for you also it is super carb heavy and there are little to no veggie options so make sure you get your nutrition elsewhere. The udon is very heavy so it'll fill you up really well and is the perfect texture! They make the noodles there so they are especially yummy! However rice bowl is super overpriced in my opinion and not worth it! service was good!"
6/3/2021,20210603,5,4.35,A MUST when visiting Little Tokyo. Definitely worth the wait and the hype. The noodles are so chewy and the Udon options are soooo good.
6/4/2021,20210604,4,4.35,"The wait can be kinda of long, but the food is worth it. Their noodles are so good and quality! I am a fan of the Curry Udon :))."
6/4/2021,20210604,5,4.35,Best udon I've ever had! I had the beef udon during lunch so I also left with a mini beef bowl that I ate at home. Wife had the udon carbonara and all of our food was amazing. Can't wait to come back again soon
6/6/2021,20210606,5,4.35,"The sea urchin uni udon is made with super fresh udon noodles and a ton of love. You can actually see them prepare the udon by hand through the glass. The sauce made it taste almost like an Italian dish with a creamy white sauce. People have commented about the long waits and we came at around 2 pm for a late lunch and only waited 15 minutes. After walking around Little Tokyo for a bit, we saw the lines form up again around 5 pm here."
6/7/2021,20210607,5,4.35,"Finally got to dine at Marugame Monzo again over MDW after my last visit! They currently offer both indoor & outdoor dining. Staff will take temperature reading regardless if you're sitting inside or outside, and tables are spaced out. Restrooms are clean. Menus can be scanned via QR Code from a drink menu they give to each table.This time I stuck to ordering the Beef Udon, and my bf ordered the Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon. We like the Uni Udon much better than the Mentai Cream. Uni is fresh and the entire Udon dish has a great umami & is well balanced. Beef Udon was still delicious and comforting. Udon is soft and chewy. We also ordered the Takoyaki again (they offer 3 pcs or 8 pcs) and the Assorted Tempura. Takoyaki was again good (standard), but we'll likely skip the Tempura next time.We came for an early dinner (~5pm) and waited approximately 25-35 minutes to be seated. They still have the sign-in sheet at the front door and staff will call out the number and name when a table is ready."
6/7/2021,20210607,5,4.35,super yumme udon in little tokyo. it was super yumme and it made super happy and smile. i enjoyed the mapo tofu udon more because i love spicy
6/12/2021,20210612,5,4.35,"Really yummy udon with lots of variety! I had the beef and fluffy egg jidori udon, which was super tasty but a little too sweet for me. Definitely want to come back and try more items on the menu!!"
6/13/2021,20210613,5,4.35,Sooooo good. It's worth the wait. I've tried both the uni and the miso carbonara udon dishes. Both are amazing and so flavorful. I would definitely come back.
6/14/2021,20210614,5,4.35,"The most amazing bowl of Udon I've ever had (LA food seems to have that effect in general.)I had the beef and fluffy jidori egg udon with a rice bowl (only $3 extra if you get it with the udon!). MY OH MY. Its hard to explain the explosion of flavors that happened in my mouth. The beef in both the rice bowl and the udon were seasoned to a level of perfection that I didn't know existed. Not to mention that the portion sizes are MORE than reasonable. Tack that on with the amazing staff and you can't beat this experience. The entire table ordered one of their signature dishes and everyone left with a level of satisfaction even we didn't anticipate. If you're gonna go, and are in a rush, I would strongly recommend that you show up AT LEAST 30 minutes before they open to be seated immediately. My friends and I arrived 15 minutes before open to get in line for a party of 6 and had to wait about an hour to be seated. DONT GET ME WRONG, THE WAIT IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT. Just giving you a bit of notice. There is plenty of parking in the area with garages and street parking at the ready. Plenty of little shops around the area that you can go explore while you wait to be called; I would recommend that one person in your party stay behind to contact everyone when ready because they will only seat full parties."
6/15/2021,20210615,5,4.35,"Have gone to this place twice and really enjoyed my meal both times. The first time I went, I ordered the udon gratin which was super yummy especially for a cheese-lover like me! And I also added on a mini pork belly rice bowl, would pass on this as it wasn't very flavorful and kinda pricy for such a small bowl of rice. Second time, I decided to go with the classic beef udon and I got a double portion. The broth was very delicious and their udon texture is always on point. My friend got the shrimp tempura udon and IT WAS SOSOSO GOOD. The noodle soup was exactly the same as my beef udon, but the shrimp tempura was so delicious. It had a nice airy crunch, and the shrimp was perfectly cooked 10/10 recommend! Since I ordered a double portion, I had lots of leftovers and packed it to-go in 2 separate containers (one for the broth and the other for the noodles). When I ate it the following day, it was still very delicious. Service here is alright, but I prefer places that leave you alone the majority of your dining experience. I will definitely be coming back for that shrimp tempura and that perfect udon noodle texture."
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.35,"The Uni udon was sooooo delicious. The serving was on the smaller side. Although the broth was rich, I was left feeling like I could still eat a big dessert. My friend ordered the shrimp tempura udon. It looked like udon in clear broth with a few pieces of tempura shrimp on the side. My friend said it was plain.There was a wait as this place seems popular. It's hard to find steer parking in this busy downtown area. There is a parking lot across the street and a round the corner."
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.35,"Amazing ramen and tempura! The best I've ever tasted in my life. 100% worth it. We drove here all the way from Ventura county, which is almost 2 hours away. And it did not disappoint. Make sure to check this place out in little Tokyo"
6/16/2021,20210616,4,4.35,Wonderful. I got the Uni Udon for take out and it was so rich and creamy. Definitely need to have it again.
6/21/2021,20210621,5,4.35,"The udon here is always delishious. I've never had a bad dish here. We went on a weekend around 6 and luckily decided to put our name down on the wait-list right away. We waited almost two hours for a table and it was totally worth it. The creamy broth with the uni udon just makes everything melt in your mouth. It's not super rich even though it's a cream broth. If you are a fan of uni, you definitely need to try this. The beef udon with fluffy egg was light and flavorful. The other side dishes we ordered were all fantastic. Can't wait to go back for another round of uni udon!"
6/21/2021,20210621,5,4.35,"you cannot go wrong with marugame monzo! they used to make the noodles behind the glass, but i am assuming due to covid, they no longer have that. i hope it does come back though because it's quite mesmerizing. all of the udon noodles that i have gotten from here have been so freaking delicious, so seriously, you cannot go wrong."
6/23/2021,20210623,4,4.35,"This place always has a huge line, but was lucky enough to come on a weekday around 1pm and the wait was only about 10-15 minutes for 2 people!Located in Little Tokyo, Japantown, LA so be prepared to park on the streetOrdered:- Miso Carbonara Udon: rich, creamy, decadent udon! Tastes more like a pasta which I definitely didn't mind!- Hot Sansai Udon: comes with delicious, traditional ""Japanese mountain"" style vegetables. The broth was clear but super flavorful. Udon noodles was cooked to perfectionWe came around lunch time so they were offering a ""add on mini rice bowl"" for an extra $4/5. We got the beef rice bowl and spicy ground pork rice bowl.Definitely going to come back to try their other many udon options!"
6/23/2021,20210623,1,4.35,The food here is good but the service is AWFUL. My group ordered food to go and after paying asked for water while we waited. Three people told us no and that water was only for seated customers. It's 92 degrees in Los Angeles today. I even offered to pay and one man said we are so busy you can't have water. Food is good but service is a huge part of dining and this establishment isn't where you want to go. What a poor business practice.
6/24/2021,20210624,5,4.35,"This is probably the best udon places I have had in the U.S. It reminds me of the udon I have had in Japan. The best part is the cold udon offered here. Hot udon is usually easily to find at most places, but the cold udon is a rarer find. The freshly made noodles are cooked to perfection (firm, but not hard). The soft-boiled tempura egg is always a highlight for me. I am never disappointed. The only downside is the wait time because this place gets packed and busy. Luckily, it's located in the heart of Japantown in DTLA so I usually walk around while I wait."
6/28/2021,20210628,5,4.35,There was a long list of people waiting for a table but it went by pretty quick! I got the udon gratin. It wasn't on the menu but I asked for it and they said they're serving it! It was really cheesy which was perfect for me. I think there was some chicken pieces in it as well. I also tried the beef udon which was delish! There was seating outside due to COVID which was fine too. They have restrooms as well!
6/28/2021,20210628,5,4.35,"If you're looking for some house made udon noodles, I would definitely recommend giving Monzo a try! I ordered the uni sea urchin noodles and the sauce was creamy with the sea urchin bits mixed in with the sauce. Raw fish eggs on top of the noodles were delicious. They broke up the sauce's creamy taste with a salty bite. The waiters are quick to take your order and the wait time wasn't too bad on a Sunday night near their closing time, 8 pm. The restaurant does have a waiting list and can be cut off (last calls) when it comes close to 8 pm. There is limited street parking available or you can pay for parking on a lot. There is a shaded outdoor and indoor seating available. Overall, it was a really good dining experience!"
6/28/2021,20210628,4,4.35,"Pretty good. I got their uni udon and it was alright. Not really hot but still tasted good. My cousin got their spicy dragon udon and I tried it. It tasted really good and more suitable for my taste buds. Overall, it was a good and pleasant experience :)"
6/30/2021,20210630,5,4.35,"Udon Shmudon you might think before learning that this restaurant is located in Little Tokyo, and that their house-made noods and thangs are worth the drive to eat. Basically that's how it began, especially when a couple of Elites are deliberating over where to eat. The day began with a memorable trip to Venice Beach and running into no other than the legendary Snoop Dogg! Add an hour bike ride on an ill-fitting rental bike and that's a recipe for gettin' hangry. Then, once we finally found the car (long story) the drive towards LA proper gave rise to what sounded good (fried chicken and BBQ got floated in there), then fish and chips were mentioned but we were already leaving that area behind, finally, Little Tokyo came up and we all agreed, finally, on something something. Arthur wanted a slice of pizza once we parked so he had a pepperoni slice from Prime Pizza. I'm glad I declined because I got really full later. The gf and Dora ran off to get our names in a couple of places they both knew before the restaurants closed. About that, on Sundays many restaurants in Little Tokyo close between 8 and 9pm. Some may not ever open again after Covid-19, but you can bet that the best spots are going to be busy with a wait. The employee said we might get lucky about getting in before 8pm, and it seemed that they were happy to accommodate us but definitely last call. The people that make the noodles were long gone, for example, so next time I'll go earlier to watch them in action. We all got Udon bowls, warm, with some sides. Fried chicken resembles popcorn chicken without the spices. I also recommend the mixed tempura, so good and beautiful breading. The gal and I especially liked the rice bowl with marinated pork belly slices, and then the main attractions arrived. Arthur and I ordered the Beef Udon, Tofu for the gf, and Dora went rich and heavy with the Carbonara! Leftovers, definitely.... guess what? They reheated perfectly, the noodles didn't get squishy and nasty, a little plumper perhaps, but almost as good as they were in the restaurant. Great friendly staff, we liked how polite and kind the waitress was. In short, we're already plotting the next visit! Strongly recommended!"
6/30/2021,20210630,1,4.35,"This one star is given for the service. And this is something you should know before you go. YOU CANNOT SHARE FOOD ON YOUR TABLE. And of course the management should change this house rules. Me (from the east coast) and my boyfriend (from SF) went there on a Tuesday afternoon. The wait wasn't long. We sat down and looking at the menu and they have a lunch combo which you pay $3 more for the mini rice bowl. So we decided to get one ramen and one ramen with the combo so we can try. We said this to the waiter "" we want the uni udon and the hot dragon udon, and make one for a combo with the mini rice with beef."" Waiter said ""ok, and just want to let you know that you cannot share the rice."" Me and my bf was like what? I asked him what do you mean? And I even specifically asked "" so I can't even have one bite of the rice to just try it?"" The waiter said "" yea NO, it's the house rule."" And we decided not to get the rice bowl because this makes no sense. And I asked if I can talk to a manager. And there is NO manager on duty. I am not sure if this is legal in LA. So of course we are overwhelmed and shocked why is that. I don't understand why we cannot share whatever we order on our table. Then I asked another waiter why is that. Now this person said ""yea we cannot share"". And I asked more like why, what is the purpose, is it because COVID or what. He said they are just trying to protect the business. Giving an example of two people come in to just order one combo to save some money. Ok I get it. BUT WE ORDERED TWO UDON. He said sorry and asked if we still want to order the rice bowl. We said no it's ok, because we are disappointed already. Food was served and it was okay. Nothing too surprising. Not sure if it is because we are disappointed when we first order or what. Now to this company. I get it you want to save and protect your business. But I don't think you can limit what people order and how they share the food. To us, honestly I just want to try the food. BUT people order whatever portion it's up to them. Some people might just a want to try, some people might just aren't that hungry and want to share, or even if the worst case they don't have much money and want to share their food, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? YOU CANNOT CONTROL AND LIMIT HOW PEOPLE EAT AND SHARE THE FOOD. I've never been to a restaurant specifically tell us we cannot share the food on OUR table. So like if I am really not hungry and two people go in to juts order one ramen do you not take my business at all or what?And lastly, if this restaurant still want to stick with this rule, please train your staff how to explain and say this to customers. Simply just saying yes you cannot even eat one bite or one rice is ridiculous wrong. You can think that I am cheap but like I am really not. Like I said I am from the east coast I am here for my vacation. I ain't being cheap for myself. But I will say if I lived in this area I would not come back to this restaurant."
7/1/2021,20210701,3,4.35,"Excellent service, long wait, classic japanese food.I came here on a recommendation about the udon. We tried to make a reservation or even just to call the place - they have never answered any of my calls. We decided to show up and see what happens. We ended up waiting 30-40 minutes after a 20 minute estimate before getting seated.The menu is short and simple, especially to those of us not familiar with Japanese fare. The menu, however, is under-detailed and one of the dishes that was seemingly vegetarian contained pork. This is a small mistake that could have been avoided. The service were excellent in recognizing this mistake and made a new dish without meat.The table ordered 3 udon soups, an uni risotto, and two rice dishes. The udon was excellent, the uni risotto was overly rich and monotone, and the dishes were simple across the board. The duck in the duck udon was obviously overcooked, though this could have been expected of a place trying to overplay their hand into more delicate preparations.As someone dipping my feet into dashi and Japanese home cooking, I felt like I could have made this at home. The dishes were simple, tasty, and cheap, but probably nothing worth driving into the city for, nor waiting for 40 minutes."
7/1/2021,20210701,5,4.35,"If I could give this a higher rating than 5, I would. This ramen spot has the best uni udon I have ever had! You can taste the fresh uni put into the udon, as well as the rich and creamy sauce. The sauce had a savory yet rich taste to it, felt like I was eating fine dining; the presentation was beautiful too. We also ordered takoyaki, shrimp/veggie tempura, and the pork belly rice bowl. Adding on, the customer service was very polite and made sure to ask us if we would like to be seated outside or indoors, we were seated quickly. ALL of it tasted spectacular! If you're visiting Little Tokyo make sure to visit the spot here! :)"
7/2/2021,20210702,5,4.35,"My friends and I came here around 4pm on a weekday and were surprised to find the short wait time. We were seated quickly and the udon was sooo yummy! A couple of friends and I got the Mapo Tofu Udon and Hot Dragon Udon. They were both super flavorful and just the perfect amount of spice. The service was also great, one of the workers took some cute pictures for us! We couldn't get enough of the noodles so we added more for $2. I highly recommend this place and I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in LA."
7/4/2021,20210704,5,4.35,"Arrived at around 6:30 on Saturday. There was a loooooong wait. But we toughed it out, and I'm glad we did. The shrimp tempura udon with kake base was AMAAAAAZING. Not too heavy and oh so tasty. Hot Dragon udon was also good, but the flavor profile wasn't quite as clean. Reminded me of a spicy tonkotsu ramen base."
7/7/2021,20210707,5,4.35,"As someone who's lactose I was kinda scared to eat this but it was sooo delicious highly recommend the seafood option over the carbonara. My friends got the carbonara and I was the only one with the seafood option and it was only 50¢ more. Comes with scallop, shrimp and roe."
7/7/2021,20210707,5,4.35,"They have rules of not bringing in outside foods and must have your entire party before seating! Food was really good, I do wish my Mapo Tofu was spicier bc it wasnt spicy at all :( so just dont get that one but everyone elses was mad good though."
7/8/2021,20210708,5,4.35,"Very tasty but a little pricey however, it was definitely worth it. The broth for the udon was packed with flavor and the karaage is a definite must to order. It was super crunchy and crisp with out being greasy."
7/10/2021,20210710,2,4.35,"Our group was next on the waitlist but it took us like an hour to be seated. There were plenty of seat available, but the guy didn't even bother to call us."
7/15/2021,20210715,5,4.35,"I've been here a few times, finally getting around to review! I wasn't a huge fan of udon... before I found out about this place. - The Uni Udon is awesome, lots of flavor, you can definitely taste the Uni. I love indulging in seafood, so seafood combined with noodles = heavenly combo. The cream is not too heavy, which is great for this dish. - Shrimp Tempura is costly, but good! - Karaage Fried Chicken is pretty good and lightly fried. Good ratio of chicken:batter. - Agedashi Tofu is light and airy, yet perfectly crisp on the outside in a thin layer of batter. The sauce it sits in is good, too. - Hot Dragon is good for those who want a bit of a kick! Not a spice you can't handle, even for my mild-spice friends. Good broth flavor, good toppings. - Mad Tiger is a great option for cold udon. Lots of toppings to get all the different flavors/textures out of this dish. Also, I'll note that the ajitama is really good and quality! *Parking inevitably sucks around Little Tokyo, try to find street meter parking*I come line up as soon as they open, if possible. If not, their wait times are tough if you come at the busy peaks. *Overall great portions and price for quality flavor of Udon!"
7/15/2021,20210715,5,4.35,"My bf and I loveeee this place! Their fusion style seafood udon is very tasty and unique. Ever since they updated their menu after COVID, I've been getting their Mentai Cream Seafood Udon which has a buttery, rich flavor that we absolutely love. I do wish their seafood portion is more generous though! I also love their Seafood Tomato Cream Udon which they removed from their menu :-( please bring it back"
7/15/2021,20210715,1,4.35,"I got there and there are a few empty tables inside and outside so I was telling the waiter that we have a party of 2. However, we didn't put down the name on the list. While we were waiting and a few guests came after us. When the waiter finally came out after we had been waiting for 15mins, he told me they cannot serve me the table because I didn't put down my name! Even tho we came first, he said that's the RULE!!! What a rude waiter and restaurant!? I know this restaurant is popular but the waiter obviously knows that we came first before anyone else. Anyway, I'm not from LA so i really didn't know the rule when I saw there are empty tables and still have to put down the name! Lesson learned, and thanks for the experience!"
7/18/2021,20210718,4,4.35,"Amazing food but zero social distancing and dubious on sanitation. I love this place. Their food is delicious and totally worth the long wait. However, it should be noted that there is absolutely zero social distancing indoors while dining.We were seated side by side to other patrons and there was less than a foot distance to the party next to us. I also observed that they only haphazardly wipe down the tables between each party so just be mindful of that.If you're new: when you come, there is a clipboard in the front of the restaurant to put down your name! Wait is typically 30min-1 hour in my experience.I recommend the miso carbonara udon with the pork belly rice bowl :) it's on the heavier side, so my second pick would be the mentai squid butter."
7/21/2021,20210721,5,4.35,"Yummy, yummy, creamy udon in my tummy! I may be a little biased because I prefer udon over ramen on most days, but this place has one of the best noodles I've ever had in LA! It has that perfect chewy texture- soft, yet firm. The broth has great consistency and tons of flavor without being too overpowering.The Miso Carbonara is a MUST TRY for sure! The Uni Sea Urchin Cream is also quite good, but a bit on the lighter side for my taste. They have pretty decent rice bowls, just in case you or someone in your party isn't up to eating udon that day. My current favorite is the Beef and Fluffy Jidori Egg. It honestly reminds me of home.Portion size is just right, prices are reasonable, service was great, and the place was clean! I'll definitely be back again and excited to try other stuff on the menu. Oh, and don't forget to try their sparkling sake!"
7/25/2021,20210725,5,4.35,"The udon noodles are amazing, like a great handmade bucatini, chewy and pillowy firmness. We ordered takeout but I don't think it detracted from the quality of the food. We ordered the Uni Sea Urchin (redundant I know) Cream Udon and Shrimp Tempura Udon. I added a side of chili oil which I added to the Uni Udon which I prefer to help cut the richness of the cream and Uni; without it the Uni cream sauce is luscious richness without being heavy. The tempura was crisp and a healthy size. The udon broth was rich and clean. With some great Japanese restaurants in the area, Marugame Monzo warrants your time. I'm rating 5-stars because of the uniqueness of its fusion dishes while still high quality traditional food on par with udon I've had in Japan."
7/30/2021,20210730,5,4.35,"Yummmmm!!! Worth the wait!!! Got here about 15 minutes before opening to get our names on the waitlist. And then wait for about... 20 minutes before getting seated in a two top outside. Be sure if you go as a group, that you do not walk off! They call your name twice (very quickly) and if there's no response, they move to the next group! They also will not seat you without your whole party. My bf walked off to get coffee thinking we'd have time andddd we didn't. He had to rush back so our table wouldn't be given up! I ordered the uni udon and was a little scared i wouldn't like it because I've had good and bad experiences with uni. But I read so many reviews and suggested it! I reaalllyyy enjoyed the dish! With pieces of uni and richness of creamy sauce! The udon noodles were delish and made to perfection. Im so glad we waited for this place! I loved my dish so much I didn't get a picture of it and I forgot what my bf ordered. Lol!"
7/30/2021,20210730,5,4.35,"marugame monzo has the best udon ever. i love the texture of their homemade noodles, and i admire the uniqueness of their signature udon dishes. i forgot what this one is called, but it was the more expensive dish (~$18). it was super good! i've gotten the tomato udon (which i don't think is on the menu now) and the mentai udon which was amazing as well. the staff is super nice, friendly, and patient even thought it's always so busy. expect a wait when you come! i usually wait around 30-45min, but i'm usually in a group (i've come in groups of 4-7)."
8/1/2021,20210801,5,4.35,The wait is a little long so be ready to wait but you can also walk around to not get bored. The wait is so worth it. It was the best udon I ever had. The portions are small but I was comfortable full! Not over the top. I wish I can explain the taste but it just something you have to try yourself. I will most definitely come back when I visit California again.
8/1/2021,20210801,5,4.35,I love the counter at this restaurant.Watching the udon being made makes the waiting time fly by. And the udon is so delicious.It is always popular and there is always a wait.
8/2/2021,20210802,5,4.35,"First time at this udon place in Little Tokyo. Parking: We parked at the Aiso Parking Garage, which is a short 2-3 minute walk to Marugame Monzo. Validation for the first hour was given by Fugetsu-Do, the mochi shop just a couple shops down. Forgot to ask if Marugame Monzo validates. Wait Time:Arrived at around 5:45 pm on a Sunday to put our name down on the paper sheet outside the restaurant. At that point, there were multiple parties ahead of us. The total wait time amounted to about an hour. This was okay with us because there is a new boba shop just next door (Teamorrow) so we got boba while we waited. We also had time to walk around the Japanese Village Plaza and come back before our name was called. There is no text message notification system, so you do have to be present when your name is called (though I did notice them giving people grace if they missed their name being called). Pluses: - Service is GREAT. Everyone is really kind and attentive. - Food is pretty solid and the portions are more than fair. I got the sea urchin creamy udon, which was delicious if you are okay with a creamy base similar to pasta sauce. Cons: - The inside of the restaurant is extremely tiny, so social distancing is basically nonexistent. There is also a couple tables outside, but we opted to sit inside because people who are waiting for their table to be called tend to crowd around those who are eating outside. However, the majority of people who are outside waiting were wearing masks. Despite the small interior, this is still a wonderful place to eat (just probably not with large groups).Overall, highly recommend this place for udon"
8/2/2021,20210802,5,4.35,"My friend and I Waited nearly an hour to get a seat. I swear it was worth it. We both had the mushroom cream udon. I wanted so badly to order a bowl to go, but the kitchen was closed. I must return. That was a pleasurable first-time experience."
8/5/2021,20210805,5,4.35,Delicious food and attentive service! Came here while on vacation and definitely don't regret it.
8/6/2021,20210806,4,4.35,"Here's another restaurant where you should never go to hungry because the wait can be a long one especially if you are in a group larger than two. And keep an ear open for when they call your name. When a table becomes available it gets seated quickly. You snooze, you lose.I brought a friend visiting from Taiwan here and he loved it as much as I did.We also picked the combo which included some fried chicken (karaage)The turn over is pretty quick too because once you order it doesn't take long to put together your tasty udon bowl of deliciousness."
8/6/2021,20210806,5,4.35,"Super bomb udon. Didn't really see the value in paying for fancy instant udon but it's so good. Like a pasta restaurant lol. Their carbonara was nice, sweet and creamy. I got the uni to try their bestseller and it didn't disappoint. Was like a mix between savory and sweet. Service was also very friendly, calm, and patient. Not just the person serving us but everyone else. Their chicken is nice and crunchy to help contrast with the soft food. And their noodles look handmade??? Couldn't tell but it definitely tasted different."
8/6/2021,20210806,4,4.35,"Quality of udon was great and delicious! Service was great! Uni udon was great except the uni part. A bit disappointed in the quality of uni. It was chewy??? Not what I remembered. However, the duck udon .... the duck slices were cooked perfectly! Broth was a bit salty for my taste, but my friend liked it. So ‍. I'd still go back. I'm hoping it's just a ""pandemic "" thing."
8/7/2021,20210807,4,4.35,"This has been one of my go-to spots during pandemic time. The wait isn't as crazy anymore so it's not as overhyped as it used to be.The SEA URCHIN UDON is a must and has been the staple for years. They balance the uni flavor with a creamy sauce that's enriching and complements the udon texture. Their sauce is definitely on the creamier side.I've also been trying the DUCK NANBAN UDON mainly because the duck is exquisite. So tender and flavorful. The udon itself is decent, it's just a plain hot udon with great noodle texture, but the portions are a bit small. I kinda wish they would offer the duck separately as its own dish."
8/10/2021,20210810,4,4.35,"I got the uni udon, but I don't think it was spectacular. It was good, but not worth the wait or hype. The uni pieces were rather small and even then, I can't say they felt super fresh or had a sweetness to it either."
8/12/2021,20210812,5,4.35,"June 2021 Dine-In IndoorMy new favorite restaurant to get fresh, tasty udon! Small restaurant with friendly waiters. Location: Great location because it is in the heart of Little Tokyo. You can walk and relieve the fullness from eating. They do not validate parking for the Little Tokyo parking garage, so I recommend finding a parking along the sidewalk with the meters. I think it's free for 2 hours (but don't quote me on that). Food: Sooooo good. Tasted so fresh. The Beef Udon was light and had a sweet hint of taste in the broth. The Mentai Cream Seafood Udon, ugh to die for. The cream was not overpowering, there was plenty of seafood (mostly squid, which I enjoyed), and fish roe topped it all off. The udon was chewy and fresh. Atmosphere: Small restaurant so everything feels a little ""smooshed"". There is a window to watch the chef cook the udon. Some parts of the restaurant did not have a pleasant smell. Staff: Super kind, attentive, and respectful. Nothing bad to say."
8/15/2021,20210815,5,4.35,!! Big & satisfying portion! Super creammy super tasty!! 2nd time here and will come back for the 3rd time !!
8/20/2021,20210820,5,4.35,"Love love love! My friends and I came here for the first time and I just have to say it- I'm obsessed. We ordered the Uni Udon, Mentai Squid Butter Udon, Sea Urchin Udon, Beef Udon, and the Miso Carbonara- all with a side of egg, and as for appetizers, we ordered the edamame and chicken dish. Honestly everything was so so good I can't even complain. I highly recommend you coming here, but be prepared to wait a little because I don't think they take reservations, first come first serve only."
8/21/2021,20210821,3,4.35,"Ordered 3 bowls of Takeout, everything was just okay. Not really anything that was outstanding for us."
8/22/2021,20210822,5,4.35,"Such satisfying udon noodles!I ordered the miso carbonara udon. It was creamy and rich in the best way possible, yet didn't leave me feeling over saturated. Everything I'd want in carbonara but with perfectly cooked udon noodles. Loved the consistency and chewiness of their udon noodles. I also tried their uni udon which was creamy and delicious as well. I don't always eat uni but loved the flavor. Craving Marugame Monzo just writing this review. Would love to try their curry udon, seafood tomato cream udon, udon gratin and tempura next time. Would definitely have tried these dishes already if I lived in LA, but will definitely return the next time I'm in the area."
8/22/2021,20210822,5,4.35,"This is an amazing udon spot that leaves me so satisfied afterwards. Because there is no Yelp waitlist or reservations, the wait can get crazy, so plan ahead if you want to eat here. Luckily, located in the middle of Little Tokyo, there's plenty of little shops to explore as you wait. This second time I was here, I arrived very close to their opening time of 12 pm. There was already a bunch of people outside, waiting to be seated, which speaks to the popularity of this place. We got seated in around 5 minutes though! They offer both outdoor and indoor seating. Monzo's Fried Chicken (9/10): This is some of the best karaage I've ever had, period. The chicken is tender and flavorful, while the batter has a perfect amount of crisp on the outside, while slowly getting softer as you get close to the chicken. It isn't overly saturated with oil and is just right for what I would want in any fried chicken. Squeezing the lemon wedge all over this dish creates a great tang to compliment the seasoning. Highly recommend to start out with this!Pork Belly Rice Bowl (8/10): Last time I came here, we got this in a regular size, but it was too much food to eat along with our individual udon bowls AND the fried chicken. I was happy to find out that for a lunch special from 12-3 pm, you can add a mini rice bowl to any udon order for $3. So, I got the pork belly again! When they say ""mini"", I would estimate that to be between 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a regular rice bowl. However, this was still a great amount of food and is so worth the $3. I didn't feel the need to add any soy sauce to the pork or rice: the pork is pretty well seasoned and salty, while the rice has some sesame oil and vinegar with a little sweetness to add a delicious balance. This is very simple, but tasty. I wish that the pork belly was more crispy though, as the current texture is too soft for my liking.Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon (10/10!!): I can't speak to any of the other udon bowls because I haven't tried them, but honestly I don't know if I'll ever want to order something besides this one. It is incredible. Perfectly cooked udon noodles with the right amount of bite and chewiness are coated with the rich and creamy sauce. The sea urchin bits are soft and flavorful, and I also enjoy the masago to add more variety to the dish. I could say a lot more about this, but the truth is you really just need to try it for yourself. Beware: this dish is super filling and heavy, so be prepared!This spot will always be in my mind if I'm looking for great Japanese food in LA. A must try!"
8/23/2021,20210823,5,4.35,"Yes, yes and yes! I loooveee udon. Coming from the Bay Area, the only restaurant that serves primarily udon is Marugame Udon. So being able to be in this restaurant and trying out different types of udon dish is so refreshing! Because of its popularity *obviously*, I had to wait for around... 20 min for party of 2 (I arrived at around 7pm). Totally worth the wait! The service is quick too! Got my order and bills very quickly! But I would say it was slightly pricey for its portion. Don't quote on me, since I am not local anyways, this is and will be my go-to place if I ever visit LA's Little Tokyo."
8/24/2021,20210824,5,4.35,The uni udon is delicious. I've tried an uni pasta elsewhere and I prefer the udon more because of the noodles. The thick udon noodles absorbs the uni more which makes it a lot more creamier and tastier. They do give you a lot of uni as well. The bowl looks small but after you finish it you get really full. I will be coming back
8/28/2021,20210828,3,4.35,I've been here 3 times now and the last 2 visits were great but this time I felt like the miso carbonara udon wasn't as good this time. We came all the way from banning for the udon specifically and I just didn't think it was worth the drive this time because the udon was super greasy and it didn't have too much flavor. :/
8/29/2021,20210829,4,4.35,"During a visit with a buddy of mine, he suggested this udon restaurant in Downtown Little Tokyo, of Los Angeles and spoke of the Udon noodles and how good they were. I must say I was not disappointed as they were nice and thick and with a nice tenderness, but nothing overdone. I tried their Uni cream sauce which has a wonderful richness in flavor that I wanted more. I think that is where I was not as satisfied by the portions being a bit small. Although that is my opinion and for others I could see where this may be the perfect portion. Moving on they do sell shrimp tempura by the piece and I highly recommend ordering a few. Most of the time I find tempura soggy and not too crisp. These were wonderfully done in a crispy light batter that I'm glad I ordered three. I can see why there was such a line outside and would come back for sure. They have a wonderful staff and the food was a treat. Enjoy...."
8/30/2021,20210830,5,4.35,"By far the best udon in So Cal!!! Worth the wait, and if you go over the weekend at an off-time the wait goes by so quickly (~15-20 mins compared to the usual hour wait). Service is super friendly too and makes the experience! My only note is that the portion size for the side dishes are small considering their price... we got the jumbo shrimp tempura and it really only comes with 1 piece, and I didn't think it was as jumbo as one would expect. Overall, a great restaurant though."
9/3/2021,20210903,5,4.35,"This is probably some of the best udon we have ever had (have had Udon in Southern California, Bay Area, Hawaii, & Japan). What makes it special is that the texture of the udon allows the flavors to meld into the delicious homemade udon. We had the Beef & Fluffy Egg, and Miso Carbonara.We called ahead of time & picked up about 20 minutes later (before 5:30).Indoor seating was full, but tables seemed a bit too close."
9/10/2021,20210910,5,4.35,"A trip to LA wouldn't be complete without a stop at Marugame Monzo! One of my all time favourite udon places in NA! If you're a fan of uni you must try the Uni Udon! It's so creamy and flavourful, it will have you dreaming of your next trip back to LA just to get some! (Unless you're in the area.. lucky you) I also usually get a side of the small rice bowl! Delicious! Super long wait though, but totally worth the wait!"
9/15/2021,20210915,5,4.35,"This is the best udon place I have had! They make their noodles fresh right in front of you. There is always a line at marugame but line goes by super quick. They have locations all over southern California, Hawaii and more! I always get their Nikutama which is udon noodles served with sweet and savory beef, hot spring egg, and BK sauce. Always taste so refreshing and always leaving the restaurant with a full stomach!"
9/16/2021,20210916,5,4.35,The ratings here are definitely accurate. This place deserves 5 stars! Once you've tried this place you'll definitely start to crave it and will want to come back. My favorite thing to get here is the curry udon. You can't miss it! Other more interesting options include the duck meat udon which is also very tasty with light broth. The great part about this place is you can watch the workers make the fresh udon in front of you. It's captivating to watch. The tempura is also delicious here! Only downside is the parking situation. There's street parking but if you want to save some time and just pay for parking there's a lot in the little tokyo plaza for a fee.
9/18/2021,20210918,5,4.35,"I hadn't been here since pre-COVID, but it's still as good as ever! The parking in Little Tokyo is always annoying but thankfully there's a lot of structures and street meters. I honestly don't remember how long the wait was but it was quite long; they've moved some of their seats outside, so it's still as small as it was before. I ordered the infamous uni sea urchin cream udon, and after the first bite, I realized it was all worth the wait. The dish is creamy, but not too heavy. It's also a seafood dish but it doesn't have a very fishy stench to it. It's savory and coats the noodles nicely--which are also handmade and a great consistency. It's topped with a perilla leaf and a bit of salmon roe, which I think adds a nice complement (though perilla isn't everyone's favorite). Would definitely come here for this dish again, especially since I'm not bloating!!"
9/19/2021,20210919,5,4.35,"The uni sea urchin cream udon is delicious! I got the lunch special with the pork belly rice bowl. I expected thicker pork belly for the rice bowl but nonetheless, it was delicious. The pork belly are the thinner slices and salted. The rice bowl wasn't saucy but mainly seasoned with salt and green onions. The uni cream udon is amazing but a little on the heavier side. There was quite a long wait. When we arrived to the location, there's a clipboard with a list to put your name, number of people in your party, and preference for sitting inside or outside. The staff will call name and associated number of people (also number on the clipboard). Definitely stay around the area and pay attention to when you get called. Most people are just waiting around on the sidewalk."
9/19/2021,20210919,4,4.35,Delicious creamy sea urchin udon. Longgggggg wait (1 hour at 2 pm) to get in. Had to get ice cream from the store nearby so I wouldn't die from hunger. I would visit again for the food but won't go while hungry. Tip: Park at the mall across the way.
9/22/2021,20210922,5,4.35,"The udon here is so fresh and delicious! Tastes like places in Japan. this was our first time eating here and we will definitely be back again!PROS-Clean and cozy inside-They have outdoor seating but make sure you check ahead of time if you don't feel comfortable eating indoors. We went during lunchtime and they did not have outdoor seating available. -Staff is friendly, attentive and welcoming-Great selection of udon and other options if you don't want noodles-The spot is located on the block with other great authentic Japanese restaurants-A cold udon was so good and refreshing on a hot day. The mentai was fresh tasting and delicious soup base. YUM!-I decided to order a side of shrimp tempura and that was amazing and fresh! I love shrimp but sometimes I have an allergic reaction when it's not fresh. This place definitely serves fresh shrimp. -The eggplant tempura was super fresh and cooked perfectly. -Their tempura is cooked to perfection and tastes so good. Not oily like other places."
9/23/2021,20210923,5,4.35,"We love the mapo tofu and their udon at this location. Reasonably priced. There is always at least an hour wait unless you come at opening time, however, food is served fairly quickly once you are seated."
9/25/2021,20210925,4,4.35,Nice outdoor seating. They are only open at certain times so make sure to be quick about writing your name down on the waitlist. The food was delicious. I got the lunch special with beef udon and a beef rice bowl. I would definitely recommend.
9/27/2021,20210927,5,4.35,"delicious udon, i had the duck nanban udon and my friend had the kake udon and both were very good. if you're looking for drinks i recommend the umeshu"
9/28/2021,20210928,5,4.35,"There's a reason why the udon here is so highly rated. After trying the uni udon, I totally understand why it's so popular. It is warm, creamy, and rich. The uni is literally the cherry on top. I loved the addition of the ikura (salmon egg), and it helped balance out the creaminess. We also tried the beef and fluffy Jidori egg udon. This dish had the same flavors of a beef sukiyaki dish. I enjoyed the thick, almost gravy-like broth and the pieces of egg and beef. For both dishes, the udon was chewy and cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back and brave the long line because it's worth the wait!"
9/28/2021,20210928,5,4.35,my No.1 choice of diner whenever I visit little tokyo. the uni udon is a must try.
10/2/2021,20211002,3,4.35,I used to love this place when they make hand made udon in front of you. Do they still serve you hand made udon? I highly doubt it... I went back very recently and I felt noodle quality changed a lot.. maybe they no longer make noodle at spot and serve us frozen instead. Texture and chewiness is gone. Udon sauce is tasty and service is good. Just noodle quality was little disappointing. Overall above average udon place though.
10/4/2021,20211004,1,4.35,"I was visiting from out of state with severalfamily members and since one wanted noodles we decided to try it. The overall vibe is that this place serves authentic food and appears that it is frequented by regular customers. Prior to being seated, we waited outside. I pulled out a chair that was leaning against a table and sat down. Once the restaurant opened a server came over and made a point to spay down and disinfect the table that I did not touch and the three other chairs that I did not sit in. I thought to myself that they are being really careful in regards to Covid and I respect that. However, I quickly recognized that the server was just making a point that I should not have pulled the chair out and used it as the menu that three out of the six of us fondled was not wiped down, prior to being placed back with the other menus to be provided to other customers. With that said, the food was okay, but I told my family we should have went for pizza, especially since they don't respect or treat all their customers the same."
10/8/2021,20211008,5,4.35,This place never disappoints!!! I'd always go here whenever I'm in DTLA. The line can get really long but it's worth the wait. I typically go here when I'm with no one so I can sit right away! Not really good for groups unless you get here early when they open or if you're group is willing to wait. Just try it!
10/9/2021,20211009,5,4.35,LOVE LOVE THE UNI UDON! My favorite place to go and I can literally eat their uni udon everyday! It's very filling and the price is very reasonable :) I def recommend!!
10/10/2021,20211010,3,4.35,"Let me preface this by having never visited Japan and had ""authentic"" Japanese udon. I honestly don't understand the hype around this place. Servers were super friendly, and honestly made my experience a lot better. I arrived on a Saturday night around 6:30pm, and there was 9 parties in front of us. The wait was about 45 minutes. As I arrived with my name on the list, I saw plenty of big bowls, and thought the food would be high in quality and quantity. I ordered 2 uni sea urchin udons. The broth was so creamy, it tasted like japanese spaghetti?? The ""broth"" was literally seafood alfredo you find in those italian restaurants. Yes, the broth was that creamy. The udon amount was so little for what was a $50 meal for 2. They give you a few tiny bits of sea urchin, and by the time I finished eating the countable udon noodles, I felt so sick I couldn't even finish the sea urchin I ordered. The udon noodles were really chewy and full of flavor from the broth though!Perhaps I'm not used to the LA tax for popular restaurants still, but I really didn't feel like this place is worth coming to again."
10/14/2021,20211014,5,4.35,"Very tasty but a little pricey however, it was definitely worth it. The broth for the udon was packed with flavor and the karaage is a definite must to order. It was super crunchy and crisp with out being greasy. The chicken was definitely marinated with ginger and garlic so it had an amazing fragrant taste. Definitely recommend this place. It's right next to daikokuya which is a ramen place that is usually super packed, personally I prefer udon more. I am definitely coming back."
10/14/2021,20211014,5,4.35,I had the shrimp tempura udon and the broth is very light and clean which is my jam. Tried the uni udon too but it's wayyy to heavy for me but that's personal preference.
10/18/2021,20211018,4,4.35,The parking situation here is annoying as there is limited steer parking. There is a garage nearby but no validation from this restaurant. The uni udon was amazing. The creamy uni flavor was on point. The mapo tofu rice was ok. The portion of noodles they give here is small as well.
10/20/2021,20211020,5,4.35,"We often find love in the most unexpected places, and we found the best carbonara at Marugame Monzo. Honestly, the Miso Carbonara Udon may be the best you ever have.For a more typical udon flavor, the Mentai Squid Butter Udon was perfect."
10/23/2021,20211023,5,4.35,"A trip to Little Tokyo means having a lot of options for lunch. It was my son's birthday so we wanted some noodles. My son got the Gratin Udon. He loved it so much he was scraping off the cheese. His plate was clean at the end of lunch. Me and my mom shared the Mentai Seafood Cream Udon. It's got me thinking about coming back again soon. This is the spot to go to when in Little Tokyo. It's perfect for any occasion, date night and just because. Thank you for the great service. It was also nice to eat outside but dining inside is also an option. Get your udon on!"
10/23/2021,20211023,4,4.35,"I've seen many friends go here in LA, and it is so good! We ordered hot and cold udon and shared. My shinsai was filled with veggies and the broth was very refreshing. The quantity and quality for the price is good! We also got the plum shiso and creamy seafood. The portions are small enough where it won't feel super full unless you order other appetizers. Just note the wait can be a bit no matter the time of day, so i would sign up as soon as you arrive."
10/24/2021,20211024,5,4.35,The food and service here are absolutely wonderful! If you are craving a delicious bowl of udon accompanied by such a nice and friendly servers definitely come here! Our servers were so kind and the food came out so fast! The Udon Gratin was so rich and creamy and full of flavor. The beef bowl is also very hardy and is paired nicely with the red ginger. I can't wait to come back! Thank you for the meal!
10/24/2021,20211024,3,4.35,"Ordered curry rice and curry udon. Pretty good and very flavorful. Came out quickly. Asked for the red preserved ginger to add to the rice. The menu only has pork or seafood, but they were able to accommodate with chicken instead. Only giving 3 stars because got real thirsty into the evening. Sodium overload."
10/25/2021,20211025,5,4.35,Yes Yes YesThis place is so good! I love their creamy udon. Their cream and sauce is just perfect and not overly thick or watery. Their sauce isn't too salty but has just the right amount of umami flavor. I like the squeeze lemon on my creamy uni udon. Perfect for a chill date night or dinner with friends!
10/27/2021,20211027,5,4.35,"Marugame Monzo deserved every star they got. Service is good and the food was *chef's kiss*. We got the Uni Sea Urchin Cream udon and the Mentai Seafood Cream udon. They were both so good. The perfect portion because anything bigger would be too heavy. Udon had a great texture. The cream sauce was savory and thick enough to cling onto the noodle. The mentai seafood cream udon has plenty of seafood in it. And uni cream udon was just so good. How to even describe the savory umami flavor besides saying I just want another bowl?However, if you're not a fan of dairy, then you might be a bit apprehensive because the sauce is quite creamy. Definitely had to pop a few lactaid-pills for this meal."
10/27/2021,20211027,5,4.35,"MMMM their creamy udon is DANGEROUSLY GOOD. It warms you up so fast I wish there was something like this in the Bay where I'm from! I don't usually like the soupy udon which is why I opted for the creamy one and so glad I did! 100% recommend the Uni creamy udon, could have 5 bowls of these on a cold day!! Wish I could try more of their menu but I will be back next time!"
10/27/2021,20211027,3,4.35,"I think the vongole udon had a really good flavor, and was worth trying. I was not too impressed with the udon I ordered -- with mountain vegetables and mushrooms. It was good, but not amazing. I didn't like the tempura I ordered -- squid -- it was a bit watery inside the batter. Perhaps it was because the place was really busy but while I was drinking water, the waitress dumped the bill next to me, as if to hurry me up. lso, I felt the service here is not up to par with the surrounding establishments."
10/28/2021,20211028,4,4.35,"Quick summary: Tasty udons with great texture, good portions with decent prices, and a wide variety of menu items to choose from. They're pretty liberal with the heavy cream, but the flavors are still pretty good. Skip on the urchin udon if you're expecting a lot of urchin meat or urchin flavor. - Agedashi Tofu - 3 big blocks of soft tofu sitting in a light soy/dashi (?) with a slightly crispy and chewy coating, and a big heap of grated daikon. I enjoyed the delicate flavors, but it's not a must. - Mentai Cream Seafood Udon - I always spring for mentaiko udon whenever it's available. This one was pretty good, but not the best I've had. While the udon texture is nice and chewy and the amount of mentaiko is fair, there's so much cream sauce, the mentaiko gets lost in it if you mix everything together. I wish I didn't mix the mentaiko in so I could actually eat all of it without having to have all the cream sauce too. All that aside, it was still tasty. I was really surprised by the generous amount of shrimp and scallops they give you. If you're a traveller, check out the mentaiko cream udons from Hanon in Brooklyn, NY, and Udon Mugizo in SF Japantown. Hanon's is absolutely amazing and I like Udon Mugizo's more than this one. - Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon - For the price, you really can't expect much uni or uni flavor. There ARE some small chunks of uni throughout, but I'd rather spend my money on something else. Like the mentai cream udon, it's pretty heavy on the heavy cream. My friend who has high uni standards said the uni quality was good and she still enjoyed this overall. I preferred mine by far and thought I also got way more bang for my buck. Come early and put your name on the list before they open if you don't want to wait. We arrived a few minutes before opening and there was already a small crowd of people outside waiting to be seated. They have you look at the menu through a QR code scan now, but the photo of the menu is terrible quality. Try to look at the menu ahead of time to get a better view on Yelp or Google if you can."
10/28/2021,20211028,5,4.35,Excellent food! Hands down...best udon ever! The broth was tasty. I'm going back for sure.
10/31/2021,20211031,4,4.35,45 minute wait for a Saturday night. There is free street parking on weekends if you get lucky to find a spot!Service was good and food was good. The noodles are made fresh here and you can definitely taste the quality.
11/2/2021,20211102,5,4.35,I absolutely love coming here! My favorite thing to order is the uni creamy udon! The uni makes it creamier and gives it a seafood taste. The udon is cooked perfectly and it is the perfect chewiness! I will be coming back for more!
11/3/2021,20211103,4,4.35,"The pros: noodles were good and chewy, portions were good. Had outdoor seating, and the presentation of the dishes were great. The carbonara udon was tasty, it was slightly too heavy for me personally, but that's what a carbonara is. Coms: I felt there was too much radish in the dish compared to the amount of soy sauce soup they gave. The overwhelming radish made the taste too mild, and because there wasn't that much liquid and the radish soaked it all up, it became a little thick and gloppy."
11/4/2021,20211104,5,4.35,"Love this spot!Marugame Monzo is one of my must-visits whenever i'm in Socal. Their udon is delicious and service is excellent.We got the uni udon, karaage, and beef udon this time. The uni udon was creamy and savory. It is a bit on a heavier side with heavy cream but I enjoyed it. The portion might look small next to the other udons but it was just as filling. The beef udon is a classic and equally delicious. Everything was seasoned well. The karaage was good. (I dipped some in my uni sauce and it was gooood).Service is always excellent. The staffs are kind and attentive. Even when they're busy, the staffs handle the crowd well. They have a sign-in sheet in front of the restaurant. Since the inside is pretty small, i would say try to go early when they open for dinner. Even if you go during dinner rush, the longest i've waited is about 45 minutes. There's shops all over Japantown so time goes pretty quick. Remember to come back a little early since they call your name and there's no phone notifs.Food 4.5/5Service 5/5Experience 5/5"
11/4/2021,20211104,5,4.35,This is a must if you like udon. The food is so fresh and delicious and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Try a speciality or just off the regular side either way you can't go wrong!Carbonara Beef with fluffy eggBeef Udon hot soupTempura Kikage chicken We loved it all
11/6/2021,20211106,5,4.35,If you're looking for a delish bowl of udon then this is the spot! Dined here on a Saturday for lunch. They don't open til 12 but I recommend to arrive early to put your name down because the line gets long. My party was quickly day after presenting out vaccine cards. I tried the mapo tofu udon while my friend had the hot dragon. The mapo tofu was flavorful and very filling for 15$. I also really enjoyed the agedashi eggplant.
11/6/2021,20211106,5,4.35,Loved this place!!! I had the Hot Dragon Udon. It was excellent! Would love to come back for more next time!
11/7/2021,20211107,5,4.35,"yet another amazing review for this delicious place!When I lived in LA, I came here frequently. Sadly, there is no advance reservations or anything like that -- you gotta walk up and put your name down. Don't be discouraged -- usually the fat ass line is for Daikokuya Ramen next door.The ones I have tried are:Uni Cream Udon: Warm and creamy, not that much uni as I would like though! But very delicious with their salmon roe on top. Eat this one fast because it gets cold pretty fast.Tomato and Cream Udon: I really enjoyed this one, but mostly because I like tomato flavor hehe. its kinda of like a creamy tomato soup! Mentai cream Seafood Udon: this was came cold, I was so surprised, but still alright. It was more watery consistency than creamY? There were pieces here and there of mentai -- not a lot. Miso Carbonara Udon: This came out hottt. I tried this one and it was soooo bacony. It overpowered the entire dish. If youre in a bacon mood, this one is definitely for you.Negitoro bowl: chopped fatty tuna, green onion with rice. Good to share. Worth it if you think you'd still be hungry after udonKikiage Bowl: Shredded tempura with rice. It looks really cool when it comes out bc it looks kinda tall. It is good for the first 10 minutes because its hot. But other than that, I dont think its worth it. It gets cold and not very good anymore. It needs something more than the tempura. dry. Their udon is in house made! You can sit and watch them make it through the glass window in the corner of the store. I really enjoy their udon. its springy and chewy, very delicious. Parking can get pretty terrible here, but there is street parking in front or by little Tokyo. You can also park in the parking lot/structure and get it validated!"
11/7/2021,20211107,5,4.35,"Still a fantastic place to grab some legit udon (or when you want noodles but not ramen). Tried the Miso Carbonara Udon which was delicious, although I probably wouldn't order again as I prefer my more traditional udon with soup. The Miso Carbonara is very saucy and seemed like a Japanese take on an Italian dish. They had some outdoor seating but it got pretty chilly even with the small heaters the staff brought out."
11/7/2021,20211107,5,4.35,They Udon was so yummy!! I got the sea urchin uni udon and my husband got the beef and fluffy egg udon. They were both so tasty! We were there on a Saturday evening so we had about a 30-40 minute wait before we were seated indoors. Outdoor service seemed to be bit faster. In order to sit indoors you have to show your vaccination card/QR code. Once indoors the service is fast!
11/7/2021,20211107,1,4.35,"The food was alright but the service was HORRIBLE. Actually, no. The only bad thing about the service was the host (picture of him attached). As a worker at multiple restaurants with much experience, the host here has zero common sense and makes the system so messy. He was also very stubborn. Maybe if they changed the host, I would give this place 5 stars."
11/8/2021,20211108,5,4.35,"Impressed! Got their #1 dish: uni udon. Super creamy and super delicious! I hope the uni pieces can be larger tho (instead of smaller cut up pieces). Also, is it just me their huge wooden spoon just made it super hard to get the remaining soup at the bottom ? Nevertheless, food and service both excellent! Will definitely be coming back."
11/9/2021,20211109,5,4.35,"Amazing Udon literally the best ever in LA. Came all the way from Massachusetts for this and let me tell you, it's the best. Everything was so perfect and the carbonated udon is a must try! So creamy and every bite and spoonful was so good."
11/9/2021,20211109,4,4.35,Mentai squid butter udon was amazing. My friend said her tempura was average. Very nice staff
11/10/2021,20211110,1,4.35,"The service here is horrible, I don't know if our server was racist since i'm mexican but we were sat first yet he took TWO tables orders and drinks before us and just kept us waiting. we left because why would we spend our money on a a place that didn't even want us."
11/11/2021,20211111,5,4.35,"Came here after work and was super excited because I've been always wanting to try this place out. I was conflicted between getting the Uni Udon or the Miso Carbonara Udon, but ended up playing safe and sticking with the Miso Carbonara. It was super creamy and light at the same time, the udon noodles were perfectly chewy and bouncy. They give a generous amount of bacon which added a little salty kick to each bite you take!My friend got their Uni Udon which I got to try a bit of and it was pretty okay, the Uni flavor was very very light. Still just as creamy as my Miso Carbonara but was not really rich in the uni flavor. Maybe it's because they ran out of uni pieces to top it off with like how they usually would (or as seen in pictures). Also got to try a bit of my cousin's Gratin Udon which comes in a little cute skillet. His dish actually almost made me want to switch mine out! It was super cheesy and packed with rich creaminess and had little bits of chicken! Everything was definitly worth it, Uni Udon could've been a bit better but everything else was amazing! Service was super nice and quick as well!"
11/23/2021,20211123,3,4.35,Food was decent and I liked the creaminess of the udon. It wasn't anything too special especially with the 30 min wait. The sea urchin was chopped up to smaller pieces and the chicken wasn't super crispy. I've had better creamy Udon in SF
11/23/2021,20211123,3,4.35,Waited about 30 minutes to get in. Place was jam packed with a lot of people waiting outside. We got the basic kakeudon and shrimp tempura udon. The food was ok. We've definitely had better. The noodles were a little starchy and the soup was lukewarm and pretty salty. I don't think we'll return. We really wanted to like it!
11/24/2021,20211124,4,4.35,"All the hype and tons of rave reviews by friends. Went to check it out. COVID protocol was in place, as they were asking for vax cards to sit inside. We got there at 11am on a Sunday and there was already a line with 8 people ahead of us. Karaage- 4/5 stars. I liked their batter that was light and refreshing. It kinda tasted like mochiko chicken. Our two friends weren't big fans but I enjoyed it. Mabo udon - 4/5 stars. I loved the Mabo tofu but my brain couldn't quite wrap around the idea of udon being combined with tofu. It works and was good.Seafood udon- 4/5 stars. I liked the broth a lot but again my brain couldn't quite register the broth with udon. It kept saying that it would be better with ramen: clearly, that's a personal problem: Miso carbonara- 3/5 stars. Good. OK. wouldn't order again. Conclusion is that I should just stick with traditional udon like kitsune or curry udon like I used to back in Japan. They have those options but I wanted to try something different. Nonetheless it is worth trying and their udon is good."
11/25/2021,20211125,4,4.35,Delicious as always! We were surprised that there was no wait on this visit. Guess we're still struggling with post-COVID stuff? Provided our vax proof and got right in. One weird thing: No hot tea?! Oh well...The Udon and Mabo were so good! Looking forward to our next visit to LA so we can go again!
11/26/2021,20211126,5,4.35,"My bf and I arrived 20 minutes before opening and were 6th in line for the first seating. Try the uni udon! The hype is real. It was the better of the two. It was medium in thickness, creamy, and overall not too filling. I was hesitant it would be too filling, but portion sizes were perfect. The uni is from Santa Barbara and the dish is topped with roe. I'm glad I did not feel like I left with a food coma.It gets crowded quick, so get here early!"
11/26/2021,20211126,5,4.35,"My family loved it. 4 stars for the squid broth (5 stars for the squid cooked to perfection), 5 stars for the other udon broth (beef, egg, and cream broths)"
11/27/2021,20211127,5,4.35,"We started off with monzos fried chicken and assorted tempura. It was so fresh and crispy. It was a great way to start dinner.For dinner, we ordered the gratin udon, the duck udon, the spicy beef bowl, and the mad tiger. We all devoured our meals and enjoyed every bite. It was hot, but didn't scold your tongue. It was ready to eat and it filled us up without overfilling us. We were able to walk around some more and feel energized. The customer service was perfect and to the point. It is first come, first serve and we had Boba next door while we waited for our table. We will definitely come back to try more items on the menu."
11/28/2021,20211128,5,4.35,"Its been 4 years since we were here last. It is as crowd as I remember. We purposely got there half an hr before opening (on a Sat) and still ended up being 11th in line. The food was amazing though, we ordered the mentai seafood udon, uni cream risotto, hot dragon udon and assorted tempura. I have tried the uni sea urchin udon but hey the risotto really soaked up the uni flavor and it was amazing. Mentai seafood udom was great. I just love the flavor of mentai :). Hot dragon udon was alright, a bit too salty and the tempura was nothing special. Just an appetizer for us. Will be back again in the future."
11/29/2021,20211129,4,4.35,"Finally got to try this place. I came here on Saturday morning after black Friday. Got there 11:40 (they open at noon) but there were already 9 parties waiting in front of me. Fortunately got seated quickly after vax card check.  Sea urchin uni cream udon and mentai seafood cream udon were both good.  Not too heavy and filling on the sauce. I really liked that they added roe eggs to top off the uni cream flavor. I ordered side of assorted tempura as well but it didn't come out as we already finished eating udon. So, had to remind our waitress about it. It would have been really nice if we were able to eat tempura while eating udon. Other than that, everything else was good. Very quick and nice service."
11/29/2021,20211129,5,4.35,"My taste buds were satisfied after coming to Marugame Monzo!! Came here for a late lunch and there was no wait. We ordered the carbonara and curry udon dishes, and wowww both were incredible. Super creamy, filling, and tasty. Parking is a bit difficult in Little Tokyo, but worth the trip if you plan on getting dessert in the area afterwards or walking around the shops."
12/1/2021,20211201,4,4.35,"Got here around 1p on a Saturday and waited around 25 minutes for a party of two. Honestly didn't mind the wait that much and the service was fast so the line moves quickly, especially for small groups.We ordered the Uni Cream Udon and Beef Bukkake Udon, with tempura squid and tempura eggs on the side. The udon was amazing. They were the perfect texture and I loved the flavor of both dishes. I also think the two we ordered also complemented each other well. The uni cream udon was a warm dish, the uni was melt-in-your-mouth good and the cream sauce was flavorful but not too heavy or overwhelming. The beef bukkake udon was a cold dish - I liked the green onion flavor and overall it was a refreshing complement to the creamier uni udon. The tempura squid was also bomb, but I wasn't a fan of the tempura eggs.Service was excellent! It was a short wait to receive our food after ordering.The only downside of this experience is that if you come in the winter months make sure to bring a warm jacket or choose inside seating. It was pretty cold sitting outdoors which I feel affected the experience. There was also a huge crane right next to us on the street due to construction that day. LOL"
12/1/2021,20211201,4,4.35,"Delicious Italian Japanese fusion with the udon carbonara . I will definitely be back. Ps. I don't know how I forgot to mention the shrimp tempura. I have been eating this dish for many many years. I even know how to make it myself . But, this was the best I have ever eaten. The batter was light and airy, the shrimp was very fresh, and together with the dipping sauce, simply amazing. Theirs even beats my own."
12/3/2021,20211203,5,4.35,"Coming home from college for Thanksgiving Break, I knew I had to come back here. It was a Saturday night after Thanksgiving around 7:30PM and there were literally like 23 tables ahead of us but I was not leaving so we waited and just bought some boba from the place next door and talked for an hour or so (I wasn't paying attention, tbh). I do not mind waiting if I know the food is good, and time passes quickly when you're talking to your friends. Of course, I ordered my Uni Udon and a side of their Fried Chicken.As always, I absolutely adore their Uni Udon. It hits the spot every time and I can never get enough. The fried chicken was delicious and flavorful and is delightful with a squeeze of lemon.We ordered a Udon Gratin with Chicken to share. This one was a little less good than the others just because this one is more mild in flavor and didn't stand out as much. However, if you love a cheesy noodle dish then this one is for you. My friend ordered their beef udon. I have been here around 10 times but I actually have never tried their clear-broth udons (because I almost always end up ordering the Uni Udon instead). I decided to try a spoonful of the beef udon broth and was in shock by how good it was. To conclude, my friend and I agreed that any other udon place does not compare to to Marugame Monzo and that after you try their broth, you will think every other place's udon is subpar compared to this one's."
12/4/2021,20211204,5,4.35,My favorite place to get fresh udon! They make their noodles themselves! So everything is served fresh! The only thing is there's isn't a parking lot and the line tends to be long be it is worth the wait for the fresh serving noodles!! It is worth the hype haha
12/5/2021,20211205,5,4.35,"It is alwayss busy, this small udon shop, but it's well worth the wait. Fresh handmade udon noodles and lots of styles to choose from. Whether you're into traditional soups or love diving into fusion, I haven't had anything here that's a miss. They are especially known for their uni udon which is so delicious. Great balance of creamy uni with a savory blended broth. I haven't had an uni noodle dish better than the one I've had at Monzo. Their tonkatsu and carbonara udon is delicious as well! Always a stop for me when I'm in the area."
12/5/2021,20211205,5,4.35,my favorite udon place! Definitely recommend! I think you'll get better experience to dine in than take outs. Try their chicken Katsu and ebi fry!
12/6/2021,20211206,5,4.35,"The udon here is so fresh and delicious! Tastes like places in Japan. this was our first time eating here and we will definitely be back again! I recommend getting there ahead of time before they reopen for dinner since a line starts to form by the time they reopen. The service is fast, the staff is very attentive and nice. The food is amazing. I love the lunch deal they have of the mini rice bowls. Definitely a good addition to have with your Udon."
12/6/2021,20211206,4,4.35,"You sign in on a clipboard at the entrance of the restaurant. I got there at 11:15 and was second in line, the waitlist got pretty big the closer it got to the opening time of noon. The prices are very reasonable, it's $3 extra for a double portion. I got the kake udon, I'm not sure if I haven't had enough experience with hand-pulled udon or not but it tasted rather starchy, more like pasta than the udon I'm used to that slips down my throat with ease. It was all very hearty though, it's very hard for me to dislike udon. The staff are very friendly, attentive, and polite. I'd love to try some of the other udon dishes with meat one day!"
12/7/2021,20211207,4,4.35,"Our first stop in LA was this popular udon spot that had quite a line wait. There were about six parties in front of us when we lined up close to 6p on a Monday.The workers all spoke Japanese which was very refreshing, and the inside was super cozy. I like my noodles thin and firm (yes, even udon lol) but unfortunately because they make everyone's orders in the same batch I couldn't modify the firmness. I got the Miso Carbonara since it was listed as one of the most popular items, and I'm a sucker for anything creamy - especially carbonara. The miso flavor was very very VERY subtle - I couldn't taste it until the last few bites. The dish is overall very creamy and slightly sweet, but the bits of salty bacon help balance out the sweetness. I noticed that the handmade noodles themselves are also on the sweeter side. the Assorted Tempura was beautiful fried and came with a shrimp, fish, shiitake mushroom, eggplant and two shiso leaves. The oil that they used was clean and the tempura didn't feel too oily."
12/7/2021,20211207,3,4.35,"Wow what a change! Our next visit here was not good. We came last Saturday during opening and ordered the same Uni udon, Carbonara udon, and pork w/ rice. First off the carbonara was way too sweet and tasted like milk sugar water. We couldn't taste the carbonara in this whatsoever. My uni dish was good but I forgot how small of a portion they serve? I finished quick; it felt like there was less than a small serving of udon. Our pork and rice dish was not good either; small portion, way too sticky rice, and just shrubs of meat which didn't have flavor. I was disappointed this time around and won't be coming back for a long while. We were not satisfied."
12/9/2021,20211209,5,4.35,"In college, I would always come to Little Tokyo, wait like 30 min to an hour just to eat Marugame Monzo. The fusion udon is so delicious and the rice bowls are a must. I always get their mentai squid butter or uni pasta. I would add a tempura egg and shrimp to go along with the udon if I'm feeling extra hungry, but the udon is decently filling as is. I did notice the amount of udon has decreased over the years and the price has slowly risen. Other than that, this is the best fusion udon place you can get in LA!"
12/10/2021,20211210,5,4.35,"Picked up three Udon bowls to-go before a night out in LA. I loved their packaging which separated the noodles from the sauce and toppings to ensure freshness. The noodles were cooked to perfection. Tender with a nice Al dente chewy bite to it! We had a carbonara one, a hot one with beef, and a cold one with salmon roe. All three were so delicious it left me craving more. Between two of us, we almost ate all 3! The carbonara was a nice Italian fusion. I loved the thick, chewy noodle coated with a rich, creamy sauce. The beef one was very flavorful and fresh. The soup was so rich and flavorful yet light at the same time. I could drink a gallon of just the broth alone!My all time favorite is cold udon, though. I love the freshness of the cold roe against the chewy noodle. I feel like it pairs so well with the dashi in the broth and it very refreshing. Overall, I don't think you can go wrong with anything you try from here! We tried three different dishes and all were 5/5 stars!I wish they had one closer to me, I would definitely have been a regular. This will be a new spot I will crave when I'm in the area though!"
12/14/2021,20211214,4,4.35,"There's always a crowd outside this spot. Even when I came around 1pm on a weekday, there were still people on the waitlist. I was dining alone, and I got seated really quickly. The moment I got seated, my server asked me if I was ready to order, which I was not. Then after she left, another server came up and asked me to order. This made me pretty anxious, and the menu when you pull it up is too blurry to read, so I had to rely on Yelp to make my decision.The food itself is delicious. The bowl is way larger than I expected, and I drank every drop of the deeply umami-flavored, clear broth. I ordered the Hot Sansai Udon ($12.50), which comes with scallions and Japanese mountain vegetables. I was sick that day, so the veggies and thick noodles were so comforting to eat. There are cold noodles and a variety of enticing specials that make use of udon in very intriguing ways, but I think the classics will also be satisfying!Service is very prompt, and I was in and out in 30 minutes, so I'm guessing you won't have to wait toooo long if you come here."
12/16/2021,20211216,3,4.35,"Don't know why I thought I would like udon noodles in Alfredo sauce. I got the sea urchin one because it was advertised as their most popular dish, not realizing what exactly it actually was. I guess I expected it to be some other kind of Japanese white sauce. I also got the eggplant because I love eggplant and it was decent."
12/16/2021,20211216,5,4.35,love this place. I hope they stay in business forever. Noodles are delicious. My favorite is the very traditional tempura udon.
12/18/2021,20211218,5,4.35,"Run, dont walk, and order their uni cream udon! You will not be disappointed! I ordered from here via door dash and it was so good! Portion was just right and it was not overly rich. Would love to come back and try all their other dishes!"
12/21/2021,20211221,3,4.35,"Tried the creamy uni udon and the duck udon. The flavors for both for great but the texture of the noodles were soggy. The udon was mushy in the middle as if it had been cooked and left there then reheated with soup. Maybe I came on a bad day? Otherwise, food came quickly and service was great."
12/22/2021,20211222,4,4.35,"honestly wasn't too impressed with the uni udon - i think it would serve better as a smaller appetizer instead of a main course. i'm a huge fan of uni but imo there was diminishing marginal utility in terms of the flavor, every bite started to become very similar and less enjoyable. I tried some of the traditional udon that my friends got and it was packed with flavor and umami so I might've ordered the wrong dish. i'll have to come back again and try one of their traditional udon soups instead"
12/27/2021,20211227,5,4.35,"Being in the area, it's given that I have to swing by my favorite udon place! With the new COVID protocols, the restaurant requires to see your vaccination status + ID before being seated, which I think is a great idea for the safety of everyone. I came back to eat their Pork Curry Udon ($12) and added their jumbo shrimp tempura ($3). This pairing goes very well together because you can dip the tempura into the curry sauce and it is SOOO good!!! I notice that they changed their noodles, it has a flatter shape rather than round. But it is still handmade, and absolutely delicious! Love love love this place still :)"
12/28/2021,20211228,4,4.35,"A lot of people recommended this udon spot to me so I finally got around to trying it. They have a lot of unique options on top of the more traditional udons. We ordered the uni udon and the beef jidori egg udon. The uni udon was very rich in flavor, which I really enjoyed. There wasn't too many pieces of uni though but I did appreciate bowl being topped with a bit of roe. The beef jidori egg udon was good as well. I really enjoyed the broth. We also ordered the tempura which was good. My favorite was the soft boiled egg tempura. My only complaint is that everyone raves about the ""fresh"" udon here but both bowls had chewy noodles that did not resemble fresh udon. My favorite udon place is Marukame in Hawaii, which came to OC at South Coast Plaza as ""Marugame"" recently and you can tell the difference in noodle texture that theirs is way more fresh than it is here."
12/29/2021,20211229,5,4.35,Marugame Monzo probably has the best udon i've had. The texture of the udon is just different from what i'm used to having... in a good way. Pair that with the creamy uni that they offer and you get a very satisfying meal. We also got tempura eggs which were awesome. Always a crowd but i can see why. Would definitely come back.
12/29/2021,20211229,1,4.35,"So I didn't order the noodle, but the beef rice bowl and other bowls just are not good at all. I would say it didn't worth it. And it's not what I would say is Japanese food. Just disappointed what I expected it would be."
12/30/2021,20211230,5,4.35,"There was a long line when we arrived, but it went by fast  which was important since it was so cold outside.When we noticed the outdoor heaters, we opted for outdoor seating, and it kept us toasty warm. All the udon dishes ordered by our family of 6 were large were large portions, deliciously hot and exquisitely flavorful.Overall a great experience and I highly recommend it!"
12/31/2021,20211231,5,4.35,"My friends and I got there at about 11.45am on a Thursday and there was already a line with about 4-5 groups of people ahead of us. Would definitely recommend heading there about 15-20 mins before their opening time (12pm) because we did not expect there to be such a crowd given that it was also raining pretty heavily. We managed to be seated in the first wave and service was also pretty quick. We ordered 3 items: 1. Miso Carbonara Udon; 2. Mentai Butter Squid Udon; 3. Mentai Cream Seafood Udon. These were all served in huge bowls but the portion itself wasn't huge. Despite the slightly smaller portion sizes, the richness of the sauces definitely made us full. I fully enjoyed my Miso Carbonara Udon; it was creamy and flavorful and definitely umami because of the miso which was subtle, but there. Overall, I would say that the dishes were pretty good at their price points ~$19 per person including tip. I saw many people ordering the Uni Cream Udon so I might want to go back and try that too. It was a comforting meal for a rainy day in Little Tokyo."

1/2/2022,20220102,5,4.35,"PSA the creamy tomato seafood udon is finally back!! I have been awaiting it's return since the beginning of Covid in 2020 and I'm happy to say that it tastes exactly as I remember. I'm already looking forward to the next time I visit so that I can inhale another bowl of this delicious udon. Palette wise, I'd say the creamy tomato seafood udon is quite flavorful! It has a creamy base but at the same time the tomato makes it a bit acidic, which pairs well with the seafood flavor/shrimp flavor! If you're not too big of a fan of shrimp, I wouldn't suggest this soup. Not that there's a lot of shrimp pieces in the udon but the shrimp flavor is strong. Also, the home made udon pasta is the perfect texture! Personally, I think it's delicious and 10/10 would recommend to anyone and everyone!"
1/2/2022,20220102,5,4.35,"Typical Japanese udon joint with very good udon. Our group of 5 waited around 15 minutes for our table. We ordered- Beef Udon- Carbonara Miso Udon - Wakame Udon (seaweed udon) - Sansai Udon (vegetable udon) - Assorted Tempura - Chicken Karaage Personal favorite are the Carbonara Miso and the Beef Udon. Can take either of these any day of the week. The wakame and Sansai are good as well, lighter version but full of flavor. Karaage and Tempura are perfect companions for our sake. Kampaii! Service is excellent, from the reception to waiter, despite the busy business. Thumbs up Will go back to try the rice bowls and cold noodles."

1/10/2022,20220110,5,4.35,My son and I had a very delicious lunch here! We had shrimp tempura and the Udon with the cheese in it. Normally we would have ordered the typical Udon dishes but we saw a picture on here that made us want to try something different. It was amazing! My son had the leftovers the next day and said it was still very good. We will definitely take the drive back there soon for more!

The serving was so freakin' huge, the soup/broth was so tasty plus they put a lot of the seafood on the Curry Udon! The assorted tempura was good, just wished they included more assortment since it's priced at 9 bucks. Regardless, we had a very pleasant dining experience and we will definitely come back to this place!"

1/12/2022,20220112,4,4.35,"Came here on New Years Day and the line was unexpectedly short. Only had to wait ~10 minutes for a table for two. They checked vaccine and ID. We ordered the uni cream udon and the hot sansai udon. The uni cream udon was VERY creamy and tasted cheesy. The pieces of uni were mixed into the udon. The sansai udon came covered in veggies (looked like broccoli, string beans, mushrooms, green onions, etc) and the soup was piping hot which was perfect for a cold evening. Would love to have tried more of their udons!!"
1/12/2022,20220112,5,4.35,THE BEST udon and karaage I have ever had. Shrimp tempura udon has the most delicious broth. Karaage was beyond perfect- the flavor or garlic and ginger is so good and the crispy outside is to die for!

1/15/2022,20220115,5,4.35,Excellent udon! Noodles were very tasty. I had the one with the sweet beef and egg. We had fried chicken on the side and takoyaki. Also delicious. Highly recommended
1/15/2022,20220115,5,4.35,"absolutely no complaints on my end. i ordered the curry udon and they were able to put chicken instead of pork. it was amazing! usually i don't think i'm the biggest udon fan because of how thick the noddles are, but this time i ate the entire meal up no crumbs! service was really nice and the waiters gave their recommendations. would absolutely come here again"

1/16/2022,20220116,5,4.35,"Marugame Monzo is THE place for udon in Little Tokyo (and LA in general)! We knew it would be good because we got there right when it opened at 12, and there was already a huge line waiting outside. Definitely come there extra early if you want to get seated right away.We ordered the Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon, which was such a great take on traditional udon. The noodles were bouncy and perfectly cooked, and the uni cream sauce was amazing with a hint of seafood flavor from the sea urchin. I wish there was a bit more uni in the noodles, but there's still a fairly good amount. If you love seafood, this is definitely the dish for you.The Takoyaki was the perfect appetizer. It was creamy on the inside and each piece had a generous amount of octopus in it! The sauce and bonito flakes made it super flavorful as well.Overall, this is an amazing place for udon and definitely try to get a seat if you're in the area! My only complaint was the long wait, but even then, it was so worth it."
1/16/2022,20220116,5,4.35,"Never disappoint. I only come here for one thing. It's the Uni Udon. It's more of a pasta in my opinion than a Udon but the creamy base consist taste of the uni is delicious. Their mixed tempuras are also satisfyingly good and crispy each time. Since the new covid restrictions, you do have to show your vaccination card and proof of ID to enter and dine there. I also wouldn't recommend going with a crowd no more than 4 since the place is pretty limited to space. Hope you all try and enjoy!"
1/17/2022,20220117,5,4.35,"Hi I'm the 4,000th review, this place is great! Definitely won't be disappointed with the food and experience!"
1/19/2022,20220119,5,4.35,今天要分享的麵家應該也是小東京前幾名的名店了， 永遠高朋滿座， 我們到的時候是 11:30 ， 已經開始登記， 到12:00 真正開門時，外面已經登記20幾桌了， 真的是有給他誇張， 其實，店裡面就是簡單的烏冬麵跟一些飯食，最最有名的就是uni 烏冬， Q彈的麵條，配上海膽的香濃， 真的是會令任何人吃過一次就深深愛上，會念念不忘，吃到這種麵店時的感覺就是人這一輩子做好一件事就功德圓滿了， 可以想像店家對食物的堅持跟努力保持品質的用心，要一直維持一樣的水準，開店時的初心，數十年來如一日，真的是一件不容易的事，我想只要能專注的在自己的領域裡做好同一件事，任何人都能從平凡變成卓越！
1/22/2022,20220122,5,4.35,"I was on my date nite (with my babe) yesterday. We decided to live out our recent motto of ""wanting to do everything and nothing together."" So as part of our wanting to do ""everything & nothing"" together we decided to ""re-explore"" all the fun pockets of LA as Angelinos together (even though we grew up here) by driving from neighborhood to neighborhood that night and see where the night would take us. We started on the glimmering parts of Sunset Blvd...onto the long stretch of businesses on La Cienaga...trickling onto the glitzy part of Robertson...then the fun streets of Weho...then the lively streets of SIlverlake & Echo Park...then we ended up in the culturally diverse part of J-Town in downtown LA. Out of all those neighborhoods, J-Town was the most lively area that was bustling with people spilling out onto the sidewalks. We decided this was the spot we wanted to eat for dinner. We found a public parking lot paralleled one street over on 2nd St. where we got to zig zag & cut through the bustling crowds within the Japanese Village Plaza. Then we walked up to the intimidating crowd of people standing outside of Monzo and bravely attempted to put our names down in hopes to get a seat before they closed at 9pm.Fast forward to what we ordered was the following:-Their hot Creamy Uni Udon topped with a round scoop of Ikura (Salmon Roe Eggs) set sitting on top of a velvety sheet of a shiso leaf. YUM!!!-Sizzling hot Seafood Curry Udon that came with a rich dark curry broth.-2x individual orders of their light and fluffy giant crispy Shrimp Tempura pieces that were crumbling with tender flakes in every bite. It came with Tentsuyu which is the traditional Japanese dipping sauce for all kinds of tempura. (YUM!)Then jumping back to standing around in line to get seated...I wanted to advise to not get intimidated by the massive long line swarming in front of the business. Yes, it is crawling with a giant crowd of people standing around to get a seat inside or out. Yes, the place is always packed. But, once you put your name down on their clipboard inside at the front desk I found the trick is to go in the last hour before they close and your chances are much higher to get sat down before they close the kitchen. I got their to put my name down at 8pm when they actually close at 9pm on a Friday night. By 8:30pm I had been seated and was being served my hot bowls of udon and taking my first bite by this point. It apparently seems that many people come to write down their names on the clipboard with the high hopes of getting seated here to eat but I'd say half the people on that list end up wandering to other nearby businesses while they wait and either miss their slot or end up eating elsewhere and never come back in time to get seated when their names are called. For me I had the desire and passion to want to eat here so I stuck it out and we stood by like eager birds standing its hunting ground to get its prey...and the plan worked! Seated & served within 30 minutes. Totally worth it! This place lives up to the hype and definitely worth the wait. STAND YOUR GROUND!"
1/22/2022,20220122,5,4.35,"My friend and I came here on a Tuesday at 1pm and there was no wait, fortunately. We parked at the Aiso Parking Garage which is only $1/hour for the first 2 hours and ~3 minutes walking distance from Marugame Monzo. I usually order my favorite here, the mushroom cream udon, but today I decided to try the shrimp tempura udon. I really liked the shrimp tempura, but the soup was a little too salty for my liking. Nonetheless, I still really enjoyed my food! The udon here is always perfect and customer service is always great! This is my favorite udon restaurant in LA. It is definitely a must try when one is in Little Tokyo."
1/22/2022,20220122,1,4.35,The food was very bald and tasteless. My chicken was soapy and chewy. I will never come back
1/23/2022,20220123,5,4.35,I would give this place a 10/10 stars if I can. Best Udon I've ever had in my entire life. Their Uni Udon is a must try. If you're the type to do family style and share with your friends or family - don't bother sharing the uni udon lol. It's too good to share. I did try other udon dishes but the uni udon was the best one by far (Bonus - they make their udon fresh!) I also ordered the takoyaki which was slightly crispy on the outside and creamy/flavorful on the inside. Gave me flash back to when I had takoyaki is Japan. The hype is definitely worth it for this place. Definitely add it to your must try places when visiting downtown LA. Staff was also great!
1/23/2022,20220123,1,4.35,Waited 10 minutes with open tables. Went up to ask to be seated and the male host rudely told us he's not ready to seat us yet lol.
1/25/2022,20220125,5,4.35,"This is one of the best Udon spots I've ever tried!! If not the best.The parking might be tricky cuz it's in the middle of little Tokyo. Street parking is probably a No there's a parking structure nearby, and parking at Home Depot or whatever that Orange retail store is. The food is super yummy! They are known for their uni udon which is absolutely amazing. It's really thick and creamy. I also really really liked the carbonara bacon udon. I wasn't a big fan of the squid udon it was way too fishy for me. But some love it, I am not a big fishy flavor typa guy.There's always some line so I recommend coming early/count in the wait time."
1/25/2022,20220125,5,4.35,"I came here because my sister & I were looking for some good udon and this place didn't disappoint. Their noodles are cooked to a more al dente consistency and I enjoyed it. I tried the mental squid butter udon and it was good. We also tried the veggie udon and it was surprisingly really good. It was really refreshing and well balanced. I would order that again! We also ordered shrimp, squid, & shiitake mushroom tempura that came with a dipping sauce, all were so light and crispy. Service was A+."
1/26/2022,20220126,5,4.35,"Delicious low key spot for udon. We went for lunch on a Monday, and around noon there were about 4 tables present. We tried the tempura and a couple of soup based udons. Both were very good, with the noodles cooked well. The tempura was light and airy and still crunchy even after cooling down. Pricing is decent, recommended!"
1/27/2022,20220127,4,4.35,"We came here on a Thursday evening around 5:40pm. There was plenty of seating. We dined outside. It was nice and clean. Parking: street or public parking from $10-12Service: good. Very attentive. Mentai Butter Squid Udon: Really enjoyed buttery flavor of the broth and udon noodles. But I do not like onions, and there was quite a bit of it. There was not as much mentai or squid flavor to me. 6.5/10Mapo Tofu Udon: Taste was unlike a typical mapo tofu dish at a Chinese restaurant. It was more savory and meaty than spicy, with diced pork and mushroom. Tofu was very yummy and silky. 6/10Overall: 4/5. We would come back to try the other udons"
1/30/2022,20220130,5,4.35,"The Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon is a MUST TRY!!! I've also tried the Mentai Squid Butter Udon and the Miso Carbonara Udon which are also both really good but the Uni udon is what I always come back for! There's usually a pretty intimidating line but it goes down a lot faster than you would think. Personally, I've always had to wait around 30 mins whenever I come but it's well worth it! The service is great. Even though they're always packed the staff are super fast and attentive!Uni Cream Udon: Udon noodles were super bouncy, chewy, and perfectly cooked. The sauce was thick and creamy with a slight seafood flavor from the uni. This bowl is topped with a shiso leaf and ikura. Because the sauce is so thick and creamy, the popping ikura helps to brighten the meal up a bit so you don't get sick of it.Miso Carbonara Udon: Again, udon was perfectly cooked and like the uni cream udon, this sauce was also super rich and creamy. The miso adds some umami to the sauce and they don't overdo it with the bacon which makes for a super flavorful and rich sauce. Highly recommend! Mentai Squid Butter Udon: Definitely has a strong seafood flavor and they are generous with the squid pieces. A great choice if you're a seafood lover and don't want something too rich and creamy. However, I don't think I'd personally order this one again.Overall, highly recommend and I cant wait to come back to try their new Seafood Tomato Cream Udon!"
1/30/2022,20220130,3,4.35,"We were in Little Tokyo today. Dan wanted ramen; however, I had such a strong craving for hot udon. Marugame Monzo had a long line in the middle of the afternoon. I hate to wait; however, the food folks were eating here looked amazing.So we waited and eventually got a great table inside. Place was intimate, cute. They even had nice clean bathrooms. I was ready to have a 4 to 5 star meal.Sapporo BeerStarted our meal off with an ice cold Sapporo (big bottle). Came out quick with chilled glasses. Yay!Curry Udon With PorkLooked and smelled amazing. There were highs and lows to this dish - hence my 3 star review.1. Curry broth was amazing. It was thick and packed with a lovely curry flavor. Absolutely a 5 star broth.2. Pork. The pork was sliced paper thin, packed with flavor. Sadly it was a tad chewy.3. Onions. The onions were raw, maybe briefly cooked? I tasted two pieces and left behind the rest.4. Carrots. The carrots were prepared perfectly, tender and flavorful.5. Udon noodles. The noodles were undercooked. They were chewy. I ate a few but left most behind.Service was good. Definitely a nice place. I suspect I ordered the wrong dish. I shall definitely return and try one of their more popular items."
1/30/2022,20220130,3,4.35,"3.5 stars, but given the Yelp rubric - 3 stars it is. I came here this afternoon with my partner for an early dinner. While I wanted to go to Daikokuya Ramen, my partner was insistent on Marugame Monzo.  My review is as follows: Beef Udon: 3.5 stars The broth is very very good! Clean, clear, and very good beef udon flavor. The udon noodles were a little undercooked in my opinion. I have grown up eating udon my entire life and though udon noodles have a higher amount of protein in them then traditional noodles (which gives udon their characteristic delicious 'chewy bite' to them) the noodles served today were undercooked. The flavor of the noodles themselves were good, but again - it was undercooked. The thinly sliced beef in the udon was good but a little tough. There were a few bites where I had to chew and chew the beef until I was able to swallow, but for the most part the beef was tender and the flavor was ok/good. yummy thinly sliced scallions added flavor to the dish and one is able to add togarashi (Japanese chili flakes) for a little kick. I was bummed that they didn't add my 'slurry' egg, but I'll let it go. Service: 5 stars The staff is very quick, efficient and friendly. I think they are understaffed but our waitress (I did not get her name) was very attentive and quite nice. I wish they did not have to leave the front door open as it was a little drafty but given the COVID pandemic and all, I understand why they did this and I digress. If you tend to get cold, bring a sweater as there is a chance you may be seated near the front door like we were. Would I come here again? Yes, probably. I would switch up my order and maybe try the specials on the board (The most popular dishes) and only after I get my ramen fix first!"
2/2/2022,20220202,5,4.35,"I'm typically not a fan of creamy noodles, but the mushroom cream udon was just fantastic. It lived up to every positive expectation -- the cream was in a very Japanese fashion with a delicate flavor that had just barely a hint of sweetness. Very rich, heavy cream base with generous portions of shimeji mushrooms. I got my udon with additional wakame and green onion, and it definitely enhanced the flavor of my bowl.I loved Marugame Monzo, a very unique udon experience! I would love to revisit next time I am in Little Tokyo."
2/3/2022,20220203,4,4.35,"If you want to eat uni and udon in the same bite, I have news for you! Marugame Monzo serves fusion style udon like miso carbonara, & this beauty pictured above... sea urchin cream udon! The sanuki style udon is handmade fresh daily so it has a nice bounce & chew!  Sea Urchin Cream Udon ($19.95)This hand crushed uni cream sauce udon is topped off with ikura (salmon egg). Since the sauce is cream based, it was super decadent & heavy, but it's rich with an uni seafood flavor & was sooo delicious! One thing that did surprise me though is that the uni on top was actually cooked so don't expect it to melt in your mouth like raw uni!  Beef Udon ($14.75)This is just your classic beef udon with seasoned sliced beef & scallions in a hot soup. You truly can't go wrong with this, the broth is clear & savory and the beef is slightly sweet like gyudon!  This spot is poppin & they only takes walk ins so expect to wait a bit! I got boba while I waited for a table & they didn't let me drink it inside so keep that in mind you boba fanatics!"
2/9/2022,20220209,5,4.35,My favorite udon place of all times! I eat here every time I visit LA! The UNI udon is spectacular but I didn't get it this time & the carbonara is awesome! My boyfriend got the new seafood one and he loves it!
2/9/2022,20220209,4,4.35,"Ordered takeout from here on a Saturday night. I was excited since my friends highly recommended this place and I love udon. Maybe they were too busy or something but all of our udon was undercooked, especially compared to famous udon restaurants in other cities that I've been to, such as Marugame Udon in SF/Hawaii and Tsurutontan in NYC. The sauce was delicious though. Highly recommend the uni cream"
2/10/2022,20220210,5,4.35,"We loved it here, it was the best food in waikiki hands down. 4.97 cents a bowl. Pick whatever else you want to add for extra. But the noodles themselves. Great!!"
2/11/2022,20220211,3,4.35,"These noodles are not for every palate. Overly rich and fatty, the uni udon in cream broth has a salty egg on cheese taste that I could not finish. As a fan of uni in its natural state, I think this is one dish for someone who enjoys the cholesterol-rich fat on fat like egg on Kobe beef. Anyways, this was neither that enjoyable nor palatable nor memorable as best meals, but it was a good novelty experience."
2/13/2022,20220213,4,4.35,"Came by on a Friday and the wait wasn't bad at all! They offer indoor/outdoor dining - they've converted the street parking to a whole area for outdoor dining so parking was tricky to find. You can either look for street parking or park in parking garages for around $6-$10. They serve hot/ice udon, rice bowls, appetizers and I ended up ordering the Miso Carbonara Udon and Monzo's fried chicken and my bf ordered the Beef and Jidori Egg udon. I liked the beef and Jidori udon more and would love to order it for next time! The carbonara was also delicious however really thick and heavy. The fried chicken was also delicious and filling too! Overall, this place is worth trying out!"
2/13/2022,20220213,5,4.35,"My favorite restaurant in Little Tokyo BY FAR. Usually there's already people lined up at the door before they open, because the food here is THAT good. My favorite dish is the Uni Cream Udon. I've had the same dish at many different places, but I always use this place as the gold standard for comparison. Service is always quick, and the place has the feel that it's run like a well oiled machine. If you sit close to the back of the restaurant, there's a little window where you'll be able to see the cooks in the back making fresh noodles and other things. I always recommend this place to any friends that ask me what to eat in LA/Little Tokyo."
2/19/2022,20220219,3,4.35,"There was about a 1.5 hour wait on a Saturday night at 7pm (not bad but as I get older I'm losing patience more and more haha). Went next door to the bar for karaage and sake while we waited. (Pretty nice and spacious bar btw, but service was slow. The karaage there was really big piping hot and juicy pieces which I definitely enjoyed.)Ok back to Marugame, the famous Uni bowl wasn't as substantial as my friends other bowls (hot dragon and mapo tofu). I feel like I got robbed on the salmon roe/ikura. I tasted more cream than uni. It was delicious still but I guess I expected more. The noodles were pretty chewy and well made though. We also got the assorted tempura and I was impressed at how well it was battered. I was also pleasantly surprised to see even the shiso leaf battered too. Would I come back again? Maybe if I happen to end up here on a random weekday afternoon but I don't think I'll make my way out here just for this. It was good to try once so I'm gonna tick this off my list of Little Tokyo eats. :)"
2/19/2022,20220219,4,4.35,Really tasty udon noodles! I got the veggie udon and was pleasantly surprised by the flavorful broth. Huge bowl too. Thanks to our waiter for the tip. ;)
2/22/2022,20220222,5,4.35,Can never go wrong with Marugame Monzo's sea urchin uni cream udon. There's often a wait but their service is really fast so the wait isn't that bad especially if you have good company to wait with. It can range to 30 minutes to 2 hours sometimes but there was no wait on a random Friday night I went which is strange actually haha we were in and out in 30 minutes because the food was served so quick and we inhaled our udon. There is outdoor seating that they put tents out on the street and they check for proof of vaccination with ID before seating. Metered street parking or paid parking in the structures nearby.
2/26/2022,20220226,5,4.35,The service is great everyone is very friendly but the food....the food is amazing this food completely melts in your mouth the noodles are cooked to perfection highly recommended this place if you're look for some noodles late at night definitely one of the places you should check out next time you're in LA 10/10
2/27/2022,20220227,4,4.35,"Came here for lunch at around 1pm on a Saturday for a party of 5. There was a crowd of people waiting outside but we waited only about 30 minutes before being seated! Note: They do ask for ID and proof of vaccination!We ordered the mapo tofu udon, gratin udon (plus seafood), miso carbonara udon, and an assorted tempura. The assorted tempura was very small considering how much we were paying... but they do use slightly pricier items I guess (e.g. chicken, mushroom, eggplant). I think I would've preferred regular cheaper tempura ingredients but a larger portion though (like sweet potato).The bowls of udon were delicious! The noodles were cooked well and the gratin udon had a nice cheesy pull to it. The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the dishes do start to feel a bit heavy after a while. I found myself craving some tabasco sauce to add in the bowl... It would've really hit the spot haha. That being said, it is one of the better udon restaurants in southern California and I'll definitely be back!"
2/27/2022,20220227,4,4.35,"A nice udon place with special versions/takes at udon. Instead of your simple udon, they have dishes like the carbonara and mapo tofu udon which is nice. The flavors weren't explosive, but since it's udon it can't really be expected compared to something like ramen. Parking might be a little harder to find, but it's LA so what do you expect :)"
2/28/2022,20220228,5,4.35,"Came here on a cold Sunday night and udon just hits different than ramen. Can't reason exactly why, but maybe it's because it's not as ""heavy"" feeling after eating. The beef udon was light and comforting and the noodles were soft and chewy. Would definitely order this again in the future! My wife ordered the Uni cream udon and what a cool combo to pair uni and udon together. A very rich flavor that had a smooth creamy taste, and would definitely order that again too. Overall, it was a great experience, quick friendly service, and tasty food! Cute little place that we would definitely eat at again."
3/1/2022,20220301,3,4.35,Worth it? Yes-ishRepeat? NoWent early as the store opened and glad we did. The place filled up very quickly.Not a fan of the udon because it's too thick and has no bounce/elasticity of the udon.- Onigiri mentai mayo $3: rice was too hot and the flavor wasn't good.- Uni Cream Udon $20: : super tiny Ikura and chopped up pieces of Uni that didn't really flavor cream.+ Ikura Oroshi Udon $14.75: good portion of Ikura and good flavor. Udon noodles were still underwhelming +Beef Udon $14.75: this one was definitely the solid choice. Udon broth on point with a generous portion of beef.
3/3/2022,20220303,4,4.35,"The udon is so tasty here....but, I'm not sure if it's worth the 1 hour+ wait! The udon noodles are housemade and I loved their chewy texture. We got tempura as an appetizer, and the mushroom and shrimp tempura were our favs.The cold sansai udon was very filling, but nothing too special. My friend order the squid butter udon which was so unique and delightful. It can feel a little heavy if you order the butter/creamy udon."
3/5/2022,20220305,5,4.35,"My daughter and I ate here about a month ago and I'm still thinking about the Mushroom Ankake Udon. It's a hug from the inside! They were really busy but we didn't have to wait too long. The staff were very friendly and quick. Next time I'm in Little Tokyo, this place will be a stop for sure."
3/6/2022,20220306,3,4.35,"My wife and I have loved this place for years, but our experience today was not as great as usual.The udon noodles used to be made fresh right in the kitchen (you could watch them being made through the glass), but now they bring them in pre-made in separate, sealed bags.My wife is Japanese, and quite an udon connoisseur. She was pretty disappointed today. She said they just didn't taste as fresh as normal.The tempura also seemed to lack its previous perfection as well.Still a good meal for a good price, but lacking the usual magic."
3/11/2022,20220311,3,4.35,"3.5 stars to be exactMy sister recommended this place so decided to give it a try since I was in LA area. They do have really good reviews on Yelp. Came here 5pm on Saturday. There was a super long wait! Added my name to the waitlist. They have indoor and outdoor seatings. Waited for over an hour and finally got a table inside. They are a very small shop. Inside, you can see how the udon noodles are made which is very interesting. They offer udon, rice bowls and appetizers. Very unique udon flavors.Beef with fluffy eggs: soup was salty and beef was too beefyHot dragon: too creamy for my liking and too saltyDuck udon: too simple. Too salty and bland. Not sure if that makes any sense lol. Duck was overly dryService was nice and quick. Maybe we just got the wrong items. I will probably give it a try again and try other flavors."
3/14/2022,20220314,4,4.35,I tried the hot shrimp tempura udon and cold beef udon. Everything tasted great flavor wise. The only thing I would have wished for is for the noodles to have more chewiness. They didn't seem to have as much bounce back as I look for in udon noodles. This was true for both the hot and cold noodles.
3/15/2022,20220315,5,4.35,"10/10 - noodles were amazing, broth was amazing.0/10 - the annoying couple a few tables down, having the most obnoxious conversation. In intimate settings, please keep your voices down so that others can enjoy themselves."
3/15/2022,20220315,5,4.35,"Wow, wow, wow! This place was so good. We were all set to get ramen, but decided we wanted udon instead. And as soon as I saw items on the menu like the Miso Carbonara, I knew we had to try Marugame Monzo. Boy, did we make the right decision to eat here! The Miso Carbonara was fantastic. So delicious. Very rich with the Carbonara base, but it didn't feel extremely heavy. We also got the Ikura Udon, which was also fantastic. I love salmon roe so much, so having salmon roe on top of udon was just perfect. We made a promise to ourselves that next time we go to this restaurant, we have to try new dishes. Otherwise we'll be getting the Miso Carbonara every time."
3/16/2022,20220316,5,4.35,"Marugame Monzo has been a go-to of mine because the miso carbonara is undefeated. The last time I came here, we ordered the miso carbonara udon, hot dragon udon, pork belly bowl, and chicken karaage. I felt the need to order the pork belly bowl because the portions for the udon aren't the biggest. However, I can say the chicken karaage is loaded and definitely worth it. Miso carbonara is a unique carbonara because the sauce is very runny compared to a drier Italian carbonara. The soft bacon complements the thickness of the sauce very well. The hot dragon udon is a soupy broth. Even though it says it is spicy, it's definitely not that spicy. There's a little kick but definitely could use more heat. The dish came together so well because of all of the textures from the softness of the udon to the crunchiness of the toppings all paired with the soups. The chicken karaage comes to your table on a plate with chicken overflowing the sides of the plate. This is a must-get and a great way to share food with the table. I am definitely going to always order the karaage. The pork belly bowl is good but definitely can go without the rice if you have karaage and udon. Another time, I did have the seafood risotto and that bowl was really tasty to share with the rest of the table. The seafood risotto at a Japanese restaurant is unique because the rice they use is not Arborio. Instead, you get this jasmine style rice that simply just works and is a great fusion.Marugame... I am going to be back!!!"

It is the best in the City and while you are at it, take some home, you will want it later in the evening.They make their own noodles.They are nice. You can eat indoors or out.The prices are fair.Everything is great. But you must, just must try the duck, you really need to."

3/24/2022,20220324,5,4.35,"My favorite place to get udon!! Wait is usually always pretty long if you don't get there early but definitely worth. The mentai squid butter udon was my favorite. We also tried the miso carbonara the uni cream udon, all of which had great flavor but wasn't too overpowering. The perfect amount of creaminess and richness. Previously, I had tried their duck udon and curry udon. Both were decent but not extraordinary compared to other udon places. I would say stick with their speciality udons!"
3/25/2022,20220325,4,4.35,"Tried their beef udon and uni udon and much preferred the beef udon with soup. The soup is very good and I love the texture of the udon. The uni udon was very creamy but I can't really taste the uni, just felt like a very heavy creamy udon. Overall I would come back for the soup udon. This place usually has a line so make sure you come early to put your name down!"

Almost felt that I'm having cream pasta.... But my husband enjoyed his carbonara udon. We all agreed that tempura was the best.Tips: we came at 12:20pm ish on Saturday, wait was 40 minutes. So it wasn't bad.They don't have iPad system, they won't text you or call you.You have to write down the name and just wait!We walked around the little Tokyo mall but there was no public restrooms.I'd love to come back again!Next I'll order something else!"

I wanted to try the seafood udon, the pork belly bowl, EVERYTHING!!Udon is my favorite (suck it ramen) and i was so happy to see a place with all my faves on the menu. My carbonara was rich and creamy with a subtle miso flavor. The bacon was a bit floppy for my liking but still great. My friend's was a great blend of beef flavors and soft egg.

You have to sign in when you get there outside and someone greets you when there is a table available. Make sure to have your vaccination proof and ID ready cause they will check! The place is not too big inside but its cozy and the food was good. We got a cold udon, uni cream udon, and shrimp tempura udon and their fried chicken as an app. The uni cream udon was amazing. The other three were okay, but if I'm ever back in the area, I'd go back for their uni cream udon."

4/1/2022,20220401,5,4.35,"12/17/2019Marugame Monzo is in the heart of Little Tokyo and it is one of the best udon places that I have been to. I recommend parking in the Aiso parking garage whenever you visit Little Tokyo as it is $1 per hour for the first 2 hours! Just be careful as there are a lot of homeless people above the parking structure now (March 2022 update). The wait can be up to an hour if you come during peak dinner time.I had the Miso Carbonara Udon (one of the signature dishes) and wow it was delicious. It was my first time having a rich and creamy udon but it was amazing. With each bite, a perfect amount of cream latches onto the noodles a nice, but not overwhelming creaminess. The pieces of pork are nice so that you aren't overwhelmed by all of the cream. The Miso Carbonara is definitely my go-to.Whenever someone visits from outside of LA, I always suggest marugame monzo and bring them there. It has always impressed!

4/3/2022,20220403,2,4.35,Maybe it's because we ordered it to go and didn't ask for the soup to be separated but the 15 minute drive home turned the udon beef bowl to mush. Very disappointed. Flavor wasn't very good either.

4/3/2022,20220403,5,4.35,"My husband craved for a good udon. We went to Marugame udon and we made the right decision. We ordered uni cream udon (he's been craving for this for weeks), mentai squid butter udon, assorted tempura, shrimp tempura and chicken kariage. The wait time is reasonable with option for indoor or outdoor dine inn. For a bused weekend I would say we only waited 20 mins which is not bad at all. They have a good system of checking in people and assigning tables. Once seated they went took our order right away. Such an amazing fast service. Our order came out in about 10-15 mins which is reasonable. They all came out fresh and hot. The uni cream udon is stellar and very good. The tempura and chicken kariage came out fresh, hot, crispy, flavorful and delicious. The mentai squid butter udon is divine, I finish the whole bowl. Overall their food were delicious, flavorful, fresh and worth every penny. They price is reasonable for the quality they serve. Worth every penny. Did I forget to say the serving size is big and for the customer to enjoy and share. Highly recommending this place and will definitely come back with our kids."
4/5/2022,20220405,5,4.35,"Time and time again this place makes me so so so happy! I always go at around 11:15 Sunday morning and sign in to be seated around 12 (sometimes they seat people earlier). If you've been here before, you know the line gets pretty long. The uni pasta is always on point. The only thing that made me sad is that they did not have the negitoro don, which was my all time favorite rice bowl I will always come again!"
4/5/2022,20220405,5,4.35,One of the best miso carbonaras I've ever tasted. Will definitely come back to this place!
4/6/2022,20220406,3,4.35,"Marugame Monzo gives you that classic LA experience: tasty food with high prices, paid parking, and long waits.There isn't much street parking and since there usually is a long wait, I suggest parking at the Little Tokyo Mall and walking over. If you plan on dining in, make sure to have your COVID card physically or digitally.For dine-in, sign in at the front and make sure to stay close by to listen for your name. We stayed nearby and we didn't hear our name being called and were told that we should have done better. Not only did this happen to us, but we've seen two other groups get told the same thing. The host was difficult to hear amongst the hustle and he'll only say the group name twice before crossing them off.For take-out, it was difficult to pick up my order. Those dining in took priority and it took 10 minutes of me trying to speak to the host or even enter the establishment to talk to anyone who could give me my order. Since there was a ridiculous upcharge for the to-go options, I suggest only dining in. While the bowl of uni udon was $20 in person, it was $30 for take-out.=YUM=All portions were on the smaller side and I usually need 1.5 bowls to get full.*Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon: incredibly seafoody in the all the best ways. Prominent uni flavor and the cream coated the noodles well. Very rich but not too heavy.*Beef and Fluffy Jidori Egg Udon: lighter, sweet broth. Not as flavorful as the uni udon, so it's a good alternative if you don't want something too heavy. Beef was soft and the eggs were gently scrambled.=MEH=*Jumbo Shrimp Tempura: not crunchy and the batter was oily. Tasted old.Stick to their signature items for best quality and the toppings aren't worth the price. Service consistently has been poor and although I would prefer doing take-out, the price increase and disorganized pick-up makes it not a viable alternative. A place not for the ambiance or experience but rather just for the delicious uni only."
4/6/2022,20220406,5,4.35,"You know I couldn't have a trip to LA and not make a little pit stop here. I was completely blown away my first time coming here a few months ago, and I was even further impressed during my second visit.Before getting into the food, I want to mention that their service is quick and efficient. Last time I was here, it was extremely packed and I had to wait half an hour to get seated. Luckily for us, it was the middle of the afternoon on a Thursday this time around, so there ended up being no wait. Food came out quickly, taking only about 10 minutes. The servers and host were all nice, and it was obvious that they were very focused on their job. Also, I loved how the interior was designed. It looked like a contemporary take on a traditional Japanese noodle shop.Highly recommend getting their most popular dish, the Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon. It probably tops my list of the most flavorful dishes I've ever had. The uni itself was truly remarkable. The buttery and creamy uni complimented so well with the perfectly al dente udon. This dish was on a whole 'nother level in terms of richness and flavor. To make things better, they don't skimp out on how much uni they give you, so paying for that $20 price tag made me feel better. Marugame Monzo beats any udon spot I've been to yet. Just try to come during the weekdays, cause this place gets extremely packed during peak hours. Definitely will come back here whenever I'm back in LA."
4/6/2022,20220406,5,4.35,"Decided to eat here for lunch on Sunday with my friends. There was already a wait at 12:10pm so get there early. Since we wanted to dine-in, we got our COVID vaccine cards check so, make sure you have a physical or digital copy ready!My boyfriend and I got the Mentai Cream Seafood Udon and the Hot Dragon Udon. We both really liked our dishes. The Mentai Seafood Udon was so creamy and had tons of seafood (shrimp and scallop). I enjoyed every bite of it, but beware it is a heavy dish for the morning. The Hot Dragon Udon was interesting. It def made me think of eating a Chinese noodle dish. It was a different taste than what I usually get from eating udon. Worth trying if you want to try something different!Overall, we both enjoyed our experience here. This will always favorite spot to eat in Little Tokyo."
4/6/2022,20220406,5,4.35,"As an avid fan of udon, I decided to visit this place to try some of their specialty fusion udon dishes.I got the Miso Carbonara Udon, which was very unique. It had a slight sweet flavor and a nice hint of miso with a heavily present carbonara cheesy sauce. The udon noodle quality here was great; the noodles all had good texture. I would recommend this if you want to try something new and different.The others in my party got the Hot Dragon Udon and let me try a bite. This has a very yummy flavor, but was not spicy at all. It was very similar to ramen flavor-wise (whereas I usually find udon to have a lighter broth). I would recommend this to anyone; it is very delicious.I also got the chicken tempura and shrimp tempura. Both of these were only ok. The chicken tempura did not have that much flavor... The shrimp tempura was a little better, but still not one of my favorite tempura. I'd come again for the udon but not get any tempura."
4/6/2022,20220406,5,4.35,"WORTH THAT WAIT!!!! Came here while on a short trip to LA and was so glad we came and waited after a long day at Universal Studios! How long did we wait you ask? Roughly 30/45 minutes for a table for 4! For bay Area folks, this was not unusual! We got seated inside and the service was friendly and fast. We honestly scarfed down the food! The plates and bowls were licked clean and I didn't even get a photo of the agedashi tofu because I was so excited to taste it! As soon as I tasted it, I ended up inhaling it! We have already decided that on our next visit to LA we will be coming back for another delicious meal here!"
4/7/2022,20220407,4,4.35,"Originally I was planning on going to another restaurant, but decided to stop by really quick just to see what the line was like. We were lucky and only waited about 20 minutes, which is not bad at all for the area.I recommend trying the uni udon. Or at least have one person in your party order it so you can sample it. It was so good! Definitely something you have to try at least once. The Monzo's Fried Chicken was a popular item at our table and others too. I would skip the pork belly rice bowl next time.Tip: Do not walk away if you put your name down. If you are not there when your name is called, your name is crossed off and you have to add yourself back. I witnessed this with at least two parties."
4/12/2022,20220412,5,4.35,Absolutely delicious! We had the curry udon and udon carbonara. Great recommendations from friends. Would definitely come back again!
4/13/2022,20220413,5,4.35,"My god this place is delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Yes that many exclamation points are necessary). I literally came twice in two weeks because the opportunity arose and I couldn't stop thinking about this place. There's always a wait, even in the middle of the afternoon. Pro tip: stay within earshot, especially when there's only a few parties ahead of you. Both times, my group got brought in earlier than expected because some groups ahead of us had left to go walk around. Service is quick and to the point. You are there for one reason and one reason only: to shove udon down your throat. The specialty udon dishes do take a while to come out, so it's definitely slower than the Marugame in sawtelle, but the food you get is well worth the wait.I have gotten the squid tempura, uni cream udon, and tomato cream seafood udon. I've also tried a bit of the mentai seafood udon and the beef and fluffy egg udon. Everything has been perfectly seasoned and satisfying. The mentai seafood cream udon is definitely the one with the strongest fishy taste, because of the fish egg, so keep that in mind! The uni cream udon had many chunks of uni throughout and the sauce was perfect, not too greasy or cloyingly creamy. I literally ate all the noodles, took the sauce home, and made a quick ""risotto"" with it the next day. The tomato cream seafood udon was wonderful too. The sauce was a bit like a creamy, rich, seafood stew. I was drinking it by the ladle, no shame! Plenty of scallops and shrimps, though they are on the small side. I enjoyed the squid tempura as well. It was a nice, large, flavorful piece that wasn't too greasy! Great with the tempura dipping sauce or dunked into the creamy udon sauce. The noodles are incredible as well. I think they are handmade since unlike the frozen udon I buy at hmart, there are some irregularities that help them better catch hold of the sauce. The noodles are cooked perfectly Al dente and have a lot of bounce and chew. They are so satisfying!The amount of food is perfect for me, I can scarf down a whole bowl (including sauce) and not feel stuffed, so the portion size may be a bit small for someone larger or taller than me. Solution: order two udon dishes! XD seriously though, I will be dreaming about that uni cream udon. It's got a place in my mental list of unforgettable must-eats!!! Would absolutely drop by anytime I'm in the area, OR any time I'm not in the area but still craving some amazing udon."
4/13/2022,20220413,5,4.35,Uni udon is incredible!! I highly recommend dedicating some time to getting seated as this place is suuuper popular
4/22/2022,20220422,3,4.35,"I do lots of research for my trips, and this place was highly rated/reviewed on Yelp, but sadly, didn't live up to the expectations too much. If you come early, put your name down on the list outside. It's not a physical wait in line until your turn thing.For an udon place, the udon was sorely lacking. While it did taste homemade, it wasn't made very well. The batch we had at the restaurant's opening, wasn't chewy or bouncy, and instead, too flour-y/starchy to enjoy. Bowls are huge, portions are not. Miso Carbonara: I was really excited for this one, but there were a lot of things that could've changed how this ultimately tasted. Bacon could have been fried up/crispy to give it more texture. I didn't taste any leftover bacon grease that could've added more flavor to the overall bowl of noodles. The cream sauce aftertaste is like Ragu's alfredo sauce....like what? :o Also, what miso? None of that in here.Spicy Mentaiko: this bowl saved the place a little more. I loved the cream sauce here a lot, but this bowl had even less noodles than the miso one, so for two people, we left here pretty hungry despite having such a carby meal. Plenty of shrimp too. But again, it doesn't matter how good the cream sauce is if the star, ahem noodles, didn't slurp and bounce as it was intended to. What noodle texture? :/Assorted Tempura: when the appetitizers steal the show...haha damn. If I were to come back (not likely, sorry), it's definitely only to get these super crispy, not too oily, tempura goodness. The veggies were so soft and retained all of that juice throughout the deep frying process, to get into our mouths. Bouncy shrimp. Even the chicken was so juicy! Wahh haven't had tempura this good since Tokyo! A must order."
4/22/2022,20220422,5,4.35,"I've been going here for years since I first discovered this place in college! They never disappoint. I usually order the mentai squid butter udon, which is still my fav thing to get here, but this time I decided to try the new seafood tomato cream udon. It was delicious! I'm personally a tomato lover so I loved the rich and tangy flavor it had. The shrimp and scallops were a nice addition to it but were just okay. They didn't taste very fresh, but still weren't bad at all. The udon noodles were really good as usual. Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for good, handmade udon paired with unique flavors!"
4/22/2022,20220422,5,4.35,"Review is for the uni udon, HITS THE SPOT! This cute little udon shop is located in little Tokyo and yes it is a must try! Came here on a Friday during off hours and there was no wait, which was perfect. Just got one uni udon to share because it's prettty heavy, it is super creamy and the uni taste was just right (not too much and not too little) . The noodles were perfect too. Udon noodles should be alittle chewy and soft. 10/10 would recommend!!"
4/23/2022,20220423,4,4.35,I do like this restaurant. It's one of my favorites in Little Tokyo but most likely you have to wait in a queue to get into this restaurant. Now you might get lucky not to have to wait on slow days. But most of the time I come to Little Tokyo this place a line even before it opens.Overall the food here is great. Their hand made udons make this restaurant a unique place. My personal favorite is Umi Udon. The portion may not be big so I suggest getting a side or appetizer.
4/23/2022,20220423,1,4.35,"Terrible. We thought it was the same greatness as the one in Honolulu but huge disappointment. Prices sky rocketed and they pushed the uni cream udon as their #1! We bought it and left it uneatened. It was just cream and udon like a white pasta. My bf got the hot dragon and it was a bit better but our neighbours got curry ... save your money unless you know exactly what you want. We won't return. Oh and hot tea was served in a can! And to top it off, my stomach feels queasy after 30 mins. You played me marugame."
4/27/2022,20220427,5,4.35,**Hot tip** Park at Aiso parking for $1 for 2 hoursI definitely enjoyed the miso carbonara so creamy with bacon. 10/10Chicken karage is not too bad either.
4/27/2022,20220427,1,4.35,"I placed an order online via Google/Postmates and got 2 email confirmations and a text. When I arrived at the store, and gave them my name, they acted as if I were trying to steal an order. I was able to show them the order summary/receipt with my name that matches what they have exactly (food was already prepared with the receipt on the bag), but the order number was just not shown in my confirmations. I even showed them my ID but apparently all those are not sufficient.I asked the waiter if he could help me find the order number from the app, and he said ""no YOU have to tell me, I don't know."" They ultimately kicked me out and didn't let me pick up my order.I then called Postmates to get a refund, but Postmates said the order was not marked as completed and could not give me a refund. So I called Marugame, but then the lady told me my order was ready and asked me to go to the store for pick up. While this lady was much nicer than that waiter, it's still a ridiculous thing to say, as I just got kicked out 30 minutes ago for not having a confirmation number, so I declined.I guess bottom line is that you should never order online via an app with this location.This is an extreme headache. It's been over a month, and I'm still waiting for my refund. Not sure what Marugame is doing with Postmates, but I was constantly sent to a specialized team for this issue with no response."
4/28/2022,20220428,4,4.35,First time there and the food didn't disappoint. If you're ever around Little Tokyo and you haven't seen one some food I believe Marugame is a good stop. It's pretty hard to see due to the fact that it's a tiny hole in the wall. So be sure to keep an eye out. Food:I ordered the miso carbonara Udon I feel like the overall flavors were great perfect as is. The noodles are cooked perfectly the texture of the bacon also complimented the noods not to under cooked and not over cooked just right. The sauce was great very creamy flavorful I really enjoyed it. The hot dragon was also flavorful but I didn't find it as spicy so we did have to add a bit of spice. I personally thought the chili paste was a great add to the noodles. The monzo fried chicken was a great Japanese fried chicken dish. Not as crispy as a Korean fried chicken but overall the seasonings and the crunch was there. We did add a bit of lemon to the chicken and that enhanced the flavor which is always a plus. We did add some of that chili paste to the soy sauce which I personally thought was fire so give that a try if you want.I wasn't really a big fan of the assorted tempura. As you can see in my picture for me the shrimp was the best from that plate. The shiso was also good. The mushroom eggplant and chicken was a bit bland for me but then again that's just what I thought. I feel like the chicken could've used some seasoning and that would've enhanced the flavor and made it super flavorful because it was crunchy so the crunch was there but not the flavor. The mushroom only had tempura on one side and wasn't seasoned either I feel like a bit of salt could've helped and coding the whole mushroom would've been better as well. And then finally the eggplant I just felt it was a bit mushy and like the other two a bit of salt would've made it 10 times better. Overall though they are known for their udon noodles and those two dishes we had MISO CARBONARA and HOT DRAGON were amazing should definitely give it a try and if you want some appetizers I would definitely recommend the monzo chicken and shrimp tempura.
4/29/2022,20220429,5,4.35,I was on a website that talked about the best pasta in each state. For California it mentioned this restaurant and highly recommended the miso carbonara udon. I brought the dish home and my husband and I were blown away by the incredible taste!!!! I can't wait to try the gratin udon next!!!! Absolutely recommend!!!
5/6/2022,20220506,5,4.35,"Fresh udon, cooked deliciously!The udon is on the flatter and thicker side. A bit difficult to slurp. Nice and bouncy though. The carbonara sauce is on the lighter side, don't weigh you down! The clear soups are so refreshing!Fast and friendly service.Place is always busy. We came in 10 minutes after they open, it was already full inside. If we had come in 10 minutes later, would've had to wait in line outside!The only downside is they are pretty pricey. Expect to spend about $45 for 2 meals and 1 appetizer."
5/6/2022,20220506,4,4.35,"Love the texture of Udon noodles! We got the agedashi tofu, agedashi eggplant, and assorted tempura as the appetizers. All three items were delicious. Good size portion to share. Tempura breading was light and crispy. Assortment of items deep fried included shrimp, mushroom, and sweet potato. Agedashi sauce was flavorful. Tofu was lightly fried. Eggplant were cooked nicely. We ordered the Uni Udon and Mentai Squid Butter Udon as the main entrees. Udon noodles for both dishes were good. They had a nice bounce and firm texture. Uni udon was creamy but it might have over powered the uni. Wish they added more Uni to bring out the flavor more. Mentai squid butter was not overly salty but way more bold compared to the uni udon. Both entrees were unique in their own way. I would come back to order the uni udon again!"
5/6/2022,20220506,3,4.35,"i was really excited to try this place after seeing positive reviews. I arrived a little before 12 to order takeout. The door was open so I went inside to ask if takeout requires people to sign in at the front too, but instead we were yelled at by the lady at the front that they weren't open yet. I got the food after about 10 minutes. The second time I felt like the service was a bit rude was when I set my food down on a table outside (no one else was seated outdoors) to wait for my Uber, I was yelled at by the same lady to move yet again, even though the food is from that restaurant lol. For the food, I ordered the squid udon which was buttery and the squid was tender. It did feel a bit heavy to me though. I really liked all the flavors. Overall, the food gets 4 stars but subtracting a star for the rude service while trying to order."
5/7/2022,20220507,5,4.35,"Okay this place is worth the wait. The udon is fresh and the flavors are just like Japan. Karaage was too good, we ordered another round. There sometimes is a wait so be prepared. They do offer outdoor seating to get the list going, so if you're okay with some fresh air and sun, go for it. The serving size is pretty filling. And the service was nice. I mean they are busy most of the time so give them a break. Glad I got to try it out. Love delicious udons!! They have different flavors which was awesome!"
5/8/2022,20220508,4,4.35,"I'm a fan of Marugame udon and decided to stop by for lunch while we were in LA for a day. Parking is street and limited, so as others have suggested, you can park in the shopping mall across the street and walk over instead.I had no issues with the udon we had. All of them met our expectations. Their noodles have the right texture and we love the variety of options.Since seating is fairly small inside, you are likely to wait a bit even if you go near opening time."
5/9/2022,20220509,3,4.35,"This restaurant is usually packed during peak hours. This time I decided to have a late lunch on Sunday around 1:30pm and there were few tables available. - The creamy Uni udon was very good. The creamy base was not too heavy like Alfredo sauce you get on pasta. The sauce was not too oily or thick. - The duck udon did not meet my expectations. The duck meat tasted like chewy rubber. It felt like it was previously frozen and served into the broth immediately to defrost. - Service was great. Though in the end, it was hard to catch the server to grab the check because that same person had to clean tables as well. Probably should have another worker on the floor to help. To conclude my review, I believe with the price you are paying for the food and the amount of reviews that this restaurant has, there are higher standards and expectations that should be met on a consistent basis. Serving rubber meat that tasted previously frozen/expired and being short staff should not be one of them. The reason why I am not giving a lower rating is because the creamy uni udon was a 9.5/10 for me. I could not overlook the main dish and previous good experience I had a few years ago, before the pandemic."
5/10/2022,20220510,3,4.35,"Okay here's the deal. I usually love coming to Monzo but this last visit was by far the most disappointing visit I've ever had. My sister and I came for lunch/early dinner. When we got there there was no wait time, which was great. We got a server that seemed to be having a tough day, they came off as a little rude but my sister and I shrugged it off. It wasn't what they said but more or less how they communicated. ANYWAY, my sister had the uni udon, she said it was fantastic (it's also my personal fave) and I had the miso carbonara udon (I've had this before and it's delicious) but unfortunately this time around my noodles were dripping in grease. I couldn't taste much of the sauce because of how much grease it had. I tried my best to eat it but I ended up having a stomach ache right after. I'm not exactly sure what happened but I'm hoping it was just one of those days."
5/13/2022,20220513,4,4.35,"Nice place: you write your name in the sheet outside and wait to be called. When we showed up there were maybe 3 people ahead of us so the wait wasn't long. We got seated and all the tables are super close to each other, you feel like you're all one big group. I didn't mind that. We ordered some sake and noodles and the sake as always, great. The noodles were delicious! i got the seafood gratin, super cheesy! i added chicken and I wasn't happy with the chicken or the shrimp. I did like the scallops. Overall, I did enjoy this place, we missed the long wait, the noodles are something I'll be craving for a wild. Next time I'll probably just order the noodle gratin (if that's a thing) with nothing else added."
5/13/2022,20220513,5,4.35,An experience guaranteed to delight both young and old. Price is so reasonable with its food quality. I highly recommend this place..
5/15/2022,20220515,4,4.35,"My friends and I came here on Saturday right before noon, so we were luckily seated without having to wait. We each ordered different things because the menu was pretty unconventional. Notably, my sister ordered the Ikura Udon, I ordered the Seafood risotto, and we split a Shiso Tempura because we love this leaf enough to pay $1.50 for one fried. First off, it was kind of dumb for two shiso lovers to order the tempura because all the shiso flavor got sapped away when it's fried. We were both disappointed at the lack of flavor but at the same time amusingly impressed at how intact the shiso was after going through the deep fryer.I'm not a fan of udon, but I have to point out that there is a ton of Ikura in the Ikura Udon. I happily helped my sister eat some. My seafood risotto also had a generous portion of seafood, although accompanied by a huge amount of rice. I really liked the risotto - it's warm and creamy, and it uses jasmine rice instead of arborio rice. It was on a heavy side, so my boyfriend (who ordered the conventional pork rice bowl) helped me eat some. Overall, this place is good and the portions are pretty generous."
5/15/2022,20220515,5,4.35,10/10 much better than the chain of marugame. This place has authentic and classic flavors. Love the seasonal options
5/16/2022,20220516,3,4.35,I got the kake udon and added the pork belly for 4 bucks. Also got the assorted tempura. As well as the carbonara udon. The food taste good. The carbonara udon is interestingly good and by that I mean I've never had udon that way. The assorted tempura was good. I was hoping for better vegetable selection. Long lines and parking is always an issue
5/16/2022,20220516,4,4.35,"My first time here and I heard this place was popular. We waited about 30min which wasn't bad considering the Saturday lunch rush. We ended up getting a table outside by the sidewalk which I think was better because it looked crowded and stuffy inside on a warm day. The udon was great and they had so many different ones that I wanted to try. We got a cold udon, the spicy dragon, and a creamy seafood udon. The udon tasted fresh, chewy, and quality of all ingredients was great. The spicy dragon had just enough spice. I like the heat but I still want to enjoy and taste my food without burning my tongue off. So if you're worried it's too spicy, it's not, go for it! Our server was friendly but they looked liked they could use a little more help. It was a long while before she came back to us and I ended up going to the cashier to get our check. No parking for the restaurant, you'll have to find a pay lot nearby or use the structure at the Little Tokyo plaza. Great udon, I'll be coming back."
5/17/2022,20220517,5,4.35,"We tried to dine here a few times on weekends but made it to the top of waiting list... Finally walked in on a Tuesday before peak hours.Usually I find places with certain experiences overhyped and disappointing. But Marugame Monzo is worth it!We both love the signature uni cream udon - super cream but not overwhelming. The pork belly rice has an attractive (maybe sesame oil) smell. Pork belly is a bit over cooked and on the dry side. But even mixing the cream broth with rice is satisfying.Since the establishment is small, food is served quick and patrons should not expect to eat and chat for a long time. Nevertheless people who work here are attentive and polite."
5/17/2022,20220517,1,4.35,"Is it just me or did the noodles change. I swear they used to be rounder and the texture used to be softer. Now they are rectangular and hard? The flavor is still the same, but I cannot get over the texture change. I come here for the udon, so I was super disappointed. I've tried them twice in the last month before writing this review. The ordering ahead is so unreasonable. They do not answer their phones or at least all the times that I've tried. You can order ahead using a third party app, but the prices are way higher even when you select pick up as the option. I wish they had their own website for takeout orders. Won't be back for a while.. I hope the OG noodles come back."
5/19/2022,20220519,5,4.35,"Marugame Monzo is located in the heart of Little Tokyo. Usually it's packed on weekends and can take hours to wait for a seat, but I went on a weekday for dinner and was seated within 5 minutes. There are options for either outdoor (sidewalk) dining or indoor dining, and we opted for indoor dining. Service was quick and waiters were very polite.I ordered the Udon Carbonara, and it was delicious. I was worried that the dish would be very heavy due to the cream and cheese, but this was a perfect balance and I didn't feel too bloated after finishing the entire bowl. It also appears that they make their own udon, as the texture seems different compared to store-bought udon I've had. My family also ordered a rice bowl, duck udon, and a seafood udon, and both dishes looked delicious. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the portions were decent as well. Definitely give them a try if you are in Little Tokyo--the wait is worth it, but try to go on a weekday if you can!"
5/20/2022,20220520,5,4.35,"Worth the wait! I waited about one hour to be seated. The place is small, probably only fits about 25 people inside. But they offer outdoor dining too by the street. Noodles are hot and fresh. Agedashi tofu wasn't quite the way I enjoy it, but it may just be preference! The service is fast, the staff is very attentive and nice.Overall, highly recommend and I cant wait to come back to try their new Seafood Tomato Cream Udon!"
5/21/2022,20220521,5,4.35,Arrived shortly after opening and was instantly seated at the bar after 10 mins. Service was quick and friendly. Super hot day so decided to order cold udon and appetizers.Ikura oroshi udon (5/5): I was surprised at the amount of ikura sitting on top of the udon. There were significantly more ikura in my bowl than even the picture on the menu! Dish was refreshingly chilled and tasted delicious with sweet soy broth mixture and grated radish.Cold tofu (5/5): One of the best cold tofu that I've eaten because of this gingery blend and bonito flakes that sit on top of the tofu. It definitely added a ton of flavor to the otherwise boring dish.Glad I got to try the cold udon in person as I only order the hot ones thru UberEats.
5/21/2022,20220521,4,4.35,"My bf and I ordered the carbonara udon and uni udon and shared the assorted tempura. Uni udon was amazing! It was super creamy and definitely could taste the uni flavor. The carbonara was very rich but I definitely preferred my uni udon. Tempura plate was very good. Perfectly fried, and just the right amount of crunch. Service was quick and very friendly. We waited about 35 minutes to be seated on a Friday night. Not bad considering we got there around 6:30. Finding street parking isn't easy here so we opted to pay to park in a lot. Overall, very good food and would definitely come back for another round of uni udon."
5/23/2022,20220523,5,4.35,Been craving this place since I first came here. I literally cannot find a better udon place anywhere. This time tried the creamy uni udon and it was amazing although I still think my favorite is the butter squid one I got last time. We also got the agedashi tofu and assorted tempura which was both to die for.
5/25/2022,20220525,5,4.35,"One of my favorite restaurants in all of Los Angeles. One of the few places where I've gone again and again, and there are multiple dishes that I love equally, so I still have a genuinely hard time choosing which dish to get."
5/26/2022,20220526,5,4.35,The uni cream udon is really delicious. The duck one is fairly normal. There is a lot of udon options for you to choose. The restaurant is not too big so the wait might be long during peak hours
5/28/2022,20220528,4,4.35,"Come for the experience, but leave with your stomach unstaisfied for most of the menu. I've been to monzo many times over the years now, ordering dishes from the Uni udon, to squid, to dry noodles dishes. Marugume for the most part is a great experience. The main reason to come here is they have a glass viewing of the chefs prepping all their dishes including a highlight on making and pulling the udon right in front of your eyes. This in itself is a great reason to visit. Unfortunately, I have come to terms that there is only 1 dish that is worth coming here for, the Uni Udon. The uni Udon is extremely flavorful and has a great balance without being too salty. This mixed with the soft firm udon creates an amazing dish! If you like uni, this is definitely a must try. Most visitors probably will sway away from the Uni due to it being more of an acquired taste. The other dishes here are sub-par and to pay for prices upwards to $20 a dish including tax and tip is just not worth it for the underwhelming dishes. 4 stars because the experience is still awesome and the Uni is great. Take away the Uni and this restaurant will probably be closer to 3 stars in my opinion."
5/30/2022,20220530,5,4.35,"Let me start by saying that the wait here was long! I came on a Sunday after 12 pm for lunch with a party of 7 and we waited 1.5 hours. That's goes to show not only how good this place is, but also I think it would be useful to go earlier and put your name on the wait list, especially if you have a big party! This place is near fugetsudo (the artisan mochi place) so I would highly suggest stopping by there if you're waiting in line. As for the dish itself, because it was SWELTERING HOT I needed something cooling and refreshing. This is THE udon to get if you're looking to cool yourself off! It came with all the toppings here (white radish, scallions, bonito flakes, friend tempura shavings, and an egg) the cold soup comes on the side in this cool looking cup that came out really cold (it wasn't room temperature so they kept it in the fridge). If you want protein the egg is the only protein it comes with but you can always add additional toppings for an extra amount."
5/30/2022,20220530,1,4.35,"Extremely bad experience!!!!! If there is negative 5 star rating I will do that. Our party have waited for an hour for the table while all parties behind us get theirs. We asked how long we still need to wait, the employee said if I complain we will not get the table and we can find other better restaurants. Can't believe it is their attitude for customers"
5/31/2022,20220531,5,4.35,"I came here a few weeks ago on a cozy, gloomy day (I'm from Seattle, yes I love the gloom) I've been craving the taste of home and familiarity. There are a few places I would order take out from regularly in Seattle during quarantine and they quickly became very sentimental comforting foods. One of those things I came to really love was mentai cream seafood udon. I love living close to Little Tokyo and seeing what's good to eat out here. I was so excited when I realized this udon might be what I've been craving for months! We walked over and my partner couldn't even get a picture of the udon when it was first served because once that bowl was placed on the table I was ready to go! Lol. I love the creamy and slightly salty taste to this dish and the texture that salmon roe brings to this dish is lovely! I felt the love in this food on this day. Thank you Marugame Monzo for taking care of us!"
6/2/2022,20220602,3,4.35,It was alright for us. Because we don't like to eat carb. Good soup. Kids enjoyed their rice but overall just lots of carb. If you are a carb eater then it's good. If not you'll be having a little hard time
6/3/2022,20220603,4,4.35,"First time having cold udon and overall, would definitely get again! Very refreshing and the blend of toppings/broth meshed well together. Very reasonable portions as well."
6/4/2022,20220604,4,4.35,"What's up: After spending some time at the Broad and wandering around the neighborhood, we decided to come here for dinner. Parking: Street parking or one of the nearby parking lots. Since we came from the Broad, we parked at their parking structure. Environment: Sign in on the list up located up front. They had an area sectioned off for outdoor dining. Inside, there were a handful of tables as well as counter seating. Restrooms are clearly marked and located towards the back of restaurant. What was ordered:- Takoyaki (hot and delicious. Definitely better than what I've had before)- Uni Cream Udon (little pieces of uni mixed into the creamy udon...yum)- Miso Carbonara Udon (creamy but a bit salty)- Hot Dragon Udon (super flavorful, not as spicy as expected but the broth was definitely really good)Yay/Nay/Meh: Yay. The food was delicious. Udon was nice and chewy and the takoyaki was good. The Hot Dragon was a lot better than expected so it was a pleasant surprise. Credit cards are accepted."

Place your name on a waiting list if there's a line, and they provide both indoor and outdoor seating -- I went on a pretty sunny day at around noon, so it was a bit unappealing waiting in the sun and eating outside in the heat (but thankfully got a table inside!).They had a lot of really interesting options to choose from, but being a huge uni lover, I had to try the Uni Sea Urchin Cream Udon, and also got to try the Carbonara Udon. While it wasn't bad and were good for satisfying creamy udon cravings, I was a little disappointed, taking into consideration flavor, quality, and price point.Both of the creamy udons (Uni Sea Urchin and Carbonara) tasted the same -- some cheesy, creamy, milky base. There were teeny bits of uni, and tasted more like udon noodles with cheese sauce. I was also expecting them to mix the uni raw into the cream like others do to retain the uni taste, but they literally COOKED the uni piece dry. I was traumatized, haha. I'm a huge udon lover and have tried quite a few udon places, but this place is unfortunately at the bottom of that list. It could be just the dishes I ordered, and would consider try other ones if I were in the area again.Keeping my review at 4 stars because the noodles were still soft and chewy, and I enjoyed my meal, but I may just stick to other places for now. It was nice to try out once though!"
6/5/2022,20220605,4,4.35,"Always a line. The word is unique. Gratin, carbonara, and so many more dish that you won't see anywhere else. The tempura is amazing. It really is fired to perfection and I'm not a big fan of tempura unless done correctly and they do it correctly. Where can you get noodles made fresh? Not many places. Service isn't the best. They take an order and drop the food. I was by myself and order for a table of 4. The disappointment that I had was nothing was coursed. The hot and cold udon and rice bowl came out when 5 mins after the apps."
6/6/2022,20220606,5,4.35,"Delicious, amazing, yummy, are just a few worlds to describe the food here. It's a MUST EAT in LA. Period!"
6/7/2022,20220607,5,4.35,"Ordered the uni udon and it was so yummy! Flavorful (but not too rich) and creamy (but not too heavy). The udon noodles were also soft and chewy, but not the most slurp-able. I ordered through delivery and the dish was packaged well, and it maintained its appearance quite well too. Highly recommend!"
6/8/2022,20220608,5,4.35,"Absolutely delicious! The food was extremely fresh and flavorful. While these items were definitely on the heavier side, I could not stop eating them. The cream paired beautifully with the uni. I also loved the way that the miso enhanced the cheese, I'll definitely be attempting this at home. You could feel that the noddles were homemade based on the chewy texture that they gave.Overall a little pricey, but in my opinion well worth the money. I also really enjoyed the small store ambiance of the restaurant. I am definitely coming back to try some their more traditional udon!"
6/8/2022,20220608,5,4.35,"this place has small quaint seating but don't let that fool you - the food & portions here are great! my friend and i got the creamy udon with chicken and chicken karaage and did not disappoint. udon noodles were chewy al dente texture and the roux sauce was well seasoned. chicken karaage was juicy and tender and also well seasoned, one of the only chicken karaage dishes that had so much flavor that you don't need a dipping sauce! the restaurant is one of the only places where they don't serve their karaage with dipping sauce but it doesn't need one :) great food and ambience :) sorry for no pictures of the chicken karaage - just get it, it's rly good & big portion! :)"
6/8/2022,20220608,5,4.35,A place you have to tryWould recommend the Uni Sea Urchin Udon or the RisottoThe tempura is also in above medium level!
6/9/2022,20220609,5,4.35,"OMG this place was sooooo good! I am very impressed. Came here on a Friday night and wait was maybe 25 minutes or so for our party of two. We were in town for a short vacation and this was our first stop and I am so happy it was.We got the Uni Sea Urchin Cream Carbonera and the Tomato Seafood Udon and let me tell you, it's not just the sauce that makes the dishes so delightful, it's the udon itself. The udon is super chewy and never like any I've ever had. Think pasta but with Udon that holds the creaminess of the sauces and that's what this place has the ability to do. Not just that, but even though Uni is expensive, the dish provided plenty chunk of it so I didn't feel cheated. Hopefully I'm able to come back the next time I'm in LA!"
6/10/2022,20220610,5,4.35,"Haven't been back since pre Covid and still hits the same! Really love this place food is good quality and the noodles aren't super chewy. I got the sea urchin udon, which was super creamy yet delicious! It came with ikura on top too! Also ordered some takoyaki and was also very tasty! Went on a Thursday and had no wait (for the first time in my life) staff here are really attendant and nice!"
6/11/2022,20220611,5,4.35,"Incredible. That's all I have to say. I'm not a huge udon aficionado (ramen, pasta and pho are my top noodle choices), but as someone visiting from Vancouver, I had to trust my LA local friend when she chose this spot. And I did not regret it. I can't handle creamy udon soups, so I chose the squid butter mentai udon. I was a little apprehensive at first (since squid isn't usually my first choice), but upon reading multiple raving reviews about it, I jumped the gun. And it was amazing. So yummy, so unique, so much umami, not overwhelming in taste or salt. It wasn't like one of those dishes where your taste buds got tired after a while, either. The squid was a nice compliment to the udon and the broth. I was impressed. We ordered the assorted tempura as well, which my friend highly recommended to pair with the udon (and she was right)! So here I am, passing the recommendation down - you gotta do it. You just gotta."
6/11/2022,20220611,5,4.35,"Uni cream udon is just what it says on the tin - super creamy sauce over udon, with pieces of uni and topped with some ikura and a shiso leaf. Actually it was easy to forget I was eating udon... because the cream sauce really makes me think of pasta. The cream sauce overwhelms the uni flavor, so don't expect to actually taste it. The ikura is good to break up the cream with a saltier, fresher flavor."
6/12/2022,20220612,4,4.35,"Little Tokyo in LA...what a great place to visit for great Japanese food and culture. So many tasty options...which one to go with??? Well, sushi and ramen are prevalent in virtually every city these days but a restaurant specializing in Udon? Not so much. Plus it comes highly recommended by family in LA. So, we sign up on the list outside the restaurant and wait. They can't (or won't) estimate a time so you look at how long the list is and hope for the best. On a Saturday evening at 6pm this could be problematic, however, we score a table in approximately 30 minutes..not too bad. If you are expecting the standard Nabeyaki Udon here, forget it. So many unique options- uni cream udon, miso carbonara, ma po tofu, hot dragon etc. All dishes definitely hit the spot and were tasty except for one - the tomato seafood udon special...not horrible but just OK. Personally really enjoyed the Ma Po Tofu udon. Nice flavor and it goes well with the fresh udon noodles. The chicken karrage app was also wuite good. Crispy nuggets that aren't excessively greasy. Here's to hoping an udon restaurant makes its way to the DMV one of these days..."
6/12/2022,20220612,4,4.35,Very good place for udon (soft thick handmade noodles). Sea urchin creamy udon is great and the most popular item here. Shrimp tempura was overpriced. Long wait time especially during weekends. No dedicated parking adjacent to those place. But you can park on the street or public parking and walk 5-10 mins to get here. Seating option both inside and outside. Restroom is okay.
6/13/2022,20220613,4,4.35,"Went for lunch, we had Uni cream udon, Tempura shrimp, Wakame Udon, on the side, we ordered tempura shrimp, tempura pumpkin and T. Soft boiled egg.Unit cream udon is good, a little too creamy for us, Wakame udon very good, side dishes are good too.This restaurant full all the time, good thing it is a simple menu, people finish their meal fast. so that you don't have to wait long."
