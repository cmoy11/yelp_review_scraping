8/15/2014,20140815,5,5.0,"LOVE IT!! We got seated at the bar and had the pleasure of being served by bartender Krishna...HE is the BEST!!! Loved the way he shakes them cocktail shakers...one of the best part of my meal was chatting with him!! Ok back to the food...it was amazeballs...started with the chips and dip (if you love pork rinds, you will LOVE this dish) then yellow tail and brussels sprouts...for our main dishes we had the lobster pasta (sooooo yummy) and my hubs had the short ribs (also amazing) and since it was my birthday, they treated me to a decadent fruit tart with homemade ice cream on top...OMG best birthday meal in a long time...service was great, hostesses were hospitable...can't wait to go back!!! Make sure you sit at the bar and have Krishna serve you!!! He's awesome!!!"
4/2/2015,20150402,4,4.5,"High energy, noisy place with good foods, the entire menu is designed to be served family style therefore it's the best to visit this place with friends. The foie gras with steel cut oats and strawberry was savory and sweet, grass fed beef tartare was lean and refreshing, the octopus salad was tasty however with sparing of octopus pieces, we also enjoyed the asparagus salad as well as the brussle sprouts, the weakest dish of the evening is perhaps the bass; interesting selections of wines by the bottle, the sommelier was more than helpful in making great suggestions. House filtered water with/without the gas. It would have been nicer if the reservation is more available. Overall we enjoyed our meal."
5/20/2016,20160520,5,4.67,"I think I am in love with Republique more because of the atmosphere and the venue and the amazing display case in the front and the presentation of all their food, than some of the food itself. But that really doesn't stop me from coming with friends and family for brunch, because I am in awe every time (and I get amazing food pics). I've come for brunch a few times and never know what to get. I've tried a few things from the case: a sesame cookie, an oatmeal cookie, a nutella banana pastries. The one I enjoyed the most was the oatmeal cookie because it was sooo buttery and delicious (you can taste the butter)! I've tried and split a couple different brunch items.- Green soft boiled eggs one time: a little strange because it was cold softboiled eggs served in a green soup mixture served with bread, but the presentation was on point! The baguette was also delicious and it was like my own personal baguette. I love bread.- Kimchi fried rice: a couple of my friends have tried it, and it looks much better than it tastes, sorry.- Mushroom toast: damn, this thing is so dense it could feed two without you even noticing. Super flavorful because of the mushrooms, buttery, and delicious eggs. If you don't like mushrooms that much, don't get it! - Madam croque: because of the mushroom toast (above), I didn't really get to eat this one. But this dish is also a little heavy because they use a lot of butter (a lot) when they toast the bread, so be warned. It's delicious because butter but be prepared what you're getting yourself into.- Salmon avacado toast: This one was pretty delicious, a little pricey, but I am a total sucker for avacado toast (especially with salmon)! Also, the hong kong tea latte is really good! This place is also pretty pricey, so be ready to lighten your wallet. After you see all the pastries, drinks, and basically everything on the menu, you might order everything."
11/26/2016,20161126,3,4.25,1. Eggs on toast with uni: 3.25-scrambled egg on crispy toast. I was expecting more in terms of how the uni would compliment the eggs but it didn't really 2. Seared foie gras with berries and a chestnut cappuccino with bacon foam: 3.25-the foie gras was good as well as the foam. The chestnut was too strong. The berries were not sweet enough to balance the rest of the dish. 3. Spaghetti with Dungeness crab and uni: 3.25-more of a salty sour taste. Not much crab or uni ok the dish itself4. Mafaldine pasta with truffle: 3.25-the sauce still tasted somewhat salty but slightly more peppery and drowns out truffle flavor. The pasta tastes better here and perfectly al dente5. Sonoma duck breast with pear and pistachio: 3.25-the duck was cooked we'll but slightly too salty. The service by waitstaff was overall very good and attentive. There was nothing particularly memorable that I need to eat again.
2/16/2017,20170216,5,4.4,"3/10/17Lucky for us we were able to score a 6:30 PM reservation. Four of us headed over there and much to my delight we were seated in the back room again. The back room is much quieter and more pleasant.My son did the ordering and we shared margaritas baguette with both butter in pan drippings, grilled octopus salad, Maine diver scallops, Maine lobster spaghetti, cavatelli, steak and fries and finished off with the Pana cotta for dessert.I can say honestly every single dish was delicious. In addition, we seem to have an endless supply of baguettes, I think in total they provided us six or eight.We finished off with black coffee.Once again everything was spectacular, service, hospitality and food.2/l8/17What a treat! My son took me there for a late dinner. We started with the Margarita's Baguette. They served it with BOTH the Normandy butter and the pan drippings....OMG! So delicious! I had to control my self so I wouldn't get filled up on bread. Next dish was the Grilled Octopus Salad. Delicious! Nice chunks of octopus, fresh veggies, pistachios and a tasty light chili lime dressing....then on the to Pappardelle with shaved black winter truffles....so rich and delicious. We ended with the Maine lobster spaghetti....another total winner.I opted to try the apple tart, which I was not impressed with...next time (hope there will be a next time), I'll try another dessert.All in all, Loved Republique!"
3/21/2017,20170321,5,4.5,"Love the modern and medieval accents in this restaurant. The front is bright with perfect lighting and the back is more romantic with high ceilings.My friend and I came here for brunch and this place was so perfect to hang out and eat some delicious food. I think we ordered too much but it was so darn worth it!We got 3 dishes and one dessert, and we ordered at the front and got a table. Water and utensils are self serve and you seat yourself. They charge 3% on top of your bill for employee healthcare so just be aware of that... I don't really like this because this is not a sit down restaurant... Well at least for brunch anyway. Mushroom toast - This is SOOO good! This is a must try if you like mushrooms. It's velvety and eggy and the flavors were perfect.Kimchi fried rice - I highly recommend this too! I am Korean and I have had kimchi fried rice my whole life and I got to say this place has the best kimchi fried rice. Idk what is in it, but it's delicious. The two poached eggg really makes this a great lunch item. salmon toast - this is light and refreshing with a good amount of smoked salmon. I enjoyed this one as well!Fruit and Pistachio tres leches -- BOMBBBBB!!!! I highly recommend this moist decadent dessert to everyone.I highly recommend this place for food! I just hate how they charge 3% of your bill for their employee health insurance when it's not a sit-down restaurant. Don't most restaurant employees qualify for Medicare...?"
3/24/2017,20170324,3,4.29,"$56 for a 5-ounce sliver of THE MOST TASTELESS SHORT RIB I HAVE EVER HAD.Sure, it was tender af, it came with good polenta and greens, but it was SO COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BLAND. (And so, SO tiny. Like just the tip tiny.)I was so smitten with the French Toast (brunch), the Eggs on Toast, the Shakshuka (brunch), and the Kimchi Fried Rice. BUT NOW MY HEART IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN."
4/24/2017,20170424,4,4.25,"This is a really nice brunch place offering a wide range of different things. We ordered the kimchi fried rice, shakshuka, and the short rib sandwich. The sandwich was extremely good, probably one of the best sandwiches I've had. So much richness in flavor. The shakshuka was also pretty good but very heavy on the tomato flavor, so if you're not a huge fan of that base it might not be worth it. The fried rice was alright - a bit too expensive for my taste. Highly recommend the short rib sandwich and blueberry lemon coconut cake."
5/9/2017,20170509,4,4.22,"What I've Tried- Regular Breakfast- Chia Seed Pudding- Chorizo y Papas*- Shakshouka- Mushroom Toast*- Strawberry Tres Leches Cake*Loveee coming here for breakfast. Their baguettes are sooo good (if you don't get a burnt one lol.) The Regular Breakfast isn't something you can get at a diner. It comes with a thick slab of bacon, the most delicious and crispy fingerling potatoes, eggs and a baguette. You can pass on the Chia Seed Pudding unless you're going the healthy route. It's not sweet and is made with homemade almond milk!The Chorizo y Papas were really flavorful but, oily. The cast iron it came in was super greasy.. it left oil all over our table. The potatoes in the Chorizo were not the same as the fingerling potatoes (boo) but, I would get this again! Shakshouka was okay... I would ask for yogurt sauce on the side because they put so much on top! It's not a drizzle... it's like a layer. :( It gave it a sour taste.. not a fan.The Mushroom Toast was really good but, heavy. It may look like a small portion but, it was drenched in sauce and probably oil lol. The toast is not crispy but, I don't mind the soggy bread.. it made it easier to cut and share. The best part of our meal was the Strawberry Tres Leches Cake! It's not your traditional tres leches cake... the bread wasn't overly soggy and the cream they used had a hint of vanilla bean. It also came with kumquat and pistachios on top! Would come here just for this cake.TIP: The line does start before they open at 8AM on weekends. The line also moves really slow...I'm guessing no one knows what they want before they get to the register. Valet is free for breakfast during weekdays!"
7/2/2017,20170702,4,4.2,"I've had this spot bookmarked for such a long time, I'm so glad I was finally able to try this place out! I came here with a few girlfriends for a birthday brunch on a Sunday morning and I can definitely vouch for beautiful this restaurant is. Definitely the perfect brunch spot in LA. We arrived around 9AM on a Sunday morning and there was still a line out the door but the wait wasn't that bad. You order at the counter, pay and seat yourselves. We ordered a bunch of different dishes to share which I would definitely recommend doing so you can try a little bit of everything!-Matcha Lattes-Biscuits & Gravy-Mushroom Toast-Smoked Salmon Tartine-Ricotta Toast-Kimchi Fried Rice-Belgian WaffleI was actually rather disappointed with the matcha latte... they make it with condensed milk so I was expecting it to be on the sweeter side however it tasted like warm milk. Didn't even have the slightest green tea matcha taste to it and it wasn't even that sweet at all which I was really surprised about. Definitely not worth the $5 so I'd recommend ordering a different drink.The food on the other hand looked AND tasted amazing. Everything came out one after another which definitely worked in our favor as we wanted to snap pictures before eating, of course. My favorites were the Mushroom Toast, Kimchi Fried Rice and Belgian Waffle! The mushrooms were AMAZING, I don't know what they did to it but you just gotta try it. The waffles were fluffy and subtly sweet and the kimchi fried rice was surprisingly really good too. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and decor at Republique. Loved how open and bright it is inside and the hanging lights made it look so elegant. I would definitely suggest this spot for a brunch date or even a birthday celebration. My suggestion would be to come early during the weekends or maybe at an off time?"
7/25/2017,20170725,4,4.18,"Found this place by accident, when a co-worker brought some baked goods from here that were so delicious that I demanded he tell me where they were from!I made a point to come by and check out this place sometime that same week!I was not disappointed..! I came for dinner and much to my dismay they had no more pastries for the day, but MAN OH MAN the dinner crowd was so busy! We made reservations for 7 pm and weren't seated for another 20 minutes: during which about 5 different groups came in and were told they were booked for the entire night! WOW, so make sure to make those reservations! I believe you can only get them at dinner so I suppose it's first come first serve for breakfast and lunch! Apparently this location used to be the La Brea bakery, which now sits a block away.The interior is stunning: large glass panels and a glass roof that filters on light against delicate chairs and exposed brick wall. While we waited one of the workers suggested we try their Margarita's baguette bread, with the french butter AND the pan drippings. That was possibly the best choice of the night! It was unlimited and I could not stop eating the small, crisp, hot little baguettes and dipping them in the pan drippings!Along side that we also ordered the Box Crab Toast, White Sea Bass, and Spinach Cavatelli.I really enjoyed the Spinach Cavatelli, green lumps of pasta in a finger licking great sauce! The Sea Bass was moist and well cooked. The Box Crab Toast, other than it's presentation, was nothing really spectacular to me. I think the items that I would come to eat again would be the Margarita's baguette and the Spinach Cavatelli. It was a little noisy as the night drew on, but seeing the eventual fade of day to sunset to night was phenomenal to observe; the large window panes and high ceiling opened to the light and adjusted well with the ambience!But I suppose with all the hubub, comes a price...the price. The bill was pretty expensive and the portions, while delicious, were not as large as I'd hope they be. In addition they charge an additional 4% to go into providing healthcare for their full time employees, while great, can take another hit to your wallet.They have alot of vegetarian friendly entrees and have a very hip crowd. Plan to come by to try their pastries during the day or have another dinner at this location for a special occasion!"
8/4/2017,20170804,4,4.17,"Always a popular brunch spot and both times that I've been here I've had to wait in line. It moves faster than you think though. Definitely recommend grabbing a menu while in line to make the most of your time. I feel like the line usually happens because people don't know what to order when the time comes. PARKING: Metered parking can be found on the street. Typical LA haha. Good luck!You stand in line to order and pay first. The line is right next to their pastries and I've caved in every time so far! Very unique dishes and pastries. After paying, you take your number (written on a cup) to self seat your party to an open seat or table. Servers will later bring you water, cups, and utensils. Cute and very LA inside-probably why it's still a very popular spot. Can definitely get some Instagram worthy shots here! BANANA POPPYSEED MUFFIN: This was really good, better than I expected and it's not too sweet! Would totally order this again! VIETNAMESE ICED COFFEE: Definitely not as strong nor as sweet as Lee's coffee. It still is slightly on the sweeter side, but I would still order this again. (I wouldn't say it's a true Vietnamese coffee, more like a iced vanilla latte actually haha). KIMCHI FRIED RICE: Comes with beef short ribs mixed in with the rice and comes with two soft farm eggs on top. (I totally did a boomerang shaking the bowl for Snapchat for fun as an immature way to juggle the eggs haha! ) For $16, it's overpriced for sure but worth trying. It was good but a little too sour for me. I didn't expect to, but I preferred the pork adobo fried rice more. PORK ADOBO FRIED RICE: Also overpriced for $16, but I enjoyed this more than the kimchi fried rice. Some adobo dishes can get oily, so I'm glad this wasn't. Comes with two fried eggs on top and a side of Fresno chili (basically sriracha). I didn't use the chili and enjoyed the dish as it came out. Would get this again. Although this place is a little pricey, it's very unique. Can't wait to try more dishes here! (:"
8/18/2017,20170818,5,4.23,"The line was ridiculous even though there was plenty of seating inside. I adored everything else about this restaurant. I loved the aesthetics, lighting, spaciousness, and ambiance. The food came out pretty quickly and I was impressed with the selection of pastries they had.Here's what we ordered:1) Kimchi Fried Rice - Pretty delicious but it didn't stand out too much for me to get again2) Biscuits and Gravy - I LOVED this dish! Not only was it pretty, but it was so flavorful. I love anything with gravy, really.3) Market Fruit Tart - I liked this one a lot. I love the caramelized fruit in this one!4) Strawberry Lemon Basil Eclair - This was my first time having a fresh eclair. The texture was soft and interesting, but the basil and lemon combination isn't for everyone.We had a great experience here and can't wait to keep coming back!"
9/11/2017,20170911,3,4.14,"I cannot believe that I haven't ever heard of Republique despite living over the road from it for almost a year! Dropped in for brunch with a girlfriend not knowing what I was getting myself into, I took one look at the menu and became quickly overwhelmed! I panicked and ordered the Breakfast Sandwich with Pork Belly, my friend got the Gazpacho. We also ordered a Lemon Basil Spritz each and a Watermelon Spritz.Despite the restaurant being gorgeous inside with great atmosphere, the Gazpacho being delicious and the drinks very refreshing (and strong) I was really disappointed with the breakfast sandwich. I found it very heavy, greasy and lacking in any kind of stand out flavour which I'm sad about. Looks like Tiago Coffee & Kitchen on Hollywood keeps the title of 'Best Brekkie Sanga' for another year AND it's way less expensive.This being said, I really liked Republique. The staff were friendly, service was prompt and the atmosphere was gorgeous. I won't let one subpar experience mar my judgement of this restaurant and I will definitely come back, study the menu further and get something truly delicious so I can leave a better review."
9/25/2017,20170925,4,4.13,"Dinner review: Tl;dr - a bit on the hip side, this is a must-visit place for those out of town and even those who are in the area. The prices are high (I would say $$$ easy and not the $$ yelp shows right now)! The food is actually quite delicious and dictated by the farmers market. Food: 5Presentation: 3.5Atmosphere: 5Service: 4Value: 3Overall ~ 4.1We came spontaneously on a Sunday around 8:30 and had to wait a good 45minutes. The place was packed! I guess all that hype must be worth it if it's always full despite the high price tag. Thankfully, we were able to order drinks while we waited (some small snacks were available but we didn't want to spoil our dinner). The waitress helping out with the drinks for those waiting was spectacular. Very attentive, friendly, and had great recommendations. Probably the worst part about this place were honestly their cocktails actually but even they were above average. The service once we were seated, however, was pretty mediocre. I understand that they were busy but even when it cleared up before closing, our waitress was hard to track down and I had to wave her down a few times. I'm willing to overlook this a little bit but it was concerning for such a high end establishment. We ordered the green gems (a salad), beef tartare, malfaldine (seafood pasta) and oysters. The green gems salad was amazing. It had fresh produce and had the perfect seasoning and dressing that enhanced rather than overpowered the salad, highlighting the already present freshness and flavor of the dish. The beef tartare was a bit disappointing, especially presentation wise. The cheap and flavorless chips covering the beauty was disappointing and the egg was already pre-mixed. It was quite good but nothing too spectacular. The Malfaldine was probably the highlight of the night. The whole lobster chunks in there were a welcomed addition. The pasta was perfectly cooked and drenched in the seafood dressing. One of the best I've ever had to be quite honest. The oysters were delicious as well, but a bit overpriced at $4 a piece. We had the fat bastard and the shigoku.Overall, it's one of the better places in LA as far as flavor and atmosphere but the value proposition is not great, considering how much you are paying for what you are getting. I'd still recommend it as a must visit if you have the cash to spare.--Update:The second time we had dinner here the quality wasn't as good but the service was improved. The carbonara just missed that little extra oomph and the spinach cavatelli was mediocre. The way they served the sea urchin (uni) however was interesting and quite European if I had to say so myself (being European myself). I never thought of consuming Uni with bread but it kind of worked. They had this lovely sea/oceany butter as well that made for an interesting experience. I still prefer my uni plain but this was different and good."
9/27/2017,20170927,2,4.0,"I live near Republique but have never attempted to eat there because there's always a long line outside, which is a good sign. Fellow elite Jeff H. and I decided we'd give it a try, long line and all. It was 10:30 am on a Friday and it was crowded but the line was only about 10 deep. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. One of the problems with the system is you really don't get to look over your tab very well because there are so many people waiting in line behind you. I just signed and tipped without looking it over. Turns out they tag on an extra 4% for their employee's health insurance. OK, good on them. Still, you're now paying for your meal, plus approximately 10% tax, and 20% tip, so you're at the price of an already pricey item plus 35%. It's kind of like paying a buyers premium at an auction. The receipt they give you doesn't break it down, only the one you sign and give back has the cost breakdown. Not sure if a cash receipt is itemized. Seating was sparse and it's not super comfortable. Mostly sitting on stools on tall, long tables. I did like the community feel though and we met some really nice people sitting next to us. We even shared food with each other. Cool!Walter's Favorite was hilarious. Over $20 with tax, tip, and surcharge. Walter must be a 3 year old because it's hardly any food. It's just an egg, a baguette, OJ, coffee and butter, jam and honey. The coffee was lukewarm and bitter. Big thumbs down on Walter's Favorite. Walter, it's called an appetite, get one! Oh wait, they did throw in an extra. A fly in the honey. No charge for the fly, though. We alerted the runner, which wasn't easy to do. He could care less. No apologies at all. It was like we were out of line for asking for honey without a fly in it. Maybe he's the guy who made up the quote that you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar!By the way, nobody ever came by the table to see if the food was OK or apologize for the fly in the honey. Bad form, especially at the price point. We also had the kimchi fried rice. I thought it was just OK. I did enjoy the Croque Madame. It's a lot of food. It would be easy to split because it's very filling. I'd say overall the food is good but I really don't get what all the brouhaha is all about. The lines, the prices, the take it or leave it attitude, Nah."
10/21/2017,20171021,5,4.06,Went for the first time and liked everything about it. Even the waiting line moved by pretty fast and I did not mind it too much. They make it efficient by having the customers order and pay at the registe and the waiters would deliver the food to you (semi-self service?) the baguette was so good with or without the butter and I would have finished the whole baguette if we had ordered it. The belgian waffle with peahes was simply peachilicious and my husband loved the kimchi fried rice. Definitely wanna go back and try more stuff next time. It will be my favorite brunch spot for a while!
10/21/2017,20171021,5,4.11,Put in the planning to make a dinner reservation here weeks in advance. The food is worth it. This place is not overrated.
10/26/2017,20171026,4,4.11,"République has been another restaurant I've been wanting to try for awhile. I've heard many great things about this place, and I will say that I enjoyed it. It was good but I wouldn't say it's anything special. In fact, most of the brunch and breakfast options here are pretty standard. Their dinner menu is a different story. Came here for brunch and ordered the regular breakfast meal that came with scrambled eggs, fingerling potatoes, a chunk of bacon, and French bread. I also ordered smoked salmon on toast, a few pastries and a lemon basil spritz cocktail. Everything was good but my favorites were the smoked salmon tartine and the cocktail. Smoked salmon was delectable while cocktail was very refreshing. Service was actually quick. For such a busy restaurant with the line surpassing the entrance door, we just had to wait around 10 minutes before we were served. And the staff was also friendly. The decor is very intriguing and unique. It is rustic medieval yet industrial. I liked how the interior was converted using the exterior of an old stone building with windows that preexisted there. My one call out would be the price. For brunch, it's not bad. It is $$. But the dinner price is much more expensive and it actually is $$$ so don't be fooled."
11/4/2017,20171104,4,4.1,"4.5 stars for this gem! Had the pleasure of having weekend breakfast here. I highly suggest getting here before 9:30am, anything later will have a HUGE line which is just absurd. Their pastries and cakes look INSANE!!!! I would love to return to try. I ordered the shashuka ($15) it was delicious and flavorful. I just wish it arrived more hot.I think this is a great breakfast or brunch spot if you get there before the line starts. I hear dinner is a bit overpriced for what you get. The salmon tartine also looked divine, I'll try that next."
11/9/2017,20171109,5,4.14,Awesome atmosphere and service. I had the chia bowl and grain bowl! Great sizes and moderate prices. Super fun brunch spot.
12/3/2017,20171203,5,4.18,"Rave review here we go....I would like to write a review about this French delicious restaurantae. ;)For lunch you can come in and wait in a long line. Once you get the to counter, the raving begins. Aka it is worth it. Food- French toast is crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. Ask for a bow of fruit to go with it. Lemonade drink with ginger and pear- very special.Kimchi fried rice- The best combo of spice and meat.Damon Tartine- The healthy delicious option. Fresh salmon and fresh ingredients, perfect all around! A top favorite place in LA :)"
12/11/2017,20171211,5,4.22,"Can I just say... DEE LISH SHUSH. Delicious. Everything we ordered was absolutely scrumptious. I got the salmon tartine - there was a hefty amount of avocado on toast with a heaping amount of smoked salmon and some onions and baby radishes. It was so so good and they definitely don't skimp on their ingredients. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles, which was also very tasty!! The chicken was so tender and the gravy complemented the waffles very well. It was a pretty big portion. As for pastries, we got the creme brulee ball thing (bombolombi? Forgot what it was called) but it was similar to a fried donut with creme filling on the inside. We noticed a lot of people getting it so we got one too! It was so light and fluffy, I knew why everyone was getting it. The other pastry was the bread pudding. Super good - it had yam and raspberries and so much filling, and the top had just the right amount of crisp to it. It was a hefty portion though so we had to take most of it home because our main meal was more than enough. Definitely coming again !"
12/15/2017,20171215,4,4.21,"We searched for a place to get brunch and this restaurant happened to be one of the my bookmarks, so after we found street parking, we got in line and placed our order. The line wasn't too bad since we got there kind of early. There are so many desserts in the case that is very tempting to buy something, but we ended up not getting anything at all!After you pay, they give you a cup with a number on it, so you just need to find seating in one of their community tables. While waiting for our food, I saw some workers preparing the dough in the back, and a glass case of uncooked meat I guess you can buy to cook at home. I really like the layout and atmosphere here, it's very inviting...I was surprised how quickly our food arrived! We shared the Belgian waffle, mushroom omelette, and Chef Victor's Chili. Everything looked and tasted delicious! The chili also came with two pieces of really good cornbread! I usually don't like salads, but the salad that came with the omelette was very refreshing. It's cute how they filled the waffle pockets with fresh berries. Service was on point too. Will definitely come back for more breakfast goodies next time I'm headed to LA!"
12/27/2017,20171227,4,4.2,"THE CROQUE MADAME WAS GOOD!==================================My son was home from his freshman year at college and he and I decided to head to République for brunch. It is quite a trek from La Canada, but it had been on my bookmarks for ages.FOOD: 4/5 STARSI ordered the croque madame because I like sampling these whenever I can. The last one I had was in Paris two months ago and that one was hard to beat. This one was good, but I found myself having a hard time cutting through the crust on the bread even though it had been soaked with the egg on top. The salad on the side was good. My son ordered the chicken and waffles and he liked that. I tried a bite and it was good.AMBIANCE: 4/5 STARSWe did really love the interior of the main dining room right where you enter, but we ended up in the back where the lighting wasn't as nice.SERVICE: 3/5 STARSThe line was pretty long, but thankfully it moved quickly. You order at the counter and then they bring everything to the table.  The timing could have been better though. My dish arrived about ten minutes before my son's did. I wanted to share my plate with him while we waited, but I couldn't flag anyone down to get another dish. I ended up walking over to the side of the room where there were some plates stacked up and just grabbed one.PARKING: 3/5 STARSThey have valet parking and it is $8.00 during the day and $10.00 in the evening.TIPS:1) Eat in the main dining area right by the entrance if you can. It's just a prettier room.2) Go on a weekday and get there before 11:00 a.m. to avoid the rush.3) Keep in mind the timing of the food may be out of whack, so ask for extra plates when the server brings a dish so you can share."
12/27/2017,20171227,5,4.23,"Republique always lives up to expectations whenever I take friends or family around for brunch. The ambiance is always up to par with the nice high wooden tables and ample lighting. Walking into Republique, it's hard not to first stare at the many delicious and perfect looking pastries in the front behind the glass. While you are waiting in line, you can survey the two-sided menu; the first side is all of the food and the backside is the coffee and other drinks. Since I have first gone to Republique many years ago, the menu has expanded a lot, from like 10-12 items to like 20+ items on the breakfast/brunch menu.Drinks: Regular coffee - The coffee here is really good! I am not sure what kind of coffee they use, but it is pretty strong and is brewed very well. Food:Bacon Burrata Toast - Bacon, avocado, arugula, fried egg, and burrata cheese (shredded). This toast was a behemoth. I was surprised at how large and how many delicious foods they can pack onto one toast. It all went together pretty nicely though. It started to fall apart in the end, but it was altogether a really good toast and actually well-balanced.Republique is an awesome place to grab breakfast with friends or catch-up with people. The valet parking is like $8, but you can park on the back streets for free or find street parking."
12/28/2017,20171228,4,4.22,"Great food, amazing atmosphere. Definitely worth coming here!WAIT: Came on the Thursday between Christmas and New Year's so it's pretty much the same as a weekend/holiday. We got there around 11:40 and the line was fairly long all the way to the next shop over but we only waited in line about 30 minutes before we ordered and sat down. You order first then grab a seat wherever. People are pretty good about not saving seats before you've ordered and although the line is long it wasn't that hard to find seating.ATMOSPHERE: This place has a very rustic/industrial vibe. It kind of reminds me of an Urth cafe but more industrial. The inside has one half that has hanging lights and very bright lighting and then the other side is a little more ""dark"" with high vault ceilings, stone and almost a German decor. There is also another back room that doesn't have good lighting or high vaulted ceilings. Lots of communal tables make it good for larger groups and there are both counter seats, smaller tables and then high tables. Great place for brunch, great place for lunch with girlfriends, a date or to take visitors from out of town.FOOD: Their food is typical brunch food with a slight asian flair. They have lots of pastries and pies that are not on the menu and probably rotate. You can see them in the display case when you're about to order. They have gluten free options for pastries. My sister is gluten free + dairy free and she was able to order a good amount of stuff. However, the Japanese grain bowl cannot be made gluten free (the farro is mixed in) so she had to get the salad.BACON BURRATA TOAST - I opted for this instead of the mushroom toast and was not disappointed. It had a thin layer of cheese (very subtle) then avocado, arugula and thick pieces of bacon on top then a fried egg with lots of parmesan cheese shredded. The toast itself is sourdough (but not too sour) and is very crusty/toasted with some sort of butter on it that makes it very very tasty. The bacon is also thick cut and very good. The egg was perfect on top with the right amount of ooze and the parmesan cheese was a nice way to round it out. I loved my toast and it looks small but was enough for me.CHICKEN AND WAFFLES - a more savory chicken and waffles with fried eggs and peppers on top. The waffle is pretty good, it's crispy and then soft on the inside. They give you two square waffles and 2 pieces of chicken with 2 eggs and then a side of the gravy so it's a pretty large meal.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Some of the dishes aren't AS great (the pork adobo fried rice only looked OK) but the atmosphere makes up for it. It depends on what you order in terms of food so I would just stick with what you usually like to eat."
12/31/2017,20171231,5,4.25,"If you want to indulge yourself, Republique is the place to go for a night out in LA. The Republique vibe is open, fresh, family sharing, loud and exciting. When you walk into the place, it's full of communication, people moving around, workers working behind the counters. It gets your palette excited for what's to come.Being seated, we were treated with the utmost respect and our waitress and people helping were on their games. Water was always full, plates were always cleaned up, questions were always answered. I applaud the service as it's been awhile since I've been to a restaurant such of this caliber and I was very impressed.And what about the food? Well, what about it! I honestly could come here, have a beer, get a charcuterie board of light cheeses, house made meats and bread and call it a day. Hands down, delicious, but having gone out with friends we ordered a bit more to fill up on our appetite. Everything we got was packed with flavor & cooked exceptionally well. Butternut Squash Agnolotti was creamy and rich of butternut squash flavor. You could taste the homemade pasta. The Malfadine, with it's lobster bisque profile mixed with uni screamed seafood heaven in a bowl with the pasta that clung to the sauce! The duck breast and prime fillet, both cooked perfectly melted in your mouths as you took a bite of each type of meat. And quite possibly the most underrated part of the meal, the french bread, which was fresh and crunchy was so good as I used it to clean up the sauces of the pasta bowls.What's funny is that we didn't choose this place based off the food. It was actually discovered because my friend wanted a piece of chocolate cake. He had it, was dreaming forever about it, and finally was able to come back and remember the bliss. Do you know what I am talking about? The salted caramel chocolate cake. May I warn you, one cake can easily feed two people. You could be like us and order one per, but you'd be a fool in a food coma afterwards. The cake is so rich in chocolate flavor, it can be a bit overwhelming, but the caramel brings it back down a note because it's salted. I was told if the caramel was warmed up and drizzled onto the cake so that it soaked into the layers, it is also extremely potent and delicious. I have half the cake left over which I am going to try after writing this.Hands down, awesome restaurant and well deserved to be among the top 20 in LA. Bookmarked, and ready to come back."
1/4/2018,20180104,5,4.28,Awesome spot for brunch with the girls. The line was about 20 minutes long but seemed to move quickly. It's not so bad especially if you're with friends. We ordered a plethora of things but the chia pudding was what stood out the most. It was so creamy and perfectly sweet and topped with fresh fruit and almonds. 'Twas a lovely brunch.
1/7/2018,20180107,3,4.23,"3.5 stars.I've been here twice already, and although I've been impressed with the ambiance and decor, I haven't been with the food.  The restaurant is well lit and is gorgeous inside! I've tried: kim chi fried rice, pork adobo fried rice, shakshouka, mushroom toast, and french toast. Although the food was good, I wasn't blown away by it. Of the food I've ordered, I surprisingly enjoyed the french toast the most. The inside was moist and fluffy. All the other items are okay for its small portion and price ($14-$16). We got vietnamese lattes, which were good but also rather small. The mimosa ($13) also came halfway filled in a wine glass. For 5 small dishes and drinks for 4 women, it was already about $120, not including tip. They also charge a 4% on top of your bill to help pay for their employees health insurance.Parking is not the greatest. There is valet next door for $8. After we parked there at 2:30, and went to get our car at 5pm, they said that we owed them $18 because after 4pm, it was a different rate. Ridiculous :( Find street parking if you can or make sure to leave by 4pm! Overall, I've had better brunch (food) elsewhere. However, service was good and the ambiance/decor is beautiful."
1/8/2018,20180108,5,4.26,"I came here for brunch with a few of my girlfriends, and I'd like to just start off by saying that Republique does not disappoint. Besides the horrible parking situation and a good wait, I'd probably say that this was my favorite brunch spot of 2017. The portions are pretty perfect and the menu is great for sharing, and they have the perfect variety as well, including drinks and pastries. This place has an upscale but casual ambience and is always busy, so be prepared to wait in line! Good thing California has great weather (mostly) and LA is a great place to people watch. I would definitely recommend Republique, but first timers be sure to look up the menu ahead of time, as once you get to the front of the line, the line moves quickly and there's little time to decide what you want!"
1/14/2018,20180114,3,4.22,"Really expected a lot more. This restaurant was so cute, the interior design really impressed me, however the food didn't. I saw that this place had Kimchi Fried Rice and lots of people said that it was good, so I decided to give it a try. Kimchi Fried Rice- First impression was that the rice was not even fully cooked. It was hard and barely edible. This dish came with two eggs which I mixed in. It tasted really wet which I was not a really big fan of. However, the meat was delicious. It was well cooked and tender. The kimchi was cut into pieces which tasted awesome and gave a good crunch. The thing that I'm not the biggest fan of this dish is every bite is the same. It gets repetitive and boring after the third bite.Overall, I would come here again but not order this dish."
1/19/2018,20180119,4,4.21,"We finally made it to Republique!First off, the building itself is beautiful. We had been to the restaurant that was here prior. Republique did even a better job while not impacting the integrity of the building itself.I'm not a huge fan of the communal tables but it was better than I anticipated, although it may have impacted our service towards the end of our night. Their Charcuterie board is a must. Rillettes can some time be a bit bland and even feel like the meat was used as an afterthought after it wasn't used for another dish. At Republique they are made the star, both super fresh and tender, it was a great start. Unfortunately the rest of the meal didn't live up to the start, maybe it was the dishes we chose. In particular the Sonoma Duck Breast was well prepared and great quality, but nothing memorable.Service was great until towards the end when our waitress was given a huge table and we kind of got lost in the wash. All and all I would go back to try some other dishes. I find it difficult to believe you could be disappointed there, it just may not live up to all the hype."
1/20/2018,20180120,3,4.18,"Came here with my girlfriend and some friends for brunch. There was a line out the door when we arrived, and it took maybe 20 minutes for us to get to the counter to order food. Not too bad so far. Once we ordered food, we were able to find a table in the back that seated all 8 of us.I ordered the dry-aged beef burger for myself. It tasted good, but not $17 good. I could've gotten 5 cheeseburgers from In-N-Out for that price that would've tasted waaay better.My girlfriend ordered the pork adobo fried rice. I had one bite of it, and did not want any more of it. It was very bland, no taste at all, and the rice was wet and mushy.What I did like were the french fries that came with my burger. They were golden color, lightly crisped and salted, with a satisfying crunch to them.But with the $14 mimosa, bad fried rice, and mediocre burger, I think this place is a rip off and I wouldn't come here again."
2/2/2018,20180202,4,4.17,"Got lucky and found street(meter) parking right in front! They also have their own valet.Walked up and the line seemed really long, but the wait wasn't too bad (15-20min).We ordered the kimichi fried rice, lechón kawali, and mushroom soup.Presentation of food here is fantastic! Everything looks elegant af. The atmosphere as well is spot on. It feels cozy, elegant, and rustic all at the same time. The tall buildings and windows help attribute to this.Food taste was okay.Kimichi fried rice, pros were the two eggs - very creamy and the beef was really tender! Personally preference i thought it was a little too sour and not enough spiciness.Lechón kawali- was a let down. It was not the lechón i was expecting (seafood city has better lechón). The skin was not that crispy, and the fat wasn't really rendered at all, but the meat was tender. Mushroom soup looks like cement, but tastes fantastic! Don't let the appearance deter you. It's creamy and even a little fluffy with a full mushroom taste.Seating can be a challenge if it gets packed, because after you order you seat your self at pong community tables. If you have a large group 4+ it might be hard to find seats together."
2/5/2018,20180205,4,4.17,"I'm happy I finally got to try Republique after all the wonderful pictures I see on IG! It was my birthday weekend and my husband made reservation via Opentable. We got lucky and found free street parking on a Sunday night. (valet is $10) Who needs super bowl when a girl gotta celebrate a birthday?Our waitress was very polite and happy! We had a few questions regarding the menu and she explained everything with a smile.We started out with the leek and potato beignets. I was curious about it and it was a savory dish that tasted like a very good potato ball. Then we had the octopus salad and it was smoked, grilled and very tendered. The dressing was nice but it had bit of a spicy kick.For entrees we had the Strozzapreti which is pasta with Italian sausage, bagna cauda and black winter truffles. Our waiter was very generous with the shavings of the fresh truffles and it was delicious! We also shared the beef short rib and it as yummy and tendered. Our waitress recommended the mille-feuille for dessert and it was a perfecting ending to our meal. Even though it's a bit of a drive I want to come back and try the brunch everyone has been talking about. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 stars is because of the Healthy LA 4% charge on our bill. I now see on their website that you can ask for it to be remove. Yes, it's pricy to eat here, so I don't think the customers would see the difference when 4% is added to menu items. But I feel a surprise charge at the end of your meal is a bit tacky. It's just cost of running a business to provide health care to your employees."
2/7/2018,20180207,4,4.16,"One of my top brunch and breakfast spots. I'll admit the prices are high for what it is, but I've always had a great experience here.Things I've had here are the regular breakfast, kimchi fried rice, little gem salad, grilled chicken salad, and this morning's bread. I'd recommend everything but my favorite is the regular breakfast especially with that bacon steak.Their pastries window is so tempting that you just cannot get something. I'd highly recommend the caneles and bombolinis."
2/8/2018,20180208,4,4.16,"My girlfriend Marie recommended this place as we were trying to figure out a place to meet for brunch. As far as parking goes, they only have street parking. There's plenty during the morning but I noticed by the time it was Noon, there wasn't much left. For anyone whose interested, it's $1/hr with a 2 hour max time limit. We ended up meeting up around 9:30AM and there was a long line that went out the door-about 25 people deep? By the time we left, the length of the line doubled. I recommend grabbing a menu to see what to order. It's one of those places where you order, pay, and grab a seat. So if you're going to have a big group, it's best that someone goes inside to grab/hold a table for you. Otherwise there's plenty of seating for groups of four or smaller. I ended up getting the Kimchi Fried Rice. Apparently it was the most popular dish. Personally, I thought it was okay. Not my favorite but it wasn't bad either. I really liked how their eggs turned out--runny. But the overall kimchi fried rice didn't leave a lasting impression.  I did though really like the coffee cake that they had. Next time, I'm interested in the chicken and waffles and maybe the pork adobo dish the other Yelpers have been Yelping about."
2/11/2018,20180211,3,4.13,"Overrated, overpriced, I have no idea why there's so much hype over this place! We came here around 11:30am on Sunday, and there was a huge line out the door. (Luckily, it did go by pretty fast) We got the mushroom toast which, I admit, was pretty delicious. It wasn't anything spectacular but the bread was crunchy and I did enjoy it. What I really did not enjoy, however, were the French Omelette and Kimchi Fried Rice. The French Omelette had too much gruyere cheese inside that I started feeling nauseous - I couldn't finish even half of it. And the Kimchi Fried Rice was practically dunked in salt. I liked how they made the kimchi extremely soft and the meat so tender, but we really felt like we were drinking the ocean. My friend and I (both Korean, so we've tried many kimchi fried rice in our lifetime ha ha) were not impressed and we were parched by the end from the saltiness (and nobody came by to even refill our water). I personally wouldn't come back."
2/19/2018,20180219,5,4.15,"Pretty good spot. We got a bunch of things and shared. The bread/butter was yummy as was the short rib but my favorites were the pastas. The Mafaldine and Spinach Cavatelli were amazing. Note that they do recommend these things be shared but the portions are actually pretty small. Maybe they would be okay for sharing with a party of two but we were six people and since everyone wanted to try each thing, we literally got a bite. Parking: Valet lot next door, if you're coming towards it on your right, it's before the restaurant."
2/25/2018,20180225,4,4.15,"Bring in the big guns.Every dish at République was fantastic. As is my wont, I'll first direct you to the sage words of LA's Pulitzer Prize winning food critic, Johnathan Gold, who places République on his list of best 101 restaurants in LA published annually in the LA Times.lat.ms/2GGN9g4In addition Eater puts République on its 2017 list of 38 best restaurant's in USA.bit.ly/2t5pjsoI ordered the following:bread with NORMANDY BUTTERPOTATO & LEEK BEIGNET with gruyere and an amazing green horseradish aioli (must get!)a BLACK & WHITE SALADwith black winter truffles, endive, hearts of palm, sunchokes, creme fraiche, hazelnuts, parmesan; the truffles weren't as trufflely as I'd expect (is that because they are black winter truffles?)la pièce de résistance PRIME DRY-AGED RIBEYEwith roasted root vegetables, black peppercorn sauce, and what Jonathan gold calls the ""best french fries in LA""The ambiance promises to be magical as there's the potential to be seated in the courtyard of two Gothic buildings that still vibrate with Charlie Chaplin's residual energy and that courtyard is covered in a vaulted glass roof. Furthermore, you get a look into the open kitchen from these seats. We were lucky this is where we got to sit after declining the initial table offered to us. Not every diner gets this experience as you might be seated in the bar area, you might be seated in a section that has been covered in a wood ceiling with impressive rows of hanging lights, or you might be seated in what looks like a warm dining room. I've eaten in the courtyard both on this first visit to République and to my prior visit to the same building when it was Campanile.The service doesn't match the price on the menus. The service uses a zone defense and the little things like filling my glass of sparkling water or more importantly my wine were never done. One dish that was ordered was forgotten. République is five star food, five star prices, but four star service and ambiance.One exciting thing on the menu was a tepache cocktail. Tepache is a fermented pineapple juice. I think it was on the menu for the first time this weekend."
3/3/2018,20180303,5,4.17,"Excellent restaurant and worth the wait! The pastries and desserts were all beautiful, hope to come back again soon and try more. We came before 10 AM on a Saturday and the line was already out the door! The kimchi fried rice and chicken and waffle were my favorites. It's also lovely inside with open space, high ceilings, and a lot of light coming through, perfect for a weekend brunch! Here's what we tried:+Smores bombolina+Matcha mochi cake+Chai Latte+Kimchi fried riceThey also have valet parking, $8 for lunch."
3/5/2018,20180305,4,4.16,"Prepare to wait in line. It's worth it though! I came on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and waited for 1 hour. While waiting, you'll be next to a large pastry selection - it's so tempting! You order at the counter, get a number, seat yourself and they will bring you your food. I got the japanese grain bowl - grains, pickles, avocado, radish, sprouts, fish eggs and a poached egg. I would say it's one of the healthiest options on the menu. It was really good though, packed with good flavor and I enjoyed the different textures in the bowl. It's almost like those healthy grain veggie bowls. My boyfriend got the pork adobo bowl. It was pretty good but I wish there was more than just pork, rice and a fried eggs in this dish. It can get boring after the first few bites because there's not too much to it. I also ordered the americano which tasted like water with a minimal amount of espresso. Overall, I love the ambiance, decor and food. The price is like the usual brunch prices of $10-20 per dish depending on what you order. I know dinner is significantly more expensive!"
3/9/2018,20180309,5,4.18,"Fantastic environment and beautiful décor.Great pastries and very nice service.Republique stays pretty busy, but the line moves quickly and earlier patrons will have their selection of the best seats. It would be nice to spend a lazy brunch here with a group of friends enjoying the view and the wide selection of food. If I lived closer, I would visit often."
3/15/2018,20180315,3,4.16,"This place has so many options on the Brunch menu that I want to try. They have a little parking lot which is valet off to the side. This makes it easier for parking if you are going to drive.We went here on the way to Universal and it was quick and convenient since we got in there early. We stood in line for around 10 minutes but it went by quickly. We even saw a celebrity in line getting their breakfast.We ordered the Regular Breakfast and the Kimchi Fried Rice.The Regular Breakfast was good and simple. Everything was cooked the way it should be and the presentation was clean. The Kimchi fried rice was a little gooey and wetter than the normal fried rice you would expect but the flavors were good. I could have done without the egg and the sesame seeds but that is probably more of a personal preference than it being unnecessary to the dish.The decor is super cute in here and would make for cute instagram photos. The tables are all cleaned off, it was a little confusing at first if we should bus our own plates though. I would recommend checking this place out if in the area."
3/26/2018,20180326,5,4.17,"Caution! Dinner menu changes every day.From experience, to food, to location, and restaurant style, this place is pretty freakin' awesome. Came here for a celebration of my friend's acceptance to grad school at UCLA on a Sunday night. Made reservations the day of. I was surprised to get a table! The lady who answered the phone, however, was super rude and sounded annoyed. But! I just brushed it off because I was happy to get a table. We got here a little earlier than our reservation, then we were seated right at our scheduled time. The restaurant was full, lively, and at the perfect noise level (in the back of the restaurant at least). Our server was super helpful and sweet. Shout out to Allie! Was super bummed when she had to leave.Okay, on to the food. Drinks: I went with the amazing House G+T. No, that does not stand for ""gym, tan..."". Lol. This thing was one of the best drinks I've had. Gin, blood orange, kaffir lime, and tonic. Must get! Veggies: The cauliflower. This little bowl had an amazing assortment of veggies and nuts, all resting on top of a delicious lime yogurt base. It's packed with flavors and the veggies are cooked to perfection. Meats: The beef short rib. This is probably the most tender short rib I have ever had. It came with no knife, so I expected it would cut easily. And that it did. Like butter. The half chicken was our second protein. This thing is huge, designed for two or more to share. This was served on a hot skillet, with a spinach and potato base. The chicken was rotisserie style and melted off the bone. A little on the saltier side, but no complaints here! Just wish I had rice. LOL. Ended this delicious meal with a butter almond cake topped with fruit and ice cream. This was to die for. The cake has a crispy outer layer and is super moist and flavorful inside. The fruits were marinated beautifully and the ice cream added the perfect touch to the cake. Delicious! My one and only complaint is about the server who took over after Allie had to leave for the night. This gentleman was cordial, but had no personality what so ever. He didn't really try to ""sell"" any of the desserts to us, he rarely checked in to see how things were going, and he didn't even say goodbye or thank you as we were leaving the restaurant! He even looked me in the eye as I was walking out. It was almost as if he was annoyed with me. Weird. But, his behavior wouldn't be the reason I deducted a star. Luckily we ran into Allie outside on our way to vallet. She smiled and wished us a good night and said thank you! Overall, amazing experience. The food is unique and flavorful, prepared with love. The service was awesome (until our sever changed) and the restaurant had an overall outstanding vibe. Can't wait to come back! Quick Tips: 1. $10 vallet parking. Yup, $10! Holy cow. Some street parking available. 2. Call early to make a dinner reservation. They only take reservations for dinner. 3. Bread is free. Ask for more. Hehe."
3/29/2018,20180329,5,4.19,"One of the best LA brunch spots on my list!!!!! I would so go here often if I lived close to one... wahSo right off the bat you'll think of pastries, especially when you are greeted with some delicious looking ones while waiting in line at the entrance. But then you get your hands on a menu, look around at the incredible architecture you are about to have a meal in, and then look at what other people are having and boom! Predicament. It was kind of tough deciding what to get when their brunch menu was longer and had more variety than most places. And when your trusty yelp app shows you photos of nearly everything that you cannot decide between. Ultimately I went with the Japanese bowl. My gf got the pork adobo fried rice. My sister got the breakfast sandwich. And my homie got the kimchi fried rice. Best part? We all had eggs to jiggle on our ig boomerangs (except the sandwich). After a little taste trading, I came to the conclusion that each of these items was an incredible choice. Nothing like I've ever tasted before, despite menu descriptions sounding familiar and basic. Every thing was incredibly savory and an interesting blend of some good brunch and even dinner flavors. That Japanese bowl was probably my favorite: grains, quinoa, mushrooms, avocado, sprouts, salmon roe, and egg. There was pickles on it too which sounds a bit odd, but wow it actually worked well with all the other flavors. Great vegetarian option. I also have to shoutout the pork belly sausage in the breakfast sandwich. Tasted really good. Sadly we didn't get any pastries (I'll be back again for you, s'mores bombolini), but I did get the iced matcha green tea which was pretty good after I added some honey syrup. Everything about our dining experience was magnifique, Republique!"
4/2/2018,20180402,4,4.19,"République has been on my list foreeeva. On La Brea in Hancock Park area, which is between Beverly Hills and DTLA. Had seen pics and posts ofsome of my fav French pastries, but sadly the special fruit is seasonal, so the tart is not available.Just another excuse to jet off to Paris.Had a great yoga sesh earlier and caffeine, but wanting something more and Not too heavy as I'm not too much a breakfast person. Was meeting a friend and decided on République. Ordered the Chia seed pudding w/berries, nuts, organic honey and coconut milk. When the bowl was presented it was so colorful and tasted perfectly delish, not too sweet and so beneficial healthwise. My friend liked the Shashuka, middle eastern dish with poached eggs over sautéed tomatoes and onions, he gobbled with baguette. The pastries on display looked so good and I swear I wanted to order one of each, but did NOT. Would waste my workout efforts. Would rather eat something later for lunch or dinner. Service here was good and I will have to return and try some of their signature French dishes: foie gras, quiche, steak pomme fritters and maybe acquaint myself with the choc cake that winked at me...and hopefully my seasonal fruit tart..."
4/8/2018,20180408,3,4.16,"This had been on my list for quite some time so we stopped by with our friends yesterday. There was a really long line but it moved fast because you order at the counter and then find a table. SERVICE - When we got to the glass cases displaying the pastries, we were greeted by an employee that asked if we wanted any pastries. We put in an order for some and then was directed to the next available cashier who took our order. From there, we received a cup with our number on it for our food. Finding a seat could be very difficult durning peak times but there was a nice blonde (manager maybe), that helped us search for one that fit our party of four. That was really nice of her to do that! FOODCroissant - I read somewhere that the croissant was a must so we got it. It was very buttery and it did have that flakiness to it but it was also a little hard. Chocolate Croissant - Chocolate usually makes everything better so this was a tasty chocolate croissant! Pork Adobo Fried Rice - This had a ton of flavor but a little on the heavy lime juice. Lots of meat chunks though.Kimchi Fried Rice - This came with two poached eggs which made the rice a bit soggy if you mixed them in. There was a good level of spice to this as well.Overall, this was a solid lunch place. The quality of the food was great and the staff provided wonderful service."
4/8/2018,20180408,4,4.16,"If your going to wait in a long ass line and splurge for brunch, you should definitely go here! I'm letting you know the hype is real. Seriously. I honestly I could sit there for a whole day and enjoy everything that was on the menu. I went there for brunch, around 11 on a weekday. There was no line! It was glorious. Thank goodness for days when working at home. Don't have a work at home day? Call in ""sick"" and make this place your first stop into recovering from whatever you've caught. LOL The fact that I walked in easily, had easy access to the bakery selection, great selection of seats, and front of the line access if I want to order even more food. I was hooked.I ordered the Vanilla Almond Milk Latte, Mushroom Toast, and Pork Adobo fried rice for my sit down experience. The mushroom toast was my favorite because it's everything I expected it to be. Light, savory, salty, soft, crunchy... all the textures. The pork adobo fried rice was good. Never had a lot of adobo before so I can't give it a good comparison to the actual flavors I should be expecting. I enjoyed the meal so much that I didn't want to walk away empty handed. I wanted to bring happiness home with me so I ordered the Salted Caramel croissant knot for an afternoon snack later and the Shrimp Po Boy for dinner. Good thing I was in the privacy of my own home because I shed a tear at how amazing the food was, even if it was coming out of take out containers. The Po Boy is a must have for me. The traditional sandwich got a huge upgrade with plump fried shrimp, refreshing slaw, and all on top of a buttery roll. On another visit, I ordered the Maine lobster omelette with baby mixed greens, French onion soup, and several pastries. The French Onion Soup is the best I've ever had. A must have to start your meal. I'll definitely be back. Probably try to come here for dinner and see what that menu is like."

4/28/2018,20180428,4,4.13,"We went for brunch on a Saturday morning and we easily found parking on the street not too far away which was nice! There seemed to be a lot of parking options. First getting into the line, it was clear this place really has a lot of hype! Cars driving by were slowing while passing I'm assuming because they're checking out how busy it is since they're planning to go there or just seeing why there's so many people in a while outside! We waited in line for maybe 15 or 20 minutes? It was all our first time so we didn't know how the process worked with ordering/seating. We noticed a lot of people ordering coffee from a side window and decided to do that as well. We sent someone to order coffees while someone held place in the general line. This was a great call! They delivered our coffees to us in line. I ordered the Vietnamese Iced Coffee since this is one of my favorite coffee drinks! It was pretty below average which was disappointing especially since it was kind of expensive at $4+ The pastries all looked sooo delicious! I would love to go back and try some of them. I ended up ordering the Pork Adobo Fried Rice. I like that they offer a large variety of foods especially fusion foods! It was definitely the most expensive pork adobo fried rice I will probably ever eat at about $18. It was worth it because it was REALLY DELICIOUS!!! It was a pretty small portion too especially for the price. But it was worth the flavor! Seating was a little difficult to find, we were able to snag something because a group was leaving. So it wasn't too bad but definitely not without effort! The service was really great! The cashier was really friendly and efficient when doing split checks for our party. The server was really nice and attentive as well! The ambiance is also really nice and casual. Great tie of old fashion and new! Definitely a place I would recommend and go back to!"
4/30/2018,20180430,5,4.15,"Delicious! Everything is so fresh and flavorful! Went yesterday with some girlfriends for Sunday brunch. Line was out the door but it moved surprisingly fast. Order at front, find a table, they deliver your food to you. Ordered the regular breakfast, chia seed pudding, Belgian waffle, ricotta toast - all of which were delicious!The Belgian waffle was super light with just the right amount of sweetness, topped with fresh fruits. The batter was light and I did not feel super full with a food coma afterward.Friend ordered regular breakfast - I loved the potatoes as they were bursting with flavor, the bacon steak was fatty and juicy and perfectly seasoned.Other friend ordered and shared the chia seed pudding - the coconut cream made it oh so tasty, I could get enough! Just the right amount of sweetness. Portion sizes were on the smaller side for the prices paid, but I would consider this place higher priced than places elsewhere. Still a great experience though - ambience and dining area is great, bathrooms are clean. Curious to come back to try the dinner menu next!"
5/1/2018,20180501,4,4.15,"Came here for breakfast on a WEEKDAY! I see the lines on the weekend and I definitely don't do lines. We waited for about 5 minutes at about 10am on a Wednesday and it was perfect. The line stands right next to a great bakery display case with lots of yummy treats. I was compelled to get a raspberry Bombolone. Lots of good jam inside that, worth it.It was 2 of us and it was the first visit for both of us, so we just shared a few things. We ordered the half of baguette with bread and jam, french omelette and the brioche french toast. The bread was toasted and crunchy. This was great. The butter and jam was pretty good too.Things came out fast and were delicious. The omelette was great and tasty with herbs. The brioche french toast needed syrup but it was great once added on. I was on a vacation day, so I didn't look to see how much the extra Health Care/Service fee charge, but this has been the reason why I haven't visited sooner. I think everything should be included in the price of the food. I don't like to be nickel and dimed at the register.Not sure if I would come back unless I wanted to impress someone during the week."
5/2/2018,20180502,5,4.16,"Republique is an LA as brunch gets. You most likely have seen the crowded line out the door outside as you drive through La Brea, and with good reason. The atmosphere is modern, seating inside is very open and well lit with natural lighting/high ceilings, and food is visually colorful, aesthetically pleasing (for the IG!), and delicious if you are willing to pay the price. If you're okay waiting 30 minutes on a Saturday (basically the wait anywhere for weekend brunch around noon), don't be too discouraged by the line out the door. The line moves pretty efficiently thanks to the quick order-takers in the front, and the workers who bus the tables super fast inside. (Just as a side note, please don't be one of those people who saves a table as your friends wait in the back of the line. There WILL be spots for you once you get to the front, and you will be preventing people who just paid and ordered to get a table!)The menu you can grab while you wait is full of choices for everyone: juice, coffee, smoothies, and a large assortment of hearty brunch items. Drinks can get pretty pricey from about $4-8, and a brunch plate averages around $15-20. I ended up opting for the Citrus Ginger Smoothie ($8) and Croque Madame ($16) which set me back almost $30 with tip and tax. Though it was kind of pricey, I thought the food was top quality and delicious. My smoothie was a pretty good size and tasted sweet and fresh with pineapple and apples. The spicy kick in the back of my throat from the ginger was just the thing I needed! The Croque Madame sandwich was awesome. The bread was nice and crispy throughout both sides and was stable enough to hold all of the ingredients. In fact, the brown crisp they achieved kept me coming for more not only from the texture, but the slight burnt flavor that surprisingly added to the taste in a good way. The cured ham and gruyere cheese were salty and delicious, and the runny egg was the perfect addition to make this more decadent. I also liked the lightly tossed salad on the side just for something fresh. Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. Next to Blu Jam, it makes it as one of top brunch places for me in LA. Yes it is pricey, but it's one of the places I really love what I'm getting in exchange in terms of atmosphere, high quality ingredients, and aesthetically pleasing well-seasoned food. And I love watching everyone around baking bread. I would definitely come again!"

5/4/2018,20180504,4,4.16,"Awesome! But the line is out the door and down the street. Lol. Wait time in line was about 30 minutes to an hour and still long when we finished eating and walked out.Desserts are the first thing you see when you are asked to order and only certain ones are packaged to-go. Others you have to eat there but I wanted to eat every single dessert I saw. The hazelnut cream puff was my favorite and so aesthetically pleasing. Even now I crave the sweet delicious from hundreds of miles away. The bombolinis are nice too! I got the s'mores and crème brulee ones and also that passionfruit cake was lit! It might be a crime to leave without dessert.Brunch wasn't bad and came out in nice portions. We got the chia seed pudding, shakshuka and pupusas. Chia seed pudding was my favorite because the other dishes were kind of bland for me, but still pretty.Decor inside is very cute!Will likely come back for more dessert and hazelnut cream puffs!"
5/11/2018,20180511,4,4.16,"Finally made the effort to get brunch from Republique. Firstly, they don't take reservations for brunch. You order, grab a cup with a number and try to find a nice seat. I'd say make sure to order everything at once because, the line is usually long. The vibe of the place is adorable, doesn't feel like LA. It is very picturesque in each corner, the details are beautiful. As you're in line you will have some mouth watering pastries in eyes view, and the bread... (coming from someone who doesn't enjoy bread) it is wonderful. They have house made almond milk, or soy as their non dairy milks, unfortunately on busy days it is easy to run out of the almond milk. The double espresso was a nice palette cleanser in between plates, hah!We had the *Ricotta toast* - topped with pistachio, kumquat and grapefruits, this was refreshing. The ricotta itself was amazing. The toast was soft, but not soggy, and delicious on its own. (I ate the crust)*Pupusa* - this sounded so good on paper, but was a disappointment. I picked at it, and then left it. TOO much black beans, it is stuffed with the squash blossoms and cheese, and really, I love squash blossoms but it was such a waste in this as you couldn't taste it. The cheese on the inside was nice and thick. Overall as a dish, its a hard pass.*Grilled chicken salad* -MUST GET. This salad was phenomenal. Truly, we loved this. Each ingredient served a purpose in this salad and it all meshed so well together. The rawness of the tahini dressing, and the sesame all around. The sweetness of the dates, along with the oranges and pumpkin seeds.. The kale and radicchio were cut perfectly thin, and the carrots were soft to the touch. The chicken was grilled to the point where it was slightly charred on the outside, but soft inside. *Ban Mih sandwich* -I love pork belly, but this was ridiculously salty, oily, fatty, to the point where you didn't want to eat it. The spicy mayo, and the squash spaghetti inside of it was good, but I wouldn't get this again. I need a cup of water to chug just thinking about it again."
6/1/2018,20180601,5,4.17,Drinking the atmosphere and eating delish bake goods and hearty breakfast items. The Cafe counter service was fast and hospitable. The sunlit courtyard with wooden communal tables sets such a wonderful environ for Friday morning.
6/2/2018,20180602,5,4.18,"OMG...!!!!!....probably one of my top three fav spots in LA bcuz of the innovation and the evolving F & B program by Chef Walter....the food is perfectly on point...WOW....might a well call him ""KING Walter""...!!!!We had s party of five and we ordered tons and some of the standouts are ""ALL"" and especially the ""uni sea urchin in scrambled eggs on French bread"" was a homerun dish that you MUST order for sure...""scallop coconut ceviche""....""steak tartare with chips""...""sweet corn agnolotti""....""lobster pasta""....and ""desserts and desserts and desserts"" was all a homerun and DYNAMITE...!!!!!Btw the ambiance is perfect and nothing outta place and the SERVICE was impeccably on point with professionalism and attentiveness and conveying the info about the description and ingredients of each dish...and confident smiles:))))Also let's NOT forget about the beverage program with cocktails and fake cocktails and wine list is fairly priced and well thought out and the table side wine service is eloquently professional and smooth and precise....Awesome job Mr. Sommelier and the waiter was stealth and always nearby when needed....he was like a ""server ninja"" in motion :)This place is the BOMB and every food freaks MUST try this place to understand the food of LA and the direction, it's heading into for our future...thank you for the experience again and thank you KiNG Walter...)))))"
6/4/2018,20180604,4,4.18,"Been here for both Dinner and Brunch, and both times were pretty great! Love their selection of pastries/desserts up front, as well as the interior (which is just really nice and pretty). Note that the tables are seat-yourself style and often times you need to share a space, so know that before going. Also note that you CAN make dinner reservations, but CANNOT make brunch reservations... you just stand in line until it's your turn to order. Highlights: 1. Dinner: The Short Rib and the Brussel Sprouts were winners for me2. Brunch: Get.The.SHAKSHUKA ... just do it ... it's amazing!Overall a great experience no matter what meal you're going for!Stay Cheerful ;)"
6/4/2018,20180604,5,4.19,"Holy crap. Holy moly. Holy bajesus. Everything I put in my mouth at this place was uhhhmazing. My mouth is watering just thinking of it and I think a lot of people have found out as the line was out the door when we came.We got about half a dozen sweets all were incredibly with the strawberry frosted matcha and vanilla bundt cake topping the list, highly recommend.For brunch we ordered the musaka, French toast, pepusa and ham and cheese sandwich.The musaka was bom bom bom amazing! Pepusa was the best I've had and I absolutely love French toast and have tried many in the past and this one was literally the most phenomenal one ever. Perfectly toasted on the outside not too sweet or overbearing just right! Mmm it was delicious!!Please please come and have a meal here even if it's just for me ;) you won't regret it!"
6/4/2018,20180604,4,4.19,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 11. Line was long but it moved quicker than I expected (~20-30 min). The food was delicious, but it is definitely on the pricier end. I ordered the lobster omelette and it was full of flavor, but I thought it was a bit small for the price. I loved the bread on the croque madame! Very crispy and tasted great. The fries were really crispy as well and complemented our meal really well. The chocolate cake is a must have if you like chocolate! It was really rich and they give huge slices! We didn't finish the cake but I brought it home and ate it as a snack later in the day. Our order (lobster omelette, croque madame, side of friends, choc cake and coffee) ended up being ~$60 before tax which is pretty pricy for my taste! Definitely had lots of flavor but be ready to shell out some $$ for this place.They gave a valet that you can park at. Otherwise parking on La Brea seems horrible. You can also park a few blocks away in the neighborhood and walk! We walked from Park La Brea and it wasn't bad at all."
6/17/2018,20180617,5,4.2,"Hands down the best brunch I've ever had in LA. Dozens upon dozens of pastries welcome you upon entering, and seeing so many delicious pastries made me want to get them all. Sadly, I did not. I got the Regular Breakfast, which was soo good. A simple meal of eggs, bacon, potatoes, and a baguette with butter and jam never felt so good. The bacon was thicc and flavorful. The potatoes were splendid as well- nice texture and well seasoned. The red peppers and chives accompanied the potatoes well. I wish I would have bought a baguette home because the bread was so amazing. Super buttery and fluffy inside with a crunchy exterior. I can still taste the bread in my mouth as I'm writing this.My friends each both got a matcha latte, and it was very good. Creamy and quality and strong matcha flavor. It did not disappoint. The matcha raspberry bostock pastry was also pretty good!Interior is super hip; I love it!"
6/20/2018,20180620,4,4.2,"Yes, the Kimchi Friend Rice is good. And I also wished I tried the adobo bowl because every time someone passed by it smelled so good. My family went for Father's Day and thankfully we all ordered different things because it allowed to me to taste various dishes. The long wait is definitely enough time for you to figure out which one you wanted to try. Kimchi fried rice- wish it came with more. Definitely enough for just one person. Not spicy and came with an egg on top. Good for both breakfast and lunch. Brioche French toast- By far the best French toast I've ever tasted and trust me I've tasted plenty. Will definitely be back for this. Lobster omelette- Is not worth it in my opinion. It was tasty but for $22 I could order better dishes. The salad it came with was really good though. Burrata Toast- it was highly recommended by a staff but it was disappointing. The green that cake with it was a little bitter but aside from that .. it could have been really good. Belgian waffle- kids loved it. Probably a safe choice if you're indecisive and don't want to be risky. Strawberry tres leches- We basically fought over it. Came with lots of fruits and wasn't quite as sweet. **LITTLE YELPEDS CLUB** Kids might get a little frustrated with the wait but the food is worth it and lots of space for the little ones. Strollers on the other hand could be a problem. Depending on how busy it is. I had to squeeze through people so imagine a stroller."
6/29/2018,20180629,3,4.18,"3.5 stars. This is a restaurant for splurging. Expect to pay (minimum) $50 each but it's more like $75 per person.That being said, it's a beautiful space and I enjoyed the food. It's a great restaurant for someone new to LA or for treating a friend for their birthday. There were actually a lot of white families feeding pate and $15 plates of pasta to their children (insert eyeroll here).Food here is casual French bistro fare. We got:CHARCUTERIE ($25): we got the smallest board. I loved all the different pates and head cheeses. It also comes with unlimited bread and this supposedly fancy butter that's $7 an ounce. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between that and Country Crock.CACIO E PEPE BUCATINI: Thick pasta with cheese and pepper. Can't go wrong with good pasta and cheese.BEEF TARTARE: LOVED this. The beef Tartare had a nice mustard flavor and loved the crispy potato chips that came with it. Fun to eat. BRUSSEL SPROUTS: Roasted Brussels sprouts and bacon. I liked that the bacon was cut thicker, but out of all the dishes, this felt most like something that I could make at home. Because of that reason I wouldn't order again.I have to give a shoutout to all the Latinx people bussing tables and filling water bottles and just HUSTLING. We went through 4 water bottles and every time we finished one, a new one would just magically appear. Now that's hospitality. Y'all are the backbone of LA dining."
7/11/2018,20180711,4,4.18,"Came here for an early brunch with my friend on a Sunday morning and there was a line out the door! The concept of ordering food here is that you line up (in the line, there's a bakery section), order your food/dessert, and then pick up a number and get seated and they'll bring your food to you. Their bakery + dessert goods are a trap! They place in the line so you can get trapped into buying delicious desserts. I ordered the Belgium Waffle ($16) which is a pretty light breakfast because I had plans for lunch. It came with little peach pieces on each part of the waffle so it was super fresh and refreshing. It wasn't overly sweet either. My friend ordered the Croque Madame ($17) which was a more heavier meal but way more the price. She only ate half of it and even brought it home. I was able to find street parking a block away which is free because you don't have to pay for the meters on a weekend. I know valet parking is $8 and that's pretty pricey for valet. This place is definitely on the pricier side but their food is pretty good! I'm not sure if I would be down to pay $16 for a Belgium waffle because it was a small brunch item. The cashier kinda made us pay together even though we said we were gonna pay separately. I'm not entirely sure why...One of the worker there allowed my friend to put the pastries she bought in their fridge and allowed us to pick it up after we eat because he said they melt kinda fast and that was super nice of him.All in all, it's a good brunch place to come with your friends! Alittle on the pricey side but the food is decent."
7/17/2018,20180717,5,4.19,"I recently came to République for a friend's birthday dinner and, wow, is this place amazing! I've heard good things about République before, yet this new American/French eatery still surpassed my expectations.First off, the place is HUGE. There's cool counter seating up front for large groups, booths and tables in the back, plus an upstairs area with more tables. Toward the host's booth, you can order ice cream and baked goods. Next to it, you can watch the staff shuck oysters.Make a reservation! This place was packed when we came in. Reservations are through OpenTable -- pretty quick and easy. We had to push our reservation back about an hour -- thanks, LA traffic! -- and they were able to accommodate the change. We were immediately seated upon arrival on the first floor, toward the back.République changes its menu daily. Come here with an open mind and an open wallet. The portions are tiny, but oh so good. Apparently, brunch is better than dinner -- I'll have to come back and try it out.Here's what we ordered...HAWAIIAN KANPACHI CRUDO- ""Appetizer"" section of the menu, $26.- Raw kanpachi cubes mixed with green Thai curry sauce, melon, basil and peanuts.- My goodness, this was tiny! Not fit for two to share, but everything is meant to be shared here.- Loved this!BEEF TARTARE- ""Appetizer"" section of the menu, $25.- Raw beef chunks with tarragon aioli sauce, pickled red onions and potato chips.- My friends weren't big fans of this one -- raw meat can be an acquired taste.- I LOVED it. Good size, too.CHARCUTERIE BOARD- We opted for the smallest size for $25.- Still, it was quite a hefty size! - Nice assortment of salami, bread, spreads, mustard, butter, meats, veggies, etc.- I probably wouldn't get it again, but it was filling. I just wasn't into everything on the board.- We added two cheeses to the board for $8 each -- we asked the chef to pick out two soft options. YUM.CORN AGNOLOTTI - ""Pasta"" section, $26.- Basically, 10 pieces of ravioli with corn mash, brown butter, parmesan and basil.- We were eyeing the $50 Pappardelle because of its Australian Black Winter Truffles -- boy, do we regret skipping on that one for this.- Don't get me wrong -- it was good. It was small, but so flavorful. Still, I wish we'd had the truffles.ROASTED SUMMER CORN - ""Appetizers"" section. Comes with two pieces for $18, but we added an extra piece for $27 total.- I admit it -- we ordered this because we wanted something that had truffles on it. A moment of gluttony... but it was quite good. - Corn on the cob, dressed up with truffles and parmesan. - If you have the patience to cut the corn off the cob, order this.- Truffle is very subtle. I'm admittedly disappointed.SALTED CARAMEL CHOCOLATE CAKE - A large piece of delicious, rich cake for $13. - SO RICH. SO DELECTABLE. SO MOIST.- They don't do any special treats for birthdays, but they'll comp you a candle if you order a dessert. They don't even sing for you.CARAFE OF ROSÉ- It should be criminal how little they fill the carafe. Only 2/3 full, good for about three glasses.- I don't remember which rosé we got, but there were only two options on the menu. It was delish!For three, our meal was about $250... and we kept it relatively light! The patrons around us likely spent much more. Also, they do charge a 4% surcharge to cover the cost of health care benefits for full-time staff. You can ask to have this charge removed -- but how awkward is that? What an uncomfortable exchange to have with your server...All in all, a great experience. I'll have to be back ASAP for brunch."
7/22/2018,20180722,3,4.17,"*Disclaimer* this review is regarding my experience with brunch at the République cafe, not the restaurant, which I have not yet dined at for dinner. Overhyped, overpriced, and food did not meet expectations....it's aesthetic inside though! That about sums up this place for me. Let's start with the hype. This is one of the first places that you hear about when you come to LA, everyone seems to know about it. I had been meaning to go for a while, so my boyfriend and I gave it a try for brunch this weekend. We were both thoroughly unimpressed with the experience. Maybe that's partially because of how overhyped it is, with a line that goes out the door, but I did not believe it lived up to expectations.You order at the counter after waiting in line outside, with a relatively small menu that has traditional brunch offerings. I ordered a (very expensive!!!) single mimosa and a breakfast sandwich. I've been to places with better mimosas for about the same price - and they're bottomless at those places!! As for the breakfast sandwich, it literally came with NOTHING but the sandwich. No sides, no greens, nothing. Just a small sandwich. It tasted good, but it was basically just an Eggslut sandwich for over twice the cost. Not impressed. The seating really isn't that pleasant either. It's all communal, and it's very loud and everyone's voices echo inside due to the vaulted ceilings. At least it's aesthetic though! Loved the brick walls and beautiful lamps, windows, and checkered floors! That was just about the only positive for me, unfortunately.Disappointing and overhyped. There's much better places out there, at least for brunch. Might see what the dinner experience is like at the restaurant some time, but I know for sure that I won't be back for brunch."
7/23/2018,20180723,5,4.19,"Note: this review is purely based on the pastries/bakery. Sadly I was not able to try the actual restaurant :(I got to Republique around 10 am on a Sunday and the line was already out the door. Parking is extremely difficult, even that early on in the day. Customer service is great! There are so many delicious pastries to choose from. I took Yelp's recommendation and got the creme brulee bombolini, which is basically a large, cream filled donut hole. It was very good though, not too sweet, definitely a must try. The cannele was so good too, it was nice and soft on the inside.The prices for the pastries were a little on the higher side and does not really reflect the true cost of what you are buying. There is a hidden 4% fee that is charged to every order to provide their workers with benefits. You can opt out of it by just letting them know that you do not want to pay the 4%."
8/12/2018,20180812,3,4.17,"This review is for the dinner.Came here for dinner with a party of 8.Food---Sweet Potato Beignets (~$12): Pretty good. Sweet and savory medley of flavors. Cheese Board: We chose 2 cheeses of which I do not remember. I think it was ~$8 for each cheese. It came with bread, honey, jam and a small chunk of your chosen cheeses. Bread was good. But overall, not worth. You're better off making your own cheese board at home. Broccoli Di Cicco (~$14). This salad was interesting. Small portion. Flavors were okay. Pastas: Corn Agnolotti (~$26) and Bucatini (~$26). Once again, somewhat small portions. But it's pasta. The Corn Agnolotti was okay, but the Bucatini had a nice creamy texture. Decent flavors. Mary's Organic Roasted Chicken (~$39): Half a chicken. This comes with an eggplant dish. Chicken was moist. Flavors okay. Cook Ranch Pork Chop, Belly & Sausage (~$68): Very impressive presentation. Really liked the pork belly the most here--crispy outer skin layer, nice fatty layer, and then the meat. Nice variety of selections of meat and textures. The sauce that it came with needs more flavor. Once again, its a pretty small thing for the price. They can accommodate for large groups. But if you want to share food among a large group, everyone is getting Costco sample sized portions. Portions in general are small already. I feel like it is more ideal to come here with a small group or with a date. Overall, pretty good/decent. Pretty pricey for small portions. Didn't really wow me and somewhat underwhelming in some dishes. Excellent and friendly service. Very informative and knowledgable. Dress code: Not sure if there really is one, but for the most part, smart causal/business casual if you want to fit in better."
8/14/2018,20180814,4,4.17,"It was amazing to finally make it to the famous République! I was expecting to wait in the line for a long time but it actually only took about 20 minutes on a Saturday around 11AM so that was a pleasant surprise! I ordered the Shakshouka which was very good but kind of overpriced. It came with a single egg which was a little underwhelming. My friend had the Mushroom Toast which was good but a small portion for the price. However, the bakery here is great! I bought so many pastries. The Matcha Mochi Cake was probably the most interesting thing I tried. I liked it a lot but it definitely doesn't have a Matcha taste to it. But I love the texture of the Mochi! My favorite was the Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake. They give you a HUGE slice! The cake is super rich and moist and the flavors all come out nicely."
8/14/2018,20180814,5,4.18,"So worth the wait!!!! A beautiful restaurant with really good food makes for a great time, especially on those weekends you brunch with your friends. (The line also moves faster than you think, since you order first and then find a seat! Don't be intimidated by the line!)Came here for a birthday brunch for a friend with a party of 4- we split 4 dishes family style and ended up spending only $20 each (I was surprised!). We had the fried chicken and waffles, the chorizo sopes, French toast, and the Filipino crispy pork belly with garlic fried rice. All the dishes we had were soooo good and had an interesting twist. fried chicken and waffles: 4.5/5A super solid dish- flavorful fried chicken and crispy waffles. Comes with sunny side up eggs and an incredibly rich gravy (which couldn't done without) Be warned: this is a super heavy dish so probably best shared!French toast 6/5Oh my lord this is the most decadent, custard-y French toast I've ever had!! I'm not much for sweet foods at brunch, but this won me over. Generous portions-a must have!! But again probably wouldn't have been able to finish on my own. Sopes: 4/5Really solid, but not too generous portion. Interesting that it was made of green corn! A good choice here, but there are better. Filipino crispy pork bowl: 5/5Soooo muuchhhh flavor!!! Although there were only a few slices, they were crispy and flavorful. Garlic fried rice was aromatic but not overpowering, and everything culminated nicely when you pop the yolk and pour the spicy fish sauce. SO GOOD!!"
8/19/2018,20180819,4,4.18,"Very impressed with Republique! My fiance brought me here for dinner and it was so good! He made reservations ahead of time (I recommend making a reservation as the place was non stop packed the whole time we were there)ParkingValet parking available for $8? Or street parking is also available. We went around 7pm and street parking was free at the time. Food-Beef tartare- I preferred this over the foie gras. I've never really had beef tartare so I don't know what to compare it to. But it was good regardless!-Foie gras torchon toast- I love liver. But it was interesting with the apricot. I felt like the flavors were so powerful it was hard for me to enjoy the foie gras. -prime dry-aged rib eye cap- so good! The ribeye was cooked perfectly and the veggies complimented it really well. -corn agnolotti- If you've ever had the corn soup at curry house, it tastes exactly like that in a pasta form. My fiance loved it!Overall great food and great service. Lots of seating available. It definitely is pretty loud inside too so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you want a quiet eating environment."
8/27/2018,20180827,4,4.17,"Republique feels like a gorgeous French cafe and bistro that happens to be in the middle of Los Angeles. The superbly decorated restaurant exudes a quaint and authentic vibe that could charm even the most snobby Parisian. When bringing my sister to Republique for a visit, I knew her meal, our table and maybe even the bathroom, would make appearances across all of her social media. Timing your visit to Republique, however, is important. A line snakes its way out the front door and around the building if you try for a weekend brunch visit. My tip is to come on a weekday morning (if possible). The environment is much more relaxed and enjoyable (more similar to a true French cafe experience in my opinion). Our dishes differed but our responses did not. My sister got their Belgian waffle and a cappuccino. Her waffle came dusted with powdered sugar, covered in fresh berries and accompanied by delicious male syrup. Yum. I ordered a more savory option - their Pupusa (which comes with mushrooms, avocado, black beans, oaxacan cheese, salsa rosa and a fried egg). The Pupusa was a burst of powerful, complementing flavors. I was enamored. Although a pricy $18, the Pupusa was a unique departure from the classic Salvadoran dish.Their weekday breakfast menu is only offered till 3pm. As much as I have enjoyed both visits to Republique I have yet to try one of their lunch or dinner options. Although breakfast/brunch options are not the cheapest, the prices pale in comparison to their dinner menu. All in all, this trip was a delicious experience that I regard as a treat (considering the brunch bill totaled around $40 between the two of us. If you have not yet tried Republique, I most definitely recommend."
9/8/2018,20180908,4,4.17,"What a phenomenal place to take your out-of-town visitors! I was catching up with a friend who was staying in LA, and I suggested to come here for breakfast before her flight out. I heard good things about this place from other friends and family. We came around 8 AM on a Saturday morning expecting a wait, but it was pretty empty. Parking is mostly on the street, but they have complimentary valet until 10 AM. Otherwise, it's pretty expensive. The interior is charming, we made sure we took plenty of photos before we left. They have a great selection of pastries and breakfast items. Some are pricey, like a brioche french toast for $15. However, I think the portion sizes are fair. I enjoyed my croque madame, it was delicious. My friend liked the matcha mochi cake, which was an interesting option. I would love to come back for dinner, I'm sure it's just as amazing."
9/10/2018,20180910,5,4.18,"Dropped by Republique with a friend at ~1:00 pm on a Saturday and was happy to see that the line was pretty manageable! We were scared that there would be a huge wait, but we were able to get in, order, and sit down within 15 minutes. Feeling as basic as humanly possible, we both decided to grab the avocado toast and opted to grab bread to share. The bread came out first and oh god that baguette was gorgeous and delicious and made my whole day better. The salted butter on the side was yummy, but the real star was definitely the peach jam. So glad that we decided to get this. Now, the avocado toast was mindblowing. Literally one of my favorite dishes to date. It was piled high with cherry tomatoes and sesame seeds and had such a robust flavor. The toast was crispy and held together well even with the heap of toppings on it. The interior of Republique is hands down amazing. Each section seems to transport you into a different world and it enhances your overall dining experience. It was great to sit down next to a rack of spices and olive oil and to be able to peek into the kitchen as well. Prices are steep, but it's be expected for the area and for the quality of the food/the gorgeous interior. Parking is either valet ($8/lunch, $10/dinner) or street. I absolutely loved my experience at Republique and will definitely be back in the future~"
9/13/2018,20180913,3,4.17,"Was able to make some time the other day to try the brunch here with some friends. Have to say we were expecting the food to be great and memorable, but it was only okay. We ordered the regular breakfast, kimchi fried rice, ricotta toast (which was the best of the bunch), mushroom toast, as well as the shakshouka (prefer Gjelina's version a lot better).The saving grace was that there was an interesting and wide range of baked goods to choose from. Took some home and they were quite good. Also, the set up is pretty cool and it didn't seem like people had to wait for seating once you got to order your food. Would return to try their dinner but probably not brunch except to order some takeout bakery good from their take out window.*An added tip that may or may not hold true on other days is the line did not get too crazy until 10 am on the Sunday I went."
9/24/2018,20180924,4,4.16,"Food: There is definitely reason as to why this place has more than 4,000 reviews at 4 stars. There's a good amount of dishes that deserves the recognition it receives, but there aren't others that don't. I had originally bookmarked this place to try out their Uni toast, but they do not serve this option on their brunch menu. So, I might have to come back for that at a later date and time. As for brunch, my friends and I ordered, 2 kimchi fried rice dishes, 1 regular breakfast, 1 mushroom toast, and 1 brioche french toast. First off, I could understand why people are in love with the brioche french toast because it tastes like a buttery cloud in your mouth - but I don't think I'd come back for it for $15. It doesn't come with any fruit or anything, just a side of syrup. Secondly, I really liked the mushroom toast because all the components complimented each other very well. It definitely inspired me to cook up my own version. The kimchi fried rice was delicious, which I noticed was everyone's go-to. I love the little kick from the red chilies they incorporated into the dish, while the poached eggs really hugged all the flavors together. The bits of short rib also added onto the savory and wholesome goodness. LastlyC The regular breakfast had a little bit of everything if you want more of a mix of different breakfast items, but again, it's not something that really stands out. It included two eggs, a piece of a baguette, potatoes, and thick cut of bacon. Although the jam was really good, I think this dish fell short on something I probably wouldn't recommend as a ""must-have"" through referral marketing. Would definitely skip out on this dish too. All in all, everything was great but some were not worth the price paid for the quality.Service: My friends and I went during brunch. The wait time was about 30 minutes on a Saturday around 1pm. Our food was met at a timely manner - except our 2 orders kimchi fried rice. I kid you not, our first set of food arrived maybe 15-20 minutes after ordering. I kept asking different waiters if there was something going on with all fried rice orders to have caused a delay on ours. Unfortunately, our kimchi fried rice arrived probably 30 minutes after. It was followed by an, ""I'm sorry about that .."" from a runner. I wasn't too upset even though I was super hungry, but this definitely put a damper on my thoughts on service. It also would've been helpful to know that (I believe) a 3% health care surcharge for employees. I didn't mind the idea so much, but I wish I'd known sooner because it would've affected the gracious tip I had given. Their prices are appallingly high for certain dishes (like the regular breakfast $19 and brioche French toast at $15), but I assume it's because of the area it resides it. I opted out from ordering a drink because my bill had already rung up to close to $60 for 2 people. And yes, parking sucks as it does all over LA. You only have the option of valet parking (or street parking if you're lucky) which is $8 during lunch time (I think $11-13 during dinner), so make sure to keep some cash in handy. I had the inconvenience of having to walk to the nearest gas station to pull out some cash with a fee of $1.75 - of course. But again, just another venture. Ambiance: During brunch, there was a line out the door. It was set-up so that you had to order first then sit down. The ambiance was definitely alluring. The place reminded me of a glimpse out of a Harry Potter novel with high ceilings and beautiful lights that would make it seem like you were walking through a an alleyway in London. In farthest room, the walls were covered in shelving for bottles of different types of wine, which I thought was unique. The tables and chairs were pretty simple, not anything meant to be comfortable. I would suggest if there was a way they could include purse holders under their tables because I had to try and enjoy my food with my backpack resting on top of my feet so it didn't touch the ground."
9/29/2018,20180929,5,4.17,"UM.. YUM!!Arrived here on a Sunday around 10am and we waited about 40 mins. It's a order and find a table style. The theme and decoration of this place is on point. I LOVE LOVE the high ceilings and natural sky light coming in. THE FOOD-- YUMMMWe saw them making a few batches of the Green Juice and we had to get it. Perfect amount of ginger. YUMWe ordered the:The Belgium Waffle-- wow, the peaches were perfect and every bite with the fruit was so good... I wondered if they can add fruit for the French Toast cause that's looked very basic and plain.. Ricotta Toast with Fig-- the perfect sweet and crunchy. I did not expect the Fig to be so soft and the cheese was good. It somehow tasted like my homemade greek yogurt.. The Kimchi Fried Rice-- with 2 EGGS! Them yolk....... so so good. The radishes -- just perfect..Definitely recommended. You gotta valet your car or hopefully find street parking. You can also order dessert, pastries or coffee on their side window."
10/9/2018,20181009,5,4.19,".... is ces't magnifique!Don't be fooled by the French name, this place oozes with Californian flair. Their space is phenomenal: bright, warm colors yet clean and inviting. I've been twice for brunch and both times have been incredible! On our next trip to LA, I should really check out dinner since they seem to do more classic French preparations at that time. For brunch, drool over the cast-iron pots of shakshouka, perfectly jiggly eggs over kimchi fried rice, marvel at their artful breakfast toasts and do good by ordering a fresh squeezed green juice. You'll need it to feel less guilty when you devour their sweet sticky bun or their creamy delicious Hazelnut puffs. OMG. I'm still dreaming about those cream puffs right now ...Calories be damned.Review #2300."
10/15/2018,20181015,5,4.2,"Republique is a restaurant that charms you as soon as you approach it. Although it is popular as a brunch destination, I came in on a Friday night with my fiance and I was immediately taken by how chic the restaurant was with its dim, warm lights. We were seated right between the bar and the window looking out to the street. Along with the crowd there at night, for a moment it almost felt like I was in NYC. Although it is listed as ""French"" here on Yelp, the menu suggests otherwise with its LA-bistro-esque items. What I loved most about the food here is the combination of unexpected ingredients that creates really tasty dishes without feeling like they're trying too hard to stand out. I came here gunning for the little toast Hors D'oeuvres, specifically the ""Eggs on Toast."" Uni on top of soft scrambled eggs on top of toasted baguette? It sounds amazing, and it sure tasted amazing. The toast lasted two bites but I can still recall the taste 3 days later. We also tried the Foie Gras Torchon Toast. It was very good but just completely overpowered by the uni toast. Next we had the Cool Ranch Pork Belly for appetizer. The presentation of this dish was beautiful! And who knew caviar would go so well with pork belly? The cauliflower puree was so unbelievably creamy. I couldn't tell how the pork belly was prepared because it was so tender that it almost melted in my mouth. For the pasta course, we had the Porcini Tagliatelle. I was in love from the first bite; the pasta was the perfect amount of al dente! And the lamb ragu was so delicious. I was wondering since it was a ragu if there would be any trace of lamb taste but you can definitely tell. And it wasn't a bad gamey taste either. Finally for the meat we went with the Prim Ribeye Cap. I think this was my first time tasting this cut of beef. It blew my mind completely because I usually cannot handle eating much ribeye steak due the richness of all that fat, but this ribeye cap was magically tender without the fat! It was the perfect ratio of fat and lean meat! The mint is an excellent and refreshing addition to the dish. Aside from the food, the service here was amazing as well. Our server was all smiles all night and just overall very pleasant. She was attentive despite the busy night. She recommended the perfect wine for me that night and also helped me choose the Pear Sorbet for my dessert, which was probably the BEST sorbet I've had in my life. Every bite of that sorbet was like a whole pear. I had an excellent time dining at Republique and loved it from beginning to end. I hope to visit again in the near future for the brunch service!"
10/22/2018,20181022,5,4.2,"République is a lovely restaurant that offers unique French cuisines. The building itself is historical (built by Charlie Chaplin in 1928) which draws to the rustic and inviting atmosphere. Walked in on weekday for an early breakfast (surprisingly there wasn't a line, usually on the weekends République is jam-packed). Ordered my meal at the counter from an outstanding server (he suggested great breakfast options that catered to my liking, so customer service was already on point) received a number then proceeded to a table. Probably waited less than five minutes before our meals were brought to us. I ordered the mushroom toast which was divine! Served on a bed of scrambled eggs, ham and spinach with hollandaise sauce. It was well prepared and seasoned. My matcha latte accompanied my toast which was an excellent choice as it balanced the flavors from my meal.I also tried the Brioche french toast with vermont maple syrup which was savory. My friends ordered the avocado toast (very satisfying as well) and the breakfast sandwich with pork belly sausage, fried egg, mayonnaise and american cheese. Overall our dining experience was magnificent! I will certainly visit again for an evening dinner."
10/25/2018,20181025,5,4.21,"This is my favorite French brunch place! Have been here twice and I keep wanting to come back for everything that I haven't yet tried on the menu. The bakery is so fresh and delicious that one simply cant get enough! The dessert selection is just endless. From sweet bonbolinis to amazing croissants and strawberry cakes, you name it. They have it all! My fave meal is their Madam Croquet which truly reminds me of Paris! The green matcha is just the best in town! Come in hungry and leave happy!!! P.s. don't be surprised if you see a huge line on the weekend. Don't be alarmed, they work fairly fast and the food comes out minutes within putting your order!"
10/28/2018,20181028,5,4.22,"There's plenty of review on this place. Therefore, you know it good. First and foremost, you will be waiting in a line. It's always busy.Beside that, let's go from here. Had a group get together for a friends bday. Sunday brunch for a big group may not be wise but it was fine. Like I said, you'll be in line especially the weekend. Once inside, you ordered and and a number is given to you. You find a seat. So basically it's kind of hard if you have a large group as the only tables that could accommodate us was a communal table. We joined in with a couple that was already seated. They were kind enough to move and give us the whole table. It is pretty loud. The pastries were amazing, plenty of selections to choose from.We opted for for the classic I feel like. Also, I think it was their popular dishes. The chicken and waffles, lobster omelette, kimchi fried rice, and eggs benedict. Food, actually didn't take that long to arrive. Cocktails on the other hand did take a while. Beside that, food was very flavorful and tasty. Everything we ordered was a hit beside the benedict. It was good but I've had better. Don't get me wrong, it was good. Gives me a reason to come back and try whatever else is in the menu which there is plenty to choose from.Ps, valet is available as street parking can be a bit crazy. But it's 8.00."
11/7/2018,20181107,5,4.23,"Not your ordinary restaurant, far more unique than most in the care they take to delight customers. The food is beautiful to look at, delicious to eat. You order at the counter, from a small menu. The finished dishes are brought to you. The French onion soup is gorgeous, topped with slightly browned cheese and fresh parsley. Served hot & tasty. Sturgeon slices on a homemade bagel was perfectly yummy, beautifully plated with capers, onions, dill, topped with fresh lemon slivers.The restaurant has a courtyard decor with long, wooden tables and stools for seating, not elegant or fancy, more family style. Fabulous place for lunch. Very nice staff, and valet parking next door. We will certainly be back."
11/9/2018,20181109,5,4.24,"4.5/5 starsThe exterior and interior are beautiful. Love the atmosphere of this place, very comfy and social, bustling with people ...visited this place with a buddy of mine for the first time for brunch. We ordered the brioche french toast, chia seed pudding, and regular breakfast. Presentation, flavor, and portions are very reasonable for the items we got. I would have ordered extra pastries but we had already ordered a lot of food and we had other restaurants we wanted to try out. You order at the register, then you're given a numbered cup along with your receipt, and you get to choose anywhere you sit."
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.25,"République has one of the best brunch food selections & ambiance. I spent my Monday morning here and found the restaurant to be much bigger than I thought it would be! There are also tons of pastries/drinks you can choose from.Here are the items I ordered:~Belgian Waffle: A perfectly fluffy Belgian waffle made with grist & toll stone milled flour & topped with Tamai Family Farms berries. Each bite was deliciously sweet with just the right amount of powdered sugar & maple syrup!~Fried Chicken & Waffles: Now this was the highlight of my brunch. The waffle was the exact same one as the Belgian waffle, but let's focus on the important things..the chicken! It was perfectly crispy and fried! There wasn't a lot of dough on the chicken so the skin was thin & crunchy. It was also interesting to note that each bite was savory yet there was a hint of tartness in there (which I think was from the pickled chilis). Also, the gravy was AMAZING; it was made with bacon & pork belly sausage ( it was so good I was literally having a couple spoonfuls of the gravy by itself LOL). On the other hand, the pickled chilis added a nice contrast to the sweetness from the maple syrup. Definitely try this if you're a fan of fried chicken.~Croque Madame: Not much to say about this one, but it was one hearty & savory sandwich! It was composed of house-cured ham & nutty Gruyère cheese. It was interesting to try the flavors that came from République's way of curing ham (they also have a cool see through window where you can see a lot of dry aged meats they're working on). This also comes with a side salad for you to get them nutrients in.5/5 for having delicious food & a nice ambiance!"
11/19/2018,20181119,4,4.25,"***Jonathan Gold's #19 of LA (2017): République***Overall, I thought République was an enjoyable experience, but I wasn't really blown away as I had expected to be. République has no shortage of hype in Los Angeles, so expectations were admittedly high. This restaurant is extremely well known, and widely considered one of the best in LA, so why wouldn't they be?Came here Saturday, 5/19/18, a little after 12 noon. The line was long, but went somewhat quick. The long line was expected given its reputation around town, and we were more than willing to wait it out. For a weekend lunch/brunch, this is the kind of restaurant where you wait in line, order and pay at the register, take a seat, and wait for your food to be delivered to your table.République is definitely loud and lively. It was pretty hard to hear the person taking orders at the register, which gave us some problems, especially considering the long line behind you and the stress added to order quickly. I highly recommend reading through the menu before getting too close to the front. That's a mistake I won't make again.To eat, I ordered the brioche french toast ($15). I also split an order of the French omelette with my friend ($22). All in all, I thought the French toast was good, but not great. For the hype, I was definitely expecting a little better. The dish only came with one piece and a small side of syrup, so it's really not much, either. The omelette was good, as well, but nothing too special. The quality was apparent, however.Probably the best part about this restaurant is the decor and ambiance. It's a really cool, trendy spot, no doubt. This place is buzzing with energy and definitely a Los Angeles hot spot and staple in the dining scene. I'm very interested to come back and see what this place is all about for dinner. Perhaps, that's when they kick things up a notch. Until then, my four star review stands. It's a worthwhile experience."
11/20/2018,20181120,4,4.24,"Came here to have brunch with one of my good friends. Overall, I thought that this was a solid place for brunch, although I've heard that dinner here is a different story.+Mushroom ToastI loved the mushroom toast because it wasn't heavy at all, given the amount of toppings on the toast. Anything with mushrooms and spinach on top seals the deal for me. The toast was not too difficult to cut through, and I liked that it was buttered and put atop the stove to toast.+Croque MadameMy friend ordered the croque madame, which was also one of the things I wanted to try here. At first, it looked like a huge portion! Surprisingly, it wasn't as salty as I thought it would be, given the combination of ham and egg. I think the salad on the side definitely helped.+Matcha raspberry bostockI'm not sure was a bostock is, but I thought this was okay overall. I could taste the matcha flavor in the pastry, but wish it would have been a little more complex in flavor and a little bit sweeter.Be prepared to wait at peak hours during the day. I saw the line go out the door. The decor inside was nice, food was great, but the thing that was lacking was customer service. The employees were not very friendly and seemed flustered given how busy it was. They also added an optional, extra charge of 4% on the bill for employee health insurance. 4% seems small, but sure adds up when you have to pay for tax and tip as well."
11/23/2018,20181123,5,4.25,"I recently visited République for dinner and had an amazing experience from start to finish: Atmosphere - Very unique decor, but I love it! There definitely a buzz in the air here! Service - Great service, the hostesses and waiters/waitresses were very friendly and were very accommodating to anything we wanted.Food - The food is amazing! We had a cheese board, cauliflower, bucatini alla carbonara and salted caramel chocolate cake. Everything was amazing! The portions are small, which I like. The food is definitely pricey, but the quality and taste is worth it.Drinks - The cocktails are amazing! I had the House Old Fashioned and it was one of the best old fashioneds I've ever had! Their wine is also fantastic. They offer wines in half glasses, so you can easily pair wines with each of your courses or entrees. For $15, the bartenders will even create a custom cocktail for you based on what you like. République is an amazing restaurant in every way! Be sure to get a reservation for dinner. Next time I'm in LA, I'll definitely be going back to République for a meal!"
11/23/2018,20181123,5,4.26,"11/23/18Dinner at République never disappoints I like being seated in the back or upstairs because it is quieter. They are very accommodating and service is excellent! Our server made sure he reserved the dishes that are limited and made sure we didn't over order which is something easy to do. We always start with their delicious artisan bread, French butter and Pan drippings. Definitely get the octopus salad (Asian pear, pomegranate, cabbage, pistachios, Chile, lime) and Brussels sprouts (Thai farm arugula, apples, applewood m-smoked bacon, red walnuts and piave). The combination of flavors in both of these dishes is so delicious!Channel Islands rock fish portion was smaller than I expected but still so delicious with the chanterelle mushrooms, winter peas, gnocchi and bacon. The Mafaldine was so good with the homemade pasta, large chunks of lobster and Uni. Second pasta was the Spinach Cavatelli was nice and firm with the rich buttery sauce. We finished off with the huge 32 oz platter of prime dry-aged ribeye and super yummy crispy fries. We finished off with the chocolate care and the brown butter cake and black coffee. République is still my favorite!"
11/23/2018,20181123,5,4.27,"4.5 stars!Republique is an LA classic for a reason--the lively atmosphere (in one of the most unique restaurant settings ever), the friendly, attentive service, and the delicious food make this a truly memorable dining experience! Coming in for dinner, we had a nice spread from all parts of the menu--the potato & leek beignets were chewy/creamy in the center and crispy on the outside. The charcuterie board came with crusty, chewy bread, along with a plethora of cured meats, including rillettes, pickled vegetables, and three different types of sausages.We continued with the little gems salad, a refreshing mixture of greens, cucumbers, turnips, radishes, seeds, and green goddess dressing. I was a huge fan of the octopus salad, which (unexpectedly) was prepared with Asian flavors, including shredded cabbage, Asian pear, and fried shallots, dressed with fish sauce and pomegranate seeds! After quite a wait, we had the tender, roasted organic chicken; and the Channel Islands Rock Fish, served over chanterelles, winter peas, and gnocchi. But one of my favorite dishes was definitely the spinach cavatelli, made with super chewy, dense pasta in a creamy sauce with chanterelles, black trumpets, and porcini mushrooms--so much umami!After the delicious meal, we moved onto dessert! Kaiserschmarrn is a classic Austrian dessert, but this untraditional version was like an apple cobbler with a puffy pancake baked over the top, and served with a scoop of spiced ice cream! Overall, the food here is simply fantastic (though a bit on the pricey side), but the real reason to come is for the unique atmosphere and impeccable service!"
12/6/2018,20181206,5,4.28,"Great spot! Even when there's a line, it moves pretty quick and you can pretty easily get a table. Food was solid but the full bar wasn't open when I went. Oh well guess I'll have to go back ;)"
12/18/2018,20181218,5,4.28,"The Brunch is AH-MAY-ZING! aka Pastry HEAVEN! I'm so glad I decided to wait in line. My group and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. We ordered a bunch of plates and shared.Creme Brûlée Bombolini - If a creme puff and a creme brûlée had a baby, this would be it! Delish! Brioche French Toast - OH EM GEE. One of the best French toasts I've ever had. Perfectly crispy around the edges and full of flavor in the inside. Definitely, will order this every time I come here.Smoked Salmon Tartine - Pretty good and clean flavors all around. I love smoked salmon, so this was a no brainer.Chorizo Sopes - Pretty good standard Chorizo sope, if you're in the mood.Chicken and Waffles - Pretty good. Love that it comes with a side of gravy! YUM.Wish we had bigger stomachs, so we can try all the pastries. Next time! Btw, it's nice to dine in the restaurant during the day cause it's bright. There's lots of natural lighting coming through the windows and ceiling, compared to dinner time, when it can get pretty dark. But hey! Dinner is AH-MAY-ZING too!"
12/19/2018,20181219,4,4.28,"My friend loves this place so we headed there for brunch right after I got off my flight! The place is a line up to order then seat yourself kind of restaurant. We were tempted by all the goodies on display as we shuffled in line to the register, and somehow only ordered 4 items for 3 people :P The interior of this place is so cute! There was some serious wood and brick aesthetics goin on at this place. It sort of felt like we were in Harry Potter! There was tons of natural lighting coming through too. We ordered the mushroom toast, brioche french toast, breakfast platter, and monte cristo. My friends also got a cold brew and latte. Hands down, my favorite was the french toast. It's amazingly fluffy and perfect for sharing too! This place can get a bit pricy... but what can you expect. Eating here is an experience with the unique interior and pretty food. Definitely a great place for a cute brunch with friends or if you simply feel like treating yourself."
12/23/2018,20181223,5,4.29,"Finally tried Republique and it definitely lives up to its hype!! We arrived at 10am on a Sunday and got in line and ordered food at 10:30. The line is long but moves very quickly. We got our food within 10 minutes of ordering.We ordered the brioche French toast which was one of the best French toasts I've ever had. Made to perfection! The kimchi fried rice was also really good and the eggs on top of the rice were the most beautiful fresh orange color everrrrr. The French omelette was good but I've definitely had better. It was on the dry side. We noticed later that our server had taken away our omelette plate really quickly even though we still had basically a full salad on it, which was a bummer because the salad was good.Ambiance & location are perfect. The inside of the restaurant is magical. High ceilings and pretty aesthetic. I can't wait to come back and try more!"
12/27/2018,20181227,4,4.29,"Los Angeles is filled with yet another trendy restaurant that comes and goes. Republique defies that notion by sticking to its core and keep bringing out great (and instagram-worthy) dishes. Now note, I've only been there for brunch and can only wistfully imagine what dinner there could be like.The line that quickly forms in the morning is a pretty good sign of things to come. To start, the regular breakfast offers a good starting point with some incredible breakfast potatoes, a thick slice of bacon, eggs how you like it, and some of the best bread I've ever had. Take the best bread and add some high-quality butter and tasty jam: I'm sold. If you happen to be on your way to the airport, grab some pastries for the flight, you'll thank me later.Service is pretty quick and the line moves at a reasonable pace. Pricing is pretty reasonable and the ambiance is really lovely for that casual feeling during the day. Street parking is available, if not, there is always the valet option."
12/30/2018,20181230,5,4.29,"A hip restaurant on La Brea. From the streets, you probably wouldn't realize how busy and lively they are until you walk in. Dined for dinner and was overall impressed on every level. Ambiance - almost as if you're in the courtyard outside, the background music is a mix of genres that are all well known hits that's nostalgic. The staff are all very busy, but friendly and frequently check up to ensure you don't go a moment needing anything. Bartenders are constantly mixing drinks and can be quite entertaining to observe from time to time. Started with the bread and butter ($8), recommend adding a pinch of salt to each bite. The gem salad ($15) was really nice with so many toasted seeds. The Dover sole ($72) whole fish was brought out and deboned served table side. A perfectly cooked white fish topped with brown butter and served with potato mousseline. Very good and highly recommend. The malfadine pasta ($43) was served with Maine lobster and uni butter, all very good additions. For dessert had the almond brown butter cake and warm dark chocolate cake.Every dish was full of flavor and one I would order again."
1/5/2019,20190105,5,4.3,"I thought this place would be overhyped, but it's pretty darn good! I've had this place bookmarked for as long as I can remember. Finally was able to try this out for lunch last Thursday during my ""break"". Arrived at 12pm and the line was super long. Thankfully, it went be super quickly. You basically order at the register, take a number, and people will bring it over to you. They really do have their system down for such hectic place. Ordered:x Shakshouka (stewed tomatoes & pepper, black kale, chickpeas, yogurt, baguette, soft poached eggs) - I've only had this dish homemade so I was super excited to try it at a restaurant. I honestly don't know what authentic ones should taste like, but the flavors of this one did not disappoint! The loaf of bread it came with was a little hard, but I love that :) If you're open to trying new things, I highly recommend this dish. x Grilled Chicken Salad (kale, roasted vegetables, farro, pomegranate, dates, dukkah, cumin-honey vinaigrette) - I ordered this because I'm trying this whole ""make healthier choices thing"" even though I reallllllyyyy wanted something more carb-y... but SO happy I did. This salad was HUGE I wasn't even able to finish it. It was super light, but filling. The pomegranate was a nice touch and the chicken was actually flavorful.With the non-stop traffic here, I'm surprised how friendly the workers are. Pretty expensive, but that's just LA for ya. Very solid lunch spot IMO :)"
1/5/2019,20190105,3,4.29,"Overrated for me. I've lived in LA for 6 years and past few years, I heard about République a lot. There was always a line out the door around the block, so it doesn't appeal to me. I finally got a chance to visit because my friends came from Irvine to get brunch in LA. So, we were like okay, let's go.You start of at the Bakery section, and you choose your goods. I really enjoyed the Crême Brûlée Boni - pastry... and it was extremely delicious. Honestly, the bakery section looked more appealing to me. You pay at the end. Kind of tough for big group - I feel bad for the workers there. We got our seats right after ordering, and our food came out in 15-20 minutes. My boyfriend and I spent $90 including tip and tax for Steak and Eggs Benedict (which my poached egg was extremely overcooked). I was a little sad, but hey I know the chefs are busy. We came with a party of 12 and all of their eggs were runny except mine. I swear, I have the worst luck.My boyfriend ordered the Breakfast Sandwich, I thought it was a bit on the salty side. He said it was okay. We also got the mimosa and the Gin and Tonic cocktail on the brunch menu.Their bar selection is crazy, I saw it cause I was sitting right in front of it. Their tequila options were endless.Food - 3Ambiance - 4Bakery - 5Service - 4.5I don't think I'd ever come back for Brunch. Probably I want to try their dinner menu next time but I don't think I'll be back for a while. It's like Urth Café, where it's extremely known to tourists. I love my Asians but damn, I came out to La Brea and there's so many damn Asians."
1/7/2019,20190107,5,4.29,"Smoked Salmon Benedict: 5/5For $17, I keep my expectations pretty high. Republique certainly did not disappoint! This was probably one of the best eggs benedict I have ever had. It tasted amazing even when the food was cold (took a bit too long with taking pictures), so I can't imagine how much better it would have tasted if it was warm. The dish was truly flawless - every ingredient that went into it was excellent. The salmon, the poached eggs, the avocado, the tomato, the jalapeño hollandaise sauce, and the pain au lait bread - all complimented each other perfectly. It was a very filling meal that was well worth its price. Croque Madame: 3.5/5I tried my friend's dish and it wasn't as nearly as good as mine. It seemed to be a ham and cheese sandwich with an egg on top and a green salad on the side. I did enjoy how the ham was cooked as it had a good flavor to it. However, the bread seemed to have been a bit too burnt - not sure if that's how it's normally served or if that was a mistake.  Either way, I would recommend another dish and personally opt for something more unique. Creme brûlée Pastry: 4/5There were so many pastries to choose from, but I just had to try the creme brûlée one. The outside is sweet due to the creme brûlée topping and the inside is filled with a custard. The bread was nice and fluffy and the overall pastry paired well with a cup of black coffee. For only $3, I was tempted to buy more!Aesthetics: 5/5The interior is beautiful with its hanging decor. It's also super well-lit, perfect spot to get those instagram pictures! The exterior is also cute and another great photo-op. And not to mention the presentation of their food, which was definitely on point. Wait: 3.5/5Once you get to the restaurant, there will most likely be a line outside. I arrived around noon on a Saturday and the wait was about 20 minutes. You initially wait in a line in order to reach the cashier where you will place your order and pay for everything. Seating is self-serve and they will bring out your food to you when it's ready. It does get pretty crowded and you may end up sitting next to another party. Parking: 1/5The downside is finding parking near the restuarant. They offer valet, but it's a bit pricey. If you're lucky, you may be able to find street parking for free in a residential area (on 8th street). It's 2 hour parking, but that was plenty of time for me and my friend to get back."
1/7/2019,20190107,5,4.3,"Looking for healthy breakfast? Look elsewhere. Want delicious, guilty, buttery, flakey, loaded with goodness brunch....République!On a Saturday or Sunday expect a line but don't worry, it goes fast! The restaurant is deceptively large so there is a lot of seating inside. When the door opens a glass case of fresh breakfast pastries will make your mouth water. The best decision I made that day- creme brûlée bombolini. I mean the name alone means you have to have one right!?! YOU DO. It was a little cream puff that speaks to your heart and tells you everything is going to be ok. The filling is creamy, not too sweet, and whipped to perfection. I don't recommend sharing one because you will want it all for yourself. For breakfast the mushroom toast is a winner- mushrooms, spinach, and scrambled eggs on a thick piece of freshly baked bread. Paired with a delightful Bloody Mary- hangover gone!Now I need to bring my mom so we can sample all of the other pastries!!!!"
1/11/2019,20190111,4,4.3,"Don't let the long line deter you, it moves very quickly and definitely worth the wait. Came here for Sunday brunch and left very happy. The decor is so cute, they have a bakery with tons of mouth watering goodies, and fresh juices which is a major plus for that hangover.Kimchi fried rice: So much flavor and texture. I would order this again and again.Chicken & Waffles: Chicken was moist and well seasoned, waffle was crispy, and the gravy was out of this world. Very hearty dish, I would definitely share this one.Mushroom toast: Holy heck this shit was delicious!! I literally have no words to properly describe this but trust me, its a must!3 items + 2 mimosas ran us about $90ish which is pretty normal for LA brunch. The mushroom toast alone will guarantee my return!"
1/11/2019,20190111,3,4.29,"Honestly, I don't know if they changed their menu or if I was just oblivious to what we ordered the first time I came, but I could barely find anything I wanted to try when I came this past week.I made a reservation for dinner Thursday the same day and was seated right away when we got to the restaurant. The restaurant had very dimmed lighting and it was very loud to the point where I couldn't hear what the person across from the table was saying.We ordered the bread and butter, the rock fish, the beef short rib, and the chu....(something) which was a mix of sausage, pork belly, turkey leg, other meat, and beans.The bread and butter was the best thing on the menu in my opinion. But then again you're paying $8 for an appetizer that other restaurants provide for free.The rock fish was good, but my group was saying how the sauce was too salty, so they just picked at the fish and the mushrooms. The beef short rib was pretty good. The meat ripped off easily and it just tasted like pulled pork cooked in tomato sauce. The mix of meats and beans was just okay. My favorite was the spicy sausages in the mix, but it was too rich.I think this place is better for brunch. Also, valet parking is $8 during brunch and $10 for dinner. There's metered parking, but it can be difficult to find."
1/13/2019,20190113,4,4.28,"Food: 4/5Service: 5/5My boyfriend took me here for my birthday a while back and I almost forgot to review it so here goes! We got there around 1:30 pm ish and the line was out the door. The wait wasn't too bad though! This is the kind of restaurant where you order and pay, then your food comes to you! We ordered the regular breakfast and the kimchi fried rice! The regular breakfast was pretty great in terms of flavor. The portion was huge!! My favorite was the fatty slab of bacon it comes with! The baguette and jam was great as well (the bread was kinda rock hard though..) As for the kimchi fried rice, I would personally skip it.. It was good, not great. The portion was so so so small in comparison to the regular breakfast. The flavors didn't resemble authentic kimchi fried rice either. So my advice is to just stick to breakfast and brunch items..(^:The service was overall good, nothing out of the ordinary though. Parking is street parking!The ambiance inside is so pretty, very picturesque."
1/14/2019,20190114,5,4.29,"With so many reviews, this place is probably bookmarked on everyone's yelp account. Everything at this place was delicious. From the fried chicken and waffles to the cinnamon roll pastries. Don't be intimidated by the line. It moves! You order first then find a place to sit. I went on a Sunday morning (11ish) and it was crowded but the line did move. I waited in line for about 25 minutes. I didn't struggle looking for a place to sit because I sat at the bar. If you're going with a group bigger than 4 it might be a little difficult to find a table. Cheers!"
1/15/2019,20190115,5,4.3,"This is for dinner, but we went on a Tuesday 6PM and there was hardly anyone seated. We were immediately greeted and put at a table by the window. We had an amazing, engaging server who gladly helped us through the menu.Everything was more expensive than I thought, but it all turned out to be well worth it. The quality and the experience is like nothing else and I think it has been one of my favorite dining experiences in a long time.The potato and leek beignets come as 6 little potato puffs on a plate, and the mustard sauce goes amazingly well with the creamy little bites. ($12)The charcuterie board ($26) took me by surprise. The sausages were alright, but the pate was so smooth and delicious. Aside from the also delicious salami and prosciutto, the butter shockingly stood out as a star spread on the baguette (they gave us another half baguette when we finished our first). The cauliflower dish was amazing. The dates are so richly sweet and pair so well with the crunch of the peanuts and saltiness of the cauliflower. The yogurt dressing adds a creamy factor as well ($15).Then the duck breast. Well cooked, creamy, fatty, and it sat in a delicious sauce with sweet potatoes. ($36)This is definitely a nice dinner out. A splurge for sure, but a nice meal with great quality. I hope to go for brunch one day!"
1/15/2019,20190115,3,4.28,"I've been here three times now (each time because a friend has wanted to come for the famous ambience) and I really don't get the hype. Food does not match up to the price. Over my three visits here, I've had the shakshuka, pork adobo fried rice, cubano sandwich, and california breakfast. I'm a big fan of tomato sauce but the shakshuka was too sour for my taste. The pork adobo fried rice was good but nothing special. Cubano sandwich was good - the meats were juicy and perfectly seasoned with a good crust. California breakfast included one of the worst avocado toasts I've ever tried. You can't smear pure avocado on a piece of bread, sprinkle on some radishes, cucumbers, and sprouts, NOT season it, and expect it to be good. The grains bowl and seasonal fruit that also were included were both unappetizing. The fruit was bruised and sour."
1/21/2019,20190121,3,4.27,"Honestly, I feel like this place is overhyped and overpriced. If you don't want to wait for too long, reservations are a must. Also, finding street parking near this restaurant is a struggle. They offer valet parking, but it's a bit pricey. The food is delicious, but it's a bit overpriced. PS: They charge a 4% service fee."
1/24/2019,20190124,5,4.28,"I have been wanting to try République for quite sometime and the wait was well worth it. My fiancé and I came here for lunch hour on a regular weekday and happened to beat the line that was forming around 12:30. We stood in line for about 5 minutes the most which sold us to the pastries that were on the counter. By the time we were seated, we ordered a good 4 pastries alongside with our main dishes. Everything was delicious! Most importantly my lobster omelette was made to perfection! I will definitely come back!"
2/1/2019,20190201,4,4.28,"Went here today for lunch at around 11:30am. Line wasn't too long, took around 10-15 mins for us to order and another ~15 mins for food. All the food was good, some better than expected. Croque Madame (5/5) - Very flavorful while not being overly salty. Had a unique flavor to it, was surprised. Definitely recommend getting this. Kimchi Fried Rice (3/5) - Good, but still think you could get better or just as good at a Korean restaurant. Grilled Chicken Salad (5/5) - Awesome salad. The caramelized walnuts were a nice touch. I also ordered a creme brûlée thing to go. It wasn't too bad but probably better feesh"
2/7/2019,20190207,5,4.28,"Truly love Republique. This is a regular breakfast spot for me. Not brunch but breakfast because honestly, if you try to go for brunch, you will be waiting in an extremely long line. I've faced it though - the ridiculously long line, the medium line, the short line, and no wait at all. I will gladly do this for Republique because it is such a gem. To avoid the wait, I think it's totally worth going right when they open, maybe before work. Since it's early in the morning, the vibe is very easygoing and it's an excellent way to start the day. I have tried the Croque Madame and Regular Breakfast. The Croque Madame is so flippin good, so damn rich, and so cheesy. It's a little overwhelming how rich it is but definitely worth a try. It's one of their best dishes. It comes with a side salad to balance out all that savory goodness. At first, I thought the Regular Breakfast was such a basic move to get but it's one of my favorites on the menu. Their scrambled eggs are soft, the bacon is thick and flavorful, and the jam goes so well on the baguette toast they provide. It's large and hearty and does the job. If you're in the mood for the pastries, then those are SO worth it as well."
2/15/2019,20190215,4,4.28,"Wondering if the food was worth the price and wait. Still contemplating.. this is why the 4 versus 5. Seems like hype is higher than anything else. The wait was longer after we got in on a Friday afternoon on a 3-day weekend. (Monday was a holiday)The food and drinks were good but I don't know if the price matched it. The California breakfast- avocado toast (pictured) came with other things but was it worth the $18? I think it could have been a little cheaper. Same thing with the Pupusa that was $18. The display was also beautiful and came fairly quickly. We drank the Bloody Mary and house V&T. Again- worth $15 each? I don't know. I will give credit to the atmosphere and food display. If you're okay with price, go for it.. but I'd say you can skip it and find somewhere else."
2/16/2019,20190216,5,4.29,"Wow. I absolutely love this place. At first I was under the assumption that this place will be overhyped and I would be disappointed, but that was the complete opposite. I came here during the breakfast/brunch hours during the weekday. The way it works is that you take the menu as you walk through the door facing all those delicious pastries and figure out what you want, order, take your number on a cup and sit down anywhere you want under this French modern-like interior. The service kind of seems all-over the place but it's a pretty busy spot and they were as attentive as they could be for my request for water. I ordered the Austrian pancake and the kimchi fried rice. I really absolutely loved the Austrian pancake because it was so fluffy and the blueberries were baked right in. The pancake actually reminded me a little of bread pudding, which I loved. The kimchi fried rice was pretty good, it was a nice surprise to see a beautifully runny yolk inside the rice! It reminded me of when I was younger and my m would put tomato paste in her own fried rice. It's really tasty, but also on the saltier side. Still, a wonderful place to come and have a great meal!"
2/17/2019,20190217,4,4.28,"My first time here! I came to République for dinner to celebrate my late birthday with my girlfriend. We ordered a few dishes but I wasn't blown away by the food. The atmosphere was romantic with the lights dimmed but the tables are pretty close together. We had reservations and we were seating pretty quickly. We ordered...Octopus salad: I honestly really liked this salad! It was very refreshing. The dressing was citrusy and the octopus was cooked just right. This salad reminded me of a Vietnamese salad that my mom makes! Brussels sprouts: It wasn't the best plate of brussels sprouts that I've had but it still was good. I tend to like my brussels sprouts more on the crispy side but this dish was more on the soft side than crispy. I wasn't a big fan of the egg in my Brussels sprouts. Ribeye cap: My favorite dish of the night. The meat was cooked perfectly with lots of flavor. It was paired with some roasted veggies. I would definitely order this dish again! Dover Sole: My friend ordered this dish and she really enjoyed it. It was a whole fish that was served with a buttery sauce and puréed potatoes. The puréed potatoes was yummy! I'm not sure if I would order this again.. I thought it was quite pricey for what it is. Overall, great place to go on a first date or maybe an anniversary but expect to pay $$$. I would probably come back to try the breakfast/brunch."
2/18/2019,20190218,5,4.29,"Don't expect to waltz right in without a reservation for dinner (pretty much any night), République is tremendously popular and quite busy, even past their 10pm closing time on Sunday night. Where to celebrate Valentine's Day a few days afterwards? How about a restaurant with an exciting menu, gorgeous setting and broad wine list- yep, this place. I used the reservation service available through Yelp and discovered that the original plan to eat between 5:30 and 7pm wasn't remotely possible. The only remaining options were 9:15 or 9:30, their last seating times. I should have planned farther in advance but it worked out well. It was cold outside, street parking was next to zero except for a few blocks away, valet appeared full and we were hungry! Walking in a hostess greeted us then we sat (arrived a half-hour early) on the bench available and watched the activities. It was loud and crowded! Finally our turn came and we found ourselves in the bar section in a deuce by the window. Although seating is tight between tables we enjoyed open space on one side and looked over the menu. Thinking of multiple courses to share, we had already studied the varieties of oysters available in the pantry area, also displayed there were a great variety of imported and artisanal cheeses. The daily menu also offered some intriguing possibilities for pasta, fish and meats. Ultimately, we ordered a half-dozen oysters, two glasses of red wine, an amazing 2008 Brunello that kept developing complexity as it aerated and an amazing Burgundy (Pinot Noir) that held up well to the Short Rib, Atlantic Stripped Sea Bass, Spinach Cavatelli and all the wild mushrooms contained in all three dishes. There were fresh Morels, Chanterelles, Black Chanterelles, and Porcinis. Simply marvelous! I had a hand crafted cocktail as a starter, which really hit the spot with its smoky, warming mix of tequila, mezcal and bitters (Osxacan Old Fashioned). The pasta blew us away, and although the portion was small, the multiple courses more than made up for it. Next up was the Short Rib (the fish arrived slightly out of sync) and it simply melted in the mouth. The carrots were delectable and the farro was a nice contrast with the textures of the meat and mushrooms. Finally, the fish lent a flaky and moist light touch to a meal low in carbohydrates (bread is considered a la carte) and the four potato gnocchi were for contrast to the light flavors of the Stripped Sea Bass. Desert filled me up, a traditional Brown Cake with fruit and a dollop of ice cream washed down with a flavorful double espresso. The $240 bill included a 4% Health LA amount ($8) for their full-time employees' health insurance, something that I fully support and find acceptable. All-in-all, a wonderful meal, we had a delightful server and the busers were also attentive and friendly. Looking forward to trying Brunch and another amazing dinner in the future."
2/18/2019,20190218,5,4.3,"We celebrated a friends 40th birthday here for dinner last night and all of my expectations were met, if not exceeded. We had reservation set for 6 PM and they were honored as soon as our entire party was there. While I waited for the rest of my party to show up, a very kind hostess offered me a menu and informed me that she could grab me any drink from the bar while I waited. How convenient is that?Once everyone showed up, we were guided through a fabulous dining hall and lead to the back room where we were seated. Our waitress was so kind and guided us through the menu, offering her suggestions and giving advice when we asked. We started with a round of drinks, the Celery and Meyer Lemon were a hit!We ordered the following items:Iced Oysters, half a dozen and we let our waitress pick her favorites.These were delicious and consumed pronto!Next we had the Brussels Sprouts which were delectable and the soft egg on top took it over the edge! I loved the thick pieces of bacon and the serving size was beyond generous.We then ordered a cheeseboard picking three cheeses at our waitress's suggestion. She picked one hard, one medium and one soft cheese. These were accompanied by honey, strawberry jam and several slices of the most amazing bread I've had in a while! I can't remember what the cheeses were, one of them was a Gouda which I loved.For a main entrées we decided to carb overload and picked three pastas. I ordered the Bucatini which was so creamy and loaded with black pepper, which I love. The portion was beyond generous and the bowl was licked clean. The next pasta was the Mafaldine, which was loaded with lobster and the sauce had this creamy citrus taste that I've never experienced before. This was wonderful and well worth the $43 price tag. The last pasta was the Butternut Squash Agnolotti, which were pockets of creamy butternut squash and probably the favorite of the night.We ended the night ordering the dark chocolate lava cake, which was recommended by our waitress and it was a flourless chocolate lava cake topped with ice cream and a banana Caramell sauce. This place is definitely a splurge, but you get what you pay for."
2/24/2019,20190224,5,4.3,"NOTE: This review covers a wedding dinner. As such, it may not be completely reflective of the service and or options available to traditional diners. We dined at République for over three hours. The space was inviting, the staff was attentive, and the set menu offered to our table was robust. It included: Gioia Burrata Toast; Hawaiian Kanpachi Crudo; Smoked Eel Beignets; Iced Oysters; Margarita's Baguettes; Octopus; The Garden of...Little Gems; Butternut Squash Agnolotti; Spinach Cavatelli; Organic Roasted Chicken; Beef Short Rib; Cauliflower; French Fries; Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake; Assorted Sorbet; and Caramelized White Chocolate Sabayon. Several of these offerings are pictured with this review. While everything was delicious, I would recommend--if available--the Kanpachi, Baguettes, Spinach Cavatelli, Beef Short Rib, and Caramelized White Chocolate Sabayon. While the bill was covered, the cost of dining here can be on the higher end, so be prepared. However, if you can swing it, it does make a lovely spot to celebrate a special occasion."
2/24/2019,20190224,5,4.31,"My friend recommended République to me and said I should try the French toast. It is some of the best French toast I've ever had. The pastries are also really good, I especially like the market fruit crostata. I also really appreciate that you order and pay before sitting down (at least in the morning). Haven't been there for dinner yet, but plan to do so soon. Oh and the coffee is good too and the service is great."
2/28/2019,20190228,5,4.31,"OMG. Dining in LA has been resurrected for me-and this place is the 1st pitch on a successful climb to the summit. After being drawn into a series of pastries with names foreign to name, but screaming delicious, I reached for the 1st handhold- a bostock, the ultimate French toast. My goodness. Lunch began with dessert...and you can never go wrong. Then, the Kimchi fried Rice! It was a hard decision between it and the Lobster-next time. I thought that I had reached the peak but, turning the corner and seeing the aged beef-I realized that I had reached just an oasis. Glory awaited at the table, coupled with a superb Bloody Mary."
3/2/2019,20190302,5,4.32,"This review is for dinner but I'll definitely be back to try their brunch as well! They have a different menu every night per the waiter so go in with an open mind, they have lots of options. Most seating is at communal tables and it's on the louder side with dark romantic lighting and tall ceilings. Most everything is intended to be shared.The sauce game here is so strong. We started off with delicious burrata toast which came with a pesto. Little bite sizes and they priced per bite. Followed with cauliflower which came with a sweet potato paste and a DELICIOUS lime yogurt sauce which was possibly my favorite part of the entire meal. Next we had short ribs - again the sauce on top was perfect and the ribs were incredibly tender. My friend got the duck which she shared, the sweet potato sauce was quite good and the duck was seasoned perfectly. We ended with the almond cake which was a unique taste with blood orange, tangerine, and brown butter.Warning that this place is expensive for small portions of food, but I thought it was totally worth it. As long as you come in expecting that, this place had amazing food. Our waiter was super attentive and each server explained the contents of every dish to us. Overall I was super impressed with the food quality, everything tasted great and the seasoning and sauce on everything was perfect."
3/3/2019,20190303,5,4.33,Looking for some French cuisine and atmosphere? Then try out République on La Brea for a taste of France. Everything about this place is just right and gives you the experience you are looking for when thinking French dinning. We come here at least once a month and every time it's a great experience.
3/3/2019,20190303,4,4.32,"Long line for weekend brunch but it moved pretty fast. My boyfriend and I shared the Kimchi fried rice, which was great, but I didn't really like the chicken salad (the dressing was weird). We also had the chocolate caramel cake, which had good flavor but was a bit wet. I liked my Golden juice, too. The architecture of the restaurant is cool and there are a lot of different seating options. Next time: I need to get that passionfruit meringue pie thing!!"
3/5/2019,20190305,5,4.33,"Treated my bf out for vday dinner here. I had to make reservation ahead of time because it's such a popular spot. The vibe here is different at night, we were seated at the communal table side and if felt like we were in a harry potter movie (but louder). Everything we had here was perfect, this has to be one of my favorite restaurants in LA, up there with Bestia. - Eclairs: I'll literally order anything with duck liver in it, AND this was topped with black truffle. Must order.- Big Eye Tuna Tartare: the tuna was super fresh, the saltiness from the caviar balanced out the tomato. It was sooo good and one bite was not enough. - Octopus Salad: the octopus was extremely tender and flavorfully grilled. The salad was very zesty and appetizing. - Bread & Butter: the best $6 butter you'll ever buy. I can literally eat the whole butter by itself but obviously it's better with their warm and fresh out of the oven baguette. - Bucatini: the cacio e pepe was so creamy, the bucatini was cooked perfectly. The ingredients are so simple but it's amazing that the flavors are just so complex. 10/10.- Beef Shortrib: It was fall off the bone tender. The mushrooms really supplement the fattiness of the meat. Overall a wonderful dining experience, it definitely broke my wallet a bit but 100% worth it. Will be back again!"
3/6/2019,20190306,4,4.33,"Apparently this is the place to be if you're brunching in the Wilshire area! If you spot a big line on La Brea, you've found Republique. The restaurant works like this: you are provided a menu in line, order at the register and receive a table number, then try and find a place for your party to be seated. Then they bring your food and beverages out to you. While you're in line deciding what to get, you'll inevitably have to stand by a display case of their delicious goodies including the honey cake which is really to die for. I was with a group of six so finding a table was a little tricky but we managed to make it work by sitting at one of the tall long tables. One of the staff even went out of their way to get us another stool so someone could sit at the head of the table. I decided on the mushroom toast for lunch which was a brown toast layered with eggs, ham, and mushrooms all drizzled with hollandaise. What I was hoping would be a lighter meal actually turned out to be pretty filling because of how much substance everything had. All of the components of the toast were spot on with the eggs being on the softer side, the ham being salt and smokey, with the mushrooms soaking up all the other flavors. I am really glad that I got the apple cinnamon sparkler drink to go with it because that helped cut through a lot of the heaviness. The sparkler was apple juice, ginger syrup and cinnamon. A really great take on what is normally a hot fall drink."
3/10/2019,20190310,4,4.32,"I've had my eye on this place for a while so was fun to finally come check out. First off it's gorgeous and much larger than I thought. The menu has a great selection of items - and I was just there for brunch so would be fun to come back for dinner. Line: There is always a line it seems BUT it did move quickly which was niceSeating: It is bigger inside than I thought and was pretty full but we found a table. It didn't seem to be too hard since there weren't a bunch of others hovering around so another proService: Women who took our order was super nice, our food came promptly and we were checked on several times to re-fill water and take away dirty dishes. In a ""seat yourself"" kind of environment that can be rare. Food: The quiche I had was heavenly - so fluffy. I also had fresh squeezed grapefruit juice which you can't beat and a latte which was yummy. The dressing on my salad was bomb.Price: A bit on the higher end. I should have taken my receipt with me as I think I might have been overcharged but that was on me to have checked so in the future I'm going to be more cautious of that. Overall, a awesome spot. Super cute inside without being snobby and I appreciate the ability to get people in and out quickly but while still providing top notch service."
3/12/2019,20190312,4,4.32,"Amazing hot spot in LABucatini pasta was my favorite, creamy in a sophisticate and complicated way! Second favorite was the Crab Pasta, like WOW. Beat all the pasta in New York. Duck Confit was NOT good though, mostly is beans. The food menu was extensive, on the contrary the cocktail menu is a bit weak with minimal choices, also very light. Among all probably the celery and grapefruit was not bad. The rest were like sweet juice."
3/13/2019,20190313,4,4.32,"Such a cool place ! Interesting and fun decor inside !Order at the counter and get it delivered to your table. Lots of community tables, but there were plenty of seats during lunch time to choose from. Excellent French onion soup and delicious grilled chicken salad. Fresh squeezed juices and smoothies. All their baked goods looked fantastic. Tried the fruit and nut bread, soooo good ! Valet parking $8 during lunch and $11 during dinner, but many metered parking spaces on the street. Liked this place a lot, definitely will be back."
3/14/2019,20190314,5,4.32,"Heard about this place being a stable in LA so of course had to check it out. Rainy weekend morning and of course still a line lol...classic LA. You order your food inside and then sit and they bring it to you afterwards. So many pastries ahead of the food you have to be careful haha. The menu looked delicious and pretty varied. I tried the Korean kimchi dish since figured it's different from regular brunch food I can find elsewhere. My friend got the dish with oats and avocado toast. Dishes on average are like 15-20$ and pastries are like 2-7$. The kimchi fried rice was delicious, had some spice to it and when you break the egg yolk and it spreads was super tasty! For dessert I tried the tres leches which was super tasty as well. Both had good portion size.The interior of the place was roomy and had lots of natural light. Not sure what the intended purpose of the space was. Would try again!"
3/14/2019,20190314,4,4.32,"I have been wanting to go to this place for the longest and I was not disappointed, I can't wait to come back. This is such a cute spot for dates or groups! I'm in love with the interior with the high ceilings and feels of bring in another county. You order upfront and choose your desserts, pay, take a number and find a seat. We were lucky when we came around 11:30 am and beat the lunch rush. TIP: if you're going with someone I suggest one person find a seat while the other waits in line to order. EATSKimchi fried rice- I was comparing this dish with the one they offer at Sqirl and this one is way better! More meat, more flavor and not one but two eggs...yes! This was super tasty and a must try. Cuban sandwich- I've never actually had a Cuban sandwich but man oh man was this the most delicious sandwich I have ever ate in a good while. Filled with rotisserie pork, ham,gruyere cheese (my fav) and the mojo sauce was AMAZING, you tasted it i every bite. The sandwich also can't along with a side of green salad. Poboy sandwich- eh it sounded enticing but this was a bit of a let down. The fried Oysters were lightly breaded but lacked any seasoning. There was tartare sauce to help out but not enough for me. The fries with the stuff were nice and crispy and seasoning was Cajun style, yum! Carrot cake- gotta have dessert the carrot cake was soft and moist with the right amount of buttercream frosting, I liked that the carrot cake contained walnut cumbs to bring in some crunch. DRANKSHouse G&T- gin and tonic, beautifully presented and they served it strong I fell in love with this place, don't miss out!"
3/16/2019,20190316,5,4.33,"Finally got a chance to go to République this afternoon. It was better than I imagined. Loved the ambience of this place. It's a beautiful place with a lot of brick and glass , high ceilings. A lot of seating space and bar area with barstools. Gets really busy so expect long lines . The good part is that the lines move very quickly and you get to order in no time. Friendly staff from the moment you walk in til you leave. The lady on the cash register was very sweet and helpful. The waiters were walking around cleaning tables and making sure you are satisfied and don't need anything. The food was amazing. I ordered a breakfast mushroom pupusas, shakshuka snd ricotta toast. All tasted heavenly. I loved the mini baguettes with butter and jam. Tastes heavenly. Can't wait to go back and have more.I also ordered a Bloody Mary and a blueberry lemon spritzer and loved both. Everything is a bit pricey but worth the taste and quality. Overall our dining experience was great and we will be visiting again very soon."
3/17/2019,20190317,4,4.32,"*Review is for brunch only, not for dinner*The most memorable parts about Republique?1. The interior. The inside is beautiful and makes me feel like I'm eating at a nice pub in Hogsmeade - high ceilings, natural lighting, community tables.2. The LINE. I've been here (or tried to) a number of times, wait on average was 45 minutes. Once on a Sunday morning, we saw the crowd and immediately went back on Yelp to look for an alternative. Never even looked back.I can't deny the food is great. I've tried their omelets and shakshuka, flavors were great although portions run on the smaller side. Coffee drinks were great too, not too acidic. Service can be improved and more attentive, but I guess I can't blame them given how busy it is weekend mornings.Street & valet parking."
3/20/2019,20190320,5,4.33,"I'm usually not a fan of overly hipsterized, IG post worthy, restaurants, but Republique was one of my favorite restaurants on LA.The line was long but went pretty quickly and service was friendly.The ricotta toast and shakshouka were my favorites. The flavor combination and texture was well thought through and delicious. I also never order gin and tonic because tonic is all sugar, but their house made G&T is a great cocktail that is flavorful, light and refreshing. The pour is also extremely generous. I'd definitely return and it's absolutely worth the hype."
3/28/2019,20190328,4,4.33,Great Place and great arrangement!!!Food was delicious. Loved to pass some time there. They had a great service. Environment and presentation of food was excellent.Hope to visit again
3/29/2019,20190329,3,4.32,"Great staff :) super efficient shortening the line; offering suggestions to a hungry soul like myself.French toast was great with crepe brûlée fillings inside; it was just sad it has no frills, not pretty enough for pictures. I was lucky early enough to find 2hr parking; I won't be back to beat the crowd nor paying for the valet. With their menu price, lots of places in LA has grand interior too, easier on the wallet, may be much more scenic & complementary parking. Just crossed out another name off my ""why the dang so many Asian girls come here List"" Dill!I'm bored, so I make a video. Not bad to waste a minute to watch it if you are bored too. instagram.com/tv/Bv5qkPv…"
3/29/2019,20190329,5,4.32,"Republique has so much hype behind it that waiting is pretty much a guarantee, so I decided to wait for the hype to die down. I waited quite awhile to come here and it's STILL pretty poppin! I came here twice within a month to try the brunch and the dinner options. Both were phenomenal experiences.BRUNCH:1) Brioche French Toast - I'm not a fan of french toast, but I definitely love the french toast here! It melts in your mouth. Holy crap, I'll definitely order this again.2) Dry-Aged Beef Burger is a simply fantastic burger with cheese, caramelized onions, special sauce. The beef was incredibly juicy. The fries were light and crispy.3) Austrian Pancake was so soft, airy, moist. Just perfection!DINNER: Every item on this dinner menu that I tried was fantastic!Mary's Organic Chicken - so juicy!Scallops - sunchokes, morel mushrooms, hazelnutsCook Ranch Pork Belly - caviar, cauliflower, bacon dashiOctopus - citrus, cabbage, pistachios, chile, limeCauliflower - sweet potato, dates, roasted peanuts, yogurt, limeBrussel Sprouts - broccoli, applewood-smoked bacon, herbs, soft eggButternut Squash Agnolotti - brown butter, parmesan, amaretto-candied almondsDESSERTS:Almond Brown Butter Cake - highly recommend.Warm Dark Chocolate Cake - hazelnut, banana caramel. It's decadent and if you're a fan of dark chocolate, you'll love it."
4/3/2019,20190403,5,4.33,"If anyone ever suggests going here, I'm always IN! This is one of the most delicious spots you can have for brunch and/or lunch in LA, notwithstanding the fact that it's the most gorgeous restaurant that makes you feel like you're in France.If you're a meat eater, don't skip out on the short rib sandwich. The dijon kick is impeccable - you'll just keep wanting more even if you're already full. Their Rocky Road Bread Pudding is to die for - and huge - so get it for the entire table for everyone to share. Even if you don't like rocky road, you'll love this bread pudding. So fresh. So good. Nomz.And of course, their french toast is the best in the entire city of LA - just beautiful, fluffy goodness. You don't even need syrup. Don't sleep on this place! The line might seem long outside but it moves super fast. Happy munching!"
4/6/2019,20190406,5,4.33,"Every time I eat here it makes me so happy- which is why I go on my birthday every year!Some complain about parking, but there's valet and street (and a lot that costs just as much as valet in the back, so, I dunno-pick your poison? ), and honestly the food is worth the hassle/wait. Cost varies depending on what you get, but IMO it's worth it overall. I love the design of the building, it is an old Charlie Chaplin filming studio, and the lighting is pretty much gorgeous wherever you're sitting. They always have lots of fresh produce sitting around the area to the right of the cash register, and sometimes they'll have something like hundreds of peaches and it smells amazing when you walk by. The building feels very lively. Today for my birthday I got the granola and yogurt, Iced coffee, and my absolute fave- Ricotta toast!! I've had the Ricotta toast roughly 4 times, and each time has been so good. They change it depending on what they get that morning so it's like a routine but also a surprise! If you're really hungry go for something heavy (like Croquet Madam). My boyfriend is Korean and we've had the Kimchi fried rice and it's just OK~. Also they were super sweet when they found out it was my birthday and gave us a little candle to light on the cakes we got."
4/11/2019,20190411,5,4.34,"So glad I tried this place! I put off trying it because I expected a super long wait. When I went there was a line a couple people out the door but it moved really quick. It is a seat yourself type of restaurant so you wait in line, order, then find a table and they will bring your food over. We ordered the chicken and waffles, chicken pot pie, brioche french toast and the creme brulee bombolini. The chicken and waffles were good, but not the best I've had. BUT the gravy that came with it was amazing!! I even ate it alone when I ran out of chicken and waffle to dip it with. The chicken pot pie was sooo good as well. The filling was thick and flavorful and the pie crust was super flaky and buttery. Tbh I used to hate chicken pot pie and this completely changed my mind. The brioche french toast was also delicious as well! It was custardy and pillow and was the perfect sweetness. The bombolini was also good but I would only get it again if it was earlier in the day since it wouldve probably tasted a million time better fresh. To top it the prices are super reasonable and was more than worth it!"
4/14/2019,20190414,4,4.33,The inside of this place is gorgeous. Probably one of the best looking places I've ever eaten in. Must've been an old church of some sort. Very high ceiling with windows up top. Exposed brick and concrete throughout. Very old rustic feel. Almost feels like you're in another country. I think the coolest part about this place was the area in which the employees were making dough and bread. Completely open for viewing. Again beautiful place. A bit overpriced but the portions are really generous. The coffee was great. Long line outside before they even opened up. Get there early.
4/21/2019,20190421,5,4.34,"Just wanted to update my review on how amazing the food is here. I ended up getting the Austrian pancake (again) along with the fried chicken and waffles and the Maine lobster omelette. I already knew the pancakes were good but man, the omelette and the chicken and waffles blew me out of the park! The omelette was so perfectly fluffy, not too cheesy, and had a really nice amount of lobster where it wasn't too overbearing. The fried chicken and waffles were soooo good! It was so tasty and delicious, one of my favs by far!"
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.34,"We had an amazing meal with excellent service- one of the top dinners of my life! I can't wait to come back and eat here again but make sure you are ready to shell out some dough since this place isn't cheap. What we ate: Duck liver eclairs- 3/5 stars. These were unexpectedly sweet and my least favorite dish of the night. I wouldn't order these again but quite a few people in my party loved them.1/2 dozen oysters 4/5- these were great but really hard to screw up a raw oyster unless your quality is off?Bread and butter 5/5- yes this is basic but all you can eat bread is a great hack at this place, even at $8. The butter was delicious but I will order the pan drippings next timeOctopus salad 4/5- really tender octopus, the vinaigrette it was served in was really light, minty and fresh. Reminded me of a papaya salad almost, loved this dish.Crab Cavatelli 4/5- This dish was delicious but at $42 the cost was excessive for less than an ounce or two of crab and some pasta so I'm knocking off a star. Caccio e Pepe 5/5- My favorite dish of this night. This was creamy, toothsome, rich and incredibly smooth and I could eat this every day for the rest of my life and die happy. I've had versions of this in Rome and dare I say it?! This version was BETTER! Aged Ribeye 5/5- WOW this is one of the best steaks I've had. It was dry aged but not overly dry as some dry aged steaks are. The meat had the most amazing flavor and I loved the sauces that came on the side. I used the fries as a vessel to deliver as much sauce as possible...to my mouth! So good- still dreaming about this dish.Warm Chocolate Cake with Banana Caramel Ice Cream 3/5- this was delicious but reminded me of a cake I've had multiple times before. I was expecting more from this dish having heard so much about the pastry chef and the quality of deserts here- Id pass on this dessert and order something more ""exotic"" next time.The server was also very attentive, our food was outstanding and we really loved the ambiance as well. I hope to come back and enjoy the dishes we weren't able to try on this visit."
5/1/2019,20190501,4,4.34,"My sister and I came here a while back but for some reason I never go to the chance to write my review for this place. It was our first time and we got to the restaurant around 9am ish and the line was out the door. We waited about maybe 30-40 minutes or so in line to order our food. While we waited, we made sure to figure out what we wanted to order. You basically go inside and you'll see a bunch of pastries then you order your food then they give you a number and you find seats. There will be servers going around and the restaurant is actually pretty spacious. They have the main dining area and then there's the back dining area which seem to be a bit more on the quiet side which I liked. The decor of the restaurant was super cute! I liked the lights that were hanging down from the ceiling! My review on the food: Maine Lobster Omelette $22: It was good but I don't think it's a dish to die for. It was a small omelette with a side of salad. It's a nice and simple menu for breakfast but I felt like I was missing something and was craving for something else along with the omelette. There was small bits of lobster mixed with the omelette. The salad was simple, it was just mixed greens (argula and some other greens) and dressing. Overall it was 3.5 stars.Green tea latte w/almond milk: I didn't want to regular milk since I'm lactose intolerant and I was asking if they had soy milk but they didn't so I went with almond milk. The cashier didn't seem to recommend the green latte with almond milk but I went with it and honestly, it wasn't bad at all. I couldn't even taste the difference lol. Friend Chicken & Waffle $21: Definitely worth it. It was creamy and the sunny side up egg on top was too good!! I got to try some from my sister and I could not resist asking for more. The pork belly was also delicious and flavorful. Overall the dish itself is 5 stars for me. Overall, we had a great time and I'd definitely would love to try something else on the menu next time I'm in town!"
5/6/2019,20190506,5,4.34,"Such a cute place! The decor and design is phenomenal. There is line out the door no matter what time you go. Came here for brunch around 8:30am on a Saturday morning. The wait not too long. They have a variety of pastries to choose from and a variety of dishes to choose for brunch. We ordered a mushroom toast and the fried chicken and waffles, which is only offered on the weekends. We also tried their oatmeal cookie, lemon poppy mini loaf, and creme brulee pastry. We also tried their cocktails: house g&t, sangria, lemon-mint spritz, and raspberry spritz. My favorite out of the bunch would be the sangria -- very refreshing for a warm la morning. Overall, I was happy with everything we ordered. Everything was delicious. Definitely will have to come back and check out their dinner menu!"
5/6/2019,20190506,5,4.35,"République is my jam for brunch! I always get the daily quiche (comes with salad) and a half and half juice (grapefruit & orange).The quiche is always so good and goes so perfect with the tangy salad.Mo has gotten the croque madam, bacon burrata, and the brioche French toast. All really good would recommend any of them.Espresso drinks are all really good as well.One downside is how busy it gets even on a Monday! But once your order the turnover is pretty quick."
5/13/2019,20190513,4,4.35,"Republique. I don't know how to rate you. You have excellent food, excellent environs, good service. But you made us sit in high chairs at a communal table. The latter is something I expect at a neighborhood restaurant, but they definitely don't charge neighborhood restaurant prices. It is borderline fine dining. Point is, it is at a price that is out of reach for the average person to make it a weekly visit. And to charge us that much to sit on high chairs. No ma'am.I had the quail and it was so tender and flavor. Bread is extra and we did get the bread with drippings. Very tasty. Like having a roast appetizer but with bread. I really enjoy the food. Maybe I'll come back if I feel less price conscious but it's a fun place to eat if you don't have to foot the bill."
5/14/2019,20190514,5,4.35,"Dined here last Friday night and was delighted by everything-the food, the service, and the amazing building.My husband and I were without baby for the evening and came around 9:30pm-when we're usually in bed! We were fortunate to be seated straightaway even though the restaurant was packed. Date night gods were smiling down on us. We dined until almost midnight-crazy! The decor is absolutely stunning in this old Charlie Chaplin building with a medieval flair and gorgeous accents. Almost felt like I was in Bavaria with the epic dining hall feeling. The food was beyond compare. Tiny little eclairs with duck mouse and truffle, an incredible octopus salad with pineapple, mint, and something spicy. It was truly greater than the sum of all of its parts-and it had really delicious parts. Quail (for me) was so tender, and from what I recall, his beef ribs were a delightful almost beet red color, and again, incredibly tender. To round out we had a basil panna cotta with mango sorbet, which tasted like spring. Mama even had a snap pea cocktail to go with all of this indulgence-another throwback to my pre-bebe era. The service was very friendly, and for an exquisite LA restaurant, felt very homey. Can't wait to return again and also dine here for brunch!"
5/18/2019,20190518,5,4.36,"Very unique brunch experience and phenomenal bread. First, the setting - I loved the building filled with natural sunlight, brick structure, and kitchen display. Eating at a long, wooden table felt was communal and unique. Food - highlight was the bread OMG. Do yourself a favor and order a side of bread. The honey cake and creme brûlée puff topped the meal off just right. Verdict: a bit pricy but worth the experience."
5/21/2019,20190521,4,4.35,"First off, this restaurant will teach you patience. Because it's so popular you are forced to wait in line for untold minutes just to order. So it's a good sign for the quality of food but a bad sign if you are in any kind of a hurry. When you find a seat, it's possible you might have to share a big table but we didn't have any problem on a Friday at lunchtime. I had the smoked salmon Benedict. It was good, I've had better and I've had worse. But you can tell it's quality ingredients. I wish I could remember what my companion had but I know she liked it. It's a bit on the pricey side for this kind of food. But the ambiance is nice. I'd recommend this restaurant"
5/23/2019,20190523,5,4.36,"Ahhh this place is amazing. Delicious food, cutest interior. The Okinawa latte -- oh man. So. Good. After inhaling the first cup, I had to get a second. Perfect amount of sweetness, delicious nuttiness/ earthiness to it. Love!My friends and I got a pretty good spread, and everything was delicious. We had quite possibly the best french toast we've ever had (highly recommend the Brioche French Toast). Lobster omelette with the hollandaise on the side was perfect with big chunks of lobster. Chia seed pudding was delicious and light. Coffee cake was awesome.  Presentation was so pretty -- There were flowers on our smoked salmon bagels? Overall, highly recommend this place! Will definitely have this on my mind the next time I visit LA."
5/26/2019,20190526,5,4.36,"I was dragged to this place this morning because I didn't want to go. The line is always out the door like people standing outside of Apple when a new iphone comes out. We waited for about 20 minutes outside with menus. When we first walked in, we were immediately greeted by a bakery fanatic's dream...pastries of all kinds. (See pics) I ordered a seasonal avocado and passion fruit tart which was ridiculously delicious and I also got a Nutella/banana crostata which was great. Aside from the pastries, the actual food was SO good. I got the burrata toast with a side of bacon and the French toast was perfect. The wait was worth it and I'm definitely coming back."
5/28/2019,20190528,4,4.36,"For us, it didn't live up to the hype. Food is creative but inconsistent and really pricey for most dishes. I usually don't notice that but there was some sticker shock. Duck Liver Eclairs are great and should not be missed. Wanted to love the Eggs and toast with uni but it wasn't special beyond the description. Pasta was delicious but portion was really small. I think I only complain about that because it wasn't really shareable. Short Rib dish was quite delicious but the meat was 90% fat. Really a disappointment. Some nice cocktails and an outstanding wine list. While we didn't have wine, a couple of tables around us did and the sommelier was awesome. She had great suggestions and was always near. Service was quite the stand-out here, all around. A couple of large gathering tables, so I could see this as a great spot for large(r) groups. Definitely worth a try and although I wouldn't rush there, I'd go back."
6/1/2019,20190601,1,4.34,This one in my list for a while and I check the menu The price here is acceptable I came here with my BF to check it Sat noon But really bad experience here 1st bad thing The cashier look like an Asian girl had so bad service ，All impatient shows on her face and here is too noisy and I just wanna make her heard clearly but when I order a bloody Mary ，she said no for lunch but when I took a site found someone had it 2nd bad thing maybe I have difference taste from someone esle That is too salty for me for all the things especially shakadhouka but it look different from what I wanna order Never come back again and hope they should improve their service and nobody wanna come here start a happy weekend to be tough day
6/3/2019,20190603,5,4.34,"I'm embarrassed to say that I had been to République twice before today and never ordered the food. While the almond milk lattes are fantastic, it turns out I've been depriving myself of some of the best food in LA. This time, I traded my usual latte for sangria and was not disappointed. For brunch, I got the California breakfast, which consisted of a grain bowl with hummus, avocado toast, and seasonal fruit (berries and nectarines). It was really filling, healthy, and flavorful. My companion got a pork torta that was decadent and equally delicious. This place is awesome because you get the beautiful aesthetics (I mean you're dining in a castle in LA... does it get any better?), but you don't have to sacrifice the quality of your meal. The only bad thing about eating here is trying to decide which of the many delicious things to order. No question, I'll be back soon!"
6/6/2019,20190606,5,4.35,"At first this place is a bit over whelming but just go with it!! Line was out the door AND THEN SOME. But the line went by very quickly. Open seating AFTER you see the pastries and AFTER you order your entire meal and pay. Once you've ordered and get settled all the food will come out as they finish cooking. It's a bit hard if you have a big party and want to wait for everyone but the quality of the feed is best enjoyed as soon as it's done being made. A lot of the things we ordered we simple, but it tasted amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. I'll be coming back, mark my words!!"
6/8/2019,20190608,5,4.35,"République is a highly regarded Frenchish restaurant that has breakfast service in addition to lunch and the heralded dinner service. And the breakfast service is no slouch.Breakfast is served from 8 to 3 pm, and has some overlap with lunch offerings that start at 11. I came in for the breakfast service. Near the entrance, there is a display of a range of pastries that you could select as part of breakfast or to take out. The co-owner, Margarita Manzke*, is considered to be one of the top pastry chefs in LA. (She has had a cookbook published entitled ""Baking at République: Masterful Techniques and Recipes."") Accordingly, my expectation for the quality of the pastries was quite high. I selected several pastries for take out (see annotated attached photo) and I ordered from the extensive breakfast menu that was available at the entrance, which even included kimchi fried rice. Based on photos I had viewed on Yelp, I knew I wanted to try the Brioche French toast.The French toast was as good as I ever could have imagined. The pastries I began sampling later in the day and the following day. As expected, they were outstanding, with the exception of a Creme brûlée bombolini, where I really wasn't into the room temperature creme brûlée filling.My sole regret was limiting my purchase to only four pastries.

6/10/2019,20190610,4,4.35,"This review is just for their brunch menu, because you guys know how I feel about their dinner menu from the previous review. At brunch, there will always be a line, so be prepared to wait.You order your food at the register and then you are free to find a table on your own, which is different from dinner. If you order any pastries, they give that to you at the register.I found out this visit that there was a second floor! We had a party of 5 people, so we needed to find a larger table, which we did on the second floor. The second floor seems a lot more cozy and homey from the environment and the decor.Our food came out fairly quickly. I ordered the Regular Breakfast and was really surprised at how much food came out! It comes with eggs (however you want), bacon, potato fingerlings (and a lot of it!) and a baguette with butter and jam. Their bread is really good, so I really enjoyed the baguette, as well as the whole dish!My friends ordered the smoked salmon tartine, the kimchi fried rice, shakashouka, and the smoked salmon benedict. Everything was delicious and perfect for brunch!We also had a pastry to share: the banana bread something? It was really moist and very good as well! I definitely suggest Republique for brunch if you're willing to wait in line and pay a slightly higher price."
6/11/2019,20190611,4,4.35,"I've been to this place multiple times for both lunch and dinner. The food is consistently good, wine list is EXTREMELY thorough, a bit daunting. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing, great for dates, or to treat visiting friends or family. I definitely prefer going during the day, as the light inside the space is beautiful, and the lunch/brunch options are exquisite.Watch out, this place can get pricey, especially with wine!"
6/13/2019,20190613,4,4.34,"Beautiful decor and wonderful staff! I really enjoy visiting this place for brunch or dinner, but the wait always makes it a place I'll avoid unless I'm able to go at an off time. They have an incredible selection of baked goods and some nice dishes as well. Highlights: - Ricotta Toast: I throughly enjoyed this dish as it had some tasty ingredients topped on the ricotta consisting of tomatoes, pistachios, kumquats, etc. Would definitely consider ordering this again. - Croque Madame: Pretty tasty as well and the salad definitely helps to balance some of the heaviness. I'm personally not a fan of the Kimchi Fried Rice that people rave about, don't think there's anything too special and I can definitely make the same dish for less at home. Overall pretty great experiences here and always a joy to being friends here when they visit!"
6/15/2019,20190615,5,4.35,"At 9am on Saturday, the line was already out the door. It did go by pretty fast and we were able to order within 20 mins. The pastries here are 5/5. I got the market fruit crostata, which has peaches and raspberries on it. The crust was super crispy and filled with a creamy custard-like filling, which balanced it out perfectly. I also got the smoked salmon benedict, which was a 4/5 for me. It was pretty good, but nothing to rave about. I would definitely come back for more pastries! They did win the James Beard award for it after all!"
6/15/2019,20190615,5,4.35,"I've been here over 20+ times in the past few years. The food is always great. Of course sometimes there are dishes that aren't great and some nights where service lacks, but that is with all restaurants.Overall this place keeps a very high standard on quality, food and service. All restaurants have bad nights but this place rarely has that. Highly recommended for a good time :) (I only go here for dinner, not brunch)"
6/23/2019,20190623,4,4.35,"Other than the wait, I would say the food is pretty good. I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict which was bomb! I think they put a little of Mexican sauce to it. I like it more than a crab Benedict (which they don't have).The snacks we got were walnut bar, dark chocolate bar, and pudding. Overall, were tasty. I'd come back here again :)"
6/23/2019,20190623,5,4.35,"Food is amazing, it is very busy for a reason.Definitely take yourself here if you are in LA! Fast service as well. Beware, the cappucino is very small for the price and for what I was hoping for. That is my only con. Other than that. It was great."
6/24/2019,20190624,3,4.35,"There's a lot of stuff you can do with forty dollars. Buy a couple of books. Pay your cable bill. Nearly full up your tank with gas. Or, you could go to Republique and order one main course. Now I have absolutely no problem paying for divine deliciousness, even if the portions are small. But when it's good, not great, and the portions are paltry, we got a problem. Clearly, this place doesn't need anybody's endorsement. It's hopping every day, all day with lines halfway down the block. And while I've found its brunch to be both scrumptious and reasonably priced, my recent dinner here fell far short. I went with a bunch of friends and we shared an assortment of dishes that sounded delectable. Duck liver mousse eclairs. Soft scrambled eggs topped with uni on toast. A chili lime octopus salad. And cauliflower with sweet potato hummus, spinach and chermoula. All four were good. Well cooked. Well seasoned. Well short of memorable, which is fine. But when you're charging me $20 bucks for cauliflower, I'm expecting it to blow my friggin' mind. Theirs just blew my wallet.I'd also like to point out that duck liver eclairs should taste better than they sound, and they sound like Adele on her best day. Unfortunately, these sounded far better than they tasted. After that, we had the beef short rib and spinach cavatelli. The short rib was the kind of nice that I'd liken to someone driving you to the airport. I appreciate the effort, but it hardly made my week. The beef had good flavor. Nicely cooked. But there were about six bites in total. You wanna charge me $40 for a piece of meat, cool. This is LA. Some places charge you double. Said places, however, give you a God damn side of beef with enough leftovers to last for days. My companions and I each got two good bites. Yet that was a walk in the park compared to the cavatelli. Maybe you know this, maybe not, but cavatelli is pasta. Looks like penne, only solid through the middle. However, as I said, it's pasta. $40 for flour, eggs and a pinch of salt. Yes, it was sauced with pricey mushrooms, but it wasn't drowned in them. Rather, those mushroom were sprinkled throughout the dish like one would parmesan cheese. And again, the portion was sufficient enough for each of us to get a few good bites. For $40. Just a mile away, Jon and Vinny's makes pasta that is on a whole other level of uh-mazing, and charges half as much for the privilege of devouring it.Sure sure. The atmosphere is darling. The service is terrific. But I always come for the food, and while it was fine, the only way I'll be returning is for brunch."
6/24/2019,20190624,4,4.34,"A lot of the folks I follow on Yelp in LA had reviewed this spot over the years so I had this place bookmarked for quite a while; now I know why everyone was so drawn to this place.The restaurant was beautiful with really high ceilings and lots of huge windows to bring in lots of ambient natural light. When you stand in line, you're exposed to tons of mouth-watering pastries; it really takes a lot of will power to not buy everything your eyes see.Unfortunately, they said they ran out of the thing I ordered but I later saw someone eating that same plate after I ordered. So one star off for that. But the pastries and the egg plate I had were fantastic. The place gets crowded so be forewarned. I'd say it's worth it though."
7/3/2019,20190703,5,4.35,"I had a wonderful time spending my birthday dinner here. It was my first time and I loved the whole aesthetic and layout of the restaurant. My sister and I had reservations and were sat at the quieter side of the restaurant.Food is PHENOMENAL. We ordered octopus salad, oysters, crispy soft shell crab, and charcuterie. The bread was fresh and the house made butter added a nice subtle flavor to every bite. The hamachi & nectarine in Thai curry sauce was divine - I didn't know that could blend so well together. Their menu changes everyday (and I believe it depends on what's fresh or in season) so be aware that whatever I mention here may not be available when you go. We also had a taste of every dessert served, but my favorite was the peach/nectarine crisp and the STRAWBERRY TIRAMISU! It all tied our dinner so nicely.I gotta say - parking is TOUGH. I had to valet which costs $11.50. You're lucky if you could find street parking, and a close one at that."
7/5/2019,20190705,5,4.35,"Omg this was so good!!!! I must find a way to make it back to this restaurant for brunch! Don't let the long line fool you. It only backs up because you place your order before sitting down and then they bring you your dishes once you've settled into a table. Additionally, all the super delicious pastries to peruse prior to making your order might slow you down too. But in my opinion, just order a bunch of the pastries and share them. If it looks good, get it, it will be!We started with a peach cream cheese pop tart and a slice of mango/passion fruit cream pie. The pop tart was nice and flaky with an excellent toast to the outside. If I could find pop tarts like this in the grocery, I would make sure my pantry was stocked. The cream pie was sooooo good. Kind of like floating on a gooey ribbon of passion fruit flavored cream that wraps you in a cozy blanket. Those could have been enough, but I had the French omelette with side salad and my fiancé had the Kim chi fried rice. The eggs in the omelette were perfectly prepared! Light, fluffy and super flavorful. The goat cheese and herbs were a fantastic accompaniment to those tasty eggs. The vinaigrette on the salad was also really good. Not too tart and seasoned well with shallots and herbs. The Kim chi fried rice was a super huge portion and tasted great. It was lacking in the short rib area as there were only a couple actual pieces, so that could have been a bit better, but still had a pretty authentic Kim chi flavor. We will most definitely make our way back here for a meal!"
7/10/2019,20190710,5,4.36,"Fantastic place that's good not only for dinner but also brunch on weekends. There's so much depth I could go into and so much here for food aficionados! Each entree is good enough on its own to be a part of a five course meal with standout options. The pan drippings are a rich starter option which makes table bread so much more enjoyable, the bite-size burrata toast, octopus salad makes a great in between palate cleanser and of course the oh so hearty pork chop, belly and sausage or the duck breast that is nicely seasoned. Other complements include as well as a 121 page wine book and the inside decor that makes it look like the inside of a French castle... also the excellent service that has never failed even whenGreat for groups or for an intimate table for two. Not as busy during the weekdays, come early on the weekends. Most importantly, come hungry."
7/13/2019,20190713,4,4.35,"We went with a reservation (strongly recommended especially if you go on weekends). This place is pretty loud and it's very likely that you sit closely to other customers. We waited quite long for the food, yet all the dishes look very aesthetic. I particularly liked the strawberry tiramisu and found the corn soup pretty flavorful. The kimchi fried rice was just so-so, and I'd like to have more scrambled eggs on the Eggs on toast."
7/18/2019,20190718,5,4.36,"If you've been to République, y'all already know what it is. If you haven't, tf you waiting for?? Yes it's a little pricey so if you're trying to go on a cute date this is the place to ball out at. I got the burger which is a little wet and messy ;) but amazing. The fries go off as well.I got the banana milk smoothie which you can def make at home but why go through the trouble??? And the PASTRIES oh man. If you're a bombolini head (I think I'm spelling this wrong don't judge me) like me then you will love theirs. My only complaint is their water can be a tad warm so if you're trying to quench your thirst then def have your Hydroflask ™ ready to go. Oh and the bathrooms are exquisite 5 STARS!!!"
7/18/2019,20190718,4,4.35,One of my favorite brunch places in LA. The ambiance is incredible. It really transports you to the countryside in a European country. The food is great-- highly recommend the granola. It's filling and one of the cheaper options on the menu. I've also enjoyed the Belgian Waffle (although that wasn't as filling and it was $17). The Regular Breakfast is a staple and give you a bit of everything-- very filling and definitely better than what you can get at a chain restaurant. Make sure to grab a pastry when you order-- everything is delicious. Really. The food is pretty exceptional. Tip: Get there early for weekend brunch to avoid waiting in line. Cons: The line can get long if you don't come early. Parking is rough; valet is expensive. Food is pricey.
8/2/2019,20190802,5,4.36,"This was such a cute spot. I brought my mom and cousin to have brunch here. I loved the smell of all of the desserts but I couldn't eat them (diet ). My mom has the tart and she loved it!Food: I ordered the crab omelette (super scared to try) but it was delicious! If you are looking for a healthier option I would highly recommend.My mom tried the croque madame and my cousin ordered the Belgian waffles... and of course COFFEE!Again, try the tart! They are soooo good (according to the family)Everything was great. Service was fast. Waiters were very attentive and the place was gorgeous. We had some flies here and there but let's be honest (they may have creeped in) it's hot outside and flies love being out here right now.Parking: I paid $8 for valet but if you are lucky enough you can find parking on the street since there is meters around the area."
8/5/2019,20190805,5,4.36,"Don't come here for dinner (see my original review below).Come for brunch. Come early. Come often. Come HANGRY.- Brioche French Toast, $16. Sounds exorbitant for a slice of bread, right? Trust me, you'll gladly pay it many times over, because it'll be THE BEST SLICE OF BREAD YOU'LL EVER TASTE. - Shakshuka, $17. You want a flavor bomb? You get a flavor bomb.- Kimchi Fried Rice, $21. IF ONLY ALL KFR CAME WITH SHORT RIB!- Bomboloni (rec. Crème Brûlée and Boston Creme), $3. All other doughnut holes can suck my balls (see what I did there? Uh...)Tl;dr - keto starts tomorrow T.T"
8/7/2019,20190807,5,4.37,"This was my first time here for breakfast/brunch but been here for dinner and drinks many times before. I met with a friend and ordered our food and the second we sat down we got our food, this was by far the fastest service ever. I got mimosa and cappuccino and my friend got I think Thai coffee or something like that. She got kimchi fried rice and I got croque madame which were both really good. We got some pastries too on the side too, I don't remember the names exactly but they were all so good. It's always been a great experience here."
8/9/2019,20190809,3,4.36,"Can't believe I paid $17 for an avocado toast while I have bread and an avocado tree at home, but I guess that's LA life for ya and everything about Republique screams LA. The food is solid, which makes up for the extremely overpriced and cliché menu that looks like every other restaurant in the area.The service is quick, which makes up for the long lines.I got the croque madame and California breakfast, the former being heavy af and the latter being light and healthy.Btw hey Republique, how you gonna take out the grain bowl from the California breakfast but keep it the same price lol"
8/10/2019,20190810,5,4.36,"One of the best breakfast places that I've visited in the states! Casual setting yet the food is divine! You order first, then take any seating, then they're bring your dishes to you based on your numbered cup that's given during ordering.We had the S'more Puffs, Mushroom Omelette, and Breakfast dish and none disappointed. All of their desserts and drinks look heavenly. I had the Tea Latte and chose Hong Kong Milk Tea with Almond Milk and it was delicious, too! Too bad they give so little for it though. We will definitely come back."
8/14/2019,20190814,5,4.37,"-What you need to know in a sentence: Kinda French, kinda small plates, kinda unique, but two thumbs up overall! -Ambiance in threeish words: modern rustic farmhouse.-Treated like: my water glass was never empty. Plates were cleared between every course and our waitress gave us just the right amount of attention.-Must try: octopus salad...I don't even know how to describe the flavor, you'd have to try it for yourself! Corn Anglotti-Other random tidbits: it's communal seating, so you may end up sitting right next to someone not in your party. Reservation definitely recommended."
8/17/2019,20190817,4,4.36,"My sister and I decided to get there by 8am on a Saturday morning in August. We parked around the block and walked half a mile. There was already a line outside and waited 10min or so to go inside. The row of pastries and desserts looked delicious and hard to decide to buy. We waited in line till counter person tooled our order. I picked cinnamon sugar round roll, chocolate croissant, salt caramel croissant knot, raspberry pastry. Then we paid and took our plate to sit anywhere. The decor inside is European and lots of common long tables and other tables. The server gave us a body of water and cups. The salt caramel croissant knot was flaky, buttery, and delicious. It taste better than cinnamon sugar round roll. It was nice to people watch while eating. Next time I would order brunch items. Lots of servers around the tables."
8/20/2019,20190820,5,4.37,One of my favorite brunch spots in LA! Wait isn't too bad (I've always gone there before noon) and the line moves pretty fast. We always get the Croque Madame and Regular Breakfast with some OJ and coffee. Their pastries and desserts upfront are pretty good as well! Never been disappointed with the food or service here and the interior is Instagram worthy as well :)
8/22/2019,20190822,5,4.37,"Whenever anyone visits me in LA, I bring them to Republique. It gives you the classic LA brunch vibe, with high ceilings, a brightly lit space, and a unique selection of foods that take influence from many different cultures. Recommended dishes:1. Kimchi fried rice!! (As many other reviews will tell you) - just utterly delicious and flavorful.2. Shakshouka - I love the crunchy baguette that comes with this for dipping.3. Pupusa - a good balance of beans, cheese, and comes with a fried egg About the long line.. this is inevitable and obviously not ideal. But it moves fast and it's actually nice because once you order at the counter and take a seat, your food comes out quickly. You can get coffee from the window and drink will you're waiting. You also have to pass the entire counter of pastries before you order at the register - which is an excellent business move from their standpoint because at that point you can't resist. My only complaint is the that there are three cash registers at the front and there always only seems to be one person there to take orders even when the line is out the door. Overall, I've been back multiple times and the service is always great and the food never disappoints."
8/25/2019,20190825,5,4.37,"When you walk into this place you were greeted by the counter. Stand in line and take the time to review the menu along with all the baked goods in the glass container. The line moves pretty quickly. What do you put your order in you are given a little cup with the number on it and you go find a table. The indoor space is very large and spacious. It's well decorated and let an a lot of light. The staff was very helpful if you can flag someone down to assist you with getting water, straws or ice. We ordered the adobo fried rice and the waffles and chicken. Both dishes were amazing and filling. They came out hot and delicious. Highly recommend this place. I can't wait to come back and try their desserts."
8/25/2019,20190825,3,4.37,"This was a very cute restaurant. You can valet or street park. We ended up getting lucky and found street parking. The prices here are steep, and the food was mostly just ok. We ordered Uni toastPork belly with caviar Lobster pasta Duck with duck porridge Basil ice creamComplimentary chilled corn soupThe top favorites were the Uni toast, pork belly with caviar and basil ice cream. The Uni toast was 2 for $24! And I think that is ridiculously expensive.. it was very memorable, but I don't think it was worth that much. I think that plate was worth $12 at most. The pork belly with caviar on top of a cauliflower purée was very well balanced. You get 6 pieces for a whopping $48! I think most of the costs comes from the caviar, but still... Anyways, moving on... the lobster pasta was perfectly cooked. It wasn't a heavy dish, which I liked. However, it had no wow factor or anything. The duck with duck porridge, was interesting. The duck was okay, the porridge was really good. Lots of duck flavor. And the peaches on the side were wonderful. But I felt like the duck could have been better. The flavors were just whatever when you eat the porridge with the duck. (The server told us to eat it together.) Lastly, the basil ice cream was made in house.. and it was great! The complimentary dish from the chef was chilled corn soup. The soup wasn't bad! My boyfriend wished it was hot, but I liked it cold. As for service, it was okay. It was great that my water was always filled. They folded napkins when we left the table. But the food had long gaps/waits. 5 dishes took 2.5 hours! The duck took them a solid 20 minutes! I felt like I was dining in some Michelin Star restaurant with 10 dishes missing...! Also, the waiter gave our pasta away to the people next to me. (Communal seating, felt less intimate) The poor dude next to me tried moving the pasta plate in front of me. TL:DR.. pretty dishes that costs and arm/leg. Worth it? No"
8/25/2019,20190825,5,4.37,"Came in with my fiancé. We are long distance and we tend to go all out when we get brunch together. We're both from LA and have always wanted to come to this place. I ordered the République breakfast while she ordered the Korean rice dish. We shared a latte. We also got some pastries on the side: matcha cookie and bread pudding.First off, their ingredients are some of the freshest I have ever tasted. They put together their food beautifully and it is some of the best tasting food in general that I have had. The potatoes and bacon were amazing! Im not much of a coffee person, but the latte was strong and not bitter. The portions of food aren't too large, but the dishes leave you feeling satisfied nonetheless. Prepare to wait a long time to order, and I wish you luck in finding a good seat on a Sunday. The pastries were great, I especially recommend the bread pudding: they give you enough to last a couple of days. The matcha cookie had a very subtle matcha taste (I prefer a stronger matcha), but was still good.Total: ~$80 for two. We did order a few pastries on the side, but I'd still say it was pretty pricey. I mean it was brunch after all, it's assumed we will eat another meal later on. I would recommend visiting at least once to try their great tasting food, but beyond that I would try to save money by foregoing this place every week this is more of a once every month/couple of months kind of thing."
8/26/2019,20190826,5,4.37,"BUSY and a bit on the pricier side for brunch but BEST FRENCH TOAST I have ever had!!! It was soft and warm, and inside it had like a custard-y filling? Idk what's inside but it's bomb. Highly recommended! I also had the peach lemonade which was super refreshing. This place is def worth a try!"
8/27/2019,20190827,5,4.38,"Have heard great things about this place so I was very excited to try it out and it did not disappoint!The space is gorgeous and it has history. It was actually built by Charlie Chaplin. The space has a touch of 1930's and a touch of contemporary. It is a great place to impress your friends and family.It's first come, first serve. You get in a line and order your food. Once paid, you pick your table (it's open seating).I ordered the Regular Breakfast and Kimchi Fried rice. Both were so good! It's just good quality food there. The eggs were so creamy and rich in both dishes. Highly recommend!I was thoroughly impressed with this place and it has become one of my favorites in LA."
8/30/2019,20190830,4,4.37,"I've been to République quite a few times throughout the years but have never written a review until now! I can't remember too much from the last few visits but recently I came here with my coworkers and the food was as good as I remembered it. For lunch, you order at the counter and then find a table after. It does get pretty packed but this system is efficient.This most recent time I got the avocado toast (real basic I know) but I wanted something healthy and it was actually really good. Came with a delicious chia pudding on the side. I tried my coworkers kimchi fried rice and that was good though definitely not the best I've had.Overall cute place to eat if you're looking for a brunch or dinner spot. There is valet parking available or you can try to find street parking on La Brea."
8/31/2019,20190831,5,4.38,"Why did I waited this long to come try out the famous Republique ? I have bookmarked this place for years, and was intimidated to come because of the long wait line. And it turns out coming for dinner is one of the very good choice to make. To be fair, we came here with a friend's invitation, who knows the chef. So we were treated with great care. We came on a Thursday night around 8. It wasn't as busy as I thought. We were able to get valet right the way. And saw a few street parking along the street across. And we were promptly seated. So getting in and out was a breeze. We have ordered alot of food. A tray of hors d'oeuvres - potato beignets, eclairs and egg on toast. Out of all three, I love their eclairs! The eclair pastry was so well made. The crunchy she'll with moist and flavorful smoke salmon and roe. And of course the ""egg on toast"" is delightful with the santa Barbara uni.Their baguette are freshly made daily with their french butter was amazing too. For something as simple as just bread and butter. My other flavourites are their octopus salad, live SB spot pawns, pork belly, and their Marin sun farm pork chop board. I love the herbs they use and how thin they shredded the greens in the salad, it showcased the freshness of the greens they use. The mix of cabbage, mint and basil with a bit of chilli and lime. It was simple but yet very refreshing. Pork belly- was actually the highlight of my whole entire meal! It is the toro of the land. I have never had pork so marble and so tender that melt in your mouth. Topped with caviar was just the perfect match. Live Santa Barbara spot pawns- omg. It is divine. So fresh, so moist and flavorful. With the aroma that the butter have glazed on. It was absolutely the best live shrimp I had. ( From someone that doesn't really like shrimp other than in a sushi/ sashimi way)Marin sun farm pork chop- a great center piece to the meal for at least 4 people to share. Juicy pork chop, pork belly and sausages complimentary with the perfect long beans and grilled yellow peach. Make sure you bring enough people in your party to try this dish out.Last but not least, they also have a elaborate dessert menu. The warm dark chocolate cake and the orange blossom cream puff stands out. The chocolate cake so rich and yet not overly sweet. The cream puff is split in halves conceal with fresh cream and served with their fresh pudwill berries,never had a blackberry so sweet. And of course their house special ice cream. Love their avocado , cantaloupe, strawberry and black sesame are my flavourite. Which are quite unusual. I never usually like these flavors. Paired with a their Santa yvez storm wine. A Sauvignon Blanc that was made in a late harvest style. It was just the perfect finished of the meal. It is hard not to put on a big smile with a table full of desserts! It was a glorious scene. The chef also came by to check on us to make sure everything is good. For such big and famous restaurant in town, the chef is yet super humble definitely win over my heart for dining here again. Can't wait to be back for my next visit."
9/4/2019,20190904,5,4.38,"I have been here twice so far, brunch and dinner, and both were great experience. Parking: Valet parking and street parking are availableDecor: rusty industrial design, high ceiling with sunroof and high chairs toward the entrance, cozy dark seats in the back, great ambience Service: attentive for dinner, causal for brunch where you get a number plate and they bring you the food Food: multiple open kitchens, great food options, and fresh ingredients, overall all dishes were all great, portions aren't big just FYIOverall it's a great experience and cute place for dates or friends visiting the town."
9/4/2019,20190904,4,4.38,"This place was amazing!!! When you enter, you are welcome to a display of yummy baked goods. You select your sweets then order your food and find a table.They will bring the food to your table. I had the chicken and waffles were a different twist with an egg but it was delicious!!!Shared the pancake order which consist of blueberries under the pancake. It was very light and good!Had the Vietnamese coffee which they warned me that it's not truly a Vietnamese coffee--that I agreed--wasnt the best. Not strong and not great flavor.Definitely coming back to try the sweets and other things!"
9/6/2019,20190906,5,4.38,"I had the DOVER SOLE special, as my entree the other night we dined at République. Oh. My. God. It was phenomenal. Cooked perfectly, deboned table side very professionally, at a very rapid pace, and garnished deliciously with a brown butter sauce It was divine! I say go for the DOVER SOLE if it's on the specials menu!I love République. The service is usually spot on, top level treatment. The food and dishes they prepare, are some of the finest in Los Angeles. It's fun for people watching. **ALWAYS Make a RESERVATION for BOTH the BAR and RESTAURANT, lunch or dinner. It's a well deserved, UBER popular, and extremely busy Cafe/Bakery/restaurant, that I recommend highly. One of my faves in Los Angeles, hands down."
9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.39,"AMAZING BRUNCH FOOD! I hesitated about coming here because the prices are a little expensive, but my only regret is not trying the food here sooner. My friend and I shared the mushroom toast, which we both loved. Would definitely recommend trying the toast!We also split several of the pastries -- my favorite was the tres leches cake, which had a perfect light consistency that went well with the subtle sweetness of the berries.My friend and I arrived a couple minutes before opening on a Saturday and were second in line. At 10 am there was a pretty long line out the door so I would definitely suggest coming early to avoid the wait (you order at the counter and they give you a number to bring you your food, so there is a bit of a bottleneck near the entrance)Overall had an amazing experience here and would recommend checking it out, especially for their brunch!"

9/10/2019,20190910,5,4.39,"Amazing, you have to go here! I don't give five stars very often, and I'm sure everything great about this place is already written in the five star reviews below. But let me tell you, this restaurant is a must. Any restaurant listed on the American Express card recommendations never disappoints!We were driving from Newport coast, so at first we were making excuses not to go to avoid the drive. I looked at the menu and wasn't sure if I would love it. I was wrong. Every bite was exceptional. And the ambience is wonderful. Service was excellent, and our server was able to guide us and help us choose the right dish. Everything was amazing. They gave us a complimentary soup to start, and we ordered their bread and butter, oysters, and the toast with uni. We also shared the Dover sole. For dessert, the cheesecake with figs was amazing! This is an outstanding restaurant. Would go back!!"
9/11/2019,20190911,5,4.39,"Republique is my favorite restaurant in LA. Food is great and we didn't have to wait that long to be seated. The set up my throw you off. When you walk, you can order the bakery items on display and also order food from the menu.We ordered a lot of pastries which were all delicious! I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict with jalapeño hollandaise sauce and it great. Sauce was unique and the egg was perfectly poached. If you're in LA, Republique is one of the must try restaurants!!"
9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.4,The food is pretty good. I understand why there are 5000+ reviews here. Its excellent brunch food - and of course you pay LA brunch prices. Don't be imitated by the long line - it moves pretty fast. You order on the line and then you grab any table you see open. I got the salmon tartine and the ricotta toast. Both really good. I would have loved for it to be bigger portions but its LA brunch. One of my friend got the french toast - it was really good. Kind of heavy for one person to eat though. Highlight - saw an A lister and his kids eating here. This place is good and it attracts crowds.
9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.4,"09/13/19One of my favorite places in LA... nuff said... photos attached. 11/23/18Dinner at République never disappoints I like being seated in the back or upstairs because it is quieter. They are very accommodating and service is excellent! Our server made sure he reserved the dishes that are limited and made sure we didn't over order which is something easy to do. We always start with their delicious artisan bread, French butter and Pan drippings. Definitely get the octopus salad (Asian pear, pomegranate, cabbage, pistachios, Chile, lime) and Brussels sprouts (Thai farm arugula, apples, applewood m-smoked bacon, red walnuts and piave). The combination of flavors in both of these dishes is so delicious!Channel Islands rock fish portion was smaller than I expected but still so delicious with the chanterelle mushrooms, winter peas, gnocchi and bacon. The Mafaldine was so good with the homemade pasta, large chunks of lobster and Uni. Second pasta was the Spinach Cavatelli was nice and firm with the rich buttery sauce. We finished off with the huge 32 oz platter of prime dry-aged ribeye and super yummy crispy fries. We finished off with the chocolate care and the brown butter cake and black coffee. République is still my f"
9/16/2019,20190916,5,4.4,"Wonderful and creative brunch. I had the pupusa with black beans and an egg. Surprisingly good. We also tried a couple of different pastries and loved them all.What impressed me most was what a family operation it was. Walter and Margarita where both working and their kids where even around. This speaks to the level of quality control and investment by the owners.Also, don't be scared off by the line. It moved quite quickly and it was easy to find a seat."
9/20/2019,20190920,2,4.39,"This place went so downhill compared to how it used to be.Do not get the kimchi fried rice, they completely changed it and it's absolutely disgusting. We couldn't finish it.The mushroom toast I used to love, it's not worth $20. The flavor is bland. I guess my standards for food has gone up over the years as well as this place is not what it used to be. The price is not worth what you get. The service is lackluster and they're always out of pastries. My whole group hated their food and I felt awful for hyping this place up.I don't recommend this place anymore."
9/20/2019,20190920,5,4.39,"For me, it was fantastic and five stars. I noted though that some yelpers went for 5+ and others missed the ""wow effect"". I sided with the former but it is legitimate to ask whether the restaurant's name is appropriate as the food is sooo extremely royal that ""Kingdom"" would've been the better choice ...We had a large group for a business dinner, were seated in a secluded room where the wall was formed by shelves of wine bottles: really tempting to snatch one!! Or two ...We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share. They were not only beautifully arranged but tasted wonderfully with a full and rounded aroma, perfect texture, and delightful freshness. Desserts were tempting but this time, I had to pass."
9/20/2019,20190920,5,4.4,"This place is just soooo cool!!! The atmosphere, high ceiling, glass meat fridge, beautiful architecture (built by Charlie Chaplain the 20s) delicious French cuisine, and overall ambiance- it's no surprise they won top 10 restaurants of LA. in the heart of LA, but it feels like you're the in the heart of Europe. Honestly, we've been here several time and have ordered different things on the menu, as their menu is always changing, and we have yet to try something we didn't love! Their pastas are tastier than some of the most authentic Italian spots, their meat is cooked the perfection, and the pastries are to die for! Brunch, lunch, or dinner- check this place out. You won't be disappointed."
9/22/2019,20190922,5,4.4,"Got here around 9 on a Sunday and the wait wasn't bad at all. Line moves quickly and there was seating left.The architecture is so cute. Sit at the community table in the middle and you can see them working the kitchen and rolling out fresh dough. I love the ambience and the feel of it. Brioche French Toast is an absolute must. It's a huge piece as big as your face. The inside is so soft and soaks in the creamy goodness. Perfection! Smoke Salmon Benedict is delicious! Love the jalapeño hollandaise. Not spicy at all. All the flavors go really well together. Chicken and Waffles was just ok. The waffle was a bit dry. The chicken was crunchy on the outside, but I thought the dish was lacking flavor besides the pickled fresnos. Skip it. République uses Verve coffee and has a shit ton of baked goods to entice you while you order your food and wait for it to come."
9/26/2019,20190926,4,4.4,"Cannot believe I haven't been here before, even though I've lived in OC my whole life! Came because my friend from New York wanted to try it, and I'm really glad we did. Upon arriving we were met with a line way out the door, which was initially discouraging because I was starting to get a little hangry. But the line moved pretty quickly and we were able to order in around 20 minutes.We were able to find seats counter-side. Got the chicken and waffles, matcha mochi cake, and black sesame cream puff.Chicken & waffles: 8/10Matcha Mochi Cake: 7/10 Black Sesame Cream Puff: 7/10Definitely want to come back to try the rest of their menu!"
9/27/2019,20190927,2,4.39,"This place is highly overrated. We came for dinner with a party of 6 or 7. The restaurant itself is beautiful but the food was nothing special, tiny portions and way overpriced. We paid $8 for pan drippings and stale bread. Our server instructed us to order to share but we were paying $30-$40 on average a plate and only getting a bite each. We got the stale bread and pan drippings at the end because we were still hungry. They also add a 4% charge to every check that Is retained entirely by the company which they say is to ""ensure competitive industry compensation as well as health and medical benefits"". I really can't understand how you can charge so much and give so little but can't afford to pay your employees without charging more on top of our bill. I just think republique is super overrated. Maybe their breakfast and brunch is less pretentious."
9/27/2019,20190927,5,4.39,"Love this place!If you see a long line outside the restaurant, don't worry because the line moves pretty fast. The line is because we have to order first before seated. And they have big seating area inside.I'll start with matcha mochi cake which to me was just okay. The mochi was too hard. If it was more fluffy it might be better.The adobo duck fried rice was amazing! Loved it! Even though the price was a bit high ($21) but the portion was generous and they put lots of duck meat also!The mushroom toast was the winner! It was to die for. I don't know what else I should say other than you just have to order this one! Overall, we love this place!"
9/27/2019,20190927,5,4.39,"Ordered steak frites, Belgian waffle with seasonal fruit (peaches), and a fried chicken sandwich. For dessert, ordered the salted caramel chocolate cake, and various flavors of the Bombolino. Love coming here for their desserts and pastries. Valet parking was $8.50. Go metered parking if you can. It can fill up quickly and then it will take awhile to get out. Overall experience was enjoyable, especially the food."
9/28/2019,20190928,5,4.4,"I had been wanting to come to this famous French inspired restaurant, République for what seemed like forever!! Finally had a chance to go with my bff for lunch on a weekday. We arrived around noon ish and the line wasn't out the door yet. The line extended out and onto the sidewalk area not long afterwards, though! Valet for $8 ($11.50 at dinner) or find street parking.Review the menu in line at the pastry counter, make your selections from the menu, pay at the cash register, take your number, then seat yourself at a communal table or private table. Pretty efficient system. I love the lovely ambiance. High ceilings, bright, comforting, and beautiful French decor. We ordered these to share: - Arugula salad: Arnett farms peaches, chicory, capriole farms goat cheese, hazelnuts, lemon vinaigrette. - Smoked Salmon Benedict: Pain au lait, spinach, avocado, poached eggs, jalapeño hollandaise.- Mary's Organic Roasted Chicken: Weiser family farms potatoes, black garlic, salsa verde.- Caramel Pretzel Twist pastry- Raspberry Matcha Bostock pastry Really enjoyed all of the dishes we had!! Quality, fresh ingredients and all delicious. We ordered a perfect balance of savory and sweet items. Ended the meal extremely satisfied. We had wanted to order more, but we didn't even finish what we had ordered. Feel inclined to return for dinner or lunch again to try more items on their extensive menu!! Service was excellent. Couldn't have asked for better waiters.A 4% charge is automatically added to all checks to help cover the cost of health care benefits that the restaurant offers for their full-time employees. If you want the charge removed, just let your server know. I was perfectly fine paying the extra 4% in support of the employees! Will be back again sooooon!!!"
9/29/2019,20190929,3,4.39,"Perhaps coming in with such high expectations is what ultimately let us down, but none in our party were taken with our République breakfast experience. We came just a few days before Bill Addison of the Los Angeles times published his glowing review.Ordering: Smooth on a weekday morning. The line forms along their beautiful pastry display case, and resisting a sweet treat is futile. Tip: our cashier said for any additional orders on this visit, we could proceed straight to the cash register and skip the line.Space: Gorgeous and open, with plenty of seating at communal and private tables. I hadn't been here since it was Campanile, and the charm remains.Food: The Austrian pancake was one note: sweet. Too sweet. Both my mom and I wished we had ordered something else. I was not a fan of its wet, pudding like consistency. The French omelet was fine. Not a stand out in anyway. My brother enjoyed his regular breakfast. I loved the drip coffee I ordered. Nice and strong and a good size. My favorite food item was the sweet I ordered to-go: the matcha raspberry bostock. Moist cake with a tender crumb, delectable almond flavor, earthy matcha, and sweet-tart bursts from the raspberry.Would I return? Likely only for coffee and a pastry."
10/7/2019,20191007,4,4.39,"I always wanted to try this place but was put off by the wait time. Turns out I was just playing myself the entire time since the wait for Sunday brunch for 2 wasn't bad at all! We ordered and found seats in less than 30 minutes. Kimchi Fried Rice: I wasn't sure why this dish was so popular until I tried it. The rice is saturated in a delicious savory and spicy sauce and has bits of kimchi and pieces of braised short rib that melts in your mouth. It's topped with a runny egg which I popped and mixed in with the rice. French Toast: So thick and delicious! I think ours got a little burnt at the edges but that didn't stop me from eating it. The inside is so so saturated with the liquid it's almost like bread pudding so if you're not a fan of soggy toast this might not be for you. Matcha Iced Latte: I replaced the milk and crepe with oat milk and honey and it's so good! Latte didn't lose its thickness and it wasn't too sweet. I could easily drink 2-3 of these. It's a little on the pricier side but if you're in the mood for some good brunch food or need a good spot to catch up with a friend or cute date spot , I would give this place a shot."
10/10/2019,20191010,5,4.39,"This cozy restaurant was highly recommended by other locals in the area so my group and I from out of town went here after we checked out of our lodging place about to leave LA. We arrived a little after 9AM on a Friday morning and there were about 15 people ahead of us in line. We were totally expecting this (people already warned us expect to wait 30 minutes in line) so we arrived fully aware. :)We were expecting the restaurant to be a typical sit-down restaurant but a very friendly gal in front of us in line told us the line was to actually get to the cash register to order and we seat ourselves. The inside of the restaurant looked really crowded so we were concerned there wouldn't be enough seats for the 4 of us, but luckily there were a few tables open by the time we ordered.The menu was so overwhelming! There were so many tasty items and it was hard to decide. We all agreed we would order 2 pastries and order our own breakfast entrees. We ended up getting the Coffee Cake and the Apple Cinnamon Bundt Cake. Both were DELICIOUS! The Coffee Cake also had a couple of berries (blackberries?) inside so that was a nice tart taste to the cake as well. For our entrees, I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict and my husband ordered the Breakfast Sandwich. The Benedict arrived and I was a little surprised the hollandaise sauce was green, but then I remembered reading off the menu the hollandaise was a jalapeno infused hollandaise sauce - EXCELLENT! The heat brought a really nice touch to the dish. My husband also loved his Breakfast Sandwich as well. He actually had a little trouble finishing it. :)The next time we make a trip to LA, we will definitely be coming down here for breakfast/brunch again! While I hear there is usually a line out the door, it is totally worth the wait."
10/13/2019,20191013,5,4.39,"Finally!!!! We made it to Republique for breakfast . My hubby and I arrived before the morning rush at 8:30 there was a line but it was not bad at all.We were fascinated by all the delicious pastries.We ordered 3 but easy could've ordered all of them. We got one called the twice baked pistachio croissant that was amazing!!!!!For breakfast I ordered the Pupusa and my husband ordered the adobo fried rice.Both were delicious, I wanted another Pupusa . For drinks I had a Vietnamese coffee and he had the regular brewed coffee . I wish it could have been a bigger coffer mug because both were delicious.Overall outstanding service, food can't wait to be back!"
10/14/2019,20191014,4,4.39,"This is a cute little place for brunch, but beware extremely crowded ! I came for a friends birthday brunch, although later than the rest of the party. The line was out the door to order but luckily since the group already had a table, I was able to skip the line and just order with the cashier so that was nice ! Salmon Benedict was amazing and I love the avocado sauce they use. Lemon basil cocktail was also very refreshing and pleasant tasting ! Decently priced for being in LA, would definitely come back to try their dinner menu one of these days."
10/14/2019,20191014,5,4.39,"Amazing brunch spot in LA! This place is always packed so if you are planning to have brunch on the weekend, plan ahead and be there early so the line won't be brutally long. I absolutely love the shashouka and the mushroom toast. We got so full and even though the price is definitely not cheap, it was very worth it. In addition, the decor and the atmosphere are so lovely as well."
10/16/2019,20191016,5,4.4,République has been in my bookmarks for quite some time. I was finally able to snag a reservation for dinner for 4. I recommend setting up a reservation a couple months in advance to guarantee you a table. You can park your car in the valet which is free. We were promptly seated as soon as our party was all there.Oysters(5/5): no shells found inside the oysters. Perfectly shucked. All were great. Uni soft scrambled egg toast (5/5): the uni just melted into the fluffy egg. Each bite was filled with creaminess. Big eyed tuna tartare with Imperial Kaluga caviar (5/5): tuna was finely chopped and was subtle in contrast to the light saltiness of the kaluga caviar. Very delicious.Heirloom tomatoes with buratta cheese and peaches (3/5): nothing of significance. Buratta could've been seasoned slightly better to make the dish pop.Brussels sprouts (4/5): Brussels sprouts were small but was sweet. Egg was perfectly poached. Could've skipped the bacon inside.Octopus (4/5): I'm not too fond of octopus but it wasn't too chewy. My friends seemed to really enjoy this dish.Duck Breast (5/5): duck to fat ratio was balanced. Peppercorn was aromatic and really brought it the flavors of the duck.Maine Lobster Pasta (5/5): the lemon balanced out the richness in the butter. They didn't skimp on lobster on this dish. Overall great experience. Can't wait to try this place out for brunch.
10/21/2019,20191021,3,4.39,"This was my second visit, and both experiences were just ok. The food was good, definitely worth trying, but we had a small issue with one of our friend's food not coming out for almost 30 minutes after all of ours came out. When we asked on the status of her food, they went to check on it and the lead came to let us know that it'll take literally 2 more minutes.....to which it did not and actually took 10 more minutes. We didn't want to start eating until her food came out so all of our food got cold and soggy. the way she handled it was pretty disappointing, because we were sure they forgot about the dish in which they could've just told us the truth. Other than that, I don't think any of their dish is that unique or special, but is worth trying at least once just for the experience."
10/22/2019,20191022,2,4.38,"First off let me say after my experience here me and my wife left hungry. We actually ended up eating at another restaurant on the way home. Keep in mind I'm a dude who has a small appetite. As such, portions are on the small side. You can probably tell from my tone I'm salty as I'm still hungry after spending $60 on lunch for two people.A hip and suavey décor restaurant. Order at the counter and hunt for an open table. While you're waiting to order you can drool at the pastries which you'll probably be enticed to buy. Utensils, water, are all self-serving.The food is good but portion sizes are pretty darn small. As noted above, after our meal my wife and I actually ate another meal just to fill ourselves up. Keep in mind I'm a pretty small dude and I have a small appetite. Carrot Cake - $4 - Solid - 4/5The carrot cake is solid and I'm not even a fan of carrot cake.Chicken & Waffles - $22 - Decent - 3.5/5Decent chicken & waffles. The chicken is well seasoned almost like Asian style chicken, seasoned w/ bell peppers & green onions. Moist inside too. Waffles are just alright. I hate when the waffles come out soggy (they should come out crisp and crunchy). These came out soggy.Salmon Benedict & Toast - $20 - Eh - 3/5 The salmon benedict & toast is yummy. The presentation is beautiful and the taste matches. My only gripe? The portion size is laughably small. It's literally the size of a golf ball. I could crush this meal in a bite. My pet peeve about restaurants is when they're cheap on bread / carb dishes. If you are giving me pasta or rice, just give me a mountain of it. It doesn't cost much to make and it satisfies the people who have big appetites. Don't be cheap and give me a tiny spoon of rice or a small sliver of bread.TIPS-Serving sizes are laughably small. Expect to order an extra dish per person or leave hungry like me.-Parking sucks. $8.5 parking (lunch) $13 (dinner) for valet."
10/24/2019,20191024,4,4.38,"I came here for a weekday brunch with my friend who was visiting from out of town. I've been wanting to come to Republique for awhile, and I'm so glad we decided to come here. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and has a great open air design. I enjoyed eating under the skylight. The seating her is first come, first serve. If you are unable to get a private table, you will have to sit at a communal table...which is pretty cool since the crowd is pretty young and fun and gives you a chance to peak at the food other people order. We luckily got our own table and waited for our food to be brought.We ordered the California Breakfast and Belgian Waffle. The California Breakfast was really tasty and comes with a cute small bowl of chia seed pudding. The Belgian Waffle was nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was covered in berries and was beautifully presented.We just really enjoyed the atmosphere here and I can't wait to come back to try their other breakfast items and pastries."
10/26/2019,20191026,4,4.38,"This location has been on a bookmarked list for years and I'm finally just getting around to trying it. A group of friends had planned a surprise event for a friend's birthday and this was one of the places we were scheduled to eat at. Can't disagree with that!Lines were out the door when we arrived, but it allowed us time to mull over the details before finalizing what we wanted to try. I partnered up with a friend to split a few dishes and firmed up our selections with the Ricotta Toast and Kimchi Fried Rice. Little did we know, every duo in the group also ordered the same thing, so we had three bowls.I also got the Blueberry Yuzu Soda as a refreshment since it was super hot out. The yuzu was very subtle and it tasted much more like a Blueberry soda. Sweet and not tart at all, or even citrusy.The ricotta toast was perfect. Light spread of ricotta cheese atop their artisan bread, topped with plump juicy cherries and crushed pistachios, then drizzled with honey. It was a great finish and stark contrast to the Kimchi Fried Rice.A medley of pickled veggies, beef short ribs and fried egg, the whole dish overall leaned more sour than savory. It was great, but didn't have a strong kimchi flavor profile. Loved the textures though, so that was fun in my mouth.Overall, pretty solid lunch! Seating is self-service so we were lucky to find a table that accommodate all six of us, but the momentum of the restaurant is pretty quick."
10/29/2019,20191029,5,4.38,"There's a bit of a wait for brunch but totally worthwhile! The kimchi fried rice is to die for!!!The decor is very tastefully done, love love love the ambiance, the casement windows and the whole place! It sort of reminds me of Spain and a church. I came here for dinner too and everything was delicious."
10/30/2019,20191030,5,4.38,"Totally worth the hype! I am so glad we make time to come here during a short trip to LA. We came here around 9am for brunch on Sunday and the wait to order was about 10 min - shorter than my expectation. We saw a longer line forming when we left at around 11am. We ordered the mushroom toast and kimchi fried rice. The mushroom toast is out of this world! The eggs were cooked perfectly with great texture - soft, jiggly and flavorful! All the ingredients and sauces go so well together - made it a perfect breakfast bite. The kimchi fried rice is also delicious! It doesn't really fit as a breakfast plate but who cares! For drinks, I got the elderflower cocktail and it is the perfect cocktail for brunch! Very refreshing and slightly sweetened. We also got some pastry to go for breakfast the next day - it was also very scrumptious and filling. With such an amazing brunch, I would imagine dinner to be even better - would definitely come again for dinner and try their uni dishes!"
11/3/2019,20191103,3,4.38,"It saddens me to say that this is definitely an overhyped brunch spot. You order in line, get a numbered mug, then seat yourself. When I called ahead to see the wait, as they don't take reservations for brunch, they told me the line was within the building. Not even 10 minutes later, we arrive and the line is barely within the exterior limit of the building! Luckily the wait wasn't too too bad. From what I saw, bevause you order at the register, your party size doesn't matter too much.I got the Kimchi Fried Rice and my partner got the Regular Breakfast. We both grabbed a dessert and today her got a carafe of mimosas. The carafe is supposed to hold 3 mimosas, but those must be some small mimosas! They're priced at $10/one, $20/one with a refill (2), and $30/carafe that fits three.The Kimchi Fried Rice was rather bland considering the hype it got both in the restaurant and in reviews. It was a good portoon size, but besides for the spicy aspect, the flavors were subtle and weak. The Regular Breakfast featured a very BBQ-tasting piece of bacon steak, which also had a decently big chunk of fat (which to me, isn't desirable). It's a filling plate of breakfast for sure.Desserts are a hit here! Definitely preferred my dessert over my slightly sour mimosas and my overhyped main plate. My partner picked a chocolate walnut cookie (was under $4) which is a good size but wasn't fresh for sure... I picked a slice of Basque Cheesecake ($7), which is almost a flan-style cheesecake. It was phenomenal!! Would eat that again and again.Overall, I'd select another brunch spot. Maybe they're better for dinner, but brunch was pretty much an upsetting experience."
11/4/2019,20191104,5,4.38,"Been wanting to try this place for a long time and so happy I got to try it out. Usually if you don't have a reservation, you will have to wait for a long time. My boyfriend and I got lucky. We went around 5pm and luckily a reservation was cancelled. Don't be like us and make a reservation!The food was top notch delicious and the staff members were super friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."
11/8/2019,20191108,5,4.38,"This was my first time here for breakfast/brunch but been here for dinner and drinks many times before. I met with a friend and ordered our food and the second we sat down we got our food, this was by far the fastest service ever. I got mimosa and cappuccino and my friend got I think Thai coffee or something like that. She got kimchi fried rice and I got croque madame which were both really good. We got some pastries too on the side too, I don't remember the names exactly but they were all so good. It's always been a great experience."
11/12/2019,20191112,5,4.38,"Make a reservation!!! That is tip #1. Food is amazing! Staff is super attentive to your needs and always watch your water glass if it is half empty and fills it. Each dish we ordered was pretty much handcrafted and make to perfection with presentation in mind when they bring it out (please see pictures).Sonoma duck was cooked medium-rare and was very soft and flavorful. Big Eye Tuna Tartare was amazing! You can eat it in one bite if you want or savor it and take two bites but each chew while tasting the food is definitely a dish you would want to order again. Ordered the butter and cauliflower and it was also pretty good but didn't wow me that it was different from something I have tried before.However, the Turbot fish...apparently they only have 6 per night and if you go late, you may not get it. Sauce they added was delicious and it comes with mushroom sauce and mash potato ""puree."" The fish was filetted to perfection and it was a fall off the bone entree. The waiter warned us about ordering too much that we might not finish it, or if he can help, he would make suggestions for a tasting or cater it to our liking. Overall experience was amazing and food was amazing. Just a little dark in there but I guess you can keep it intimate."
11/12/2019,20191112,4,4.38,"I still think Republique is really expensive. But I'll tell you why I think it's generally still worth it!First of all, don't be intimidated by the line. If it's a sunny day, think of it as being blessed with the opportunity to catch up with your friend for even longer! And it passes by more quickly than it looks. The line goes past the bakery case. First you got the cakes, then cookies, more bread-y pastries. Meanwhile, think of anything off the menu you want.We tried:- Mushroom toast ($19) - I wouldn't say it's worth that much. It was really delicious though, one slice of toast piled high with scrambled eggs, some prosciutto, spinach, and mushroom of course. Very delightful. But not the most remarkable.- Berry tres leches (~$7/slice) - DELICIOUS!!!! Tastes pretty similar to Porto's milk and berries cake which is probably my favorite cake in the whole world. The Republique cake comes with crumbled pistachios on top as well, and overall it is just so beautiful. And you can see the vanilla bean specks in the cream, and taste it too.- Chocolate raspberry bostock (~$4) - The worker described it as a soft cake inside (it looks all chocolate from the outside) soaked in orange syrup. LOL I wouldn't really describe it as a cake at all actually. It's more like a soft fluffy sweet bread. And the chocolate flavor isn't too intense. As a matter of fact, neither is the orange syrup. Everything is very subtle which is pretty nice. But if we knew it was more like a bread we wouldn't have ordered it. - Baguette ($0 due to a hilarious story that I will not share here) - SO YUMMY. Perfectly crisp and snappy on the outside, but springy and moist on the inside. Eating delicious bread with butter and berry jam are one of the simpler but finest joys in life. We ate these foods bathed in sunlight from the giant windows. It is truly a beautiful establishment, and you feel like you're eating in a castle in Europe. It's buzzing and lively, and it is an LA experience if I ever had one. My philosophy on brunch is that it has to be the whole package for the price. République nails it on ambience and dessert. I would love to return for more pastries, but I'll probably forgo the main menu just because you can get multiple bakery items for just one of the mains."
11/13/2019,20191113,4,4.38,"Republique is one of those must try restaurants if you're ever in LA! I have been here for both brunch and dinner, and both times, the food was delicious. Some of the highlights are the bucatini, tuna tartare, the baguette (Lol, really), octopus, and endive salad. Valet parking is $11.25 if you don't want to spend time finding street parking!"
11/14/2019,20191114,5,4.38,"Delicious! So far everything I've tried here has been really good! Their Tres Leches cake has to be one of the best on earth if I were to crave salads as much as I crave République, I would be much skinnier lol"
11/14/2019,20191114,4,4.38,"We arrived at noon on Saturday. The line looked ridiculously long but it is counter service so the wait was ~30 min. Not too bad but not awesome either. Finding a table was easy but we found ourselves across from another couple and ate our food not looking at each other. Kinda awkward.They ran out of a lot of pastries around this time. The salted caramel cake looked amazing -- the caramel just oozes out of the layers... but the person ahead of us took the last piece. Sad.We ordered the cardamom cinnamon bun, a blueberry smoothie, coffee, mushroom toast, Belgian waffle, and salmon Benedict.The cinnamon bun was ok. Nothing special. Blueberry smoothie was yummy. I LOVED the mushroom toast: it was different from anything else I've had. The salmon Benedict was on really yummy bread: very light and chewy. The Belgian waffle was good but also not anything terribly special. I was eyeing the French toast since it looked MASSIVE. Would be curious to try next time.TLDR: mushroom toast. Be prepared to drop $$$$"
11/14/2019,20191114,5,4.38,"One of the best restaurants I've been to in Los Angeles! Republique is one of those restaurants whose reputation definitely proceeds it. And I can say, without hesitation, that it is definitely warranted.My co-workers and I went to Republique for our annual dinner and we got several courses to share. Because of this, I got the opportunity to try several different dishes. They were all incredible. A highlight for me was the lamb. Can't recommend it enough.They have an amazing selection of food, as well as wines. The service is impeccable, and the atmosphere is top notch.I've also heard that they're great for lunch but I haven't had the opportunity myself.You will definitely need a reservation on most nights.The only downsides to Republique are the location (parking), and the price. Parking is tricky, they do have a valet, and there is very limited street parking.The price is exactly what you would expect, and I wouldn't say it is OVER-priced (which is why they don't lose a star) but this is an expensive restaurant. Don't get me wrong though, it's definitely worth it."
11/15/2019,20191115,5,4.39,"A long overdue review of a popular LA establishment run by Walter Manzke and his wife Margarita. Manzke has an impressive track record and operates Republique in not only a beautiful brick and wood courtyard but also a historical space in terms of LA food history. Although well known and frequented for its brunch, my friend and I came in for an early dinner on a weeknight. We were promptly seated at our reservation time at the long family style table and started off with wine recommendation. Dinner consisted of a la carte charcuterie with recommendations by the waitstaff and included an amazing hand formed mound of salted butter, mustards and olives of rich shades of green. Next we indulged in one piece of eggs on toast each and then split a plate of pasta which I believe was rabbit or short rib ragu that day. Overall beautiful place with a great menu. Will return for brunch."
11/16/2019,20191116,4,4.39,"Solid brunch spot on La Brea. I love the whole order first and find a seat after set-up. It's super quick and efficient to place an order even with a line going out the door. They not-so-sneakily place all the beautifully delicious looking bakery items in line so you can admire in anticipation--it's hard not to want to just buy everything and carb all out.As far as the brunch goes, we ordered a sopes and the french toast. The sopes is so flavorful and melts in your mouth. The french toast is so special and tasty. I was a bit disappointed that a $15+ french toast didn't came with any fruit toppings. It's a lot of bread just to eat plain, but it was still really great nevertheless. I would order it again and request a side of fruits to make it all the much better. For ""dessert,"" we ordered the banana cream pie which we eyed while waiting in line to order. It was just as good as it looked and was surprisingly not as sweet as you might assume.Overall, I loved République and can't wait to come back!"
11/20/2019,20191120,5,4.39,"Was here for brunch this past weekend! This place is kind of unique. They do not accept reservations for breakfast and lunch, however dinner reservation is accepted ! They get pretty busy in the morning. They dont wait list people. So most of your parties have to physically be present and be in line. Once you get inside, you order at the front , pay and then they will seat you at a table . They have an upstairs and downstairs section . Very spacious ! We got the French omelette . I personally think it's really good N a few of my friends got their French toast . And then my other friend got this unique dish I think it was eggs Benedict with avocado ! The presentation Was different from other Benedict's ! Price is decent and the service was great ! Will definitely come back !"
11/21/2019,20191121,4,4.39,"Came on a Sunday around 1030 for brunch. You stand in line to order and then get a table. Be prepared to have your sweetness scent overloaded by all their pastries. Breakfast Sandwich: think of a luxurious sausage egg mcmuffin and you can get a sense of what you're going to get. Comes in a brioche bun. Mushroom Toast: Mushrooms and a runny scrambled egg gives it a very umami flavor. Bread pudding: one of their most popular pastry items. Comes with a side of fresh whipped cream. They serve it to you warm. The apple and cinnamon gives it a nice touch. It's quite filling so recommend sharing it with a group.London Fog latte: good taste, but was very pricey for the size ($6 for about 4-6oz).Cremadette: French puff pastry with cream filling. Not too sweet and very airy. Only suggestion would be to have it served warm.Overall, with the food quality and ambience, I can see why it is such a popular restaurant. However, be prepared to pay about $25-30/pp.Other info: they have valet for $8.50/11.50 for lunch/dinner if you aren't able to find street parking."
11/28/2019,20191128,4,4.38,I had done my research of some of the best restaurants in LA and this was at the top. I came here with one of my friends for brunch. It's definitely a bit pricey which I was prepared for. And there was a wait as expected but the food is definitely superb. I got a cafe latte and my friend got the cafe mocha. They came out with heart latte art. I ordered the mushroom omelet. I forgot the fancy name for it but it was really good and came with mixed greens. I got the creme brulee ball for dessert and it was my favorite! Wish I got more than one! The decor is very cute in this place. Love the atmosphere.
11/30/2019,20191130,3,4.38,"Come here for the amazing bread and pastries. The almond croissants sell out by 8:30am so if you're craving one get here early. The lines in the morning for weekend brunch are also way out the door so be prepared for a long wait. The lattes are also unbelievably good. So why the 3 stars? Because I think there is too much hype around the brunch. The burger, omelette, French toast and fries (which is what I tried here) were below average in my opinion and here is why:- The potatoes are cookee in beef fat. You can taste it and in my opinion it's unnecessary - The fries are hard and tasted a bit stale - the burger meat was below average and lacked taste- the omelette was bland even though the eggs are cooked well."
12/2/2019,20191202,4,4.38,"Stopped in here with the hubs on a weeknight and there seemed to be a lot of people hanging out at the bar after work. It was packed but no lines and the host accommodated us at a communal table because we didn't have a reservation. The food was beautifully delicious albeit tiny in portion. The dinner menu is exorbitant which is why I believe there is always a line on the weekend for their much more reasonably priced brunch menu. The interior is fantastic: open, rustic, and very French."
12/4/2019,20191204,5,4.38,"Beautiful, French eatery with some of the best, fresh-baked pastries in Los Angeles!What we ordered:*Brioche French Toast ~ $16*Chia Seed Pudding~ $15*Belgian Waffle ~ $17*Ricotta Toast~ $13*Mushroom Toast ~ $19After parking at the valet (or street parking if you're lucky), you go inside this picturesque bakery and order at the counter. While you wait in line to order, you are tempted by the line of pastries behind the glass (they are a must). This place usually gets packed, so you might have wait to find a table. However, once you do, you are in awe of how beautiful the place is decorated. The food is crisp, fresh, and so savory! We have only gone for their brunch menu and we're satisfied with just that. This place is like a mini escape to Europe, it is charming and their food is delicious! Highly recommend!"
12/6/2019,20191206,5,4.38,"I have been wanting to check this place out for awhile now! We came for brunch and I was not disappointed! For brunch/lunch the restuarant has a casual/cute vibe. You order at the counter and your food is served at your table that correspond to the given number.I had orderd the kimchi fried rice ($21) and I loved every bite. It was full of flavor and had and had plenty of radishes, peppers and seeds on top for added texture. The portion was quite large and very filling! The beef short rib was very tender and had a good amount in the bowl. The poached egg was cooked perfectly and added to the bowl perfectly. I also ordered the white sangria which was light and refreshing. I tried my friends orders as well (chorizo sopes & shakshouka which were both tasty as well!!) and I would come back to try other things on the menu! The lady at the counter was so nice and accomodating and gave us suggestions to come back for dinner (making sure to get a reservation) and order the duck and some pasta! I am excited to repeat this resturaunt whether it be for brunch again or dinner in the new future!"
12/7/2019,20191207,5,4.38,Mushroom toast was AMAZING! I'm an avocado toast type a girl so this was a nice surprise. Waffles were ok. The fruit toast I didn't like so much. This place had a long line and quite a wait. I may go back for brunch if there's no line but I won't sit in line to come here.
12/14/2019,20191214,4,4.38,"I've driven past this place a million times, always wanting to stop, but seeing the line and saying nope... But this time we stopped and the line went super quickly! It was about 15 minutes to get to the register to order, walking past a pastry case of tempting treats. At the register our group ordered and then sat ourselves down at an empty table. Food came out pretty quickly and everyone's food came out together. I fully intended on getting their famous french toast but was swayed by the breakfast sandwich, which was amazingly yummy. A nice balance of eggs, cheese, sausage on an amazingly light bun. The bun held everything together until the last bite! We also got the berry tres leche cake to split, which was light, airy, and a delicate balance of sweet and tart berry. Staff were very nice and I loved that you can watch them make the bread in the back. I'll defo have to stop in again to try the french toast."
12/14/2019,20191214,5,4.39,"Fantastic! Simply such a great spot to enjoy an eclectic taste of some very ordinary ""breakfast"" dishes. I really enjoyed their food, atmosphere, friendly service and the fast moving order service at the counter. The wait was no longer than 15 minutes to put in our order. The food came out very swiftly--the mimosas were very good! The pastries on the other hand were just okay.. unless we order the ""wrong"" thing (banana nut bread and chocolate chip cookie) it wasn't anything special. The mushroom toast was very flavorful but kinda messy to eat. The chicken and waffle was WOW-tastic! I regret not getting that instead! The gravy was soo good and the waffle was perfectly crunchy and the chicken had the right amount of crisp! Overall, definitely recommend. I see myself coming here again in the coming weekends!"
12/16/2019,20191216,5,4.39,"I had been wanting to come to the famous French inspired restaurant, République for what seemed like forever!! Finally had a chance to go with my bff for lunch on a weekday. We arrived around noon ish and the line wasn't out the door yet. The line extended out and onto the sidewalk area not long afterwards, though! Valet for $8 ($11.50 at dinner) or find street parking.Review the menu in line at the pastry counter, make your selections from the menu, pay at the cash register, take your number, then seat yourself at a communal table or private table. Pretty efficient system. I love the lovely ambiance. High ceilings, bright, comforting, and beautiful decor. We ordered these to share: - Arugula salad: Arnett farms peaches, chicory, capriole farms goat cheese, hazelnuts, lemon vinaigrette. - Smoked Salmon Benedict: Pain au lait, spinach, avocado, poached eggs, jalapeño hollandaise.- Mary's Organic Roasted Chicken: Weiser family farms potatoes, black garlic, salsa verde.- Caramel Pretzel Twist pastry- Raspberry Matcha Bostock pastry Really enjoyed all of the dishes we had!! Quality, fresh ingredients and all delicious. We ordered a perfect balance of savory and sweet items. Ended the meal extremely satisfied. We had wanted to order more, but we didn't even finish what we had ordered. Feel inclined to return for dinner or lunch again to try more items on their extensive menu!! Service was excellent. Couldn't have asked for better waiters.A 4% charge is automatically added to all checks to help cover the cost of health care benefits that the restaurant offers for their full-time employees. If you want the charge removed, just let your server know. I was perfectly fine paying the extra 4% in support of the employees! Will be back again sooon!UPDATE: 12/15/19: Came for dinner and was just as impressed!!Though the restaurant was crazy packed, our servers still provided the most attentive service!! Our waitress was super sweet and sophisticated! The dinner menu is just as creative with an awesome variety! My gf and I ordered quite a few items to share:- Oysters - ICED OYSTERS* Ordered the Kumamoto, Pacific gold reserve ($4 per oyster)- RODOLPHE LE MEUNIER BUTTER Normandy, France). Amazing baguette and imported French butter! $8- HAWAIIAN KANPACHI CRUDO $27green thai curry,pomelo, peanuts*- THAO FARMS CAULIFLOWER AND BROCCOLIsweet potato hummus, chermoula, pomegranate, mint yogurt $19- BUCATINI pasta - cacio e pepe $26Al dente noodle pasta drenched in rich, creamy white sauce. Delicious!!- TARE - GLAZED BEEF SHORT RIBSshimeji, maitake and shiitake mushrooms, koshihikari rice, dash $42.One of my favorites! Short rib was sooo tender and juicy. All in all, dinner was incredible. Couldn't have asked for a more fulfilling evening!!Valet parking - $11.50 (for dinner)"
12/16/2019,20191216,4,4.39,"I had been wanting to go to this place for a while, finally dropped in on Sunday. The wait was about 30mins which you have to form in a line for. I don't think is bad for a popular restaurant. For brunch once getting ready to order you do have to find your own table, luckily I was in a group so while I order for everyone the others went to look for a table. It is loud inside, and service for items was slower than I would have like waiting for. Waiting for our coffee room 15+min after we asked a waiter (whotold us it was coming a different place than our other drinks) we told a manager and it immediately came. We ordered several items here's our take on each (sorry no pictures of the food cause we were busy eating):Pupusa - orders by tween daughter; she like it a different spin on something she eats regularly. She made one change of having her egg fried over medium instead of sunny side. She enjoyed it... it was tasty and the salsa well made. Chorizo Sopes - smaller than a normal sopes, even though you get 2 to an order. Tasty but too small for an adult unless you eat light (more like an appetizer) Fried Chicken & Waffle - we eat this regularly at different places but here it was super yummy. Chicken perfectly cooked. Gravy almost like a stew to dip your chicken in. We did ask for the eggs to be cooked over medium, but this was a well portioned plate for one and I would have it again.Had a few pastries all delicious but out of all of them the raspberry passion fruit tart and strawberry tres leches was the best.Would go back, but for dinner with reservations."
12/17/2019,20191217,4,4.39,"Came on a Thursday afternoon. The line to order was short. While you wait you can look at the menu. I suggest looking at the menu on their website beforehand if you plan to order pastries since the display is there while you're in line. I ordered the Matcha Brioche and Mushroom Toast. They give your number and you self-seat. Despite it being a Thursday, the place was still pretty crowded. The Matcha Brioche was basically a matcha cream puff with a crispy, crunchy cookie top. There was matcha powder sprinkled on top. The matcha cream was delicious, and the pastry was soft with the top giving it a crunchy texture.The Mushroom Toast was good. The hollandaise was creamy and rich. The egg was soft and fluffy. The mushrooms were amazing. Some of the cured ham was crispy, so it added a nice texture. The spinach added acidity, possibly because of the red wine sauce. A little difficult to eat since the edges of the toast are hard to cut off. Overall it was a great dish."
12/22/2019,20191222,5,4.39,"Practical Info:Arrived at 7:55 on Sunday 12/22. Second in line. Leaving at 9. Only 5 in line. Order at counter. If you want something more after you order you can skip line and go to far left cashier. Full brunch menu at 8:00 AMGave me take away coffee cups on request on way out. Great food, service, and space"
12/24/2019,20191224,4,4.39,"Fantastic food and service!Between my boyfriend and me, we shared 3 small dishes, a pasta, and a main. It was the perfect amount.Oysters: oysters are great; we had the Kumamoto (3/5), Plymouth (5/5), and sweet petite (this was the largest one! 4/5). My favorite was the Plymouth. Tuna tartare: this was my favorite dish! It was 2 pieces for $24, but it's worth it. The caviar goes along with the tuna really well. (5/5)Scallops: generous amount of raw scallops! Very light and refreshing (5/5)Spinach cavatelli: not a big fan of this one. The pasta reminds of me of sliced up green beans (way too short for my taste), and there weren't a lot of mushrooms. I don't think it was worth the $39. (2/5)Quail: delicious! Super tender and well-seasoned. It's probably the smallest portion out of all the ""mains"", since quail is a pretty small animal.. I wish there was more to it! (4.5/5)For dessert, we got this thing called the itle flotante; it was super light and tasty! It's basically a meringue with a little bit of custard. (5/5)Overall we had a great dinner and I'll definitely come back sometime."
12/25/2019,20191225,5,4.39,next time i visit LA i'm definitely coming back to this place. beautifully decorated inside and the food was amazing. definitely recommend the mushroom toast 1000%

12/31/2019,20191231,4,4.39,"- happy nye -A word about the pastries: meh + the canale's caramelized crust was on the burnt side which masked the flavors of the rum and vanilla + the custard-filled bomboloni (Italian donut) had too rough of an outer texture but I guess what do you expect from creme brûlée; at least, the custard filling wasn't overly sweet+ the pistachio and raspberry kouign amann (a multi-layered cake with layers of butter and sugar folded in) was the best, but that's not saying much considering the other two pastries were mediocre at bestDespite my surprising disappointment of the pastries, I would give 5 stars for the smoked salmon benedict!!!! *hurrah* yay for jalapeño hollandaise and pain du lait (French for milk bread). It's one of my favorite benedicts. I think the flavors of the bitter frisee and tanginess of the hollandaise worked so well together! I would eat all over again.I have to say I was easily wrapped up in the magic of the place. Demanding attention, the gothic arches were what immediately caught my eye. It reminded me of one of the entryways in Hogwarts. I loved the high ceilings, light fixtures and communal tables. The large windows let in so much light that on a sunny day, it might be a bit much; other than that, one of my favorite settings for brunch. It makes you feel like you're outside without actually being outside. I would try to come early (opens at 8am) because a long line was forming around 9:30am on a Monday; can't imagine what it's like on weekends. No table service, but food is delivered after ordering at the register. I def want to come back to try other breakfast items and maybe give the pastries a second chance ;)"
1/2/2020,20200102,4,4.39,"Great service, great food and great place.Went for breakfast after landing in LAX on a morning flight. Great place to hang out, have a chat and enjoy the food.We ordered the Regular breakfast, the smoked salmon Benedict, orange juice, espresso and a Vietnamese latte.The food taste amazing, fresh and warm we enjoyed it. The bread that came with the regular breakfast was warm and delicious with a chunk of butter spread to perfection by me.I found the potatoes in the regular breakfast was a little too salty and sour, it was a the tomatoes that was in it but it didn't really bother me, I just avoided the tomatoes.The smoked salmon Benedict was really good too.The Vietnamese latte was not what we expected, it did have enough condensed milk so we ended up not enjoying it. The bakery had some really interesting items but wasn't in a mood to try any. I found the ordering process simple and easy. The line went by fast.When I went to order an item for the second time, I was told by the cashier that I do not need to stay in line again since I've ordered before and was in the line already, that's good news.When we left the place the line was out the door on to the sidewalk.Very unique atmosphere in the restaurant as well.Overall the experience was good!Also, parking is only valet and it's $8.50 for breakfast/lunch."
1/6/2020,20200106,4,4.39,"Came here around 8:30, Saturday morning and there wasn't a wait (we were lucky). I love how the restaurant's set up! I love how the natural light shines through the restaurant, enhancing its chic rustic decor. When you enter, you're greeted by this beautiful arrangement of pastries (cookies, croissants, cakes). We were tempted to try them all, but decided to try the creme brûlée bombolini and the butter croissant. (We came here for brunch and didn't want to fill up on pastries ya feels). The croissant was mediocre but the bombolini was amazing! The rich custard topped with the perfectly caramelized sugar was glorious.. I can see why it's so popular! We also got an oat milk cappuccino and a latte and they were okay. I'd recommend getting their coffee if you need your caffeine fix.Onto the brunch entrees~Smoked salmon Benedict: 4/5- Fresh smoked salmon, a beautiful runny orange/yellow poached egg, Spinach with jalapeño hollandaise. This Benedict was pretty solid! I was surprised that the bread was a pain du lait instead of a regular English muffin, but it held the benedict together a lot better. Fried chicken waffle: 4/5 - It's pretty pricey for what it's worth but the chicken and waffle were both perfectly crunchy and crispy. The dish also came with gravy and syrup. I love how sweet+savory always wins! When all of the individual ingredients are combined, it's such a good dish! Overall, I'd definitely come back! I recently saw a baking book released by the Republique and everything looks Amazing! I want to try more of their pastries, especially their Raspberry pistachio croissant and savory tarts!"
1/8/2020,20200108,4,4.38,"Republique is a good choice for brunch in LA. We came in on Sunday mid-morning and waited for 20~30 minutes in line, so not too bad of a wait. This was my second time at Republique, as the first time was a few years ago. Food: We ordered the smoked salmon tartine, kimchi fried rice, and belgian waffle with a mimosa and orange juice. Everything tasted good, but I wish the kimchi fried rice had a different topping instead of pickled radish or used it more sparingly as kimchi is already a strong flavor. The pops of yellow color of the pickled radish looked pretty, but overpowered the dish a bit in my opinion. The perfectly cooked poached egg and deliciously tender beef short rib was a wonderful twist on the dish though. I also wish that the mimosa had orange slices in it or more garnishes in it like how it used to. Compared to my first visit, the presentation of the mimosa was a tad disappointing for the price.Service: Service was okay. You order at the front and a server brings you your food.Ambience: The architecture of the building is stunnning with history that goes back to the 1920's. It's a casual vibe for brunch.Everything tasted good overall and I would reccomend to check this place out for brunch."
1/9/2020,20200109,4,4.38,"Awesome spot to grab brunch with your friends, party of all sizes. They don't take reservations but it was a decent wait as you catch up with friends in line. You grab a menu as you enter. Order at the register, and seat yourself anywhere. There's plenty of communal tables and benches. I've tried a variety of sweet and savory dishes, and some cocktails. Great spot with a great menu, for everyone to find something they'll like."
1/11/2020,20200111,5,4.39,"Republique is always an amazing brunch or breakfast place. One of many in LA. This place gets crowded fast during the weekends, so I always suggest going early. Their service is superb. And the line goes quick. Get in line. Order. Get a number. Find a table. Done Food here is awesome, the pastries in the front are delicious depending on what you get and it changes throughout the day. My favorite dishes are:Chia seed pudding, made with almond milk and with tons of fruits and nuts. Super creamy and packed of berry flavor every bite. Korean fried rice is a nice addition to the breakfast mix. Fried rice with Kim chee and a runny egg on top . Not too spicy, friendly kick to the taste buds. Pupusa, fluffy but thick bean flat bread topped with egg and avocado. Has a strong hint of Mexican cuisine and when mixed with the egg, tastes great! Very flavorful. Service here is 5/5. Very friendly and tip top. Don't expect this to be like any other restaurantFood is a huge 5/5. Every dish is flavorful and well worth it's price."
1/11/2020,20200111,5,4.39,One of my favorite meals ever in Los Angeles. The mushroom toast was so creamy and flavorful and the chorizo sopes was delicious as well. We also got the banana chia seed smoothie. I would recommend this restaurant for the food alone. The venue was so open and loved the outdoorsy feel.
1/12/2020,20200112,5,4.39,"Have been here a few times but forgot to review. The stars are for the pastries and the decor. When you walk into this restaurant you look at a menu then pass through the pastries and then order at the register. Your given a number and then the food is brought to you. It's hard to make an entree decision when passing through the desserts. They also have a small window outside for just pastries and coffee. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, the acoustics of the place cause a bit of a loud environment. Restaurant gets pretty crowded so best get there early. Sometimes a line may form out the door. Since this restaurant is not run by waiters it can be difficult sometimes to get everything you need, so I suggest making any requests you think you may need at the register such as ketchup, salt , napkins etc. The entrees are very expensive but not worth it in my opinion, you come here for the pastries and coffee. Great place for a date or going solo dolo which I did."
1/17/2020,20200117,3,4.39,"Is the food good? oh yes! is the decor nice? oh yes! Is it overpriced? Oh yes. I had an avocado toast, a matcha latte and a small piece of cake for almost $40 and it felt like the most expensive breakfast I had in LA.I guess it is what it cost now in LA but I really felt like they were charging just for the instagramable place and to justify the massive queue outside.Maybe when I'm rich I'll go back, but there are as good of a place that deserve the same stars at this place."
1/19/2020,20200119,5,4.39,"Visiting this lovely place for years now and just, wow! So many deliciousness from morning to evening. Brunch is a delight. Order and damn pastry you little glutton."
1/20/2020,20200120,4,4.39,"Great place and great food. The latte, waffle and french toast were all fresh and tasty. However, it's too pricey with breakfast dishes ranging from $15-21. I'm rating 4 stars because I thought spending $113 plus tip was excessive for two french toasts, a waffle, latte, two OJs, bacon, three pastries and two donuts."
1/20/2020,20200120,5,4.39,"Definitely my go-to brunch place when I have friends visiting and they want me to recommend a place to them. There's usually a line when you get there, but I've never had to wait more than 20min as the line moves fairly fast and there's almost always an available table inside. The decor is gorgeous and spacious with nice lighting. Their pastries are also definitely worth trying. My favourite dishes are their mushroom toast and salmon tartine. Other than that, their adobo fried rice is really good as well. Only downside is that this place is fairly expensive so it definitely classifies as a once-in-a-while treat yourself kind of place!"
1/21/2020,20200121,3,4.38,Great ambiance but it's just way too expensive and the portions are so small. It's a really trendy place but I will not becoming here anymore. I basically paid $20 for 1 slice of avocado toast. The line is usually crazy and I don't feel like it's worth the wait.
1/21/2020,20200121,5,4.39,"such a great place for breakfast. the only drawback is that you have to wait in line.. but once your turn comes, the have way too many great things.... fantastic food"
1/22/2020,20200122,1,4.37,I have no idea why there is always a line for this place. I have had brunch twice (to make sure the first experience wasn't a fluke) and both times the food verged on uneatable. Slimy eggs overseasoned to the point where I had to wonder if they were trying to cover up spoiled food. Sure the interior is cool but for this price and this kind of wait the food should at least be okay. I've had better brunch at an iHop.The pastries and coffee are good so if your friends insist on going stick to the pastry case.
1/23/2020,20200123,5,4.38,"AMAZING BRUNCH FOOD! I hesitated about coming here because the prices are a little expensive, but my only regret is not trying the food here sooner. My friend and I shared the mushroom toast, which we both loved. Would definitely recommend trying the toast!We also split several of the pastries -- my favorite was the tres leches cake, which had a perfect light consistency that went well with the subtle sweetness of the berries.My friend and I arrived a couple minutes before opening on a Saturday and were second in line. At 10 am there was a pretty long line out the door so I would definitely suggest coming early to avoid the wait (you order at the counter and they give you a number to bring you your food, so there is a bit of a bottleneck near the entrance)Overall had an amazing experience here and would recommend checking it out, especially for their brunch!"

1/23/2020,20200123,4,4.38,"One of my favorite brunch/food places in LA! I love all their baked goods and haven't really been disappointed here yet. My favorites are the yogurt with granola and the signature chocolate cake. Both were delicious and I would highly recommend. The granola is made in house and comes with honey, fresh fruit (Grapes and berries) and the yogurt. The chocolate cake is layered with chocolate frosting and caramel - super rich so I would share if you can (but it's so good that you don't want to.)The restaurant itself is also super cute/enjoyable. It's lunchroom style (for brunch at least) so you order your food and then go sit at a table with a number and they'll bring your food out for you. I also really like that gratuity is included with the bill and that Republique treats their employees so well. The one downside to Republique is the parking (but that's also just an LA thing so nothing you can really do there.) They have valet though so you won't have to drive around the block looking for a spot."
1/24/2020,20200124,4,4.37,This is a very aesthetic restaurant! You order atthe counter and sit down. I got the California breakfast which was avocado toast and chia seed pudding. The toast was tasty and had all the fixings. My friend's chicken salad had to be returned to the kitchen though because it wasn't cooked all the way. This was the only problem but other than that the lunch was great.
1/24/2020,20200124,2,4.37,Food: not good but acceptable Vibe: love it Customer service: great I would be coming back here
1/24/2020,20200124,4,4.36,"Food was good and the layout of the restaurant is really interesting, but it was so crowded it was hard to enjoy"
1/24/2020,20200124,4,4.36,"Parking is expensive for vallet and street parking is limited. the cacio e peppe is amazing and so are the brussel sprouts. the burrata toast was so small it's not worth the money and it's weird cuz their is orange marmalade on it. The bread is also not that great. They recommend you get much more food than you actually need so don't listen to them if you're a party of two. Their gin and tonic is amazing and they also have a great pineapple drink. The interior design and ambiance is very unique and cool. The bathroom was not up kept very well, there were no seat covers left. Our dinner with drinks was $146 before tip for two girls. So if you're willing to spend the money you will have an enjoyable time. The staff is very attentive and kind."
1/25/2020,20200125,4,4.36,"THE place to go for brunch in LAWhat I ate:- Mushroom toast: Fluffy scrambled eggs, ham, savory earthy mushrooms, all piled onto toast. What's not to like? This was a great savory brunch item- Chorizo sopes: 2 sopes piled with fluffy eggs, hearty chorizo, and some radish slices, pickled onion bits, and avocado. This was super savory and delicious. Though, I am glad it came with some salsa on the side to help brighten the flavor up- Pastries: OMG that pastry display was out of this world! While waiting to put our order in, I kept staring at the different pastries and wanted to order them ALL! If you're not into ordering anything hot, the pastry display is a great way to have something with your coffeePros:- Brunch. This place is the requisite LA brunch spot, and once you've eaten there you can see why. Menu has a nice mix of savory and sweet items, all cooked to perfection- Pastry display! Seriously, I cannot emphasize how amazing it is- Staff is pretty good about keeping the line moving- It's not brunch unless there's booze- Really interesting interior. There was a large high ceilinged central room and smaller cozier rooms towards the back. Cons:- The line! I dislike that brunch is not table service; you order at the counter and find your own seat. Limits your options on where you can sit depending on how busy they are- Parking is street, so it can be hit or miss in that area. I was able to find parking a block away fairly quickly, but you may not be so lucky during peak brunch times and during the weekendWould I come again for brunch? Maybe if it was during the week and during an off time (meaning, if there is a short line and I can find parking right away)."
1/27/2020,20200127,2,4.35,"First this is such a cute hidden gem, don't get me wrong the decor is really nice... 4 stars for the Bakery side of the resto. The cake the pastries and the bread were really good! No doubt I'll be coming back here to try more of there cookies, cakes and etc... For the two orders we had which was the chicken and waffle and the breakfast plate both were $21 was really disappointed with mine... Regular Breakfast 2 stars... first because of the content and the price I paid for it. I had 2 eggs a bunch of red potatoes with spices one small thick bacon and the awesome bread that came with it and butter and jam. All of that for $21?????? Sorry nothing was special for this breakfast plate life seriously. And for the chicken and waffle and egg on top was ok nothing special as well chicken was cooked good and breaded well... I guess we didn't order what they are famous for. I heard the toast is what's really good here so i dunno.."
1/28/2020,20200128,5,4.36,"Very cute, very good, & very expensive. Walking in hers i couldn't help but drool over the pastries while making line. They look delicious. I ordered my food at the line and ordered a half sandwich, half salad, & half soup. I was hungry and indecisive. My friend had ordered the ricotta bread (very good). Their food is a 5/5. Their soup was great and I loved every minute of it. It was the potato leek soup so if you see it order it, no regrets. Also, if you're looking to impress someone that you know cute spots this is the place. I couldn't help but continue to admire their architecture. It was gorgeous and something amazing to look at while eating. It was in my bucket list for a while and I will be back. Next time, I will be coming back did their icecream it looked amazing."
1/29/2020,20200129,4,4.35,"Republique! Where to even begin. First thing, I can say without a doubt I would have NEVER suggested to come here if it wasn't for the gift card we had. I had called a week prior to make a reservation for dinner and the girl on the phone told me they were booked for the next two weeks.... and times they had were so late!! Sorry but I don't want to eat dinner at 9 pm.. anyways my bf suggested let's just go for breakfast. So on our day off we went early!! Like just opening the doors and OMG thank god we did.. when we were leaving that line was out the door and down the street. As we got there it was a little busy but the line moves fast. It's one of these order at the register, they give you a number and you fo and find a place to sit. You'll see the pictures for the menu and those prices!!! When i saw those prices I'm like yepp there goes our $100 lol. My bf said we might as well go all out and use the whole thing. That's exactly what we did! We got coffee, pastries and two breakfast plates to share. Everything was delicious but i can't justify the price sorry but i cant. Side note: I'm Salvadoreña and saw they had ""Pupusas"" looking at the fillings I'm like ""ummm ok... mushroom? Oxacan cheese?"" That's mexican cheese lol. I don't know how many they give you but $18??? I expect 18 pupusas then. I skipped ordering that because i could hear my mom yelling at me.FOOD: i ordered the omelet, nothing special just egggs and cheese and a side salad thatt was all. The bf ordred salmon Benedict which look to pretty to eat. We got a pastry with marmalade and pistachios. The selection for breads and goods are so overwhelming lol. Coffee was whatevs nothing special.SEATING: there's seating on seating in seating!! Love that there's different stations where you can see those who work there making the breads and the food. It's a two floor restaurant and very spacious. We asked for hot sauce and thought it would come in bottles but it came in a little ceramic cup? Nothing bad about it just thought it was funny. Never seen it be served like that. I might take back what I said and perhaps come back for pastries only lol. Our breakfast came out to a total of $88 and some change and we tipped $10 so now we have $1 leftover I docked it one star because pricing wise...nahh i cc'ing justify it. Also i heard dinner is like double the price. Thank God we didn't do that."
1/31/2020,20200131,5,4.36,I had a wonderful experience with great attentive service with incredible yummy food ... May 2018 I was surprised with my 3 sons whom secretly flew into town to celebrate their Mommy!!! What an Amazing Memorable Mother's Day Evening with my Boys at Republique.... Thank You for a Beautiful Memory
2/1/2020,20200201,5,4.36,"If you're there for breakfast or brunch, don't be discouraged by the line snaking around the side of the building (they don't take reservations except for dinner) as it is worth it. Once you're in the front door, you are greeted by a glass case full of scrumptious pastries and cakes. So many to choose from! Brunch today for us was smoked salmon benedict and fried chicken and waffles. Both of which were wonderful. Cocktails were well balanced. Fresh fruit juices and smoothies were on point. And the structural space was just striking! Would definitely return when I'm in LA."
2/1/2020,20200201,4,4.36,"What a phenomenal dining experience. I've had both brunch and dinner and prefer dinner. I view this place as somewhere to go for a special occasion. Ambiance 4/5The space is huge, I had no clue there even was an upstairs until we got seated here for dinner. At first, everyone in our party thought it was very strange and removed but it worked out very nice. It felt less chaotic and loud being upstairs. The upstairs dining area feels like someone's home or living room. It's cozy. Service 5/5Incredible service, no complaints. Our server was so kind, attentive and informative. We all thought she was amazing. Her cocktail suggestions were on point. Everyone has a place here from the person delivering the cocktails to the person bringing new cutlery. You can tell it is run very efficiently. We had the earliest reservation (5:30pm), I honestly find that preferable for a place like this. At 5:20 a small line formed outside but checking in was very fast and seamless. The whole restaurant is run well from start to finish.Food & Drinks 4-4.5/5 Overall, this was a great meal. There were definitely star dishes that stood out and some that were so so. The gem lettuce salad with green goddess dressing is INCREDIBLE. I did not expect to love a salad so much, we ordered 2. It was perfection. Light yet flavorful. The salmon roe croissant was delicious, tuna tartar was amazing. The dover sole mediocre. They said it would be enough for 4 people, more like 2. It was a very small portion for 4 and I found it had too much butter. Loved both of my cocktails and found the menu creative. Dessert was okay, was not that impressed with both the chocolate mousse and ice cream. Great meal when you factor everything in and would suggest for special occasions or out of town guests."
2/3/2020,20200203,3,4.35,"On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I've tired to eat but I couldn't. Many people were in the line so I should've leave and find another restaurant for eating brunch. So, I came back again for eating brunch. What makes people comes here? Let's get some pastries and food. So hungry.Interior 5/5Such a nice restaurant in La Brea. Insides were very organized even this place is really busy. Lights, ornaments, display and tiles, everything was perfect to eat brunch. I could feel all details from the designer. Comfort 2/5For the design, the comfort of the customers was drastically abandoned. You have to find your seat by yourself. It will hard to eat here if you has wheelchairs. Space between chairs were really narrow. I think I'm not gonna bring my friend here if they are over weight. Pastries 3/5Taste was okay. Nothing special, it just taste same like other pastries. Personally, Korean bakery's are better. I tried scone and tarts. It was cold. But pretty! Good to taking a photo with pastries. Food 3/5Same. Nothing special. But it is also pretty!! 'it Looks yummy'.One juice, two pastries, one dish = $60 + valet $8.50If you want to take a pretty pictures and show some fancy brunch to your follow, I would definitely recommend this place. And thanks all servers and employees. They worked like professional and taking care customers really well even all cameras and camcorders are filming them."
2/6/2020,20200206,4,4.35,"Line was out the door on Saturday (at approximately 11:30am) but do not worry as it goes by very quickly. They had three registers in the front taking brunch orders and payments while separate staff will ask if you would like anything from the baked goods display. It took about 20 minutes for our food to be brought out to our table. Once you grab your number, you will seat yourself and they will bring the food out to you. It was busy in there, but we had no problem snagging up a spot to sit. There is are common tables, bar seating, tables in the back, and high top seating along the edges. Though it was pretty loud in there, it is a bit of an echo chamber. Salmon Eggs Benedict - interesting that they served it on a (soft) baguette and not an English muffin.  Valet cost $8.50. Card is accepted. Convenient."
2/6/2020,20200206,5,4.35,"My friend recommended République to me and said I should try the French toast. It was some of the best French toast I've ever had. The pastries are also really good, I especially like the market fruit crostina (sp?). I really appreciate that you order and pay before sitting down (at least in the morning). The coffee is excellent too - fresh, hot and a generous amount in an attractive carafe. Service is also great.Overall it's the best dining experience I've ever had. You could argue it's expensive, but I'd counter that, given it's so much better than most other places, it's amazing value for money. Dinner is good too, but I'm more of a fan of the concept of breakfast..."
2/7/2020,20200207,5,4.36,Came here with my brother I in law Love the place and the foods were super amazing Can't forget the taste and the texture of the pork belly dish serve with kaluga caviar I'm definitely recommended to all my friends
2/9/2020,20200209,5,4.36,"Republique has always been a favorite of mine, and I've dined here a few times for dinner and brunch. I've never went without a reservation.A few stellar dishes from the last time I had dinner at Republique:-THE SPINACH CAVATELLI WITH MUSHROOMS: this pasta dish was phenomenal. Savory flavors and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The mushroom variety added another element of flavor and texture that paired well with the spinach pasta.-SONOMA DUCK BREAST: a stand out protein dish, it's definitely on the lighter side so you won't feel like rolling out of the restaurant after having this and a pasta dish. The duck breast was perfectly cook and the side salad was refreshing and delightful.Also, you definitely don't want to sleep on the bread and butter. The butter is flavorful and paired with flakey sea salt. Our server kept bringing us out bread so that was nice.Never disappointed but Republique!"
2/12/2020,20200212,5,4.36,"Hands down my favorite place for breakfast and brunch!! It's a must every time I make my way back to LA. It's such a simple concept but oh so delish. The space is small and limited parking but it's worth it. Come early because lines can be out the door! It's counter service so place your order, grab a number and then make your way to a table. A waiter will bring you water and silverwares within minutes. We sat outside at the little picnic tables since it was a gorgeous day out. A must have for me is the Kim chi fried rice and breakfast sandwich. This time we also added the regular breakfast! Everything was tasty! Everything we ordered came with an egg. Caged free and oh so runny. Egg porn for real!! Food presentation was very pleasing to the eye!! The rest of the girls opted for some coffee and pastries too. I didn't get to try thatt but I'm sure it's delish too. If you've never been here before! Put this on your things to do list and go!"
2/13/2020,20200213,5,4.36,"Only been here a few times for brunch with the ladies back at the beginning of its days, so it was a nice change of pace to revisit a previously well-loved spot of mine for dinner with the husband.I swear, the bread here has some magical yeast in it. so whether you order it with just the most delicious French butter or the pan drippings, you'll be reaching for the 4th-5th baguette before you realized you almost filled your belly full of the delicious bread! I know they say the entrees are for sharing here, but honestly, see one you like and order it for yourself. Why miss an opportunity for an entire entree you can moan and groan about rather than taking a bite or two since you dined with friends and wished you had more than a bite.We had the following, which was more than enough food for the 2 of us:1) Potato and leeks beignets: seriously, order these, don't overthink that they don't really resembled beignets and instead, realize that the dipping sauce the start lies on is something you want to secretly bathe in.2) THAO FARMS CAULIFLOWER & BROCCOLIsweet potato hummus, chermoula, pomegranate, mint yogurt: This is seriously a salad I can eat everyday. So many textures and flavors, definitely compliments any heavy meat entrees you're having, such as I did.3) SONOMA DUCK BREAST baby beets, pudwill farms berries, steel cut oats: oh, yes, this can be shareable with the ample amount of duck meat, but why lie, I didn't! Reminds me of the duck breasts that were so delish when I was in Paris: not oily, a hint of crisp on the skin. The accouterments with it definitely I loved it!4) SPINACH CAVATELLIchanterelle, black trumpet, morel and porcini mushrooms: Good, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's hard for pasta for make me go wow. But the husband loved it, he cleaned his plate. Done.5) FUJI APPLE TART: armagnac, essex st. comte, vanilla. This vanilla cream in this is is something that will make anyone smile once you take a bite. Just order, no questions asked."
2/16/2020,20200216,5,4.36,"This fabulous restaurant is located on South La Brea Avenue between 6th Street and Wilshire Boulevard. There is a valet parking available, but you can also try to find a metered parking on the street; however, it may take you some time to find a spot so it may be wise to use their valet to save you some time.Since their ordering line may extend outside the front door especially during busy weekend hours, you may want to check their menu while you wait on line as you would need to order & pay as soon as you arrive at their register. Once paid, you will receive a number to place on your table, and they will bring the food to you. Additionally, there are mostly communal tables with much fewer tables for smaller parties so it may be wise to have someone in your party to secure the seating while another is ordering to save time.And here are my recommendations:1. Smoked Salmon Tartine - A winning pairing of toast and salmon, you definitely want to try this one!2. Quiche - A very simple yet creamy, but you surely will not be disappointed and you will be tempted to try this item once again on your next visit as well!3. Kimchi Fried Rice - This popular Asian dish has now been transformed into a work of art!Historically, this place is located in a building originally erected in 1929 as Charlie Chaplin's offices, which were then transformed into La Brea Bakery and Campanile restaurant. Currently, you can experience several different types of tantalizing interiors (modern, medieval, and French cafe styles) depending on where you sit. Additionally, there is no rush in service so your quality time is definitely guaranteed. Either to impress your partner on a romantic date or just to have a regular meal, you certainly will be re-visiting this place again and again!"
2/17/2020,20200217,4,4.36,"I went to Republique around 12pm on a Sunday and the line was quite long, as expected. However it moved by more quickly than I expected, and we were able to order within 30-40 minutes. The interior is GORGEOUS. There are hanging lights everywhere as well as a beautiful hallway, and the large windows on the side let in so much natural light.I came in a group of 3 and we ordered 4 things to share:Kimchi Fried Rice - this is the fanciest kimchi fried rice I've ever tried. It's garnished beautifully with various veggies and sprouts, and it comes with 2 perfectly poached eggs and a generous serving of diced streak. The kimchi flavor isn't super strong here, but the other spices and garnishes make up for it. This was probably my favorite item here that we tried.Smoked Salmon Benedict - this comes on top of 2 slices of fluffy bread and is topped with lots of fresh greens. To be honest it's not the best smoked salmon benedict I've tried but I appreciated how fresh and light it tasted.Smoked salmon tartine - this is smoked salmon and cream cheese atop a slice of toast, garnished with veggies as well. While I liked the taste, I didn't think it was quite worth the price tag. There was nothing that really stood out about the dish and I didn't feel compelled to finish the whole thing.Chicken and waffles - this was really delicious! It comes with a tangy, creamy sauce on the side as well as maple syrup. It's a more elevated version of your typical chicken and waffles & I'd definitely order this again.Overall, I had a fun time at Republique but I'm not sure if I totally get the hype. While our food was tasty and beautifully presented, none of the dishes we tried were life changing per se or worth the insane line (and unreasonably expensive valet parking - $8.50!). Either way this is def a restaurant worth checking out if you've never been, but just be prepared for the crowd!"
2/17/2020,20200217,4,4.36,"Don't really need to state too much of the obvious here but this place is great. I came here on a Friday for brunch around 10:30am and there was a little line in the front. You can do the valet parking but I hate that so I chose to do 1 hour street meter parking which was easy to find less than a block away. The ordering is quick and easy where you get to stand and look at the delicious pastries they offer. I got the lobster omelet which was a perfect portion with the salad on the side. We also got the avocado toast which was very filling as it had a ton of good stuff on top of it. Ended with a chocolate croissant which was just OK. Really nice service and location, definitely want to be back for dinner!"
2/17/2020,20200217,1,4.35,"I came here for a late Valentine's Day dinner. Another overpriced overrated west LA restaurant.Few things to start off: $11.50 for valet parking. I took my chances parking my car for free on the street. The homeless people were nice enough to watch my car free of charge.The restaurant was quite noisy. Thankfully, after some manuevering my girlfriend was able to get us a quieter table in the back.Dinner was very overpriced and portions were quite small. I wish they incorporated more of the brunch menu items in the dinner menu. We had the pork belly (small portions for $40+ dollars), cheese (eek...2 swabs of cheese and 2 small crackers with honey / jam for $9, seriously?), campanella for $26, kimchee fried rice $25+. The Tiramisu was quite lacking: tasted more like they slabbed strawberries and sherbert ice cream together. The service was okay, but not outstanding. I wish I had better things to say for the restaurant, but the price cannot justify the food that was served."
2/20/2020,20200220,5,4.35,"I took a bite of the bread pudding, I died and went to heaven. This was unreal. My only regret is ordering too much goodness. Bread pudding was a lot more than I thought (not a bad thing nommmmmm). My partner and I Had the mushroom toast and chicken and waffles along side. I got egged out next time I'll order more veggies. Viet coffee is not as strong as traditional viet coffee, its a little more balanced.The line: only appears scary, I went at 1pm on Saturday I think we went past the next store when we got there but it didn't take more than 20 minutes to get in and get our order started. Even after we sat down the orders came within 15 minutes. Tip: put the table number on the edge where they can see it.The ambiance is beautiful I love the old rustic look inside, if you want light during brunch sit under the skylights or by the big window, if you're suffering from a hangover, walk further into the restaurant and it gets darker."
2/21/2020,20200221,3,4.35,"I stopped here for brunch during my brief 48 hour trip to LA. There was definitely a 15 minute wait during my Saturday visit, however the line moved along. I ordered the chorizo sopes and iced cold brew. I sat at the bar and waited for the food to arrive, which took another 10-15 minutes. The food showed up cold, however it tasted good. I'm glad I stopped by here, but I'd rather go somewhere else next time in LA."
2/21/2020,20200221,4,4.35,"Heard the world about this place and finally made my place over! I love how versatile the menu is, and even though I only tried six things, they were all very quality, so I'm confident almost everything else would be delicious as well. Though the burger was delicious, it was nothing mind blowing - I actually preferred the quiche of the day and butter + jam with toast more. The true highlight was the french toast - easily one of the best I've had in LA (and I've tried a ton). However, it's not your typical ""LA brunch french toast,"" and I honestly enjoyed the change. It's not dowsed and fried in corn flakes, but instead extremely thick - crunchy on the outside, and super moist on the inside. Very crowded inside, but nothing to complain about because everybody just wants to enjoy the good food! Def a place I want to go back to to try all the different breakfast/lunch/dinner dishes."
2/22/2020,20200222,5,4.35,"Went for Friday breakfast/brunch at around 9:30 and we were in line for about 10 or less minutes. Place was pretty much packed during this hour already. We ordered two pastries, two juices, French toast and mushroom toast. Our total was a little over $70 but it was all worth it. Yes, it was a pricey brunch for two, but it was all worth it. It was the best French toast I ever had. Crispy and soft. Juices were very fresh too. Totally recommend if you haven't tried.Quality: 5 starsTaste: 4.5 starsEnvironment: 5 starsService: 5 stars"
2/23/2020,20200223,5,4.35,"I have been here for breakfast and dinner, definitely recommend this restaurant for its ambiance and unique dishes."
2/23/2020,20200223,4,4.35,"Do not be intimidated by the line it moved quickly! The food was amazing. I got fresh pastries and the fried chicken and waffle. The dish had a nice savory flavor from the fried chicken and gravy that was paired nicely with the maple syrup. My friend ordered a smoothie, and it was just the right amount of sweet! Amazing atmosphere, parking was a little rough. Over all would come back for sure:)"
2/24/2020,20200224,5,4.35,I went here for dinner so I cannot speak to lunch or brunch service but WOW what a great meal. Such nuanced dishes and wonderfully paced meal. Cannot recommend highly enough.
2/25/2020,20200225,5,4.35,Wow!!! This place is so on point with the vibe it brings steppes in here for a quick little bit while my car was being serviced on. I always drive by this place and so glad I was able to stop by. Great selection of food to also coffee to pastry's. I got the smoked salmon and a poached egg yummy with avocado along with the chicken salad. They also do have a full on bar perfect for a day drink before heading back to work lol shhhh I didn't suggest that at all.  You should stop by it will be a treat!!
2/25/2020,20200225,3,4.35,"This place is way overpriced. Food overpriced and alcohol is even more overpriced haha lol Food is good but not worth the high price. I went for dinner last year and all I remember is nice but very pricy. I came tonight again for the family dinner. Just as what I remember, food is nice but very very pricy. 4 people paid close to $600 (including tip already) I was barely eating. All the dishes are super tiny. And they charge 4% surcharge. It says you can ask sever to remove the fee, but seriously! Who will have the guts to do that? It's like forcing you to pay extra when food is so pricy already. I was happy to dine there but I won't go back again. So many great restaurants in LA. I prefer paying reasonable price to reasonable restaurants."

2/25/2020,20200225,4,4.35,"Finally made it here, at some weird afternoon time, but still long line and it was raining... But even more sad was nothing left in baked goods window except for a cake (and lots of pies for the holidays, so yes, I'm writing this review a bit late), though not unexpected. We did end up getting a slice of cake to go though. As noted, this was a few months ago, so I remember getting the Kimchi Friend Rice and I believe the hubs got the beef burger. Both were really good from what I recall, but a bit pricey, I think in particular for the friend rice in that a slightly bigger portion would've been nice."
2/27/2020,20200227,5,4.35,"The oyster are my favorite, but their butter is to die for. Ambiance is perfect. Will go back for sure"
2/29/2020,20200229,5,4.36,"Thw coffee was absloutly amazing, and the place is so beautiful and clean"
2/29/2020,20200229,5,4.36,"Took my son here to celebrate his 18th bday. Service and food was impeccable!!! Ambiance was great. Son truly enjoyed his dinner, customer service and food made his 18th bday dinner memorable. Thank you."
3/1/2020,20200301,5,4.36,"My new favorite place to eat in Los Angeles! Leave here with empty pockets and a full tummy. It's a little pricy, but 100% worth it. It's so difficult to not want every item on the menu. If you have a sweet tooth do yourself a favor and grab a few baked treats... you won't regret it. Great place for a first date. Not intimate at all, you seat yourself and sometimes you're elbow to elbow with strangers. It's like lunchtime in elementary school again. Meet new people! Make new friends! Great energy if you sit inside or you can snag a seat outside on a nice day."
3/1/2020,20200301,5,4.36,"We pretty much ordered the whole menu and every dish was great!! Went for brunch on Saturday at around 11, we (party of 6) waited in line for about half an hour. We had already scoped out what to order but added some more as we pass by the pastry counter near the entrance... Everything tasted great, especially the brioche french toast (so soft and fluffy, not overly sweet) and kimchi fried rice (those soft boiled eggs!). The cocktails were also excellent. A perfect place for brunch!"
3/2/2020,20200302,5,4.36,"I've heard so much about this place, so recommended it to my friends when we did our girl's weekend in the LA area. You can't miss it because it's the one place on that street with the line out the door! You stand in line, and they'll pass out a menu for you to look over while you wait, then you order at the cashier. Once you pay, they give you a number, and you can seat yourself wherever there's seating. As crazy long as the line seemed, it went super fast.. and the place is huge with upstairs and downstairs seating, so it isn't hard to find a place to sit either. Loved the exposed brick walls, high ceilings, and gorgeous pendant lighting. Loved the communal concept of the seating too. It's just a really unique place, and they nailed the concept they were going for!As for the food - all of it was amazing!! My friends and I ordered several dishes to share, and all were good... so I don't think you can go wrong with whatever you order here. The food is fresh, light and healthy, and just beautiful! Almost too beautiful to eat. We ordered the chia seed pudding, kimchi fried rice, smoked salmon tartine, and arugula salad. We thought we got a good mix of everything - a little sweet and a little savory. The favorite was the chia seed pudding. Coffee was amazing, and the service was great and attentive too. 5 stellar stars for Republique!"
3/2/2020,20200302,4,4.36,"How can you resist the pastries? I don't know but I did because I wanted to enjoy my brunch. I regret not buying stuff to go though. I've had dinners at Republique which were good but brunch was more memorable. We had shakshuka and the waffles and we were so happy with our choices. Shakshuka is one of my favorite brunch items and they do it so well here. It's served in a cast iron skillet, steaming hot and very well seasoned. Served with (not enough) bread, this is a dish I won't be sharing next time. The waffle was perfect but we waited too long to dig in because it was a bit cold. Even then, still good. Fresh fruits were sweet and a good pairing to the waffles. Lovely atmosphere and really good oat milk hojicha."
3/3/2020,20200303,5,4.36,Casual setting but amazing food. The food came out pretty quick. I had the Moroccan Mint tea & Croque Madame. I will def be back very soon!
3/6/2020,20200306,4,4.36,"For starters, I have been dying to try Republican for the longest time. I was so impressed! As popular LA restaurants are, the prices were rather steep for many of the menu items, but the quality was amazing. The ambiance within Republican is also stellar, with fresh bread being made on the left side of the restaurant, and ample tables to choose from, on two different stories, this place really is a maze. I came here on a Saturday at around 11:30 for brunch, and it was packed. It took around 10 minutes to get through the line and once we ordered only another 15 minutes, so in all the service is super fast.I ordered the quiche of the day with a matcha latte and an apple bust cake. Everything was very delicious, the Matcha latte was on the small side for $6, but I thought I had to try it while I was there. The apple buns DT cake was phenomenal, it was flavorful and moist, and just sweet enough to not be overpowering. Finally, the quiche was to die for. I have never tasted a better quiche, not even in Paris! That's how good it was! The quiche was served with a small side salad, but in general was pretty small. All things considered, this place is super cool and extremely delicious. Prices are pretty steep, but nothing too unusual for LA.For my meal I spent around $24, which is on the higher side for brunch. The main reason I'm giving only 4 stars is because of the pretty high prices. I will definitely be coming back!"
3/7/2020,20200307,5,4.37,"Been hearing about this place for so long.... definitely worth a visit. Lines are long but move relatively quickly. Lot of seating inside. The line definitely blew up after 10am, so try to get there before 10am, especially on weekends.From the pastries to the ambiance, everything oozes old European charm. More importantly the food lives up to the hype.The only disappointing thing was the kimchi fried rice, maybe because I'm Korean and expect a different way. Seemed very Americanized to me and didn't quite taste as good. Everything else was delicious and well done. The wild mushroom omelette was delicious. Goat cheese wasn't too strong. The arugula salad on the side was a perfect sour/bitter compliment. The brioche french toast was so good. Caramelized outer with soft inside, the perfect brioche sweetness. Didn't even need the maple syrup. The smoked salmon eggs benedict was also delicious. The regular breakfast was also great. Perfectly scrambled eggs, super thick slice of bacon, the smashed potatoes were awesome (a little spicy), and the baguette with jam/butter was fantastic. My kids loved it. We tried the tres leches cake and it was a super refined version of Korean fruit cream cake. Light, not too sweet, a perfect balance of light cream and fruit. Definitely lives up to the hype."
3/8/2020,20200308,5,4.37,"I've been wanting to try Republique for years and I'm glad I finally did!! We went to brunch, they don't take any reservations (there was a 30 minute line). They pass out menus while you're waiting. Once you get to the front they take yours order and give you a number and it's first come first serve seating. After you sit they bring your food to your table. The ambiance and set up is super nice and trendy, very clean. The service is great, they have tons of people running around and they are pretty fast once you order. The food presentation is excellent, everything looked amazing and tasted great too! I have 0 complaints and would definitely come back and recommend it. I want to try dinner next!"
3/10/2020,20200310,5,4.37,"I can always count on Republique for brunch, lunch and dinner! The food is always top notch and the service is what every restaurant needs! I've been here a few times and the fusion and quality of the food keeps me coming back."
3/10/2020,20200310,5,4.37,"Had the opportunity to stop by here mid week for brunch. The pictures don't do it justice. It's a gorgeous space that makes you want to come back. Try your best to avoid purchasing one of the delicious looking desserts in the window along the register line.  The staff is knowledgeable and attentive.  Take your number back to your seat after you order and the food is delivered quickly by one of the many staffers.  We dined in French toast which here will be a whole new experience. The French toast has a perfectly buttery exterior while being strangely light. When done you won't have food coma. The coffee is served in a little pouring carafe, and not only visually appealing but also refectory made. This place is steep in price, but you'll find the quality of the food to be accurately represented by the cost. Well done guys!"
3/11/2020,20200311,4,4.37,"Republique is one of the best brunches in LA! Whenever I've driven by the restaurant in the past, there is always a line out the door. It is a bit intimidating when you see it but it goes by so quickly! Last Saturday we were in and out of the restaurant within an hour (including the wait to order).When you get inside, the first thing you notice is their array of pastries. They are absolutely beautiful! I'm not usually one to get a pastry with brunch but when I saw them I just had to. And of course I went against the flavors I usually like and chose the most colorful one and it was perfect! For brunch we ordered the quiche and the ricotta toast. I am always a big fan of quiche and this one was truly one for the books! The only quiche I've had that rivaled the one at Republique was one I had at a bakery in Bordeaux. The ricotta toast was also good but I expected it to be a bit more savory from the cheese. The citrus fruits really added a good bite to the dish. I am already planning my next trip to Republique and if you are in the area you should definitely stop by!"
3/14/2020,20200314,5,4.37,"I had a visit to LA a couple weeks ago and a friend took us to brunch at Republique for the first time ..and I haven't stopped thinking about it yet. If I could give it additional stars I would. Luckily when I went, the line was not long at all (I hear it can get pretty long). For brunch we ordered mimosas, the croque madame, mushroom toast, chorizo sopes, and the California breakfast.For pastries we had banana Nutella crostata, Ube coconut croissant, and ham and cheese croissant.Everything was perfectly crafted to a T. Next time I'm in LA, this will be the first stop I'm making!"
3/14/2020,20200314,5,4.37,Republique is by far one of the best restaurants in Los Angeles! Amazing brunch and dinner. Anything you get here will be insane. For Brunch you will wait in a line and order at the front. The line goes super quick and well worth the wait. Service is great and you can always find a table. For dinner make sure to book your reservation well in advance. The wine list is incredible.
3/15/2020,20200315,4,4.37,"I came here for dinner with my cousin. We got here a few minutes before they opened, so we were seated right away. It is beautiful inside the restaurant and I have never seen one like it! The service was great, our waiter was very nice and attentive. However, I was a BIT disappointed by my eggs on toast. We paid $24 for two tiny slices of bread, it was barely two bites of food. That being said, it was delicious, but really? $24? The Brussels sprouts were flavorful, and very well cooked. We got sorbet as dessert and loved that as well. Overall: Very good, just a bit pricy."
3/19/2020,20200319,5,4.38,"Food: As delicious as all the pictures on yelp show. Came here for dinner: classic French potato leek soup for starters; we opted for the lobster pasta and bucatini carbonara for dinner- all handmade pasta with the best amount of chew to it. Don't skip the dessert (check out the chef bios)! Tried the apple tart and will be back for more brunches and birthdays to try everything. For the prices and fresh ingredients, this place leaves you charmed and possibly inspired in your home cooking. Ambiance: gorgeous interior, you walk in where you see the familiar vaulted stone hall in most of the yelp pictures but behind that and upstairs are some romantic, cozy, smaller tables illuminated by candles and Edison lighting fixtures. I can't get over this gem!"
3/28/2020,20200328,5,4.38,"Every restaurant in LA is suffering right now but Republique is to be commended for their quick pivot to take-out and market wares. The process of buying pastry and market basics (fruit, butter, milk, eggs, duck leg confit, and bread) was clean and careful. I was actually genuinely grateful to buy basics. Customers kept a respectful distance, staff were careful, and the touch pads were wiped down with every transaction. It was a fairly slow process but worth it. Thanks for staying open, thanks for trying to keep some staff employed, and thank you helping Los Angeles survive."
3/31/2020,20200331,5,4.38,Quite possibly my best dining experience of all time. The butternut squash pasta will forever go down in history as my favorite pasta dish.
4/1/2020,20200401,5,4.38,I loved their pasta it was delicious. They have organic chicken tender and moist . De service was great. Will come back for breakfast
4/3/2020,20200403,4,4.38,"not a bad spot to take people visiting from out of town, expansive menu offering and cool vibe"
4/4/2020,20200404,5,4.38,"Best brunch place in LA ever. The maine lobster omelette is wonderful,everyone should try it! And the mushroom toast. Actually everything that I ordered are good. I will definitely come back next time!"
4/5/2020,20200405,2,4.37,"An excellent restaurant and I understand this is a time of crisis, but the web site indicates takeout from Tue through Sunday, as does the phone message. Message says to place an order for pickup. So I do so. And drove from Orange County to help support this fine restaurant. I wanted to show my support of owners and staff. I arrived and: closed till Wednesday. There was no courtesy of taking time, like the rest of us have, to change both the phone message and web site. Would have taken 5 minutes. Real bad form and I expected more. Told a staff member who was there doing whatever and she assured me it would be changed. Hours later . . . no change, same inaccurate message and website."
4/6/2020,20200406,5,4.38,"As part of our COVID19 quarantine routine we have adhered closely to all of the social distancing recommendations. Once in a while we do venture outside our cooking at home routine and order out for pick up. Republique has the best operation of all of the restaurants we have ordered from during this challenging time. There is a carefully designated one-way path of travel taking patrons in and then out with their meal. Everyone is kept to a requisite socially distant spacing while waiting. Everything was handled with great care and we were very happy with how the whole process of pick up was managed. For our dinner we ordered the chicken dinner for two. Once we got home, we unpacked our meal and were met with a heavenly aroma. We noted a succulent rotisserie chicken, a fresh green salad, a rigatoni dish, a beautifully baked baguette, and two slices of creamy cheesecake. The bread was freshly baked and tasted great with the accompanying butter. The chicken was deliciously spiced, tender, and moist. This was the best chicken we have had in a long time and the only thing that would have made it better would be to have eaten it in the historic dining space at Republique. The rigatoni pasta was prepared with a delcate alfredo style sauce that was creamy with a hint of black pepper. So yummy! The salad had fresh greens and a nice complimentary dressing. Finally, the cheesecake was exquisite. It was light and sort of airy with a definite cream cheese flavor but there was something more to it that we could not quite put our finger on that made it unique. Overall, this was a dinner that for a few moments helped us forget the dark time we are currently living through. Hopefully, everyone can stay safe and healthy through all of the social distancing efforts and when this is over we can all meet at Republique for dinner!"

4/7/2020,20200407,4,4.38,"more on the upscale level . great service , and good food if you know what you're ordering. my advice is to look up the menu ahead"
4/17/2020,20200417,2,4.37,Over hyped and just mediocre experiences I've had for dinner and lunch. Go to Auburn who's chef trained at Republique!!
4/22/2020,20200422,3,4.37,"went a couple days before the lockdown. service was very good and friendly. loved that aspect. the food was uniformly ok. a little familiar and safe maybe but tasty for the most part. didnt leave a strong impression on us tho. im not one to normally complain about price, but i think for $$$$ they are charging it's overpriced. that would be the main thing that would keep me away. at this higher price point i'd aim my sights toward Son of a Gun or Providence."
4/30/2020,20200430,5,4.37,"Since quarantine started, I have been driving to LA once a week to get some take outs from some of my favorite restaurants and support them. Have gone to republique twice already and honestly will prolly go back again. The pastries are just sooo heavenly. My favorite pastries from here are croissant, banana poppy seed bread, kouign amann, salted caramel chocolate cake, and raspberry passion fruit cream pie. And the Mondadito is also absolutely delicious.Banana poppy seen bread is so moist, even after a few days, it still tastes fresh.Kouign amann and croissants are always flaky and light. They are perfect. We also got a bunch of groceries and we cant get over how fresh everything is, and the quality is wayyyy better than anything u ever get from farmers markets. The produce that really stood out for us is the snap peas. They are so sweet and crunchy, and easy to make.We will be back soon for more quality food and groceries."
5/4/2020,20200504,5,4.37,"If there was a silver lining to the pandemic, it's that picking up food from Republique is as easy as it's ever. Normally during the day there's a line outside. Now, they are only taking prepaid advance orders via Tock for contactless pick up. I even found a spot in their parking lot! When I arrived, there were a couple of customers in front of me, with plenty of space for social distancing. They even provide gloves!Republique is a little on the pricey side, but there are less expensive options available. Their delicious quiche with bacon, gruyere and broccoli di cicco was only $6 for a generous slice. There's also a $7 Montadito - ham and brie on pain du lait. They have heat-at-home entrees like kimchi fried rice with pork belly ($18 for a small that serves 2) and macaroni and cheese ($12) which are easy to prepare.A visit to République is not complete without their superlative pastries! I got a sinfully rich slice of Basque cheesecake ($6), cara cara blackberry crostata ($5) and a chocolate chip cookie ($3). I'm glad to see that Republique is still operating and look forward to the day when I can return to see their bakery stocked and enjoy a meal in one of the most beautiful restaurants in LA."
5/10/2020,20200510,5,4.37,"Covid news.. I have been very disappointed with many of my favorite restaurants during this pandemic. But Republique far exceeded my expectations for my mother's day. We did Saturday night dinner and ordered 4 meals for 5 people. (Well actually didn't know that one person was coming..oops.)The food was ready when we're got there, no social distancing issues. It was ready to serve and packaged nicely. Everything tasted like I imagined it would at the restaurant. The bread was astounding! Lobster salad fresh and delicious, potatoes and vegetables well seasoned, brie and jam yummy, shortrib and horseradish very good, and panna cotta up to par. They have figured out the take out. It was pricey ($270)  but at least it was worth it for a family Mother's day dinner!"
6/5/2020,20200605,4,4.37,"Honestly can never get in cuz the is so long. I refuse to wait in a line for new Jordan's, I def ain't waiting for eggs. That being said, beautiful restaurant and the food LOOKS good, when I'm standing in line right before I bail.Everyone says it's good, but like I said, don't even try to come during brunch on the weekend unless u got a good hour+ to kill in line."
6/6/2020,20200606,4,4.37,"Their food is good but get the hype... I think it's kinda funny how obsessed is everyone that works there with butter... ""did you try the rodolphe le meunier"" ""you should have your bread with the rodolphe le meunier"" ""rodolphe le meunier is the best butter in the world""... ok, it's butter, can we talk about real food plzReservations are kinda hard so I was only able to find a spot on dates/time I wanted for dinners before, but I still want to try their brunch"
6/9/2020,20200609,5,4.37,"After months of quarantine during a global pandemic, a meal from Republique was quite a treat. Ordering a to-go meal and having the staff place it in the trunk for a contactless pickup was easier than I expected. If I had known it was this easy, I probably would have come sooner. The whole operation was incredibly smooth, and the food was well packaged for travel.The fixed menu was duck confit with cherries, zucchini risotto, beets in a Meyer lemon herb oil, and a fresh baguette served with Republique's signature butter that is incredibly decadent. The zucchini risotto was really unique, and I found myself thinking about it a couple days afterward it was so good. And for the coup de grâce, a dessert of chocolate cake covered in salted caramel and hazelnuts. Pair all that with a bottle of wine of your choice and you are absolutely set. I'm not sure a to-go order has felt quite as close to having it served in the restaurant as this meal did. The team at Republique has really risen to the challenge. I'm definitely looking forward to a return visit!"
6/14/2020,20200614,5,4.37,Been waiting to go to this place for weeks now. What a way to begin our Sunday Can't wait to go back and try the dinner menu. Overall the breakfast was amazing . Highly recommend
6/16/2020,20200616,4,4.37,"Get their Okinawa Latte, I'm still thinking about it. Huge portion and relaxing ambience. I went on a weekday, the line was long but manageable."
6/17/2020,20200617,5,4.37,"Went here early Saturday morning and the line was out the door already. Line went pretty fast though so that's good. Valet parking available but there's metered parking on the streets.Ordered a few and i must say that their kimchi fried rice and smoked salmon benedict are REALLY GOOD. So fancy and worth it. Chicken and waffles is good too, will definitely order these again!Love this place, good for brunch!"
6/23/2020,20200623,1,4.36,"I just can imagine that the food is great.We adopted a dog a month ago and we need to take her with us everywhere, that's why I choose this restaurant but.....A few days ago I took my wife to eat there, it was her Birthday we took out our dog because before going there I did my reacher about the pet's policy of the restaurant. They are in plenty of websites claiming that they are top 10 pet friendly. When we got there we were doing the line during the time we were in line a few employees came out to check and ask questions, to the people because they had two lines (covi-19) one for pre-orders and the other one for going in the restaurant. After 45 min in the line, we finally reach the front. The host told us that they are not allowed dogs inside, I ask her why no one said anything when we were waiting outside, they were plenty of employees that they saw us with the dog and they didn't ask is or told us about the no dogs police. Also why they don't update their website police. They had two tables outside but the most didn't even try to.find a solution she just keep saying sorry no DOGS. We end up living, I was mad and disappointed about the restaurant."
6/24/2020,20200624,3,4.36,"Beautiful interiors, it's everything instagram has portrayed it out to be... I enjoyed the pasties offered in the case, especially the cinnamon baked goods. At the same time, I feel that the prices were steep and it would be a special occasion type of a food purchase. I would only plan on returning if it were a special occasion with a group of friends.Parking: I believe everything is street parking, if not I believe they had a it was full at the"
6/28/2020,20200628,5,4.36,"Went with my mom and a friend and we loved it.The decor and environment is great!The service is great!The taste is to die for!Love the bread & pastry!!! The morning bread is 5 out of 5. That baguette is sooo good, I had to order more to go (to take home and enjoy).The kimchi friend rice is 5 out of 5. It was weird to see it on the menu but I'm glad to give it a try. The poached egg is the highlight of this dish and the spiciness is just right to give it a kick but not overpowering. The meat is sooo tender. I literally can't stop eating once I started and finished that bowl in lightning speed.Mushroom toast is 5 out of 5. It's like a complete breakfast where you got mushroom, spinach, egg, ham, bread and sauce. It was perfect.The omelette is 3 out of 5 for me, it is more American style then French style. Don't get me wrong, The taste is good, however it isn't like French omelette (that melts in your mouth) and not as tender and soft and moist. Just not my preference.French toast is 5 out of 5. It's moist and soft and perfect. It literally melted in my mouth. Homemade ginger ale is 3 out of 5 for me, again it's because I'm not a ginger person and the ginger taste was too strong for me.Overall it's superb and I'll be back for sure. Next time I wasn't to try the homemade orangeade."
6/29/2020,20200629,4,4.36,"* This is my dine-in experience during covid timeI came here for brunch on a Sunday during covid time. I arrived around 11:20 and there was a long line outside, but the line moved pretty quickly. They have the barcode on the ground you can scan to see the menu while waiting. The way to order during this time is also different than normal: you have to put down your name, your number, and number of your parties in a sign-up sheet outside. Then, you need to order and pay right at the register. After that, you can walk around to find any open seatings you want. I came here with 3 other friends and we ordered the kimchi fried rice, mushroom toast, the regular breakfast, and the omelette. I personally really like the mushroom toast (tho it was a little bit salty to me), it has good portion which filled me up and took me a while to finish. The regular breakfast is just normal breakfast with huge portion, my friend couldn't finish everything. My other friends were not too impressed with the kimchi fried rice and the omelette. Overall, I really like this place. The food is good and the service is fast. However, my friends were not too impressed with this place cuz they think the food is too expensive and they can go to somewhere else for better values. With the portion they have, I probably will order as the family style and share with the group, so everyone can try everything next time."
7/2/2020,20200702,4,4.36,"Wow this place is unique. I went for my birthday in March 8 and forgot to review it. I started with the bread and drippings, which was probably my favorite thing. The service was fantastic along with the wine recommendations. The menu has a bunch of small plates, so it's easy to try a bunch of things and share. I got their duck, which was cooked to perfection. As well a truffle pasta plate. I don't think you can go wrong ordering the entire menu here. It does come at a price, but if that doesn't bother you then this is the right place to do it. Keep in mind they have a cherrywood burner, which is unique and a great way for chefs to add a twist of Smokey fruity flavor to the meats."
7/11/2020,20200711,5,4.36,"Visiting this lovely place for years now and just, wow! So many deliciousness from morning to evening. Brunch is a delight. ...Order the damn pastry you little glutton..."
7/13/2020,20200713,5,4.36,"My new favorite restaurant.Food: 5/5, Desserts: 5/5, Drinks: 3/5, Location 4/5, Experience: 5/5 The baked goods are out of this world. I recommend getting the basque cheesecake, creme brûlée bombolone and the oatmeal raisin cookie (the BEST cookie I have ever eaten.)They're well known for their breakfast so definitely go then. Their regular breakfast was AMAZING. I initially thought it was going to be a generic take on an American breakfast but I was quickly proven wrong. The eggs were delicious (I got them over easy and I would recommend it! The yolk is so yummy with the potatoes), the bacon was out of this world, and the bread, butter, and jam was just to die for. Together it made for a perfect breakfast!I also got the kimchi fried rice and it was very spicy for my taste. I had to go home and add rice to neutralize the intense flavors! The only part I disliked was their drinks. I got the matcha latte and the Vietnamese coffee and both were very mediocre and over priced.Also FYI, the outside is open for eating during the quarantine! Great to go in the morning."
7/21/2020,20200721,5,4.37,"Rodolphe de lemunier- I could spread it on anything! I've been for breakfast and dinner. Dinner is extra fancy AF. It's definitely hype, but warranted. We dined during Covid last week on the boyfriends birthday and it did not disappoint. Always order the desert. Chocolate everything and/or cheesecake with seasonal berries. The only thing I hate about the process is the line. They herd you like sheep, but I guess it's the best way to get everyone organized and socially distanced. Overall, would highly recommend-even just to see what the hype is about."
8/2/2020,20200802,5,4.37,"Wow, wow, wow! What else can I say? A truly exceptional dining experience in the heart of LA. The service was great, the outside experience was magical, (loved the lighting and decor) and the cleanliness of the tables, chairs, bathrooms was immaculate. Regarding the food everything was wonderful. I appreciated the complementary corn soup. The bread was delicious with the pan drippings. And the presentation of every dish was up to par. Will definitely come back in the future. Especially during Covid times I appreciate the extra thought and effort for the outside patio dining experience for the customers."
8/2/2020,20200802,5,4.37,"After a long, hot morning of moving my sister into her new house for college yesterday, my mom had the brilliant idea of stopping at Republique. And boy, was it the perfect treat! Everyone respectfully kept their distance in the line to order. The patio had the same charm and chic style of the interior. My mom got the quiche, which was so light and flavorful. I ordered the smoked salmon tartine, and I mean come onnnnnn look how cute it is! Obviously their bread was delicious, but when it's equipped with smoked salmon, creamy spread, and fresh vegetables and herbs? Forget about it! We brought a doggy bag of pastries home, and those were just as great. Would highly recommend the fruit brioche! We'll definitely be coming back."
8/9/2020,20200809,5,4.37,"What can I say about Republique? I live down the street and have visited for many brunches, dinner, and even picked up COVID to-go dinner. And each time, the food never disappoints! I have tried many brunch items and you cannot go wrong with any choice. I absolutely love the kimchi fried rice and the giant fluffy French toast. It took me a while to visit for dinner because it's a bit pricier than brunch, and regretted not visiting earlier! We had such a great experience with an attentive & helpful waiter. We decided what we wanted to order, and then asked what he recommended - it was all completely different than what we chose and we ultimately changed our order to his suggestions. And it was the best decision because we really enjoyed our dinner.The Tuna Tartare has caviar and smoked tomato topped on toasted baguette and it was absolutely delicious! A must get even if you get only two pieces for $$. We also ordered the Branzino which melted in my mouth - recommend trying this if it's on the menu.I can eat the baguette with Normandy butter all day everyday - who knew Normandy butter elevates the standards of bread and butter! For COVID take out, the dinner was the most impressive from all the restaurants we have done take out at. The flavor profile of the creamed Brentwood Summer Corn, 'Cacio e Pepe' Long Beans, & Fingerling potatoes with Calabrian Chili Aioli were unique yet executed very well. Loved how they were able to still create excellent dishes for COVID take out.Obviously, I'd recommend giving them a try for brunch and dinner!"
8/9/2020,20200809,5,4.37,"We've been exploring different patio dining options since the re-opening of restaurants, and we decided to visit one of our favorite local restaurants Republique tonight. Their patio is beautiful, and it really gave me a sense of ""normalcy"" that we deeply needed. Let me clarify when I say normal, I mean I felt relaxed as a patron. The entire staff took all safety precautions so I was able to enjoy meal in a safe environment. Our waiter greeted us with aperitif on the house almost right after we sat down, followed by a delicate corn soup while we waited for our appetizer. We ordered the bluefin tuna tartar to start, then came the black truffles raviolo, and ended with the AMAZING chicken tagine. Everything was delicious, service was fantastic as usual, and the ambiance was great."
8/11/2020,20200811,4,4.37,"For the first timers (what I learned today), The set up of the restaurant is more of an order, pay and find your own seats kinda thing rather than getting served at your table. Therefore when you arrive, just line up at the cash line and there will be menus lying around on the counter for you to look at what you want to order. After ordering, they will give you a numbered cup and this will be used to find you when your food is ready. I got a passion fruit mango cream pie, kimchi fried rice, smoked salmon tartine, Brewed coffee and fresh grapefruit juice that totalled up to $63 something (not cheap for brunch). The passion fruit mango cream pie was amazing, not too sweet with fresh pieces of mangos 4/5. The kimchi fried rice was very flavourful (it's safe to say that its better than a lot of authentic Korean restaurants) with 2 poached eggs 5/5. The smoked salmon tartine was pretty good, it's refreshing 4/5."
8/12/2020,20200812,5,4.37,"Came several times for brunch, but first time for dinner! Amazing service and food was delicious as expected. Definetely the Tuna Tartare one of my favorites and I would order 10 more all for myself. Braised Beef was great - although a bit too savory for me - and the texture was heavenly. Wish there was more dried tomato as it was the perfect combination with the meat. Bread and butter was delicious - as much as our more expensive menus. Sonoma Duck was perfect with the dried peach - again wish there was more to eat with the meat. Overall, pitch perfect. Next time want to hit the pasta and fish menu. Thank you for being opened and hope your team well ;)"
8/13/2020,20200813,5,4.38,"The ambiance at Republique is lovely. The decor is very nice. The food does justice to your taste buds. Even they were serving food keeping in the mind the COVID precautions- the staff was wearing gloves and masks, social distancing norms were followed. whether-you go for breakfast, lunch or dinner - Republique loves having you at the table. We ordered branzino and French toast which just melted in the mouth. It's a great experience having food in the heart of LA.CREAMED summer corn, long beans, fingerlings potatoes, calibrian chili aioli were on my bucket list for next time. It's wasn't heavily priced. They had different kind of dishes in the menu. The food is tasted well. Cleanliness of the tables and chair was top class.Republique is a highly recommended place. I will recommended this restaurant to all the people. It should be must visit on your to do list. whether you want to dine in or take delivery you will not regret..."
8/18/2020,20200818,5,4.38,"Vive Republique! We tried it because of Buzzfeed's Worth It, though we came in the morning to experience the part that the show didn't profile: their bakery and café. And I'm so glad we did! The coffee was superb, the baked goods were exquisite, and the social distancing protocols reassuring. We tried their vanilla canelé, kouign amann, and Basque cheesecake for food and the macchiato for coffee. The macchiato wasn't quite my speed, since I forgot that macchiatos aren't typically done the way that Starbucks does, but the quality of both the (Verve) beans and the espresso was undeniable. The lightly fruity notes came through well, and the crema was beautiful. It's definitely worth having in whatever espresso form works for you. The canelé was a mind-blowing experience. The deliciously soft, custardy interior let the subtle vanilla notes come through, and the firm, glistening exterior has a caramel-like darkness that contrasted beautifully.The kouign amann was my absolute favorite one that I've had in California. (Only the esteemed Dominique Ansel's DKA in New York surpasses it, and it far surpasses the others I've tried.) It had the amazing flakiness you'd expect from good viennoisserie while balancing both the crispier, golden outer crust with the softer, buttery inner layers. Plus, it was just sweet enough to lift up the fatty flavors without turning into a toothache-inducing sugar bomb. The Basque cheesecake was a uniquely delicious experience, since it seemed to combine the best elements of other cheesecake types (e.g. New York, Japanese) into one. It also has no crust, which leaves the cheesy ""filling"" to shine on its own. The middle of the cheesecake is soft and pillowy, almost like whipped cream, while the edge is firmer and takes on more of the caramel notes from the burnt edges. Outdoor dining here is clean and easy, and there's plenty of room around each table in their courtyard."
8/18/2020,20200818,5,4.38,Im a Sunday regular just because I cannot get enough of their brunch.. you really can't go wrong ordering anything on their brunch menu.
8/22/2020,20200822,5,4.38,My wife and I had dinner last night here. The service was great. Delicious food. Class A place for sure. Our waitress was very busy with other people but was always attentive of our needs. We will go back for breakfast sometime.
8/25/2020,20200825,5,4.38,"I'm so happy I finally got to try this place! The food is actually TO DIE FOR. Literally everything that we ordered tasted incredible. To start, they gave us complimentary Chilled Corn Soup with a Basil drizzle. This set the tone for an amazing meal. It was so simple, light and delicious, but tasted sooo good. For a starter, we got the cheese board and bread with butter. The cheese board with 3 cheeses was the perfect size to share between 2 people. Each cheese was so unique and delicious. It also included some crackers, honey, jam, and figs. The bread with butter is a MUST. This is seriously the most delicious butter I have ever had. As a side, we chose the Heirloom tomato salad which was the perfect compliment to our main because it was so light and fresh. For the main we got the Salmon with Prawns, Octopus and Clams. This dish was cooked perfectly and was a combination of balanced flavors. Unfortunately we were so full that we didn't have room for dessert this time. I'm so excited to come back to try more of these amazing dishes! I've heard that the brunch is also a must. Don't forget to book a reservation to avoid a long wait! There is valet available for $10 out front."
8/28/2020,20200828,4,4.38,"Came here for brunch. You order and pay at the counter then find a seat outside. They clean and sanitize the menus and pens. Tables are spread apart and staff were wearing masks. We ordered:Lobster omelette Steak fritesShort rib sandwich Matcha latte Cold brew Golden juice FOOD - tasted great although the steak frites could have had a little more steak. DRINKS - the drinks were OK. The iced matcha latte was done in 3 sips, it was filled mostly with ice. Golden juice was OK and cold brew tasted watered down. PARKING - metered street parking or valet. It wasn't difficult finding a parking spot on the street on a Tuesday around noon. RESTROOMS - clean Overall everything we ordered tasted great, staff was attentive and followed covid precautions. Next time I will probably try something else to drink or not get a drink at all."
9/2/2020,20200902,5,4.38,"I've ONLY had good experiences here. The staff is amazing, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere transports you to somewhere entirely different. I am so glad I discovered this gem of Mid Wilshire, because Republique is a spot that I can see myself coming to time and time again.The interior decor is eclectic, in a great way, and makes you feel like you're dining in Paris, Rome, or Madrid. Plus, it's absolutely a restaurant that you can dine at for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! If you are in Los Angeles for only a few days I would absolutely recommend checking out Republique, you won't be disappointed :D"
9/3/2020,20200903,4,4.38,"Republique, where to start... One of the most beautiful restaurants in Los Angeles, serving up unique dishes that you dream about weeks later. I've been here twice, once before Covid and once during in their outdoor oasis. The service is beyond fabulous, the wine list has some great wins, and the food menu is always leaving me wanting to try everything. Let's get to the food though.Pan Drippings, Appetizer - 5 Stars. Drippings from different meats make up this tasty and flavorful sauce that is served with some of the best bread you'll ever have, the Republique tasty baguette. I could eat this all day and still want more.Soft Scramble Uni on Toast - 4 1/2 Stars. The perfect bite of Uni on top of a soft scrambled egg, placed on a little toasted baguette. Perfect balanced and oh so tasty.1/2 Chicken Dish served w Figs and Cous Cous - 4 Stars. Though this was really good, it was not all that memorable.Tipsy Cake - 4 1/2 Stars. This is like a take on bread pudding. The server brought out this little cast iron dish of sweet looking bread, poured a boozy liquid on the bread, and served it with a side of grilled nectarines with a dollop of Vanilla ice cream. So tasty, so unique! This just worked! Overall this spot is a gem, and really deserves 4 1/2 stars. The ambiance is lovely, the service is on point, and the food is so darn good. I hear they have an amazing brunch, that will be my next trip here!"
9/8/2020,20200908,3,4.38,"So I've come for dinner and breakfast during covid. It's really mixed. Dinner time, I asked for a recommendation on an app and was told to order the prawns. They're $18/piece. They're good, but not $18/piece. The celery cocktail I had was tasty and the desserts I ordered were pretty solid. Breakfast, I got the kimchi rice. It's really awesome. I also got the mezcal bloody mary and it's really awesome also. But I also got the Vietnamese latte and it's trash. I also got 6 different pastries and I only liked the chocolate cookie and the creme brulee pastry. The other pastries: fruit tart, the fruit machato(sp?), the banana and nutella, and the raspberry kouign amann and all just ok. Ok as in I wouldn't order them again. So I've come to the conclusion that you have to order the right things here. I'd come back for dinner and try other things."
9/8/2020,20200908,5,4.38,"Start your day with energized breakfast from Republique is the way to go. Wait time is not bad, the line seems long, but the whole wait time from waiting, ordering, to getting a table takes approximately 15 -20 minutes. As you are guided into the order area, they take your order at the front and send you off to the pay area where you pass by many delicious decedent yummy pastries, of course you cannot resist and continue order everything that appeals to you, that's exactly what we did. The French toast is a must, it is fluffy light and dipped with the custard egg fillings that makes the toast so scrumptious and light. The all in breakfast comes with two eggs, the baguette is so fresh and delicious specially spread with the silky butters. The latte was not so creamy, but very silky, loved the kimchi fried rices, yes, ordered the fried rice for breakfast. It has a very pretty presentation topped with earthy herbs, had a kick of spicy soy bean and soaked with a medium poach egg, that binds everything together. Everything there was excellent, cannot go wrong with any order. Definitely a place where you enjoy and want to go back. Hope they invest in OFF candles if outdoor seatings become the norm."
9/9/2020,20200909,5,4.38,"I'm shocked I haven't left a review for Republique yet, but here I am!I went back with my boyfriend for the first time during the pandemic and was really pleased with their outdoor setup. Unlike blu jam and some of the other popular brunch spots in the area, they have a short wait and FANS/SHADE in the outdoor seating area so you don't feel like your melting during these insane LA heat waves.We ordered the french omelette, fig and ricotta toast, and the salmon tartine. It was the perfect mix of savory and sweet, as I find pancakes/waffles overwhelming at times. We also impulse ordered bloody Marys which were sooo good and decently strong. Add on some stellar coffee and I couldn't have dreamt up a better brunch. It was my happiest outdoor dining experience I've had all quarantine. Thank you Republique!"
9/12/2020,20200912,1,4.37,"I don't even know why this is a top place to go to. You will like this place only if you like form over function. Food tasted very average for that hefty price you pay! That's a Nah ah! We got Shakshouka, Avacado toast, caramel latte, brownie and lemonade. Probably the only thing that tasted above average was the lemonade. Pretty disappointed."
9/15/2020,20200915,2,4.37,"Best bread & butter in town. Good vegetarian menus as well. But the dinner menu are very mediocre. (We ordered enough for 3;1 appetizers, 1 salad, 1 bread/butter,2 dinner, 2 desserts.)The main entree's portion was unbelievably small in spite of the server said they are all family dining style, which meant to be big enough to share.Loved the lunch/brunch from Republique,that's why I tried for dinner here. I think this place's dinner is overpriced and overrated. If want, I suggest to go for lunch or brunch."
9/15/2020,20200915,5,4.37,"Wow, I can't get over how much I love Republique. I tend to be a bit critical of places but this spot fires on all cylinders. The chicken dinner I recently got was very fairly priced and so delicious. Now I am dreaming of chicken and the chicken or duck liver mousse (not sure which it was but it was so damn good).I was hesitant to ""dine in"" but this was also where I chose to have my first meal in their dining area in the parking lot. They were doing it right, I felt totally safe, but also very welcomed.Wine was also tasty and they found something that I enjoyed without breaking the bank.I do love the pastries but haven't been getting them as much of late due to pandemic pounds.Basically may be my favorite restaurant in Los Angeles"
9/16/2020,20200916,4,4.37,"Ordered inside sat down outside we had Italian sandwich, Burger and steak frites All very good, was a little warm on the patio could use some misters but was all very good"
9/16/2020,20200916,5,4.37,"Hands down one of the best restaurants here. So glad I was able to come here during my last night. I absolutely loved the decor, service, and food. The bread was so good! They even gave us extra at no cost. Definitely make a reservation before coming out here. Parking was super easy. I'm a fan of this place!!!!"
9/16/2020,20200916,5,4.37,COVID-19 update on the dinner package takeout! Such a delicious selection that was even better on the dinner table for two days! Orderly pickup with names taken down and out with the go bag a few minutes later.
9/19/2020,20200919,5,4.37,Delicious! Great for either a light pastry or a heavier meal.The restaurant is beautiful and the outdoor space creates a great ambiance.
9/21/2020,20200921,1,4.36,"If you are Caucasian you're in luck! If you are of color be prepared to get cut in line and sat so close to the curb that you can feel the cars driving by, and yes even when there is plenty of seating inside. Lord forbid they sit you with the fair skin folks."
9/22/2020,20200922,4,4.36,"I randomly saw this place in the plaza and thought why not. I got the Korean bbq burger and I must say it was delicious. If you are meat lover I recommend you get it. I got the regular fries but they were nice and crispy, if you like them like that. Although it took some time for my order to be ready, but it was worth the wait."
9/24/2020,20200924,3,4.36,"The valet, drinks and food were great ... everyone we encountered was great except our server Katy. Her tone was pushy from the get go while taking our orders and we did not like her attitude. we thought she improved as the night progressed but when the Bill came.. we were shocked. On the menu under appetizers it says ""tuna tartare toast $24)We were charged $60. When I asked why? She said in a matter of fact tone ""you guys got 5pc and it's $12 each pc.The menu does not clearly state it is $24 for 2pc of toast and the server did not bother to tell us. This is a scam. We would never pay that much for 2pc of toast. It's not even 2pc of fancy sashimi. Although everything is good. The server just left a bad impression that we all never want to come back here"
10/1/2020,20201001,4,4.36,The pastries here are amazing. The endless glass case was beautiful when walking in. We got a few and were very pleased. My French omlette was well prepared and the salad had good flavor. My partner got the regular breakfast and was very satisfied. I think next time I need the chicken and waffles! We arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday. Case was very full and there were many people already eating and waiting. I do think it is pricey but treat yah self.
10/2/2020,20201002,5,4.36,"Even in light of COVID and all the stress the service industry is going through, Republique delivered the best dining experience I've had in all of 2020!Everyone from the hostess, to all the staff, and especially Katy who was our server, were amazingly sweet, fun and knowledgeable!It's tough right now with everything flipped upside down, and it was a shame not to be able to dine inside bc Republique has one of the most gorgeous interiors in LA - but they managed to make the outdoor dining area feel so cozy and comfortable w proper distancing while still feeling like a fun night out!The food... wow wow wow... it's mind blowing ... this is obvious and everyone knows it... there are no words to give the food the respect it deserves - bravo to the chef, the staff, and management for such a wonderful experience!"
10/3/2020,20201003,5,4.36,"We got there early on a Sunday morning and there was already a line formed. We ordered and were able to get one of the last tables. 100% worth it, so good. The friends I went with were def judgey that I got the chocolate cake for breakfast but honestly we all laughed because it was sooooo good. Definitely get it"
10/4/2020,20201004,5,4.36,"Republique's food, service and safety measures highlight why this place consistently makes it to ""Best of LA"" lists. Menu items/ingredients change as often as daily, and the few items we tried were outstanding!Although thought of as a French restaurant, Republique shines in incorporating elements from other cuisines, such as introducing japanese mushrooms & rice to pare with short rib beef, and offering cheeses from Indiana & Holland.I've enjoyed each bite here. You'd expect slightly better ambiance/ outside decor (a challenge in our covid era) but the food is so good that almost nothing else matters."
10/6/2020,20201006,5,4.36,"Oh what a treat my Monday Night Dinner at Republique was. The pre-set menu for $75.00 per person is a Gourmet Diners Delight. Starting with Smoke Salmon Eclair, to a Santa Barbara Uni Cauliflower Panna Cotta which was beautifully presented, Butternut Squash Soup accompanied by Margarita's Baquette and Normandy Butter to Munak Ranch Melon that happened to be super sweet, cold and delicious. Next a Raviolo with a soft egg in the center, Channel Island Rock Cod, a Prime Dry-Aged New York Steak and finishing with Brilliant-Savarin Cheesecake. A lovely dinner served in their outdoor seating area, with on point service and attended by their caring wait staff, it could not be better. Even at 8:00 PM, there were lines waiting for their turn to be treated to a dining experience like no other. All Covid Safety Practices are strictly enforced. All staff are masked and Face Shielded."
10/9/2020,20201009,5,4.37,"One of the best restaurants I've been to in LA. Yes expensive but 100% worth it. Everything we ordered was divine, except the tap water which had a funny taste. But totally recommend for a special occasion, and their yard is so cute"
10/10/2020,20201010,5,4.37,Food was delicious! Everything we ordered was good including the bread. Highly recommend.
10/10/2020,20201010,5,4.37,"Pastries at this place are just to die for... the basque burnt cheesecake is a must try! Outdoor patio seating is great during COVID-19, but careful of the flies... (might be choice of seating..)"
10/10/2020,20201010,5,4.37,Food was delicious! Everything we ordered was good including the bread. Highly recommend.
10/11/2020,20201011,2,4.36,"Where do I start. First they discriminated against us because the thought we were poor.I asked for table of two, which they had, and they said it was reserved, even though we ourselves reserved a table. They sat us next to the entrance next to the brick wall. I counted at least 16 different crickets that walked by us on the wall, that is filthy, the only reason I stayed is because my wife really wanted a date night and didn't want to look for a new spot. The host also said they couldn't sit us at a table with four chairs, so that they could sit larger groups, makes sense, but then she sits 2 people at a table for fourThey messed up our orders three times.We ordered 4 of the blue fin tuna they only served us one. They brought me the wrong champagne. And they forgot about our steak that we ordered.They made up for all of that by giving us an extra glass of 15$ Cabernet. I wasn't pleased to say the least.They don't wear name tags which I assume is so they don't get called out on Yelp reviews.The assistant manager (shorter Asian woman that wore a tan suit) apologized for the bad experience based on my displeased looks, because my wife wouldn't let me complain. We ordered dessert and no joke the waitress said, ""it's gonna be a six minutes wait is that ok,"" my wife replied ""sure"" and the waitress responded ""of course you are, you already had to wait so long for everything else hahahaha, so sorry again!""The fries were overcooked and tasted like bricks.The one not that ng I enjoyed eating was the bluefin tuna tartare.The wine connoisseur or I assume he was (male white, blond hair) dressed like a slob. They have no standards. He was dressed in a pink, un-ironed button up shirt, tattoo left forearm, and saggy pants.The staff did nothing to make things better, actually the exact opposite, the considered us as a lose and gave up all customer service etiquette."
10/11/2020,20201011,2,4.36,"Where do I start. First they discriminated against us because the thought we were poor.I asked for table of two, which they had, and they said it was reserved, even though we ourselves reserved a table. They sat us next to the entrance next to the brick wall. I counted at least 16 different crickets that walked by us on the wall, that is filthy, the only reason I stayed is because my wife really wanted a date night and didn't want to look for a new spot. The host also said they couldn't sit us at a table with four chairs, so that they could sit larger groups, makes sense, but then she sits 2 people at a table for fourThey messed up our orders three times.We ordered 4 of the blue fin tuna they only served us one. They brought me the wrong champagne. And they forgot about our steak that we ordered.They made up for all of that by giving us an extra glass of 15$ Cabernet. I wasn't pleased to say the least.They don't wear name tags which I assume is so they don't get called out on Yelp reviews.The assistant manager (shorter Asian woman that wore a tan suit) apologized for the bad experience based on my displeased looks, because my wife wouldn't let me complain. We ordered dessert and no joke the waitress said, ""it's gonna be a six minutes wait is that ok,"" my wife replied ""sure"" and the waitress responded ""of course you are, you already had to wait so long for everything else hahahaha, so sorry again!""The fries were overcooked and tasted like bricks.The one not that ng I enjoyed eating was the bluefin tuna tartare.The wine connoisseur or I assume he was (male white, blond hair) dressed like a slob. They have no standards. He was dressed in a pink, un-ironed button up shirt, tattoo left forearm, and saggy pants.The staff did nothing to make things better, actually the exact opposite, the considered us as a lose and gave up all customer service etiquette."
10/13/2020,20201013,5,4.36,Jesus Christ this place is Heaven on earth. I have to admit that I was not expecting having such a delicious breakfast. It's been a long time that I don't experience the delicious taste to a nice plate. As I arrived I saw the long line and I got a little bit scared because time is gold in LA. Well it went on super fast. The ordering process is very organized and the staff has control of everything that was going on. They have outdoor seating and the servers are super nice and efficient. I ordered the sauce of my Eggs Benedict separate I'm glad I did because it was delicious and I took a little of it home. It was an amazing experience. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.
10/13/2020,20201013,5,4.36,"Great outdoor seating!! Perfect for brunch or lunch! Their Vietnamese latte is amazing, highly recommend."
10/13/2020,20201013,5,4.36,"Staff were super friendly and the food was amazing! The price was fairly reasonable for what it was. Also, the wine selection was spectacular. Would go more often if I could afford it"

10/14/2020,20201014,2,4.36,"We are happy to have the Monday night set dinner in Republique. The food is well presented. Waiter is a little bit pushy. While I am still having bread in hand, he came over the collect my husband's plate, then want to collect mine too. This happened 2 times for 8 course meal. I don't think it's polite, plus this is kind of French style dinner.On the main course, the server has white truffle on hand and ask if we want to have it on top, which is $12 per gram. Of course, that will be nice. The server did not ask how many grams we want, but to start to grate truffle on top. We thought he will grate one gram. Till the bill came, it's 3 grams each. So we were charged 6 grams, means $72 on top of the bill, which almost a Monday set dinner price $75.After reading review of the restaurant, almost every night it has different things to add on, or overcharge without customer acknowledge.I know it's difficult to survive on Covid 19. If you want to earn business from your customer, please don't let them feel fool by you."
10/16/2020,20201016,2,4.35,Keep moving Foodies. The place felt highly overpriced for food that was definitely underrated.
10/18/2020,20201018,5,4.35,"Random plan to go check this place out since the pictures on Yelp were spectacular- as we arrived we got seated right away and Curtis was waiting on us ... the menu was completely different then what the pics were on Yelp.. clearly I was not excited about it anymore so I went with safe choices and whatever Curtis recommended. Let's start with that, we got oysters , grilled Thao cauliflower, Normandy butter and freshly baked baguette with a glass of French Rose'- oh my god !!! It was so flavorful and delicious!!! Then I got sweet potatoes agnolotti - unbelievably delicious .. I was full by that time but we still ordered peach and almond sorbet..!! It was as expected AMAZING.. I will be going back soon to try other items and I couldn't be more satisfied with the meal. Loved it."

10/19/2020,20201019,3,4.35,Been wanting to try this place forever and I had a weekday off so of course it was on the top for me to try. They have a good procedure with outdoor dining. My only issue was the amount of flies. OMG! I understand that it is uncontrollable but I never had this much of an issue any place else.The food is beautiful and tastes good. Parking is street parking or valet.
10/24/2020,20201024,5,4.35,"I have only been to Republique for brunch and it is yummmmmmy. I can't wait to try their dinner menu sometime.This time around, I got the avo toast (sans tomato) and some coffee. The toast is beauuutiful. It came with a ton of avo, cucumbers, some herbs like dill and mint, and flowers! At first I wasn't sure about the mint but it actually went really well with the cucumbers. My boyfriend had the regular breakfast and he was a fan. The bacon is thick cut and the potatoes were crispy and good too. I had the baguette that came with the regular breakfast and had to bring home the rest bc the crust was so caramelized and good.We also shared a crust less cheesecake and surprisingly it was really good! It was slightly more fluffy than a normal cheesecake but just as creamy.Right now during covid, they have more outdoor seating set up in their parking lot. So there are less valet parking spots but many more outdoor seats. The wait for us was pretty short, about 10-15 minutes for 4."
10/24/2020,20201024,5,4.36,"Oh My Goodness!!!! I think I found my new brunch spot! Where do I start?!?! Okay, so ordering is pretty simple. They have menus, you order and pay before you sit. I honestly rather sit first then order but o well. Its all self seating. They clean/sanitize the tables in between customers. Great outdoor seating area, and umbrellas. Very cute. But THE FOOD! We went with the family, and let me tell you. I tried a little bit of everyone's dish and vise versa... it was ALL amazing . RICH flavors. Nothing bland. The French toast was to diiieee for, and I couldn't get enough of the potatoes. I was honestly debating staying in the area just so I can come back when they reopened for dinner. I NEED to see those dinner options. But maybe next time lol . I love food, so I will definitely be back soon."
11/1/2020,20201101,5,4.36,"Must visit - loved it! We went here based on the reviewed it had on Yelp and the place totally loved it to the it. We got the kimchi fried rice eggs, mushroom toast, chocolate souffle and okinawa latte. I would say the mushroom toast is a must try, I personally loved it. Okinawa latte was definitely unique and I liked it but I can how some people may not. Chocolate souffle was well made - good souffle. Overall if you're looking for quality food with some uniqueness that the usual brunch options you get, this is your place. I would definitely go here again!"
11/2/2020,20201102,5,4.36,Republique is fantastique! There is always something exciting to try from the seasonal menu which includes an eclectic array of Eurasian selections from classic French to Asian cuisine and a melange of both cultures into one dish.Definitely worth a visit when you're in LA.
11/2/2020,20201102,5,4.36,"Patio seating beautiful romantic lighting there's heat lamps so it's not cold because it's in parking lot. Duck 5 stars so juicy! Cod was 4 stars, too buttery. Pasta was 4 stars, a little spicy. Panna cotta was 3 stars, forgettable. They do complimentary stuff for the table! We got complimentary mocktail, small squash soup, gelato, and apple cider. Valet parking expensive $12 for dinner"
11/5/2020,20201105,3,4.36,"Republique definitely seems to live up to its hype if one were to observe the throngs or people waiting to be seated, even past 9pm mid-week. Unfortunately that leads to situations like ours where a reservation has to wait for 20+ minutes on the sidewalk - something that I would not expect from a professional local institution. In terms of the food, the bread service is definitely recommended (as by everyone else). We also ordered the Heirloom Tomato/Burrata, the Caulifower, the truffle ravioli and the short rib. Amongst our apps, the Tomato/Burrata felt oddly unimaginative and fairly simple in its composition (3/5) and the cauliflower was well prepared (4/5). Unfortunately, a $100 plate of truffle pasta (the $60 base with an extra helping of fresh truffle shavings) left a lot to be desired. As with any proper truffle dish, the truffle is the standout ingredient, which in this case felt like it was past its peak freshness and hence somewhat dry and flavorless. Something that can easily be the signature dish for a restaurant unfortunately brought the experience down in this case. The beef short rib was tender but not particularly flavorful and while the service was attentive and prompt, the overall wow-effect was unfortunately missing."
11/7/2020,20201107,5,4.36,"Always great eating here, food is hot and delicious. I also always get pastries. Everyone is doing their best with the new COVID restrictions so the lines can be long and it's outside seating with covers or no covering. Overall great food and service from staff."
11/8/2020,20201108,4,4.36,"Had brunch here with a friend and ordered the kimchi fried rice and salmon Benedict along with two mimosas. Overall, it was a nice patio dining experience. Next time, I will come back with a coat since the weather is getting chillier and the winds can really pick up."
11/10/2020,20201110,4,4.36,"Went here for brunch back in July and I'm getting around to my review now. Despite covid situation they had a large spacious outdoor dining set up with adequate spacing between tables to ensure folks felt safe while dining. We ordered a few pastries and some main dishes including the berries and creams croissant which was phenomenal and the mushroom toast which was notable. We also ordered a breakfast set that included a baguette and a daily fruit compote. The compote at the time was blueberry and it was incredible. We were able to purchase some to go and even though they only had the blackberry jam available for purchase, the manager said they could sell us a jar and packed it for us as we waited. It was a really stellar experience, though you do pay for it. Valet is the easiest way for parking unless you get super lucky with street parking, but it's West Hollywood so... it is what it is. Recommended for girls brunches, early in relationship dates and friend meet ups for coffee and pastries, whenever you want to splurge and see and be seen"
11/11/2020,20201111,5,4.36,"Since I moved to Chicago 4 years ago, I haven't been to Republique for at least that long if not more. Which is why I was so delighted to see that the food and experience has gotten even better and even more beautiful than before. How is that even possible? Not to mention Covid hasn't had any impact on the quality of the food or service. Last but not least...they love dogs!!"
11/14/2020,20201114,5,4.36,"Reublique is one of those restaurants that you always hear about and for good reason! The food is super high quality and you can taste the freshness in all the items. Although there is usually a wait to order, its worth it. I had the quiche of the day, which came with an arugula salad (my fav leafy green!). It was very soft and tasty. I also tried the croque madame - super crisp and flavorful!! My friend, who lives right down the street and visits pretty often, swears by the kimchi fried rice, so I will have to try that next time. For desserts, I tried the salted caramel cake, basque cheesecake, and the creme brulee bombolone. They were all delicious but my favorite has to be the bombolone since its the perfect serving size, has all the textures I love in a pastry, and is relatively cheap! I do want to try the other desserts and pastries they have because they all look so good."
11/14/2020,20201114,4,4.36,"Food (4/5) : Kimchi fried rice tastes healthy; I think there needs more fat and salt (or maybe my tastebuds are too used to salted foods). The shakshoukah is also pretty healthy and minty, also there's no meat in it which is a no go for me. You can tell there's a lot of freshness in their ingredients. Brioche French toast is fantastic though. The perfect layers of crunch, fluff, and sweet syrup in a brioche French toast. Ambiance (4/5): Love their outdoor area with its lights, and plenty of shade. There were a lot of flies though and when it gets hot, there is only 1 area that has fans. Shouldn't be an issue as we get into fall weather.Service (4/5): Ordered at 12:02 and didn't get out food until 12:45. Price (3/5): $78 for kimchi fried rice, coffee, brioche french toast, and the shakshoukah. You can taste the freshness and quality of their food, however, I feel like their quantity suffers. $17 for shashoukah, $21 for kimchi fried rice, & $18 French toast."
11/15/2020,20201115,5,4.36,"This restaurant has some of the best food and ambiance I've ever experienced in LA. The inside is quite large and absolutely stunning. The design is something special and unique, and really ties the French theme together. You have to wait in line (they don't take your number), which can be a bummer if the wait is long. Other than that, I only have good words for this restaurant. Their pastries and french toast are a must...they make their to-die-for bread right there in the restaurant for your eyes to see. The waiters were kind and attentive, and my entire family fell in love with the place. We went back recently, but decided to go to a different place because it was just too busy, especially since Covid limits the amount of seating. We will certainly be back on a weekday, however, when the wait is a little more reasonable. Well worth it, though!"
11/16/2020,20201116,5,4.36,"Went there for brunch around 1pm and even though it seemed to be busy the process of ordering and finding a seat outside in the patio was seamless. the place has a great vibe to it and the energy was lively. The food was great full of flavor and enough individual portions. To start with a Sangria which was $10 it was not the greatest. and felt the ice watered it down. Just skip it if you can. If you want breakfast or lunch, the Mushroom Toast was amazing! you get mushroom, spinach, egg, ham, sauce on a toast.Also tried the Shakshouka it was very flavorful. Its oven-baked tomatoes and peppers, eggs, black kale, chickpeas, yogurt, baguette. Saving the best for last! If you end up here you should not leave without trying the Brioche French Toast! omg I was full from the meals already but first bite into the Brioche and I could not stop myself; bite after bite the sweet fluffy toast kept delivering the same amazing taste! This one is a must!Everyone was nice and friendly it felt relaxing to have a Saturday brunch there. Now pricing.. It's a bit much."
11/16/2020,20201116,5,4.36,"Ordered Avocado Toast and Kimchi Fried Rice. If you want to take out, it's better to order ahead through app or it will be a long wait time. The food here are amazing! Love it!"
11/20/2020,20201120,5,4.37,"Let's just cut to the chase. You need to come here pronto. This place became my #1 restaurant in all of LA. This is what to get: Do yourself a favor and get the bread, WITH the butter, AND, the Pan Drippings. Then, order a cheese. They will bring it out charcuterie board style for you and you'll have the best dang night of your life. Oh my lord. Now onto the main event. Get the MAFALDINE. This was the greatest pasta I've ever had. It's basically 4-5 ingredients, all executed perfectly and in one incredible bite, you have a punchy lemon, with basil, soft lobster, and those insane noodles. Like, get out of here. I lost my mind. This is who you should have serve you: Michael. This guy rules. He knew everything about the food, had some insane stories behind them, and was a great addition to a lovely meal. The service is amazing, the employees are lovely, the place is beautiful, an the food is great. 10/10/10. WOO! Will be coming back."
11/21/2020,20201121,4,4.36,"Republique has always been a standard in my list of go-tos but today was the first time back in a long time, now under Covid regulations. I have to admit, I balked at the crowd of people convening outside the entrance and what appeared to a long line...but, besides this couple behind us who were practically breathing down my neck in line (6 feet, anyone?) that calls for maybe a bit more line regulation...things went fairly, surprisingly, smoothly today despite the 'no reservations/first come first served' brunch operation here. $8.50 for brunch/lunch valet.I have to say the food off the limited menu leaves a bit to be desired- my friend ordered the Chia Seed Pudding that looked nice, but my ""French omelette with gruyère cheese, fines herbes, baby green salad"" looked better written out on the menu than in person. It was bland and even the salad looked boring/unappealing (reference my photo) so I ended up picking at most of it and took most of ""lunch"" in liquid form thanks to a tasty bottle of rosé we split.However, keeping this review at 4 stars because I still love Republique and I commend them on how friendly every staff member I encountered today was. Brunch operation: line up, QR code the menu, sign in on the sheet, get inside into bakery/cashier (only 3 parties allowed inside at a time), place/pay for order, get number, then find a table either curbside, or in their fairly spacious enclosed patio to the side. You're then tended to by a attentive crew, from food/drink delivery, to bussing, etc. Their was an Asian woman floating around (manager?) who was so sweet and helpful. Afterwards as they were clearing out the bakery case close to brunch close, my sweet tooth hit for something to-go...she nicely suggested a few things that were left - I grabbed pot de crème and slice of strawberry pie, both delicious.All in all, had a nice brunch here and will be back. The line moved fairly quickly and I liked their efficient way of running things despite it getting pretty packed, I'm sure at every brunch. But the good spirits of the staff was really what made my experience here."
11/23/2020,20201123,4,4.36,"*Pre-Covid Review*Be prepared to wait a good minute if you're dining in, however, the popularity of Republique really lives up to the hype. Please note that no matter if you're going for brunch or dinner, this place will be packed. I've been here a handful of times with my fiancé and we've always had a great experience! When you enter, you'll see all of these delicious pastries on your right hand side. You can order pastries at the counter and have them delivered to your table, order at the table, or order at the end and take it to go. Once you pass the pastry display and make your way to the seating area, you'll see that it's open concept (meaning you can watch bakers baking the bread, people cooking, slicing, dicing, etc.) the seating is a mix between community style tables, and a few two/four seaters scattered around. The interior is stunning, and lining the walls are clear jars containing numerous spices. Idk y'all it really sets the mood for me.For brunch, i recommend the breakfast sandwich (it doesn't come with sides) or the chicken and waffle paired with a mimosa or their pear spritz! they have quiches available as well if that's more your vibe. They offer specialty drinks, fresh juices (in case you're craving avocado toast and a green juice), coffee, and tea. Drink recommendations:- vietnamese latte- okinawa latte- golden milk latteRepublique is great for:- breakfast and brunch- dinner- coffee and dessert- ordering pastries, cakes, and pies for gatherings/bday/anniversaries"
11/28/2020,20201128,4,4.36,"Love this place from the breakfasts served until two to the lunch ,pastries ,and incredible dinners you cant go wrong at this destinatiin place."
12/2/2020,20201202,5,4.36,"Best bakery spot in LA, hands down.Marg Manzke really knows her stuff!! Having been to Paris and tried authentic French pastries, her baked goods can absolutely compete with the best. I even bought a copy of her book because of how much I love these pastries.Personal favorites:-tomato & zaatar croissant (haven't seen this offering too often, so snatch it up if you ever see it)-Caneles-crime brûlée cheesecake-Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake- BEST CAKE I EVER HAD.Their brunch food is quite excellent as well; I've tried the kimchi fried rice, the shakshuka, the French toast, the soft shell crab, the burger... they're all pricey, but solid! But in my personal opinion nothing even comes close to the quality and value of the pastries here. Grab a coffee and a croissant and you're set!Establishment is beautiful on the inside. Unfortunately, COVID restrictions won't allow indoor dining, so... hoping to eat inside again one day!"
12/2/2020,20201202,4,4.36,"Delicious but pricey. They charge for almond/soy milk. For covid, they opened an entire tarped area on the side of the restaurant. There is also seating on the front patio. My friend said this was her favorite place for french toast so I had to try it. It was okay, I didn't really like the softness and thickness of it. I loved the kimchi fried rice. I would definitely go back for that. I had a vietnamese latte since I don't see any other place using condensed milk in their coffees. Overall, I would go back again. This is probably my 3rd or 4th visit to this restaurant over the years. Kimchi fried rice!"
12/5/2020,20201205,5,4.36,"Years later, Republiqué remains one of my favorite brunch places. From flaky croissants to kimchi fried rice, their pastries and their hot dishes are consistent and offer exactly what you'd expect from a popular brunch spot in L.A. If you're a pastry person, this is one place you have to visit. If you're into specialty coffee (and other) drinks, they offer a good variety. It's cozy inside, and even on the busiest of days, the staff remains friendly."
12/5/2020,20201205,5,4.37,"The picture definitely doesn't do République's delicious pastries justice. All amazing, yet the cheesecake and chewy cookies were the brightest stars. Reminded me of Olive et Gourmando in Montreal.Pick anything and you won't be disappointed, just make sure it's decadent!"
12/5/2020,20201205,1,4.36,"What a mess! Avoid at all costs. Instead of normal take out, they use a ""cattle call"" approach. We are at least 40, maybe 50 people waiting on the sidewalk for the 6:00 'call'. We loved Republique, came here often, we want them to stay in business. But this system is total nuts. If you love them as much as we do, stay away until the get the logistics under control."
12/9/2020,20201209,5,4.36,"Thank you so much for taking such wonderful care of our family during our visit to your wonderful Restaurant. I observed that the staff were so very accommodating and informed about our special dietary needs. The place was also very cleaned and organized. I couldn't ask for more from you, guys! Highly recommended!"
12/10/2020,20201210,5,4.36,Love this place thanks so much for the service Happy holidays best of luck to you will be back again
12/11/2020,20201211,5,4.36,"Republique never disappoints! It's one of my top picks for brunches in LA, always top notch food and beautiful, instagrammable photos to complement the dining experience here.I'm really glad I was able to squish one last outdoor dining meal here. They had a great setup that was COVID friendly with adequate space between each party along with quick and efficient ordering. Luckily, there wasn't any problem finding a table to dine at during Sunday brunch. Some of my favorite picks here include: - Kimchi fried rice- Mushroom toast- Smoked salmon tartine- Regular breakfastTheir bread, butter, and jam are so delicious and addicting! They have valet parking available or you can try to find street parking. Great spot!"
12/18/2020,20201218,5,4.36,I really like this place. It is located in one of the more unique buildings in the area and it has a nice patio area. The menu and pastry options are also pretty impressive.
12/19/2020,20201219,5,4.37,Ordered the dinner for two for takeout during Covid. Super easy pickup. Just pulled into the parking lot (plenty of spaces) and they had my order waiting for me all organized and labeled nicely in a big box for ease of carrying. Dinner menu included with warming instructions for a couple of the hot plates which was key. The Hawaiian kanpachi crudo was delicious with the Thai Curry sauce and basil. Pear salad with greens came with a lemon quince vinaigrette. Don't put too much dressing on which I did. Probs could've saved one of the dressing packets as there was a lot. They gave us a whole order of a baguette which was divine and came with yummy butter. Menu said it would include smoked eel rillete which was missing but we still enjoyed it. On the star of the show...the venison pasta was to die for. Absolutely delicious. Better than most Italian restaurants known for their pasta! There was so much we shared one portion and saved the rest for the next day. Lamb was good. We didn't have room for the dessert but it came with financiers AND pumpkin spice muffins for the morning after! Absolutely amazing takeout experience and worth the $$$$. Forgot how much I love this place. Will be going back again for next date night.
12/20/2020,20201220,5,4.37,Ordered covid take-outIncluded rack of lamb and venison Ragout pasta. Everything included in the meal was delicious. Heated up nicely at home. Although we can't enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant I thought it was still worth the money.
12/31/2020,20201231,5,4.37,"Republique came highly recommended by manus friends and family members . Even our first experience was excellent. From the outside, it's very hard for anyone to form an image of whatsa inside this restaurant and may be this is the reason, we never visited this place before. But when you enter this place, you will find this place packed. Obviously this place is not cheap but the quality of foods is superb. As we shared Verity of appetizers, main course and desserts, I am sure everything here is very tasty. If you talk about service. It's amazing and our server ( Courtenay ) was extremely informative about the meal through the time. The whole night was well spend with beautiful ambience and service. In short, we had a pretty grey dinning experience and I will definitely be back soon."
1/5/2021,20210105,4,4.37,"Food: There is definitely reason as to why this place has more than 4,000 reviews at 4 stars. There's a good amount of dishes that deserves the recognition it receives, but there aren't others that don't. I had originally bookmarked this place to try out their Uni toast, but they do not serve this option on their brunch menu. So, I might have to come back for that at a later date and time. As for brunch, my friends and I ordered, 2 kimchi fried rice dishes, 1 regular breakfast, 1 mushroom toast, and 1 brioche french toast. First off, I could understand why people are in love with the brioche french toast because it tastes like a buttery cloud in your mouth - but I don't think I'd come back for it for $15. It doesn't come with any fruit or anything, just a side of syrup. Secondly, I really liked the mushroom toast because all the components complimented each other very well. It definitely inspired me to cook up my own version. The kimchi fried rice was delicious, which I noticed was everyone's go-to. I love the little kick from the red chilies they incorporated into the dish, while the poached eggs really hugged all the flavors together. The bits of short rib also added onto the savory and wholesome goodness. Lastly, the regular breakfast had a little bit of everything if you want more of a mix of different breakfast items, but again, it's not something that really stands out. It included two eggs, a piece of a baguette, potatoes, and thick cut of bacon. Although the jam was really good, I think this dish fell short on something I probably wouldn't recommend as a ""must-have"" through referral marketing. Would definitely skip out on this dish too. All in all, everything was great but some were not worth the price paid for the quality. Service: My friends and I went during brunch. The wait time was about 30 minutes on a Saturday around 1pm. Our food was met at a timely manner - except our 2 orders kimchi fried rice. I kid you not, our first set of food arrived maybe 15-20 minutes after ordering. I kept asking different waiters if there was something going on with all fried rice orders to have caused a delay on ours. Unfortunately, our kimchi fried rice arrived probably 30 minutes after. It was followed by an, ""I'm sorry about that .."" from a runner. I wasn't too upset even though I was super hungry, but this definitely put a damper on my thoughts on service. It also would've been helpful to know that (I believe) a 3% health care surcharge for employees. I didn't mind the idea so much, but I wish I'd known sooner because it would've affected the gracious tip I had given. Their prices are appallingly high for certain dishes (like the regular breakfast $19 and brioche French toast at $15), but I assume it's because of the area it resides it. I opted out from ordering a drink because my bill had already rung up to close to $60 for 2 people. And yes, parking sucks as it does all over LA. You only have the option of valet parking (or street parking if you're lucky) which is $8 during lunch time (I think $11-13 during dinner), so make sure to keep some cash in handy. I had the inconvenience of having to walk to the nearest gas station to pull out some cash with a fee of $1.75 - of course. But again, just another venture. Ambiance: During brunch, there was a line out the door. It was set-up so that you had to order first then sit down. The ambiance was definitely alluring. The place reminded me of a glimpse out of a Harry Potter novel with high ceilings and beautiful lights that would make it seem like you were walking through a an alleyway in London. In farthest room, the walls were covered in shelving for bottles of different types of wine, which I thought was unique. The tables and chairs were pretty simple, not anything meant to be comfortable. I would suggest if there was a way they could include purse holders under their tables because I had to try and enjoy my food with my backpack resting on top of my feet so it didn't touch the ground."
1/17/2021,20210117,5,4.37,"(A pre-COVID, belated review.)République is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I can't speak to the dinner experience, as I've only been for brunch, but I can solidly rave about both the mushroom toast and the french toast. Their pastries are insanely good, too. I recommend asking their friendly staff for recommendations. The raspberry pistachio pastry remains the best pastry I've had in Los Angeles. The bread pudding, while it looks beautiful and sells out quickly, was very good but not as mesmerizing as the other dishes. I also didn't particularly enjoy my coffee. But the quality of everything else at République is so outstanding that I couldn't possibly complain."
1/19/2021,20210119,3,4.37,"The food is good but not really ever worth the long wait or the cost. I feel like there are many many other breakfast places to go for cheaper with food that is just as good. Honestly nothing wrong with the place, but this is all I think about every time a girlfriend wants to go. A place to be ""seen"". Also have not been during coronavirus. This is based on previous life."
1/19/2021,20210119,5,4.37,"Republique is hands down the best spot to indulge in yummy food! Not only is the food fresh, well prepared, and out of this world, the customer service is exceptional! I bring anyone and everyone here. I wish there were more restaurants that were as intentional, and well executed as Republique!"
1/20/2021,20210120,5,4.37,"Ahh République (sigh)....how I miss thee.I had the opportunity of going to République right before COVID came to be our new reality. Let me start by saying I can still taste the deliciousness of that morning's breakfast. The pictures really don't do the food nor the building justice. This place is an absolute treasure. Upon walking in, you find yourself transported, it seems, to a French provincial locale. With rows of communal tables, an open kitchen and a rear 2 story dining room, the place is magic. It's an architectural beauty with a rich Old Hollywood history--it was once the domain of Charlie Chaplin.The food is delectable. Each dish is truly mouthwatering and done to perfection. They've managed to make even the simplest of dishes look spectacular. An absolute favorite was the Chia Seed Pudding, which upon arrival looked almost too good to eat. You will definitely find it difficult to stop yourself from ordering too much as everything on the menu sounds amazing, and I can vouch that they truly are. République is a rare find, and I'm eagerly awaiting its reopening. Definitely worth checking this place out if you haven't been."
1/27/2021,20210127,5,4.37,"(pre covid review) I love republique! The restaurant shifts beautifully from a wonderful brunch spot to a romantic date night spot. While the menu can seem a bit pricey, all the food is carefully made and presented, making every dish worthy of coming back for. They are ALWAYS bumping so make sure you make a rez for dinner and/or don't mind waiting in line for your am french toast."
2/3/2021,20210203,4,4.37,"Coffee and pastry were great. I loved pastry so much, that packed a few additional items to go :) My main choice for breakfast was mushroom toast, and it was good, but nothing special."
2/4/2021,20210204,5,4.37,"So few places live up to the hype, but Republique actually does. It's located in the old & charming Campanile/La Brea Bakery space . I've only ordered items from the bakery during COVID and everything was scrumptious. Now that Republique has opened up again, I'm looking forward to ordering some grub!"
2/12/2021,20210212,4,4.37,Came here for breakfast during the week. No lines. Parking valet for $8.50. No lines. Fresh baked goods. Loved my croque madame. Outdoor dining open. Best to come here during the week. Will be back. Great bombolinis!! Love the crepe brûlée bombilini. Trust.
2/13/2021,20210213,5,4.37,"An exciting brunch location in Los Angeles! This was on our list of recommendations to stop by while visiting the city. We managed to find parking nearby and walked over. There was a small line to stand on to place your order. From there you find a table and the staff will bring you your order. While waiting on line you can view all the pastries that are available. You can't help but be enticed to add two or three more items to your list.We managed to come slightly after the brunch rush. I heard that on most weekends the line is out the door. The interior of this restaurant is gorgeous. I love the spacious seating and the architectural design. You sit under the skylight atrium which creates a great ambiance. A great place to enjoy a wonderful meal with friends.We ordered several dishes. We ordered the Brioche French Toast, Breakfast Sandwich, Fried Chicken and Waffle, Croque Madame, and some fruit on the side. All food items were delicious. I did enjoy the Iced Hikari Matcha Green Tea which was amazing. As some of the other reviews have stated, food portions could be on the smaller side. This is where you can order an additional pastry to keep you company.Overall, a great place for brunch and I plan to return once things get somewhat to normal!"
2/15/2021,20210215,5,4.37,"French toast is probably the best I've ever had! So soft inside and very flavorful even without any syrup. The French Omelet is tender and soft. The Chia seed pudding is refreshing and fruits in it are all fresh and sweet.The patio looks nice, with good distance between tables. Will definitely come back."
2/16/2021,20210216,5,4.37,"i have always been a fan of Republique. but i just hadn't gotten the chance to give them a review until now. i was recently here, during the super bowl weekend because LA now starts doing outdoor dining again after 2 months of stay-at-home order.the dishes that i never skipped are kimchi fried rice, french toast and mushroom toast. those 3 are my go to because they taste like heaven. i have never been to heaven before, but i just know it tastes like that. loleverything here is just excellent, even their pastries are good too. i don't have anything bad to say about them. will i be back? hell yeahhh."
2/18/2021,20210218,5,4.38,"Food was delish! Anything from the menu, starting from the pastry to the food was great! Only thing was the cashier was not as friendly as u would think but otherwise staff were all good. Definitely recommend! Valet is available for restaurant outdoor dining. Loved it!"
2/25/2021,20210225,5,4.38,The Friday night pre fixe menu was lovely. The duck was divine. Everything was delicious and filling. So nice to finally get out and have dinner outside.
3/1/2021,20210301,5,4.38,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. Got lucky with street parking on Sunday morning even though they do valet. You get waved in once there's enough space and then go to the outdoor seating area. Limited amount of outdoor seating available. The food is always fantastic and no matter what I order I am always delighted with my meal! Our server Joanna was fantastic: young and energetic, happy and polite, and made the best recommendations. Our group ordered the Belgium waffles, regular breakfast, an assortment of pastries, with an americano, and matcha green tea latte with almond milk. Can't wait to return and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to eat in Los Angeles."
3/4/2021,20210304,5,4.38,"Republique is notorious for its brunch menu. For good reason! Classy, sleek and modern decor is matched by outstanding, high quality food. I brunched here a couple of times pre-COVID and was blown away by everything I tried: French toast, ricotta toast, & avocado toast (I'm not trying to hide my love of bread!) are all delicious. Also cannot go wrong with the burger or steak frites. During COVID, my girlfriend and I ordered their Friday night 3 course to-go dinner. Our chicken dinner was delicious but I must admit the experience of getting take-out was lacking. The food is better when it doesn't have to travel. Also the restaurant itself is beautiful with its high ceilings and warm ambiance. Somehow my food looked less impressive packed into containers and my tiny tiramisu crammed into a plastic cup was sad. It didn't quite cut it. The food was tasty but I wouldn't pay $100 for that to-go meal again. Glad I supported them during Covid-19 but I'm looking forward to going back when everything is safe and completely re-opened. Eat my chicken dinner as God intended."
3/4/2021,20210304,4,4.38,The kimchi friend rice is a little bit spicy but it is so good! I also recommend getting some pastries on your way out. Cute atmosphere and good service
3/4/2021,20210304,5,4.38,"My favorite restaurant in LA. Excellent wine list, unparalleled food, and the kindest--most accommodating staff. I was an hour and a half late to my reservation and the extremely sweet hostess still found us a table within their sold out booking. Katie was one of the best servers I've ever had. She paired our wine to our meal (and honestly I am so picky about wine so I was a bit nervous) and nailed it. She also was super attentive and made the experience so light hearted and wonderful. Best food in town. Don't skimp on the normandy butter, it's worth every penny--especially if you dust with salt."
3/5/2021,20210305,5,4.38,"PERFECTION!! Went there for my sisters birthday and we tried a couple of things. The pastries were all amazing, even my nieces loved it. The service was amazing. Would recommend for any occasion. We did go on a Friday in the morning. There wasn't a lot of people there. I hear it gets super busy later in the afternoon and on weekends."
3/6/2021,20210306,4,4.38,The Regular Breakfast is really good but the service was pretty standard. Price was reasonable.
3/6/2021,20210306,5,4.38,Best restaurant in LA. Done. Sold. Never misses. Great food. Great drinks. Great service. Long may it prosper.
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.38,This is one of my favorite restaurants in LA. The service is incredible and I love the atmosphere. Highly recommend!
3/11/2021,20210311,5,4.39,"I went last weekend with my girlfriend for Brunch.It was the first time since the pandemic started so we weren't sure about service and sitting situation but they have a great arrangement.You wait in line (it goes by fast) and place your order, and then you go grab a seat in this outside sitting area that they created out of the valet parking lot. It's semi-covered and pleasant.Food came out fast and it was super delicious as ever.Highly recommended!"
3/12/2021,20210312,5,4.39,"The five stars is for doing business during Covid. Thanks for risking your lives so I can eat under your canopy.We dined under a canopy during a windy day. We felt adequately sheltered.The food was fresh, good, and delicious.  My salad had butternut squash and a variety of grilled mushrooms, nuts and grains. It felt too healthy compared to my dining partners with 2 inch thick bacon steaks. But who says you are going to die of a heart attack. You might get hit by a car so go ahead and enjoy the bacon."
3/13/2021,20210313,1,4.38,"So I really had the worst experience here. The line situation outside is so poorly executed. We waited in the first line just to be told it's to sit at a table and we have to move to another line to order. I asked a girl in the OTHER line if it indeed was the place to order. She said,""no just for pastries."" We saw the family that pulled into valet behind us at the time we got there walk past us and go inside and order. So we did just that and told the girl at the desk our order, I explained my confusion she was very sweet and said not to worry about it I am there and she will take my order. A woman who was waiting behind us came inside and was extremely rude and aggressive and said we had cut her off. The manager came around and wanted us to go to the back of the line for a third time! This was the worst dining experience I've ever had and I never even tried the food."
3/15/2021,20210315,4,4.38,"5 stars for the food and great outdoor setup under a canopy. But 4 stars for the really long wait and adequate service We came at 11am on a Saturday, which seemed to be the absolute busiest time for brunch. We waited at least 30 minutes to get to the counter to order and pay, and another 10 minutes to be seated. The line was shorter both before we got there and after we were seated, so I would recommend coming as early as uou can on a weekend. After we finished eating (about 45 minutes), we were asked to leave to open up the table for others. The location offers valet parking ($8.50 for brunch, $11 for dinner). Kudos to the skilled valet driver for fitting lots of cars into tight spaces! Despite the long wait, I would definitely come back again for the pastries and yummy brunch items. The smoked salmon Benedict ($21) was the star - the salmon was tasty and light, the eggs were poached to perfection, the jalapeño Hollandaise added a great kick, and the bread had an unexpected buttery sweetness. We also got a few pastries and my favorite was the fruit brioche tart. The tartness and citrus of the blood oranges and grapefruit offset the sweetness of the filling and pastry really nicely."
3/17/2021,20210317,4,4.38,"Republique is a household name in the LA brunch scene and I'm so happy I finally got to try it! They have a very organized ordering and table service system during covid. We lined up for a while on a Saturday morning but it was worth the wait!I love their variety of pastries and couldn't decide which one to get. We loved everything we got especially the thai tea cream puffs! Absolutely amazing. The bombolinis turned out underwhelming as they weren't filled! Kind of disappointing since it defeats the whole point of what a bombolini is.For our dishes, we tried their chicken and waffles which is really delicious! Easily one of the best ones I've tried. On the other hand, I got another disappointing dish in their pork belly sausage sandwich which is a sad use for a pork belly. I could really pick a better order next time.Overall, loved Republique and if I just had smarter choices, I'd give this rating a 5. We'll definitely be back to try their cakes and ever-changing pastry menu."
3/18/2021,20210318,5,4.38,"Along with Koko Head Cafe in Oahu, this is my FAVORITE Brunch place. Ironic that neither place is where I currently live sigh.But if I lived in LA, I'd be here EVERY WEEK. Maybe EVERY DAY.Amazingly delicious everything. Not only are their gorgeous healthy options - the chia seed pudding - SO GOOD.But their desserts are also perfect. I want to eat everything here. The service was lovely and the space is gorgeous as well."
3/19/2021,20210319,5,4.38,"We were in Los Angeles last week and dined here once for dinner and once for brunch. Absolutely delicious. I'm trying to figure out how to make their cauliflower dish at home, but I know I'll never be able to make it the same way. For dinner they brought us a complimentary mushroom soup which was divine--super smooth light texture with fantastic flavor. Such a treat. Fish special for dinner cooked perfectly and the quality of the fish was fantastic. Brunch was absolutely yummy. Fresh pastries which were worth the calories followed by an extraordinary herb omelette. And my latte was super rich and flavorful. Service was great also. We eat out a lot-- and this restaurant was a real treat to eat at. Cannot wait to go back!"
3/20/2021,20210320,5,4.38,"My buddy & I stopped to eat here before my flight back to Virginia. The ambiance, food & staff was amazing! There are so many desserts & pastries to chose from... I wished I lived closer because I would try them all!"
3/24/2021,20210324,2,4.38,"I'm happy to give my money to any business. But my sister was in town and made a reservation here and I had asked her to change the reservation for something earlier. She told me she actually wanted to cancel the reservation but they would charge her for canceling. This was hours before the reservation. She was from out of town and it not only gave her a bad impression of LA but it didn't allow her to eat at a place she really wanted to go. The food was good, yet very overpriced. Did not need to spend 12 dollars on two cubes of goat cheese and 28 dollars on a small portion of cacio e pepe. Our server seemed annoyed but given the masks he has to wear and the circumstance of the situation I understood. I only wish my sister was allowed to cancel the reservation."
3/25/2021,20210325,3,4.37,"Disappointed in the overall experience. The bus boy help staff were rude, snooty and unwelcoming-- their overall vibe was that they were unhappy to be working. Know your place! Patio dining only avail with no gas to ignite the patio heater during a cold afternoon. I walked to get my own to-go container as no one was willing to help. Because I enjoy the food, I wont bother dining in with my fam again. The $8:50 parking (no option to self park in the lot) is just the last draw."
3/25/2021,20210325,4,4.37,"It is pricey, but it is near Beverly Hills and it is LA. While your here take a look at all the antique stores around (same street and across the street). Rodeo drive is 5min away. The bakery and brunch food and Sangrias were great. I will definitely be back, worth the day trip. You can tell they take a lot of pride in the food and the details/ingredients; the color of the egg yolk was rich and deep orange and their breads with butter were delicious. I want to try their french dinner sometime."
3/27/2021,20210327,5,4.37,"Amazing. That's it, no other comment needed. Maybe a little pricey but totally worth it."
3/28/2021,20210328,5,4.38,"This place is amazing. Originally, the interior is what sold me on trying this place... luckily the food is incredible as well! Highly recommend."
3/31/2021,20210331,5,4.38,"Their outdoor dining is spacious and all of the tables are actually at a 6 feet distance which I appreciate. Service was great, my boyfriend and I got our drinks right when we sat down after ordering inside the store. I bought a whole bunch of pastries and I highly recommend the kouign amann, chocolate caramel cake, and vanilla canele! The kouign amann looks very boring but I assure you that this pastry is loaded with butter and sugar wrapped up in a crisp shell. I ordered the Croque Madame and it was very yummy. Overall I would definitely come back."
3/31/2021,20210331,1,4.37,"I'd love to say I had a pleasant experience here, but unfortunately, that's not the case. I walked in a couple of minutes after 2 p.m., and a taller brunette guy who worked there immediately told me they were closed and couldn't serve me. I was totally fine with that-hours are hours after all. But as soon as I left, another lady came strolling in, and he allowed her to buy something.When the lady came back outside, my friend politely asked the woman if she had ordered in advance. She said no and that he hadn't even mentioned they were closed. It was bizarre, and because of that, I definitely won't be spending my money there again. If there is a rule, it should be for everyone."
3/31/2021,20210331,4,4.37,"I highly recommend Republique for brunch but do not recommend for dinner. Dinner is overpriced and service is slow, but brunch the space is airy and bright and the pastries are to die for!"
4/1/2021,20210401,1,4.36,"Republique - just, no.I really wanted to like you! The hubs and I came here for an early lunch, and we were pretty stoked that there wasn't too long of a line during the lunch rush; you weave through the bakery, place your order & pay at the bakery, and grab a spot in the main dining area.I had heard about their popular dish, the Kimchi Fried Rice - this came with beef short rib, pickled radish, sesame seeds, and soft poached eggs. Honestly, this was just not good. There was absolutely no flavor to this dish; the kimchi was not fermented enough, the beef short rib was not tender and was not marinated, and the rice was wet and overcooked - EEKS! Just because you slap some kimchi pieces on a dish doesn't make it 'Korean'!After the first bite, this was pushed aside and not touched again.We also tried the Mushroom Toast (with house-cured ham, spinach, hollandaise, red wine sauce, and scrambled eggs) and the Steak Frites (which came with a grilled 7 oz flat iron steak, french fries, and topped with béarnaise sauce); both these dishes also had no flavor and were also left on the table.The offerings are not that cheap either, but considering the hype of this place, the prices just did not add up.Super disappointed, but glad I was able to give this place a try.Limited street parking in the area.+bland and non-seasoned food+avoid the Kimchi Fried Rice!+order and pay at the bakery+limited street parking"
4/3/2021,20210403,5,4.36,"Warning: biased review based on special memory dining experience. My s/o treated me to the chef's prixe fix tasting menu (extended) for our anniversary celebration. This was my first time dining here at night, as I had only been here once for brunch before. He had the wine pairing and I had a glass lol- just one based off the chef's recommendations because Indont drink much these days. The entire menu is both local and seasonal inspired fare with french style preparation and presentation. I swear if it wasn't for my boyfriend I wouldn't be exposed to finer dining cuisine and experiences! Everything was delectable and delicious. What felt like 15 courses left us feeling very satisfied, pleased, and excited. It sounds like a lot but the plates are petite and close to bite sized, with the whole experience lasting about 3 hours! It was wonderful, and felt very European and social in such an intimate setting. The hosts, servers and sommelier were all friendly and helpful. What a memorable anniversary dinner!"
4/3/2021,20210403,1,4.36,"Ordered the Breakfast Frittata for pickup this morning. Attaching the menu description from their Square order page, which says ""burrata cheese, broccoli di cicco, calabrian chili, arugula, parmesan cheese"". What I received had asparagus instead of broccoli di cicco (see photo). I consider myself the opposite of a picky eater (I eat all kinds of offal, insects, food that has fallen on the ground) but asparagus is my least favorite food of all time. I was not called to be notified of the substitution (something I've experienced ordering to-go at many other restaurants when a substitution needs to be made), so I don't think it is outrageous to assume that what is on the ordering page is supposed to be accurate. What if I had an allergy to asparagus?I think I am most annoyed by this because asparagus stems and broccoli stems do look similar, so it almost feels like they tried to pull a fast one on two similar ingredients, thinking that their patrons do not have a discerning enough palate to know the difference.Haven't even sampled all the items I ordered today yet, but the other items I tried were mediocre."
4/5/2021,20210405,5,4.36,"This place is my to-go brunch/cafe place in LA area. Their food is delicious, never disappointing! My favorite is always Shakshouka, but their Kimchi Fried Rice is also unbeatable! Dont forget to also order their desserts because you will never regret having them! Very delicious, the taste just hits right.. not too sweet, not too bland, not too creamy. All perfect & this place is highly recommended!"
4/5/2021,20210405,5,4.36,"I went here for brunch on a pretty busy Saturday afternoon, and was impressed with the food and overall atmosphere of this place. The architecture and ambiance of the inside of this restaurant is unlike anything I've seen, which really adds to the whole experience! The food was great and brought out fairly quickly. You must also try their drinks, we had the mimosa and sangria and were not disappointed!Will definitely be coming back here, but maybe on a weekday when it is less crowded."
4/6/2021,20210406,4,4.36,"Quick SummarySolid food and drinks, but I wouldn't say it is in another league for your brunch spots. Good coffee, solid food, but it's more about the ambiance when you come to Republique (ie people watching). There is usually a line, but service is pretty quick and the line moves.Food- 4 starsKimchi fried rice- this was good, but probably a one-and-done for me. Good, heavy flavor (especially with how solid they make their eggs), but wasn't phenomenal (which I kind of expected for the $21 price tag)Cubano- this was solid and I would come back to get it. Preferred it over the kimchi fried ricePastries- we shared the seasonable mango cream pie and strawberry cream puff. This along with the caramel latte and Vietnamese latte were solid and I enjoyed every bite of it. Would recommend ordering the caramel latte if you want to go on the less sweeter side. The pastries and coffee were the main attractionsService- 4 starsThe wait wasn't too long as they were very efficient with the workflow, and the cashiers are pretty informative about their menu. They are pretty catering to those waiting for a table though; less than 1 minute after we finished our food, our table was cleared and encouraged to make way for the next guests. (I mean I understand, but didn't even get a chance to finish our waters before it was taken away)ParkingValet and street parking available. Definitely busy around La Brea but available to find street if you're willing to be patientBottom LinePaying a slight premium for the food, but it's solid quality. I wouldn't say it's a must-try LA establishment, but you're definitely going to get the desired LA brunch experience here at Republique"
4/7/2021,20210407,5,4.36,"I couldn't be more satisfied! Unfortunately the indoor dining is not possible during the pandemic, the decor here is really classical! Can't complain anything, just try all of it!"
4/9/2021,20210409,3,4.36,French toast was the best thing here! Chicken and waffles were not the best I'v had but decent. Way too expensive for what we ordered but at least the portion sizes are huge.
4/15/2021,20210415,4,4.36,"This review is for the fabulous brunch we had at Republique for my birthday. Its first come first serve so you just have to queue and then wait for your turn and the restaurant is pretty spacious so even on Sunday we got a table pretty quick. You order when you turn comes in queue and then get assigned a table so there is no wait on your cheque later when you are done. I opted for a cappuccino and a lobster french omelette that comes with a side salad. My friend got the simple french omelette and a chia seed pudding. My loved my rich lobster-filled omelette but the chia seed pudding surely stole the show. If you are trying to be healthy but still want something desserty, order this! My first experience at Republique a few years ago was a nightmare but this visit definetly redeemed this popular LA spot for me again. Cant wait to come back and try their baked goods."
4/15/2021,20210415,3,4.35,"I've been here several times for coffee and nosh. Only once for a meal. The menu seemed out of touch, an esoteric sheet with no sense or regards to food and drink. Everything on the menu had someone's name...even the butter ""RODOLPHE LE MEUNIER BUTTER"" as if it mattered.When dining out, what do I expect??? A straightforward, perfectly prepared meal made with ingredients of a very high order and cost will not be the overriding consideration. Republique fools you with the ambiance and attitude and doesn't deliver or warrant the curatorial care and concern the menu lavishes on the food.We're seeing an increasing number of restaurants that pointedly seek to épater la bourgeoisie with decor and facade. But in this price range, the meal should be all about the food, not the bourgeois trappings. My steak ($65) came with ""potato mousseline"" meaning mashed potatoes and peppercorn sauce.  A good steak has an even spread of marbling all over the beef. Chop houses age their beef to improve the tenderness of the cut and intensify the flavor. There's a lot of room for disagreement about what cut, seasoning or cooking technique is the best, this steak did not stand out.The Campanelle was served almost at room temperature which I hate. The pasta and lobster may not be at precise level of doneness you expect or desire. When paying $42 for pasta, I expect $42 pasta.When on the outside looking in, there is a perceived preciousness in the food. When on the inside looking down at your plate, you see an artful mixing of the high and the low."

4/18/2021,20210418,5,4.36,"I have always had the need to try République but don't live too close to LA but on this occasion I was celebrating my girlfriends 21st birthday so I decided to take a small trip and take her out to brunch. I ordered the Croque Madame and my GF ordered the Eggs Benedict and we also ordered 2 mimosas, (which according to the server, has more per glass than if you were to order a small carafe so that was very helpful on his behalf). Needless to say, the food was amazing, well-balanced and left me with the urge to try other dishes on my next visit. The price can be pricey but worth every penny. République did not disappoint."
4/18/2021,20210418,3,4.35,"Came here for brunch. Brunch was good so I came back for dinner. Dinner was just ok. What really annoyed me was our server whose name begins with K said she would ""make sure we ordered an appropriate amount of food"" and then proceeded to be very pushy with getting us to order more food. We had finished putting in our order and she said we needed to order more so we felt pressured to add 3 more dishes. We ended up getting more food than we could handle. I did not appreciate that."
4/19/2021,20210419,5,4.35,"In the three days we were in LA we found ourselves having breakfast here twice. Their pastries are phenomenal. The croque madame, chicken and waffles and fried rice all hit the spot. I wouldn't recommend the avocado toast, it's alright but I've had better elsewhere in LA."
4/20/2021,20210420,5,4.36,"If you're looking for French pastries, cakes and other desserts that's nothing but delicious and well-baked, then this is the place for you. I keep coming back here for their kouign-amann, canele, croissants, financiers, their tarts and cakes that varies from time to time. My last visit, I had a slice of their Basque burnt cheesecake and I couldn't forget and stop thinking about it after savoring my last bite. I hope Republique will continue to bake high quality baked goods."
4/21/2021,20210421,5,4.36,My daughter and myself visited here while on our trip to California from Illinois. What a gorgeous space. The staff was very friendly and the egg Benedict's were amazing. A def must visit in California!
4/21/2021,20210421,5,4.36,"Mmmmmm! The mimosas were so good. My breakfast was also very good. I have 0 complaints. Everything went so smooth. We were worried because they are a first come, first served restaurant, but there was no wait when we arrived."
4/22/2021,20210422,3,4.35,"This place has good food but considering the long wait and the type of service that they're cooking up over here I wasn't super impressed. You have barely any good parking, you end up waiting 45 minutes and then another 20 minutes for your food to actually come I just don't see why I would want to come back."
4/25/2021,20210425,5,4.36,"Came here on a Saturday evening for the fixed menu dinner. Everything was fantastic in terms of quality and quantity of food. There was a good variety of seafood (oyster, caviar, scallop, sole), vegetables, pasta, and meat, in addition to the spectacular steaming baguette straight out of the oven with delicious butter. The dessert was delicious as well and not too sweet. Overall, it was a really great value, excellent food at reasonable price for LA."
4/26/2021,20210426,5,4.36,This is one of my favorite places to eat! Both lunch and dinner are amazing. You can't go wrong ordering anything on this menu and the service is impeccable! It's a must!
4/27/2021,20210427,5,4.36,"First time here. And I will definitely be back!! This place is amazing!! Everything changes daily which is refreshing to see. We sat outside. Well aerated, well staffed. Tabpes are not close together by any means.. outdoor heaters kept the temperature even. Everyone is masked with signs that say if not eating or drinking please keep mask on. Staff was masked with no hint of anyone taking their mask off. Our server was knowledgeable and very helpful. Asked if we needed anything but was perfectly present. Hard balance to strike but she did it gracefully. Got the agnolloti. Oh em gee, amazing! It was incredible. The brown sugar, the mint, ah perfection!The berry tiramasu was really good and that is hard for me to say as everything is chocolate to me and that had no chocolate in it which says a lot. The inside is pretty cool to see too. Maybe next time we will dine indoors"
4/27/2021,20210427,5,4.36,My wife bought me here for my birthday and boy was it awesome. Great ambiance and energy. Service is top notch. The food was incredible and the drinks set the mood. The tuna tartare is a must as is the gem salad. The duck was great if you're okay with a bit gamey as duck should be; the kumquats and orange sauce balanced it out nicely. The agnolotti was awesome. Go and enjoy!
4/27/2021,20210427,4,4.36,"Another amazing breakfast!!! I came to the shop after a doctor visit and I was very exited. The shop has less crowd than before. I ordered the usual Breakfast and I couldn't wait to try. The look matched its name a "" regular breakfast"" but it was just the beginning. The bread was good as it baked it own and the jam and butter were good. The pouch eggs were amazingly good and the baked and stirred fired potatoes were ten out of ten! They might have changed the way they cooked but this time I liked it. It was crispy on the outside but so soft from the inside. Last but not least, was the bacon streak. It tells you how much they care for their products. It is salty and fatty to the perfection!! The only reason I didn't give it a five stars is the butter. It changed somehow and it is not so ""flavorful"". It could be my taste but I will try again for sure."
4/27/2021,20210427,5,4.36,"My favorite breakfast/brunch restaurants. Everything here is absolutely delicious. Not to mention, the building is beautiful. Tons of indoor and outdoor seating."
4/28/2021,20210428,5,4.36,"Republique is an LA institution, offering cuisine that I can best describe as ""California French"". Chefs Walter and Margarita Manzke utilize classic techniques and seasonal ingredients to create breakfast, lunch, and (pre-fixe and a la carte) dinner menus, as well as a stunning bakery case. The interior is beautiful, with a well preserved old world Spanish vibe, and lots of natural light. I came here with my sister in law for brunch, and were in agreeance that it was the best meal we've had in a long time. I got the Potato Pancake, a savory, fried nest of finely shredded potato piled with smoked salmon and ample salmon roe (my favorite). On top sat two perfectly poached eggs, creamy hollandaise, and fresh dill. Exquisite. The French Omelette was expertly executed. Filled with nutty gruyere, every bite melts in your mouth. I also loved the Okinawa Latte, which is made with hojicha tea and just the right amount of sugar. Service was friendly and fast. I am already eager to come back."
4/29/2021,20210429,5,4.36,A truly exquisite dining experience! Our server Curtis was phenomenal at guiding us through our dinner. He paired the perfect wines with each course. Each course was beyond delicious! The flavors danced in my palette. A truly unforgettable experience and the perfect ending to my 25th birthday. Oui c'est bon!!! Thank you so much Republiqué
5/1/2021,20210501,5,4.36,"We enjoyed our first meal back at a restaurant fully vaccinated after almost a year away. The service was beyond expectations and the entire staff was so lovely. They follow all precautions to keep everyone as safe as possible. The food was SPECTACULAR! We had several appetizers & plates and shared as a group. The pasta, duck, and Brussels sprouts were all delicious and cooked perfectly. We finished the dinner off with the Strawberry tiramisu & blueberry panna cotta. We'll be coming back again soon."
5/1/2021,20210501,5,4.37,"Lovely restaurant 1 mile from Lacma. I went for breakfast and service was great. Several other reviews suggested that the servers were less than. I didn't have that experience at all. My french toast was phenomenal (it's their specialty for a reason). Order it and enjoy! I bought several bakery items to take home. My son loved all the baked goods. I loved the Basque cheesecake, delicate, rich and divine (yes, all 3). My husband loved the whole grain wheat bread which had a subtle, delicious, earthy sweet taste. Let's call it very good."
5/3/2021,20210503,5,4.37,"Republique has a one of a kind experience.Every dish is explained in detail, as well as given wine pairing suggestions. I now understand why Republique is popular and loved by many.I made a reservation for dinner. All of the staff were friendly and respectful. The food, cocktails, wine, and ambiance of the restaurant space exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this restaurant.I ordered the Charcoal-Grilled Brussels Sprouts, Charcoal-Grilled Beef Short Rib, Sonoma Duck A L'Orange, Dark Chocolate Tart, and the Strawberry Tiramisu."
5/3/2021,20210503,5,4.37,"This place is my husband's favorite restaurant. We have come here for dinner and brunch on numerous occasions. The brunch pastries are always amazing. The creme brulee bombilini are my favorite. I always get the fresh bread with French butter which is delicious and authentic. Dinner menu changes seasonally, I believe, but it's always good. A very consistent quality and the wine selection can't be beat. I did feel the service was rushed and not as welcoming but I think that's because of COVID. Indoor and outdoor seating available."
5/5/2021,20210505,5,4.37,"F O O D:french toast 10/10: if this was my last brunch item on earth before i die, i would choose this. the heavenly goodness of this is unexplainable. get this you will not regret it. the fluffiness, balance of sweet, butteriness. mushroom toast 8/10: something i feel like you can make/get almost anywhere, still delicious though. creamy mushrooms on toast. chicken and waffles 9/10: yummmyyy can't go wrong with this. the mix of protein n carbs, savory and sweet is my cup of tea. flavor of waffle comes through more than chicken though, but for brunch this surprisingly wasn't heavy which is great. D R I N K S:iced viet coffee 9/10: not very authentic but it will do. not strong enough coffee and sweetnessviet latte 9.5/10: still on the lighter side, not as strong, sweet and foamyfreshly squeezed mimosa 10/10: can't go wrong with this, great way to start off the day.S E R V I C E:exceptional service, walk in choose your pastries and order, pay at one area, sit down anywhere with your number. water, utensils, plates, were rushed out to us immediately. fast service. the line was down the block and we arrived at 12:30. i was freaking out thinking we weren't going to be seated before 2. we made it through the doors at 1. the line moves fast!E N V I R O N M E N T:beautiful inside!! super instagramable. bright lights, homie feeling. O V E R A L L: perfect brunch area, i would definitely come back. check out the menu so you know what to get because as soon as you walk through the door you order."
5/5/2021,20210505,2,4.37,This place is way overpricedNo worth the money honestly I've tried better for cheaper $16 French toast was OK but too mushy $17 waffle not my favoriteMimosa did not taste like any orange juice probably artificial or over squeezed orange Well not be coming back The only good thing was the servers he was really quick and friendly while bringing our food
5/6/2021,20210506,5,4.37,"Eggs Benedict $21.00 5/5- tastes great, the green sauce is rly nice; highly recommend - blend of greens and prosciutto (Italian dry-cured ham) with soft poached eggs on top!Shakshouka $17.00 4/5- oven baked tomatoes and peppers with chicken peas and baguette (they make their own baguettes and it's rly good) - a lot of pepper seasoning with mint and parsley, but the soft poached eggs are rly good!! If you ever go here get a slice of the Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake!! It's AMAZING 6/5!! It's $8.00 per slice and it's perfect; if you get the whole cake it might be too sweet. It's a bakery, restaurant, brunch! They have such a variety available on first come first serve. Can book reservations for dinner, offer take out or outside/indoor dining! My friend and I chose outdoor dining and employees cleaned the table before sitting and followed all covid-19 protocols! Interior Design of Republique is so aesthetic!!"
5/7/2021,20210507,5,4.37,"This place never disappoints! If you don't get their french toast, you havent truly had Repubique. It's pretty incredible."
5/8/2021,20210508,1,4.36,"Do not believe the hype or waste your money, please support the plethora of far superior restaurants LA has to offer. Myself and two besties went last night for my birthday dinner, so expectations were understandably high, also given the amazing Yelp images and good reviews. Plus we had all looked at the menu in advance and been excited about the choices on offer. I will try to be succinct in my critique with bullet points, as I personally hate to wade through a highly objective tirade of the average Yelp reviewer, so my clearly superior and unbiased ;) JK just my opinions are these.$11.50 for valet - no street parking - lameFirst thing upon seating warned we can't stay over 90 minutes - that's fair on a Friday night but sets the wrong tone - the call back to this point is that at the two hour mark we were turfed out - BUT this was after we finished desert that the waiter forgot to put the order in - if your staff takes two hours to get the food out - don't hassle people for going over their ""allotted"" 90 minutes. The menu was totally different than the one their website had advertised that very morning, I had like any great ""Crazy Foodie Prepper"" - already picked out all my choices, and NONE of them were there - disappointing to say the least. I wanted fish and they had ONE fish on offer a ""Whole Dover Sole"" for $75 - my friends were treating me so I felt like there was no way I was ordering a a $75 entree that's just rude. The waiter assured us all three of us could share as it was a whole fish and a house specialty ... foolishly we trusted him. We also got a salad - super under dressed, bland and tiny for three people.The vegetable section of the menu had one option - ONE! This is LA come on we want a plant base buffet of delicacies at all times! Farmers Market anyone?Oysters $4 each - way over average LA price of $2 - and TINY - pointless and the mignonette sauce was bitter - I eat oysters all over town this was a weak showing, all around. Finally the famous fish arrives and it seemed clear to me that several people had eaten parts of it, on it's way to our table ""The Whole Fish"" was an anemic slither of no more than 10"" and 1/4 of an inch thick with two tiny sides of airplane style boxed mash potatoes - please see picture - note the dinner plate in the picture is what that sad fish was divided up into and served to three fully grown hungry adults. I will say a woman escorted me to the restroom and asked how my meal was and I casually mentioned a couple of my disappointments, assuming she was an over friendly bathroom attendant - but turned out she passed my thoughts on to the manager, who promptly arrived to apologize. Very professional and she was lovely - she took the salad off the bill, that being said it should have all been comped as it was a total let down and I will never return.This place is totally over hyped and does not live up to it's glamorous French/Old Hollywood persona. A real shame as people have been in lock down for so long - when we do come out to support our local restaurants especially on our birthdays one would expects them to be even vaguely ""as advertised"""
5/9/2021,20210509,5,4.36,"One of the my favs in LA! Foods are great, and the decorations are adorable so you can take lots of pics here."
5/10/2021,20210510,5,4.36,"We've dined (breakfast only) at Republique maybe 3 times now. Each time, our dining experience has been amazing! Our last visit was Mother's Day 2021. For those interested in dining here for Mother's Day, definitely arrive early or you'll quickly discover a line on the sidewalk similar to a weekend at Porto's. We shared their ""This Morning's Bread"" (available in small or large sizes) and their Eggs Benedict. Their bread is awesome! It's a French bakery, why wouldn't it be right? Anyway, look at my attached photo of their Eggs Benedict! It's simply the best tasting Eggs Benedict I've ever had! It contained prosciutto, asparagus, homemade hollandaise sauce, and the eggs were poached perfectly! It was so good, I had wished we weren't sharing that item. Counter service was exceptional. As far as the servers taking food to your table, this was not so great. Our coffee, flatware, & napkins were delivered quickly, BUT our food took forever to receive, and if you needed say a coffee refill or anything else, good luck. The servers aren't even looking around to see if any tables were trying to flag them down (as if they're wearing horse blinders). We never got a chance to get our coffee warmed up with half a refill before leaving. :( Besides the table food service/wait staff too busy to get flagged down, my wife's Mother's Day experience was very solid! We also ordered pastries to go: an ube pop tart, and an ube pound cake. Both were delicious and pastries we've never had before. It won't be long 'till we revisit them again... Hopefully, we'll try dining here for ""dinner"", which we've never done before."
5/10/2021,20210510,5,4.36,"Excellent! First time here and we will be back! Super friendly staff, shoutout to JANE! She's so nice!! Credit for that bc I know first hand maintaining that in LA is challenging! Food was tasty, loved the attention to detail with each dish!"
5/13/2021,20210513,5,4.37,"Everyone knows the queue to get in for breakfast is craazy so if you ever pass by and there isn't one, go in!!! We got here at like 10ish yesterday and only had to wait 5 mins or so before being able to get in to order. Got a bunch of pastries and desserts for home and ordered the Eggs Benedict and French Omelette to eat there. Omg the Benedict was soooo good! I love how they use brioche rather than English muffin. There's a perfect toasted crisp to it before it soaks up all the egg yolk and hollandaise! The super thinly cut prosciutto adds the perfect amount of salt tying the dish together. My husband loved his a French Omelette and was surprised how well the baby green salad complemented each egg bite. For drinks we got the Bloody Mary and Blueberry Banana smoothie with kale. Both are must haves, especially the Bloody Mary. They make these fresh and not from a mix. Can't wait to go back!!!"
5/13/2021,20210513,4,4.37,"The place is nice, fancy. A good time for breakfast- 9-9:30 am when there is not crowd. Great menu, huge variety of bakery (so difficult to choose!)! The Basque Cheesecake was OMG! For 2 breakfast items, 2 cheesecakes, a coffee and an orange juice we paid $70. So, it's not an economic place. ""Burrata Frittata""- sorry, but I was expecting to have at least a half of burrata. Nope, there were literally 2 drops of burrata cream . You shouldn't even mention Burrata in this dish name."
5/13/2021,20210513,5,4.37,"LA's best kept secret! Wowwww I love this place so much. I got the brioche French toast and the regular breakfast. The French toast is so fluffy and decadent! The eggs were cooked to perfection and the potatoes were seasoned so well. Don't get me started on the baguette with butter and jam, OMG! And the masala chai is delicious and it's not too sweet. 10/10 would highly recommend this place! The Harry Potter theme, talk ceilings, open air layout, and people watching set the perfect vibe!"
5/14/2021,20210514,3,4.36,"Service 4 starsFood 2 starsBakery 5 starsOverall 3 stars factoring street difficulty. The place itself is as beautiful as its unique history. Love the exposed brick and natural lighting. It's a cool and relaxing in every different looking direction you look. Towards the back is an intriguing wall of jarred spices. I always love an open kitchen, too. Came for Friday lunch. The line moved pretty fast, 3 parties allowed in at a time. Some outdoor tables on La Brea but you can also dine in the back patio.I love shashouka. The bread was perfect and filled me up but I would've preferred slices instead of two huge pieces. The shashouka however was disappointing, so sweet. I added water to dilute it. I also prefer sunny side up eggs over their poached ones. Except for the fresh mint, where were the spices? They don't have to burn my mouth but nothing was hot. I didn't like the fresh mint but at least the acid balanced the sweetness. I didn't want to box the remainder but I don't like wasting food or money. I will have to spice up my leftover. It takes like Trader Joe's frozen shashuka minus the amazing spices. If you want a kickass shashouka with equally amazing baguette try La Provence Patisserie & Cafe on Olympic. At 1 pm many pastries were sold out. I'm a big carrot cake fan so got one for $4. Love the light orange buttercream frosting that fills the cake. Kudos too for all the walnuts and a very moist cake! The baguette is very crunchy and chewy. I could devour it in 2 days. Service was mostly good. Great, friendly service from an Asian woman who asked how my shashouka was and explained sweet tomatoes are in season. But I had to get my own napkins and an employee wanted to clean the ladies' room before I used it. I ended up going first. It was clean and attractive like the rest of the restaurant but smells faintly of bleach.Seating is community style and I was easily comfortably distanced from other diners. There are stools and comfortable seats. Eggs Benedict seems popular and it looked amazing but looks can be misleading. I would try this place again for breakfast or brunch but on weekdays only. Parking is free before 10 am then valet is $8.50. Parking is a challenge if you're not an early riser like me or not willing to pay valet. I found neighborhood parking on Detroit, west of La Brea. Reservations are strongly recommended for dinner. Right now they just have a pre-fixe menu. The long and short of it is that I'd give a meal another try on a weekday and their bakery goods were solid. Their entrees may be hit or miss and some overpriced but the pastries are reasonably priced and great quality. You are guaranteed to love the ambience."
5/15/2021,20210515,4,4.36,"Nice way to spend a Saturday late morning. My friends and I headed over to Republique at 11:45am and waited in a pretty long line to get inside. Even though there was about 20 people ahead of us, the wait to order was only about 30min. Food was pretty good as an overall consensus, and the pastries were delicious (always best as an appetizer than a true desert). -1 because we ordered large carafes of mimosas ($30/ea) and they not only had no large carafes (they gave us a small carafe and a glass ??), but the OJ-champagne ratio was way too OJ heavy for the cost. 6 brunch items with 2 carafes of mimosas and a 4 pasteries was ~ $250. I did leave full, but a bit steep even in the times of COVID rebuilding (imho)."
5/17/2021,20210517,5,4.36,"Holy shit the Ube brioche and potato pancake were phenomenal! Went at 12.45pm on a Friday afternoon, queue moved quickly got in under 20 mins. Brunch at republique never disappoints!"
5/19/2021,20210519,5,4.37,"Came here for my daughter's 25th birthday brunch and were wowed--especially by the pastries. We couldn't resist, ordered 5 (for 3 of us), and I was sure we'd need a box to go. But we polished them off! My order of preference (although they were all delicious!):CaneleCreme brulee bomboliniKouign AmannSalted Caramel Nuts puff pastryYuzu Coconut cakeYou would think with that many pastries and coffee, we wouldn't need more, but no, we had to order 3 entrees too. My favorite was the mushroom toast. We also got the regular breakfast and shakshuka. Their eggs are bright orange--must come from some amazing hens! Great outdoor atmosphere. Happy to finally make it here!"
5/21/2021,20210521,4,4.36,"Overall: Great food, great service and great experience (except for the wait times)The Good: The menu and occasion was set for their ""prix-fixe"" or fixed menu and it was an enthralling menu and tasting experience. Every piece of every dish appeared and tasted like it had been carefully curated, selected and placed. The plates were also served chilled/warmed to accommodate the dish. New silverware was provided after each dish as well. The level of service and professionalism was also exceptional.The Bad: We had to wait 35+ minutes beyond our reservation to be seated. Worth noting this was on a weekday, not weekend. Even though no less than 3 people apologized, it greatly detracted from the overall experience. No other form of complimentary courtesy was offered or extended."
5/23/2021,20210523,3,4.36,"For its prices, Republique was a bit underwhelming. We got the potato pancake, kimchi fried rice, berries tres leche cake, and ube pound cake. Potato pancake was good, kimchi fried rice barely had flavor, and pastries were ok (couldn't taste ube flavor)."
5/24/2021,20210524,5,4.36,"This place is iconic if you live in LA or come visit LA. It's on the pricier side but I think it's definitely worth it to splurge once in a while. The portions are huge (at least for the entrees we got). Dinning here is basically like stepping into a Harry Potter movie. The decor, ambiance, and small bakery at the entrance is so cute. Overall, it's a fun place and you'll definitely leave feeling satisfied with the food and the experience despite the price tag. If I lived closer I'd probably come here all the time even if it means standing in line for an hour. For a brunch date we got 2 entrees and 2 drinks. Regular Breakfast (5/5) - The bagguette stole the show it was super amazing: crispy on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside just like how I like my breads- Bacon was actually really thick, probably the thickest I've had - The potatoes were well seasoned, slightly crispy on the sides and tender in the inside, evenly cooked Chicken N Waffles (4/5) - The chicken was cooked to perfection, very moist and soft - The waffle was a little hard and nothing was special about the waffle - The biscuit gravy was interesting but I didn't feel like it paired well with the dish- Maple syrup was pretty standard and great as always Okinawa Latte (5/5) - Wow I was so impressed by this I wish the portion size for this was larger. I probably could drink 3 cups of this- This has now changed my perception about Hojicha and now I am on the hunt for more hochija drinksLatte (4/5)- Pretty standard, smooth and silky but nothing too crazy stood out that made this memorable"
5/24/2021,20210524,4,4.36,Great ambiance and all! Perfect place to grab breakfast before a flight out in the morning when it's less crowded. Wish though it offers seasonal entrees that changes up the menus once awhile. Great spot!
5/25/2021,20210525,5,4.36,"First place I decided to eat during a recent trip to LA, and Republique did not disappoint. We grabbed a weekday lunch here and are already planning out next meal here. The outside is deceptively small but the minute you enter this eatery you are taken a by it's warm wooden interior meets partially industrial meets renovated ware house feel. With patchy wood worked interior and a large sky light it makes for a lovely lunch spot. We ordered the potato pancake with eggs, shakshuka and kimichi fried rice. Every thing was delicious and appropriately flavorful! We ordered a bunch of dessert items to enjoy at home: basques cheesecake, salted chocolate cake, chewy chocolate cookies, biscotti and brownie...all worth every decadent calorie!!"
5/27/2021,20210527,4,4.36,"Love this place. My friend used to work in here. So I do come here very often. Love their pastry, especially the croissant. And the kimchi fried rice is a must try. And there is always a line tin the store, so better prepared the waiting time."
5/27/2021,20210527,1,4.36,"Personally, I love seasoning in my meals. So Unfortunately I would say this establishment is extremely expensive for tasteless food .. however the place is nice but that's it ."
5/28/2021,20210528,5,4.36,Love their baked goods! Great spot for breakfast/brunch and dinner. I personally love grabbing some goodies in the morning during my morning walks.
5/30/2021,20210530,3,4.36,"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. But I do think it's over hyped, I got the ricotta toast and my friends for the French toast and waffle. The French toast was literally just once giant piece of bread with syrup. Nothing special especially for the price. It was good but not amazing. The waffle was also decent and the ricotta toast was good, I liked the apricots but it came out about 20 mins after the other dishes and was nothing amazing, considering what we paid for. The lunch menu looks good so I do want to go back and try the lunch. But I don't think the brunch was worth it."
5/31/2021,20210531,5,4.36,"Still a classy place with beautifully presented, tasty foods, interesting wine and cocktails, and top notch services through and through. The seasonal European white asparagus is a must, the tuna tartare was almost too pretty to put in the mouth, the fresh CA king salmon was as delicate as it gets, the English agnolotti was as good as Spago's, and the beef short ribs simply melted in the mouth, now the baguette and butter.... tasted just like how they bake it in Paris, so simply yet superb! Valet parking to the side of the restaurant is $6.50. Look forward to returning again soon."
6/1/2021,20210601,5,4.36,Love this place- I came here for brunch today without reservations. The line went by fairly quickly (we came at 11:30am and waited about 15-20 minutes) and the service was fantastic. We ordered two dishes for two people. The total came out to around $50. The food was fresh and flavorful. The atmosphere is lovely- you can see people cooking orders in the open kitchen and bakers kneading dough in the workspace across from the open kitchen. It's just fantastic to sit in the middle table and take it all in. The interior looks like something out of Harry Potter.You have to come here at least once if you're in the LA area.
6/1/2021,20210601,5,4.36,Definitely one of the best places I have ever been to. There's always a line outside but this is a pay first then sit kind of food place. The food is delicious and the servers than bring your food are super attentive. I can't wait to come back.
6/1/2021,20210601,5,4.36,Such a great place with best and fast service and nice design! We were happy to see big variety of high quality pastry. Food is to die for. Highly recommend!
6/2/2021,20210602,3,4.36,"So there's so much hype about this restaurant, and while I had quite high hopes for it, it wasn't as ""glamorous "" per se, and I wasn't ""wowed"" although I will say the ambiance was quite cool. Located on La Brea past Wilshire, parking is a bit tough but they do have valet, for $8.50 (lunch hr) $11.50 (dinner hr). There was a bit of a wait, order in, take a seat. I ordered a kale smoothie, which is definitely highly recommended. It doesn't taste like kale because there are other ingredients involved, such as banana, strawberry, and pineapple. I ordered the grilled chicken salad. Portion size was good, but definitely shareable.  Nice accompanied dressing too. My wife ordered the Cuban sandwich. The arugula was quite sour and strong, but the sandwich itself wasn't bad. I wouldn't say it was certainly the best. Yes, we are in LA so the prices are a bit steep. For 2 drinks and 2 dishes, came out to $70. Service was fine but nothing out of the ordinary. Could've gotten something a lot better at the Original Farmers Market for 1/2 the price. Overall experience: B-/C+"
6/4/2021,20210604,4,4.36,"Understanding the challenges of covid times, limited tables, etc., I am trying to be completely fair about our 2nd experience here. It's not close to home and our last experience was just barely above average, but they send me emails with information about their weekly tasting menus and this week's menu intrigued us. KALUGA CAVIAR Tuna Tartar, Smoked Tomato-ENGLISH PEA SOUP-JUST-BAKED MARGARITA'S BAGUETTERodolphe le Méunier Normandy Butter, Italian Salumi-EUROPEAN WHITE ASPARAGUSAnson Mill's Carolina Gold Rice, Yuzu, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Dashi-CORN AGNOLOTTI - Santa Barbara Uni, Maine Lobster-BING CHERRIES-SONOMA DUCKPorcini Mushrooms, Smoked Farro Verde, Baby Turnips, Pudwell Farm's Blueberries-RIS AU LAITTroy Regier Peaches, Santa Barbara PistachiosThe start to the evening was super rocky as we arrived at 8:10 for an 8:15 reservation and checked in at 8:12 when the hostess returned from seating a party. There was one other party waiting ahead of us on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant and another party showed soon afterward. We all waited near the hostess stand where two hostesses and a manager milled about. AT 8:25 an Uber pulled up and a couple got out, checked in for their 8:15 reservation. At about 8:30, the hostess got a ticket from the other woman at the stand and collected 2 menus and we figured it was for us. No, she went and got the couple that arrived late and sat them. I, of course, asked the hostess at the stand what was going on and she said that maybe they had an earlier reservation. I mentioned that I had heard them say they had an 8:15 and was told that she'd have to ask her associate why they were seated first. When the seater returned my wife went to inquire and the first woman told my wife that it was she that had directed her to seat them. More conversation took place but no answers. Even if she'd just told us that she'd made a mistake, we would not have been thrilled, but it would make more sense.Anyway, finally seated at 8:45. Manager came to speak with us and we explained the situation. He was disturbed to hear that we'd been misled and said he's make sure proper training was offered to the hostess. He then, brought a couple of glasses of vermouth for us. Super nice gesture, even though we are not at all fans of vermouth. Now, for the positive. The tasting menu was really outstanding. We loved every dish (agnolotti was absolute favorite! Duck was perfectly prepared) and all was beautifully presented. Huge surprise was bing cherries preparation, and made it even more fun. Opted for a wine pairing that was very good and the sommelier was great. He had a nice grasp of each wine with great stories about the regions and wine makers. Very impressed. Service was outstanding. Server, Sandra, was lovely and engaging. We chatted about wines, food and it was super impressive that we got so much attention. She was equally attentive to other tables near us and is an absolute gem. All food runners and support team were excellent, too."
6/4/2021,20210604,1,4.35,"Overpriced, oversalted (seriously do they even taste the food they serve???) The only thing that is good there is the bread. Take your money to mastros instead. The service you will get is night and day for the same money and the food is in another league."
6/6/2021,20210606,5,4.35,"Must go to every time we're in LA!Iced Assam Black Tea and Hikari Matcha Green Tea - Very refreshing, bold flavors.Mushroom Toast (house cured ham, spinach, Holland side, red wine sauce, scrambled eggs) - Must order! The ratio of flavors amongst ingredients was perfect. The subtle saltiness from the ham and eggs, the mashed up juicy spinach, the glazing creamy sweet Holland side, and savory red wine sauce created this extraordinarilyy perfect toast.Shakshouka (wood oven baked tomatoes, peppers, farm eggs, black kale, chickpeas, yogurt, baguette) - Comforting and light at the same time. Was craving bread to dip in a tomato soup, and this nailed it. The overabundance of herbs was appreciated.Ube pound cake - Lots of buttery flavors.Pop tart - Totally not like a pop tart but more of a flat, dry chocolate crisp. Tastes much lighter and healthier than a real pop tart.Market Fruit Brioche - Creamy and juicy middle with a surprisingly salty brioche. The contrast of flavors worked.Chocolate croissant - Can't remember.Next time try: Chia Seed Pudding, Potato Pancake, Green Shake"
6/6/2021,20210606,2,4.35,"I used to love this place and would come here all the time when we lived in the area. We marked our calendars two weeks post vaccine to come back to Republique for our first dining experience since Covid. Republique is expensive. You pay $22 for eggs and potatoes, and you get a 4% (or something like that) for paying for health insurance for the employees. The cost is totally worth it because their food was just that good. Not anymore. The food quality was not good anymore. The eggs were so undercooked, they were inedible, and the scone was completely tasteless. I'm so sad I won't be coming back here again."
6/7/2021,20210607,5,4.35,"- traditional croissanti really wanted to try their specialty croissants but they only had the traditional one in stock when i visited. the croissant was super flaky and yummy as expected. would definitely get again!!- creme brulee bomboloniyummy italian donut with a creme brulee filling. they have some other fillings as well, so i would definitely want to try those next time.- salted caramel pecan briocheprobably my favorite pastry!!! the salted caramel is so delicious and the brioche complements the flavors so so well. a bit on the sweet side but not too sweet at all. a must try if you love this flavor!!- croque madameham, cheese, and fried egg on toast with a baby green salad. classic flavors that taste great together and overall a great classic brunch dish. - kimchi fried ricefried rice with beef short rib, pickled radish, sesame seeds, and two soft poached eggs. the two poached eggs make the fried rice so so creamy while the beef short rib elevates the dish. super yummy, but the poached eggs and beef short rib were the particular highlights.- overalli ordered in person. it's a pretty popular spot with a cafeteria style like seating and the seating area is so beautiful!! absolutely lives up to the hype for me!!"
6/7/2021,20210607,4,4.35,Food is good here. Not great but definitely worth going. Been here 10-15 times over the years. Brunch is great. Love the normadie butter with the dripping. It's definitely a place to be out in Hollywood as opposed to an amazing meal. Still would recommend
6/7/2021,20210607,5,4.35,"Best Brunch Spot I have been too in LA. From the interior designing, Service, and OMG the food and Mimosa's. Our party of 4 ordered almost everything on the menu. The Frittata and Quiche were are favorites. The French toast was also very exquisite. Coming back here hundo percent."
6/8/2021,20210608,3,4.35,"The ambiance is cute, open and airy. Love the joint tables. Food is alright. I tried the omelette which was nothing too special and the chocolate croissant, which was dry and crunchy. I had high hopes for Republique but didn't feel the food really wowed me.I did hear the fried rice was really good -- I might give it a try back and order that."
6/9/2021,20210609,3,4.34,"Great atmosphere and big selection of pastries (went at 10am). The line was moving pretty quick for the amount of people there were. I think it's good for just a small bite like having the morning bread with a Vietnamese latte, but I wouldn't eat there to have more than that. The food didn't really seem worth it."
6/9/2021,20210609,5,4.35,OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! You have to come for the pastries! All of them were amazing and I wish I could've eaten more. The coffee was amazing too. Definitely recommend coming here for the pastries!
6/12/2021,20210612,1,4.34,It was my first time at the restaurant and the food was amazing as it shows on Yelp.We ordered coffee and cream on the sideBut when I found a little fly inside the cream I called the server and he denied saying it was a coffee grain. He took the creamer and brought it back like he just poured half of the cream and just bring it back the same creamerThen he was talking to another server looking at us and laughing sarcastically I would appreciate it if he just apologized and bring a new cream. I am very disappointed and it was a horrible experience.
6/12/2021,20210612,5,4.34,"Republique was one of the best dining experiences I've had in LA! The gin & tonic and old fashioned are incredible. White wine was phenomenal. The dover sole was absolutely delicious. Santos, the guy who deboned the Dover sole, was like Michelangelo sculpting David."
6/13/2021,20210613,5,4.34,"Definitely come back again and again for the pastry and food, although there is a long line to get into the restaurant."
6/14/2021,20210614,5,4.34,"10/10 atmosphere. I think everyone will fall in love with the open, airy and enthusiastic interior of this place.It's the perfect place for weekend brunch, catch up with friends. However, you do need to be patient since their will always be a line. Their pastries are just overwhelming, they have very creative flavor that won't disappoint you at all, you will actually be obsessed with their pastries if you are a sweet tooth like me.I did also tried their breakfast/brunch dishes ( Lobster Egg Bennedict and mushroom sandwich) both are mouth watering and I really like when they serve their homemade bread on side. I was able to see how they make it right in front of me so the freshness is 10/10. The price was a bit high yet I think it's 100% worthy.The staff was also very friendly and energetic."
6/15/2021,20210615,5,4.34,So good! I loved the interior and every dish was delish. It is kind of pricey but totally worth it! Def recommend going on a weekday.
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.35,"This place never disappoints. The building has a very high ceiling and plenty of light source combine with very interesting dishware. This is a great brunch place if you're in the area, but street parking is difficult or you can do valet.Pastries and food are all good. I love their brunch items. I always get their french toast because it's like eating a piece of cloud, super fluffy. My other recent love is potato pancake because I love salmon eggs."
6/16/2021,20210616,4,4.34,"My first ever experience here was for my friends birthday! I planned a dinner on a Friday night for him with 6 people. I booked on opentable a week in advance. (You need a reservation for dinner, and they ask for a credit card to hold the reservation at least on opentable) When we arrived we ended up having another person join us & they were more than accommodating to get us an extra seat. Our waitress came over and the first question she asked after greeting us was ""does anyone have any allergies"" I LOVE THAT QUESTION because yes! She explained that the way the restaurant works is that it is family style. So she gave us some recommendations on what to order. We ordered: A dozen kusshi oysters, rodolphe le meunier butter, hawaiian kanpachi crudo, the garden of baby lettuces (2), sweet corn agnolotti, arugula cavatelli, charcoal-grilled beef short rib, Mary's organic chicken, prime dry-aged New York strip, almond brown butter cake, and caramelized white chocolate sabayon PLUS a ton of drinks. Every dish is unique & delicious. My favorite must have been the charcoal-grilled beef short rib. It just melted in your mouth and was the perfect mix of sweet & savory. The service here is A+++ I don't think there was every a time that my water was empty or a dirty dish stayed in front of me for more than 5 minutes.Definitely one of the most expensive dinners I've ever had. For 7 people: 3 appetizers, 2 salads, 2 pastas, 3 meats, 2 desserts & a bunch of drinks w/ tip included cost about $900. Republique has some of the most delicious food I've ever had, but I can't say that I would be coming back super soon only based on the fact that it is just SO EXPENSIVE."
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.35,"I am obsessed with this place; we sat down at the entrance and saw all other customers walk by with another pastry on their plate; we ended up getting two more pastries after brunch as they all looked so amazing and they were! Yes there is a line most mornings, but it moves quick and the food is so good! Also the people that work there are great!"
6/17/2021,20210617,5,4.35,"Omg ... I can't find the words to describe this gorgeous and insanely delicious restaurant... took my twins early in the morning to beat the traffic and didn't want to leave the restaurant... the desserts are not only gorgeous, it's to die for ... I don't mind maying more for good quality food and excellent service"
6/17/2021,20210617,5,4.35,"Everything here is perfect, from the morning menu to the evening menu! The pastries are especially great in the morning.Especially the pastries in the morning. The canelés are the best."
6/18/2021,20210618,5,4.35,"Absolutely LOVE this place! It is quite a bit hectic and quite quick-paced during breakfast/lunch/brunch hours, but is SO good! Their salads are served fresh and are very tasteful with greatly paired ingredients mix, and their dessert-exquisite! You like up and order as you walk in, pay and receive your number visual for servers to bring out their food to you. Highly recommend salad and spritz to start with as light lunch and end with their cafe mocha and basque cheesecake. Their decor outside reels you in and their tasteful food selection keeps you enjoying and happy you waited in line and found a place to sit and dine in. Highly recommend and cannot wait to return!"
6/19/2021,20210619,5,4.35,"This place was great! My sister and I split the salad as an appetizer and the short rib as our entree. The salad was incredibly refreshing and the short rib was to die for. The atmosphere and staff were perfect. It's a great spot for a fun night out. I got the celery drink and it was a bit salty, but still good! This is a wonderful place. I definitely recommend."
6/19/2021,20210619,5,4.35,"Team dinner with prix fixe menu. Every item was delicious. Bite size potato item, ahi item, and burrata item. Cheese board. Salads. Pastas. The sole was a hit. Three pretty fruit-based desserts. The G&Ts came in a wine glass with large ice blocks; very elegant."
6/20/2021,20210620,5,4.35,"Just here to toss another five-star on the heap! Had grade-skool friends in from Norway (who I hadn't seen in FOREVER!) and am so glad I chose this spot.Father's Day, there was a long line, but it moved very quickly. Met Miss Chloe at the cash register, and she was ridiculously charming and helpful.Ordered so much food: Brioche French Toast, kimchi fried rice, mushroom toast, chicken* and waffles, too... Everyone was accommodating, the food was next-level (trust me, I'm a total food-snob) and the ambiance was purrrrf! And when I say perfect, I mean this place nailed all of my requirements. I love hosting my mates + I think LA is the greatest city in the world. But it is vast. Here's my take: Los Feliz and Silverlake are #TooWhite so those 'hoods are usually cast aside, right outta the gate. (With the exception of Sage, which rocks.) SaMo's blindingly white as well, but it does get to claim the beach so I'm a bit more forgiving with that area. Venice, though (not including Erewhon and Deus, two of the greatest hangouts in the whole wide world), grosses me out. I just think it's filthy. And the parking in and around Abbot Kinney, bish, PUHlease!Moving on, Culver City bores me (save Backstage Bar & Grill, the biggest Seahawks bar outside of Seattle), and while Sunset Blvd. is my everything, the Chateau is members-only now and the other restaurants along The Strip are pretty expensive for sub-par food. So what's that leave us with, kids? Well, WeHo, of course! We had one not-quite-yet legal in tow so that axed The Abby et al., and Gracias' owners are...how should I say...not working with integrity.I'd narrowed it down to Fratelli's, I Met Her at a Bar and this lovely joint. So in addition to the THOUSANDS of stellar reviews, I simply chose Republique because, and you're not going to believe this, but I have a thing for used-brick. I know! *Monica Gellar voice* But my father built all of our homes and used-brick is one of the best (read: fabulous) materials money can buy. And cheers to going with your gut because my mates and I loved everything about this Best Brunch Bauble!PS: If the aforementioned rant doesn't sway you, I've got two more words that will: Outfuckingstanding pastries.PPS: Attention Yelp Police! I'm white so am allowed to use the #TooWhite hashtag.*I'm a recovering vegan but even when I did eat meat on the regular, chicken always freaked me out. But -- holy moly! -- this place has absolutely perfected fried bird. Hands. Down.Note: The salmon is farmed. That's honestly the thing that probably rescues this place from pure, unadulterated perfection."
6/21/2021,20210621,5,4.35,"I need intervention! I'm addicted! Im not a big fan of eating out but this place broke my belief! I've been coming back and bringing different people for the food and experience.Excellent food and extra ordinary customer service. What more can you ask for!! Just ask them to kinda twitch your dish or drink and they will be happy to do so. (Sure with a smile)Kinda proud and biased too chef Margarita was born and raise in the same place in the Philippines where my whole family were from including my husband.June 10, 2021 was the most unforgettable experience I have to date. There was a little issue with my food and guess who came out to help me... Chef Margarita !! #starstruck! She took care of me and gladly took a souvenir photo!Will keep coming back for more! What I'm doing so far is trying 2 different pastries at a time (don't judge me.. I share it with my group ) and a new dish. Thank you Republique for the amazing food and wonderful experience all the time! Please stay the way you are!!! ‍"
6/23/2021,20210623,4,4.35,"Fun place for breakfast/brunch that had been in my Yelp collections but I just had FINALLY tried! I had the BLT Benedict with coffee. I personally enjoyed my meal--- interesting combo of flavors. I was pleasantly surprised that the bread was not a basic English muffin! Honestly even just one piece stuffed me already. I also ordered pastries and was able to try the Nutella-stuffed donut looking item and a banana/Nutella croissant-like item. So sorry-- I forget the names. The pastries were on the smaller end but good to try. I think the stand out is the BLT for me (out of the things I ordered).The ambiance reminds me of some tv or movie but I couldn't quite place it. An alley? Of some sort? Tables everywhere and you seat yourself. Sharing tables is normal. I like the huge windows and all the natural light. For parking: I parked in the neighborhood and walked. Not too far!Overall, while it could be $$, it still gets my breakfast/brunch vote."
6/23/2021,20210623,5,4.35,One of my favorite brunch places in LA!! It's very pricey but so worth for a special brunch! The food tastes delicious and the presentation is so aesthetic. The mushroom toast was very flavorful and the Belgian waffle was yummy. The mini pastries taste just like what you'd eat in Paris. Cute outdoor vibes too.
6/24/2021,20210624,5,4.36,"Okinawa latte did NOT disappoint. Wowowowowow.I didn't realise that this was a ""order and seat yourself"" brunch spot and I honestly think that's the greatest. I went on a Saturday around 12 and the line was intimidating but moved very quickly and we were able to snag seats by the window. We ordered boring food, I think we messed up. BUT IT WAS SO GOOD. The ""regular breakfast"" also did not disappoint!! And the bread!! And the jam!! AHH! I want to go back and ask their egg secret. So soft when scrambled, just *chef's kiss*BRILLIANT!"
6/25/2021,20210625,5,4.36,The morning bread lived up to the hype. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Came here around 9am on a weekday and there was no line which was nice.
6/26/2021,20210626,5,4.36,"Omg. Am I in Europe? Canelés perfect to sense the vanilla bean and rum custard within its crusty copper molded garden of deliciousness. The sumac spice on the avocado toast is three snaps up. Every pastry, dish, and coffee tasted great and was presented as if painted by a detailed oriented artist. Top it off with a lovely conversational atmosphere."
6/27/2021,20210627,5,4.36,I always wondered why everyone was obsessed with this brunch place and now I know exactly why...the atmosphere is just so lovely and the food even better. I loved how there is a small pastries shop right at the front so you can grab some cute pastries for later (I would have gotten some but I wanted to try all the yummy dishes at this place). I got the chicken and waffles because I have been craving them for awhile. The chicken was very juicy and the fried batter was not super oily (which I prefer). I liked how the waffles were crispy on the outside and so warm and soft in the inside. The two sunny side eggs on top were perfectly cooked and the runny yolk added the perfect touch to the chicken and waffles. I also loved the creamy sauce they gave on the side to dip both my chicken and waffles in. We got the kimchi fried rice to share and honestly this is better than at some Korean places I've had. The egg yolk mixed into the rice was the perfect addition. I also love how soft the meat was and it was cut into small chunks so it mixed with the rice well. I would def recommend getting this to share with friends if you're going in a group.
6/28/2021,20210628,5,4.36,"The duck breast was nice and tender. Pasta was great. Though they said it meant to be shared, don't believe them, order your own. Pasta was very al dente. Sabaoyon was delicious as well. All in all, good experience. I waited too long to write this so I can't be more descriptive. ‍"
6/28/2021,20210628,3,4.36,"Ordered potato pancake, which was super greasy & fatty & desperately in need of a pickled side. Also shakshuka which was also surprisingly under seasoned. Could tell that the eggs in particular were really high quality, but the flavors were just not coming together. Juice was delicious. Maybe the pastries are better?"
6/28/2021,20210628,3,4.36,"This is my favorite neighborhood place but I have to say that the staff can be very rude. Today we were served poached eggs that were way undercooked and not warm. Oddly, the plate was warm but not the eggs. We sent them back and the manger treated us as if he was annoyed. We asked the manager to please have the eggs not so undercooked and his reply was that the restaurant serves makes and serves them perfectly. He actually said that to us and walked away. But again when the dish was served the eggs were not at all warm. The manager never came over to check in either. Of course there are many wonderful things about Republique but wow I do wish they could find a way to be more customer service oriented and at least not treat customers as annoyances."
6/28/2021,20210628,2,4.35,"Usually love this place but today was not good. I ordered an egg dish that was undercooked and not warm. When the manager came to take it back he was rude. He explained the way they cook the eggs are specific and exactly how eggs should be cooked. When I requested they at least be warm he took the dish away and brought back the new dish the exact same way. Tepid, not warm at all. Too undercooked to eat. He was annoyed and didn't bother to ask or check if it was any better. Hoping this manager gets a lesson in customer service."
6/29/2021,20210629,5,4.35,"Brunch at Republique is a must! The restaurant is so lovely and bright -- perfect for a weekend morning. There is usually a long line around 10 am to 1 pm but don't worry, it moves fast. When you first get in, you see a line of delicious baked goods and pastries that you can order in addition to your brunch order. They'll bring those to the cashier where you order your drinks and food. Then you find a place to sit and wait for everything to come!My friends and I loved the Potato Pancakes and Shakshouka! The plating was beautiful and we couldn't help but take many Instagram food pics :) Apparently, the Brioche French Toast here is Mary Berry's favorite as well and definitely worth a try. Drinks were delicious -- especially recommend the Rhubarb Spritz and of course the Sangria. The Mimosa was just okay in my book. But, all in all, such an experience! Definitely understand the hype and you need to stop by for brunch with friends or a casual date. Will definitely try their dinner next :)"
6/29/2021,20210629,4,4.35,"Great food - loved their strawberry passion fruit pie! Pupusa was good but did not come with salsa, cream or zucchini blossoms. Someone was careless in the kitchen. Maybe worth the $18 if had everything. Over $60 for brunch for two."
6/30/2021,20210630,5,4.35,"Came for weekday brunch and still lines with no parking, unless you want to pay close to $9 for parking the food is tasty and the decor is gorgeous though. Pastry selection is magical, though options made ordering stressful cause I wanted everything! Especially loved the fig ricotta toast and croque madame. The shakshuka was okay. And all pastries are the milk chocolate croissant, the pop tart, the pies, the cookies. Sweet tooth satisfied."
6/30/2021,20210630,3,4.35,"Republique, you're flying too close to the sun. For years, you've been playing a game of brinksmanship with your prices, hoping that you're staying on the better side of absurdity and that customers don't balk. Well, I've got news: I'm balkin' here. I mean, $24 for a bowl of grilled vegetables... $65 for EIGHT ounces of steak... $39 for arugula cavatelli... these are just laughable. It would be one thing if the food were all superlative, but ""very good"" isn't enough to justify these price tags. Take the duck. It was good. Tasty. But was it that much better than the duck at your average fine dining establishment down the street? Hell no. Look, my dining companion and I enjoyed our meal and really loved some of the food, particularly the campanelle with Maine lobster, easily the standout dish of the night. But we left with our wallets sore, wondering... did it need to be this way? Especially when you're eating in a relatively charmless parking lot? Probably won't be back for a long while. That is, unless I hear that they've come to their senses. Let this review be the first ripple... that creates a wave."
7/3/2021,20210703,4,4.35,"Came on a Sunday afternoon for brunch and there is ALWAYS a long line here.. don't be intimidated though! At 11:00am, my bf and I only stood in line for 20 minutes! There's actually a lot of seating inside and they also have a outdoor seating as well, so the line is probably just for crowd control?We ordered the croque madame, kimchi fried rice, and fried chicken and waffle! The chicken and waffle was really good, and the chicken was really juicy! My favorite of these three would be the croque madame just because of how rich the flavor is put together in this sandwich. It was also my first time having a ""croque madame"". The kimchi fried rice was very underwhelming. It seemed like the most popular menu item choice here so I thought this would be some special kimchi fried rice that's way different than Korean cafes or something, but nope, it was just alright. The short rib in the fried rice was great though, but something I wouldn't choose again if I came back here.Really great experience overall, and the service is quick. You order at the cashier and find your own seat!"
7/3/2021,20210703,3,4.35,"Ordered the Shoshouka , French Toast, Burger.   I loved the french toast. The shoshouka was delicious and had a hint of chili. I love chili, so i totally loved this dish as well. Who doesn't love an egg , chili, and bread all in one. The meal in question was the burger. Although the burger was delicious and the meat was totally tender, the bread messed it all up for me. I wasn't sure if it was a bad bun or it if was suppose to be like this, but the bun was totally hard. And what happens if you take a bite into a hard bun.. that's right , it pushes everything inside the burger out.  The first 2 bites were delicious , but by the third bite, everything was on the plate. It was like I ordered everything in my burger a la carte. Now i usually speak up, but I wasnt sure if this was the way it was suppose to be. and LA is totally a burger town, so this place gets 3 stars because everything else was good and the burger itself was good, but needs a softer bun to be perfect."
7/5/2021,20210705,5,4.35,"Came for brunch this morning and there was a line out the door. Do not be intimidated by the line. It's not that bad and goes by fast. Since the restaurant is a counter service number ordering system, the tables and line moves quicker than expected. We waited about 30 minutes in line but it wasn't bad since we just spent that time chatting and looking at the menu. We ordered the BLT eggs benedict, brioche french toast, this morning's bread and OJ. The OJ was delicious, not tart at all and freshly squeezed. The bread was better than some of the bread I have had in Paris. It was crunchy on the outside but amazingly soft on the inside. The butter served with it was TO DIE FOR. It was so creamy and sweet. The BLT eggs benedict was THE BEST eggs benedict I have ever had. The chili hollandaise was a perfect balance of spicy flavor without being overwhelming. The brioche it was on was amazing and I loved that it wasn't on an english muffin. The poached egg was like silk. I can't emphasize it enough- if you like eggs benny please do yourself a favor & order this one. The brioche french toast was also delicious, crunchy, soft, airy, light. I definitely will come back here to try more. The ambience is amazing too with cute lights and a rustic vibe. I felt like we were dining in a European castle."
7/5/2021,20210705,3,4.35,"Went here today, don't let the line deter you it moves pretty fast! Pros: Beautiful place super open and bright. Great pastries chocolate cake was SO good and rich!Cons: So you order at the front and take a number and sit and wait for your food and drinks. I got the Belgian waffle cause they were out of the brioche toast, it was fine; syrup was super good. My fiancée got the Shakshouka which came out 30 mins after I was done eating my waffle. We got the manager involved 15 minutes after I got the waffle and had to remind him again 15 minutes later so he could go figure out what was happening, apparently the cashier forgot to ring it in and he re-rang it but still took like another 15 minutes to get which really soured our experience here. So check that they have your entire order at the register! All in all it was fine, I feel like it's over hyped. I would come back and just grab pastries and coffee to go."
7/5/2021,20210705,2,4.34,"Great food as always. Amazing selection of pastries. But it's a shame that their employees do not know how to treat customers equally. Upon ordering my food, I told the cashier I was done w my order when he asked if I wanted to anything else, but he paused and stared at the Asian couple next to me. He asked if I'm not paying for them and I told him I don't know them and that we're separate. He said ""Oh, it seemed like you guys were together"" and I was offended by his comment. Just because I'm Asian, that doesn't mean other Asians behind me are my party as well. When I called him out on this matter, he gave me a quick, bitter ""OKAY."" Disappointing experience that makes me re-think about my next visit."
7/7/2021,20210707,5,4.34,"We came here for brunch to celebrate our anniversary. They open at 8am, we got there sround 8:15 and there was already a line out the door. We didn't worry too much though because it gave us time to figure out what we wanted to order. As everyone has mentioned, you place your order first (pastries first and then the meal), they give you a number and you choose a table to sit at. They have a second register for you to add to your order too, which is great! From the pastries we ordered the creme brulee bombolini and bread pudding. Pretty good, but probably wouldn't order the next time so we can try something new. For our meal we ordered:- Okinawa Latte w/ a shot of espresso: 5/5, recommended by the barista- Croque Madame: 5/5, omg it's been over a week and we still talk about this dish every single day- Potato Pancake: 2/5, they're just doing too much with this. We really wanted just some good traditional potato pancakes and this wasn't it- Brioche French Toast: 4.5/5, the syrup really makes this dish, bread is light and airy but still has some crunch. would love if they could do a little more to it though like adding berries or powdered sugar or candied pecans or somethingCan't wait to come back and try their other dishes!"
7/8/2021,20210708,4,4.34,"Brunch review. Really high quality ingredients and delicious food. Wasn't blown away by my meal but I think it could of just been what I ordered. I didn't think it was worth $40+ for the breakfast and a bloody mary that wasn't with top shelf alcohol. TIPS:- Parking is limited, but there is metered parking. - You order before seating for brunch, so make sure you look at the menu before you walk past the bakery counter. FOOD:- Regular breakfast (eggs, bacon steak, potatoes, baguette, french butter and jam). I now know what they mean by ""bacon steak"", this piece of bacon was the biggest that I've ever seen and it was delicious! The baguette was probably the star of the dish though, crunchy exterior and soft interior. Everything tasted good, but it just felt like something was missing.- Bloody Mary: Good bloody mary, could of been a bit spicier though. - Smoked salmon on potato pancake: My friend ordered this and it was good, however tasted a little heavy having salmon on what is essentially a fried hashbrown. I think something pickled and creamy would of been nice to balance it."
7/9/2021,20210709,4,4.34,"Finally went here. Pricing a little high, but its decent. added updated menu. Seating can suck when they're packed, like brunch on the weekend. You order, then find a seat. so like a cafeteria. You park on the street. Baked goods are good. Kimchi fried rice was decent, kind of pricy, but its suppose to be upscale so thats okay. Chicken and Waffles were decent. Nothing was bad, but nothing was like oh my goodness, I'm coming back again next week. Here are some pictures. please enjoy. Expect to spend 25+ per person."
7/9/2021,20210709,4,4.34,The food and pastries are amazing but not sure if it's worth the wait and expensive price. I loved the kimchi fried rice (my first time trying kimchi fried rice) and French toast. The kimchi fried rice wasn't super spicy so I liked that and the French toast was the SOFTEST and FLUFFIEST toast I've ever had. The interior is beautiful and pastries are also delicious but we waited roughly 40 minutes really early on a weekday and I just don't know if I'd do that again
7/10/2021,20210710,5,4.34,"Love, love, love this place. It is the cutest cafe inside. The line is always out the door so get there early be prepared to wait (but so worth it). Once you make it inside you are greeted with a bakery case filled with sweet and savory treats. Everything is amazing, you can't make a bad choice. Once you get to the register you can order fresh squeezed juices, coffee, breakfast items. I've gotten the shakshuka and eggs Benedict, both delicious. Whenever I have visitors from out of town here, this is always on the list of places to take them. Next on my list is to try their dinner menu."
7/10/2021,20210710,3,4.34,"Try the French toast, it's delicious. The pastries and the coffee are great as well. The place is very busy, especially on the weekends. You order at the counter, are given a number, you find a table, and they bring your order to you. Ordering feels rushed and some of the staff behind the counter seem impatient if you're not sure what you want. I recommend viewing the menu and knowing what you want before you get up to the counter. If you are there to get pastries, prepare to feel rushed while selecting what you want, especially if you're not familiar with their selection. The service is hit or miss. Some days you feel welcomed, other days not so much."
7/10/2021,20210710,4,4.34,Came here for dinner and was seated outdoors. Ordered baby lettuce and bread and butter for appetizer. Salad was very fresh and tasty. Bread and butter were fresh and amazing. For main course we had SWEET CORN AGNOLOTTI and Beef Short Rib. The agnolotti were pasta pouches like ravioli. They bursted with layers of flavors in my mouth. Beef Short Rib was tasty and very tender.
7/12/2021,20210712,4,4.34,"My first indoor dining event after 16 months of lockdown!! Was in the private room upstairs which has horrible horrible acoustics. It just kept getting louder and louder! The room had 2-3 very tiny windows and the other wall faced the wine cellar. The decor and ambiance was very discreet and private - but not for a rowdy bunch! (Also, while I was staring into their wine cellar the entire time, I didn't understand why ALL their wine bottles were standing upright!?)The menu was amazing and I would definitely recommend this place for quality of food and value. Other than a few things, everything was tasty and delicious and pacing of appetizers / entrees / drink refills were perfect."
7/12/2021,20210712,5,4.34,"Came here for dinner with my husband. Although we had made reservations three days in advance, we still had to wait with rest of the big group of people outside. So make sure to come early and make reservation in advance! I loved the interior and decor, but the food was so so. The oysters and the duck breast and leg with the glazed peaches and shallots were cooked to perfection and very scrumptious. But the beef ribs was a little too salty to my taste and we had to send it back. Our servers were all very attentive and made sure to always fill the water cup and clean the table. The famous handmade churned butter and the baguette were as expected and great tasting. A cup of artichoke and butternut squash soup was presented to us on the house. I will definitely go back to try the brunch menu!"
7/13/2021,20210713,3,4.34,"I can definitely see what the hype is about with the cool outdoor Euro vibe in the main dining area and the fresh baked goodies. The line wasn't long to get in if you go on a weekday, and the service was fast. We got our food within 10 minutes of finding a table. (This is the part that I would give it 5 stars.)The only downside is it isn't a great place if you have food allergies (like dairy, peanuts and tree nuts) since they keep all pastries open and mixed together. There seems to be a lot of cross contamination opportunities. We had a nut allergic person in our group, and he felt so uncomfortable that we almost left but decided to talk to the person at the ordering counter to see if there was anything we could eat that was safe for our group. He asked what dishes we were interested in getting and went to the kitchen to check, so we felt fine to stay. FYI: Unlike most brunch places we've frequented, Republique uses peanut oil for almost all of their baked goods. The part that surprised me the most was we still received a dish that had nuts on it (the rice pudding with fresh fruit), even after informing the guy at the pastry counter whom we ordered from that we had a nut allergy in the group. See attached photo. Their menu description also did NOT specify there were almonds in it. Since food allergies are serious, I find this unacceptable and would not return. It is too bad because I think Republique had a great atmosphere, but health and safety take priority over atmosphere and taste."
7/13/2021,20210713,5,4.34,"Soooo many brunch options here, I don't even know where to begin. Beware if you have choice anxiety like I do! Although I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu hereThe line was pretty long to order, but it actually moved really quickly, 10 min max. You can order pastries and baked goods (all appeared mouthwatering) from the display when you walk in, then you walk up to the register and order your meal as well. The interior of Republique is very aesthetic and makes for a very pleasant dine-in experience!I ordered the gioiella ricotta toast and my friend ordered the regular breakfast. Both were delicious! Definitely recommend the ricotta toast if you want something on the sweeter side but not your typical syrupy-sweet breakfast/brunch option. I only tried the potatoes from the regular breakfast, and they were seasoned really well. The regular breakfast is for sure the right move if you want an upscale version of a standard breakfast you'd get at a diner. We also ordered the tres leches cake (amazing) and the chocolate hazelnut bomboloni (also amazing). You can easily go a little too crazy with all the pastry options."
7/13/2021,20210713,5,4.34,"REPUBLIQUE, Upscale French-inspired bistro & bakery, owned by Chefs Walter and Margarita Manzke. Centered in the heart of LA an iconic building originally 1929 as Charlie Chaplin's offices. I LOVE THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BUILDING. Intimidating long lines outside EVERY morning but moves very quickly. The longest time we waited was 15mins. No worries while waiting in line you can decide what you want to order. Cause as soon as you get in you place your order, pastries first then meal, then they give you a # then you choose your table. They have two levels of tables and a patio. They also have a second register if you need to add on, awesome. FOOD IS AMAZINGLY healthy fresh it feels like melted butter on your mouth. I start with Pastry: Ube pound cake followed meal a Shakshouka: wood oven-baked tomatoes, peppers, farm eggs, black kale, chickpeas, yogurt, baguette), then Drink: Hikari matcha green tea, oh forgot the kimchi fried rice OH MY GAAWD). Haha. I have only come here for brunch and it's a must! Breakfast/Brunch is 8 am runs till 2 pm then they closed and opens for Dinner @530pm which you can RSVP. Forget looking for parking it's LA, valet it! Hehe. $8.50/am and $11.50/pm. You'll understand why when you leave this is one of my top 3 fav restaurants in LA. It would be my #1 pick if only it was at the beach. Lol."
7/13/2021,20210713,4,4.34,"Line is terribly designed, food is nothing to write home about. Cool ambiance though. Tables are first come first serve. Come here on Sunday preparing for a wait."
7/18/2021,20210718,5,4.34,"This French-inspired spot is really unique in it's interior. They have extended their outdoor seating area to accommodate for the pandemic and having more guests. I liked that I could bring my dog to the patio. Everything was delicious. I loved how fresh the oysters were. The Crudo had a delicious kick to it and the blue fin tuna tartare was so delicious. I could eat 10 of them easily. The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The waiter looked bored around us."
7/19/2021,20210719,4,4.34,"My group of 6 came in on a Sunday at around 9:30am after a hike. There was a long line, but it went by pretty fast with a staff at the front giving menus and instructions on how to order. They made the ordering process very easy and they separate the checks for groups. However, I don't recommend for large groups unless you make a reservation. The seating is not very large group friendly. Street parking is available, but can be difficult. My group finished their plates and everyone enjoyed the food. I had the potato pancake which comes with smoked salmon. I liked it. I'll recommend their iced golden milk latte, it's almond milky and the turmeric flavor is not too strong. Yes, it is a little on the expensive side, but the portion size is quite reasonable."
7/19/2021,20210719,4,4.34,"Republique can be a good option for both brunch and dinner. The space has a great aesthetic with high ceilings and dark wood surfaces. You can expect a line for brunch and needing a reservation for dinner. After going for pastries again recently, the once great pastries that I'd come to expect from Republique were lacking and dry. The options available were also minimal. It might just be me but I'd rather they serve less cookies and more pastries. Additionally, it appears the restaurant has shifted more to their kitchen's menu than their pastry performance during weekends, which I understand from a profit standpoint. I saw a couple of people ordering French Toast for the picture. When I've been for dinner, the food and ambiance were on point but it's been a while. I might keep Republique as just a dinner option going forward and leave brunch for the Instagrammers."
7/20/2021,20210720,5,4.34,Best eggs Benedict I've ever had. Pastries are delicious and balanced in flavors. Peach cream pie was incredible. Interior is amazing! Croque madame was great but not as good as Benedict.
7/21/2021,20210721,1,4.34,"It's really irritating when someone fixes something that isn't broken. This rating is exclusively for their salted caramel chocolate cake, one I've had numerous times over the years (since mid 2010s) and one which, although at times showed signs of evolution or change, it still felt like a variation on the classic. A week or so ago I had their cake again for the first time since the reopening. I was extremely excited about it, so calling the experience a disappointment is an understatement. It was an entirely different cake, mainly because the core batter was now made up of rich dark chocolate. Now, a dark chocolate cake can be fantastic and delicious but it wasn't the case. So not only was a perfectly dreamy cake ruined, but it's replacement wasn't even good. They should've just made a new cake entirely instead of messing with the original one."
7/22/2021,20210722,5,4.34,"My fiancée and I had been wanting to try Republique for a while now, so we finally got to do so for brunch. We arrived around 11 a.m. on a Saturday morning. There was no street parking available along La Brea so we opted to park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant.The line looked intimidating at first, but moved fairly quickly. We had ordered and seated ourselves within half an hour. Seating is cafeteria style, and they have plenty of seats indoors as well as outdoors on their side patio.The process here is pretty efficient. The line takes you first along the pastry display, so you can order any pastries (to-go or for dine-in) before placing your order at the register for your main courses. We ordered the Market Fruit Crostata and Ube Pound Cake as our pastries to-go, and a slice of the Strawberry Passion Fruit Cream Pie to try along with our meal. The pie was very creamy, but at the same time very light and flavorful without being too sweet. We also got a Blueberry Banana smoothie to go with our meal, which was very cool and refreshing, as well as fresh-tasting.As our main items, we shared the Brioche French Toast and the Croque Madame. The french toast was amazing - not too dense and very buttery. It didn't require too much syrup since it was flavorful enough on its own. The croque madame was also a hit. It had a good amount of ham and gruyère, and honestly would have been a bit overwhelming if we hadn't been sharing it or had other items. But otherwise it was nicely toasted. The baby green salad accompanying was great to balance out the heaviness of the croque madame. We really enjoyed our meal here and will be hoping to come back soon to try their other menu items and pastries."
7/23/2021,20210723,2,4.33,"This review is based solely on their pastries because that's all I've ever had. But now I'm not sure I'll come back for their actual food since we were so disappointed. We picked up the pastries at 2:00, ate some in the car and the rest when we got home. They tasted like yesterday's pastries, and yet I'm sure they would never do that. Nothing was flaky. While the salted caramel filling was great, the frosting was awful- tasted like crisco mixed with a little bit of chocolate (and I ordered 3 slices, dang!) And the brownie- boxed brownies are better than this. Donut, hardly tasted like anything and was stale.Donut 2/5Salted caramel cake 3/5Peach danish 2/5Chocolate chip cookie 3/5Kouign amann 2/5Chocolate brownie 2/5"
7/23/2021,20210723,5,4.33,Really enjoyed this place for a birthday brunch with my mom! Ambiance is gorgeous amd food was soooo good! Had a delicious madame croquet and Benedict where the eggs were cooked to perfection and the bread was nicely crisp edges and soft interior. So much yum!
7/25/2021,20210725,3,4.33,"We returned for breakfast today after a delicious dinner there last month. At 9:30am Sunday morning, there was a line. As others mentioned, the wait was not long. The bread and butter came first and was as wonderful as we remembered. We ordered Waffle, Regular Breakfast, Ricotta Toast and Potato Pancake. The Ricotta Toast and Potato Pancake were tasty. Waffle is nothing special. As for the Regular Breakfast, the bacon is good but a little too salty, potato and scrambled egg are good. We left and was a little disappointed as we had high expectations. We decided that we will return for dinner but not brunch."
7/26/2021,20210726,5,4.33,"We really enjoyed our breakfast here. Everything was delicious and you can tell the ingredients were fresh and cooked well. The pastries are amazing. You have to try them.Just a couple of thoughts. If you are new here, beware that it gets really crowded and they don't accept reservations and cash, so plan accordingly."
7/26/2021,20210726,5,4.33,My favorite brunch place in LA! Food came all at once and super quick. They're pretty busy so I recommend going early.
7/27/2021,20210727,5,4.33,Nice brunch experience. There's no wow factor everything is very standard but still great food. Love the vibe and interior Design in the restaurant. Very airy and bright.
7/29/2021,20210729,5,4.34,5 stars every single time. I just found out today that other baked items in the front display during breakfast are all made in house. The simple things like drip coffee was excellent. The customer service is always phenomenal by the servers and the people bringing the food. Cleanliness is on point. We ordered -the steak Fritas those hit the spot juicy and well cooked every time. -The baked items are never a disappointment -French toast is ok brioche a birthday much and buttery for us. But did not come with any fruit or toppings. Fat toast with syrup-the toast with crunchy but topped with fruit that was great. The streak is for the win! Parking is about $9 valet unless you find street parking.
7/29/2021,20210729,5,4.34,Absolutely beautiful place and fabulous food! Totally recommend you to try this place. We had breakfast and we bought almost every pastry they had which was delicious!
7/30/2021,20210730,5,4.34,Pretty gooooodBut I really don't understand why the signature dish is kimchi fried rice? The beef in it are really okay but i would not say it's the best kimchi fried rice thoughI probably will order Sth else next time. The cake is soooooo yum! I love it sooo much I ate the whole cake on my own. And I just love it sooooo muchLatte is goooooood as well!
7/30/2021,20210730,4,4.34,"Food and people are excellent. Just two things - coffee could be better and music should be way better - cool indie or something, not bad 80s pop in the morning, that hurts before 10am."
7/31/2021,20210731,3,4.34,"I'v been to this restaurant a couple times and it has some amazing qualities but I feel like its growing popularity has decreased the quality of service. Here are the reasons for my three star rating of Republique:- You have to wait in a line when you come here but it usually moves pretty quickly. It makes sense its so crowded since it is so popular so you have to be willing to wait a little while. Once you put your order in, everything comes out relatively quickly (unless you do to-go).- While I was waiting, I noticed customers at the to-go window were knocking at that window for way too long because their order was ready but no one would come and give it to them through the window. - When I ordered coffee to-go it was ready for awhile but they forgot my order and I had to wait for around 15 minutes but when you order it to have it there in comes within 5 minutes. I ordered one decaf and one regular and they didn't write anything on the cups so we didn't know whose was whose. In general the quality of coffee is usually pretty good but sometimes misses the mark and is expensive ($6 minimum) so it wouldn't say it's worth it. Their iced mocha tastes exactly like Jack n the Box mocha (whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you). - Some of the menu items are amazing like the mushroom toast and potato pancake while others are a rip off like the breakfast sandwich (you could get the exact same thing at McDonalds for $1, but here it is $18). - The interior is beautiful but it is hard to get seating during busy times and also there are long tables where multiple parties can sit but I don't like the feeling since COVID is still going on. - We asked for water for our dog, which they said they would accommodate for but just forgot about it even though we asked twice. It felt understaffed for how busy it was. Overall, its a decent place but definitely feels a little overpriced, except for the pastries. Those are definitely worth it and run out fast."
7/31/2021,20210731,5,4.34,went here for my boyfriends birthday and wow that service bless you danna for making our experience memorable and amazing!!! the food made it worth not eating the whole day. we had 10 courses of absolute deliciousness!!! definitely a great night one for the books danna you are a star
8/1/2021,20210801,5,4.34,"Location of republique is spectacular, right by the LACMA! I loved the decor and vibe, I would spend all day here if I could! Wanted to try so much in the menu (lots of interesting vegetarian options) but only ended up getting the pupusas (the zucchini blossoms inside were really unique) and it had melty cheese inside. Also ordered a cappuccino (which was great quality). Just to note, if you're planning to do work out of here, make sure to charge your devices! There's only one place for outlets in the whole restaurant seating. One of my favourite spots I visited in LA!"
8/1/2021,20210801,4,4.34,"I had been longing to try Republique for such a long time but never got around it. My gf posted a picture of her breakfast on ig and when she told me it was Republique I was like you got to take me! She insisted we go early since the lines get long real fast so we met up at 10:15. I'm not a morning person, so If you are I suggest going earlier. Parking was a bit hard but luckily I was able to snag one. The line was indeed long, but it went by pretty fast. Once you get inside, they have a glass display of all their yummy looking pastries and desserts. I will say, there was so much to choose from, I actually felt overwhelmed and because you have to hurry as it's busy I felt rushed which led to major anxiety hahah. Hey! you got to chose wisely, can't rush the process. Once you pay at the register you seat yourself. The inside and layout is so nice. Open space, with big windows and high ceilings, lots of natural great lighting, perfect for my peeps who likes to take pictures of their food :) They have single tables, high top bar tables, and communal tables. _Granola ($13) Straus organic yogurt, farmer's market fruit, wildflower honey. I never get granola at a brunch place but my gf got this for us to share and damnnnn I'm so glad she got it. As I write this I am already craving the granola. The yogurt was the perfect texture of thick but slightly silky, the fruits were so fresh and sweet and the granola added nice texture while also adding a touch of sweetness. The honey was also the perfect touch without being too sweet or overpowering. It was light and refreshing. _Regular Breakfast ($21) Eggs any style, bacon steak, fingerling potatoes, baguette, french butter, jam. This was the dish that led me to come here. The plate came out just like the pictures. I will start by saying the baguette and potatoes were the highlight of this dish. The potatoes were soft inside and slightly burnt on the outside with a hint of smokiness. The baguette was perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I was not a fan of the thick bacon It was way too fatty and rich for me. But that's my own personal taste, for some this may be the highlight. I'd still get this again. I hearty breakfast. _Ham and Cheese Croissant ($5) I took this and the other pastries below home, and safe to say the croissant itself was still pretty fresh. I will say the ham and cheese is pretty darn close to my favorite at Proof Bakery. Flaky and buttery, a classic._Yuzu Coconut Bundt Cake. This looked better than it tasted. I did like the light flavor of the lemon and coconut but it did not blow my mind either. This would be nice paired with tea. I think the bundt cake was a bit too heavy for the light yuzu lemon flavor. _Banana Nutella Tart/croissant. My gf recommended this and I love nutella so had to try. I thought it was going to have a lot of nutella but it was just a tad where you can taste it. Which was fine as the bananas were pretty sweet itself, it was a good balance. I thought the size was a bit too small but because it is pretty sweet, it was a good size, otherwise it would be a bit overkill. _Market Fruit Brioche. The brioche was pretty thick and dense. It was touch to cut with a knife. The fruits on top were pretty good, but I think I would just stick with their pastries over the breaded desserts. Overall great experience, but way too pricey for the everyday average brunch spot. I would definitely come back for the granola and try their other pastries."
8/2/2021,20210802,4,4.34,"So cute, so aesthetic, perfect for the brunch girlies*! *girlies is gender neutral MUSHROOM TOAST: If you love a buttery succulent breakfast item, GET THIS. It's packed with mushrooms and the egg is so soft and delicious. The toast it's served on is perfectly crunchy ... a great amalgamation of textures. SEASONAL QUICHE: Flaky crust, soft and bouncy egg mix, a fresh and healthy serving of salad ... truly dreamy. This has to be one of the best quiches I've had! My only addition I'd like is if the quiche had corn ... hehe. The textures in this one were all pretty similar, but it wouldn't stop be from getting it again next time. BELGIAN WAFFLE: This had a TON of berries on it! The waffle was heavy on the vanilla flavoring, but overall a good solid waffle. PEACH BERRY UPSIDE DOWN CAKE: This is probably the worst pastry I've ever had ? It was dry and tasted like flavorless corn bread. Also the slice of peach inside was huge ! I was expecting it to be little cubes of peach incorporated into the dough but whatever! All the other pastries made up for it (see below). UBE BRIOCHE: I wish I had gotten 2. 4. 10! This was filled with ube and custard and was so so so good. I typically have a hard time tasting the ube at other pastry shops but this was super good and strong. Brioche pastry was excellent as well! BERRY KOUIGN AMANN: If you've read this far, go to Gayle's in Santa Cruz, CA and try their kouign amann if you think this one is the best you've had so far. The one I had here (at Republique) was good, but the caramelization at the bottom got a little burnt so I didn't like that. There wasn't a huge amount of jam in the center which is ideal IMO, and the berries that topped it off were so sweet and such a cute touch! Overall my only gripe is how EXPENSIVE this place is. TLDR: 8/10; good vibes"
8/2/2021,20210802,5,4.34,We made a stop here after LACMA and before dinner and I almost regret not making a dinner reservation! *Also you will be wise to make a reservation! When they open at 5pm there is a long line of people hoping to grab a table!What a lovely restaurant! We ordered a coffee and peach tart and WOW that peach tart was DELISH! OMG! (The coffee was good too but that tart OMG).We watched the bartenders whip up beautiful cocktails and the servers deliver beautifully plated food...JEALOUS! The menu had something wonderful for everyone and made my mouth water just looking at it!We will definitely be back for dinner!
8/3/2021,20210803,4,4.34,"I went for lunch. You line up and order/pay at the counter cafeteria-style and then take a seat anywhere. The building is beautiful and they have a patio. They bring your food to you. The line moves pretty quick and plenty of open seats on a Tuesday. Very few baked goods available on the spot. Food was pretty good but expensive. Service was slow. Worst part is parking. It's either valet in their lot for around $10 or try to find street parking in the nearby streets. And most meter parking is 1 hr limit which is annoying since there's no way you'll line up, get your food and finish it within an hour. I give it 4 stars due to the nice venue. Otherwise it's a solid 3 stars."
8/4/2021,20210804,5,4.34,"Republqiue is always my go to when I am visiting my friend in LA. Valet and street parking is available. They have such a great selection of bakery goodies. I went a little crazy the last time and got a half dozen of sweet goodness. My favorite one was their own version of a twinkie. It had a twist to it with a memorable lemon flavor that I didn't expect when I took my first bite because it looked like a fancy twinkie! It was moist bite of cake and a well done master piece. They serve lunch at 11am but I usually go for their breakfast Menu items which are served until 2pm. Kim chi fried rice is very filling. I love the Asian cusine as a morning dish, has the kimchi spice, with short rib, the egg is perfectly cooked so the yolk drips into the dish. Every bite was delicious. My friend and I also shared the mushroom toast. Wow it was such a beautiful dish and tasted amazing! I will definitely be coming back here. My mouth is already watering again writing this review."
8/4/2021,20210804,4,4.34,"In short description, Republique is like a fancy version of Porto's. Decent food, but mainly known for their bread and pastries.The interior design is very unique. It has an outdoor feel...sort of like you're eating somewhere in Italy.  I wasn't a fan of the noisy ambiance...sound of clattering dishes and loud conversations. It was like I had traveled back in time to school cafeteria lunches. It has a very casual feel to it. Shorts, tank tops or cute summer dress with flats and you'll fit right in.My idea of a fine dining experience is to have waiters show me to my seat, take my order and wait on me throughout my stay. Republique is different in the sense that you have to wait in line, order at the register, look for a seat and then the food is brought to your table.Two of their most popular meals are the Kimchi Fried Rice and the regular breakfast. Therefore, we decided to order those two meals, along with the Potato Pancake, Avocado Toast and two pastries - Creme Brûlée Bombolone and Raspberry Pistachio Kouign Amann (Breton Cake). As far as drinks, we ordered a latte, an iced coffee and the Elderflower Spritz.Shall we start with the Pastries? Oh WOW!!! Their pastries are unbelievably delicious! Before you order your food at the register, you will walk by a counter full of beautiful and unique looking pastries, at which point you will have the opportunity to order dessert or goodies to take home. The Creme Brulee Bombolone and the Raspberry Pistachio Kougn Amann were two of their most popular items so I decided to give both of those a try. They were both incredible! So yummy!Regular Breakfast (eggs any style, bacon steak, fingerling potatoes, baguette, french butter, jam)For $21, this plate was overpriced. There was nothing unique or special about it and the overall taste was decent.Potato Pancake (smoked salmon, salmon roe, hollandaise, dill, soft poached eggs)Though the pancake itself had a good taste, it was a bit too crispy to even cut with a fork. Also, the eggs were undercooked. Other than that, it was a good meal.Avocado Toast (sungold tomatoes, cucumber, breakfast radish, serrano chile, cilantro)I must say, this is definitely the BEST avocado toast I have ever had. Full of flavor and very appealing to the eye. It looked so picture-perfect, I didn't even want to eat it. lol This is definitely a must-have if you love avocado.Kimchi Fried Rice (beef short rib, pickled radish, sesame seeds, soft poached eggs)Not my favorite. I'm not a big fan of Korean food but my husband is. If you love Korean food, then I'm sure this is a great meal to have. It was beautiful in appearance, great flavor and spicy.Now let's talk about DRINKS!Elderflower Spritz (aperitif wine, grapefruit, pisco, cognac, prosecco, soda)This drink was very, VERY delicious and refreshing! The perfect drink for summer!Iced Coffee and LatteBoth very good. Most enjoyed with their pastries.Would I come back? Probably not. But if I did, it would be to buy pastries and enjoy them in the comfort of my own home.NO CASH ACCEPTED to pay in the restaurant. Cards only!Also, expect to pay an average of $10 for Valet Parking, as it is Valet Parking Only."
8/4/2021,20210804,5,4.34,"Absolutely fantastic lunch happens here. The best hollandaise sauce I've ever tasted in my life on their eggs Benedict. A wonderfully spiced Bloody Mary. Great service, everyone is beautiful and ambiance is just fancy enough to feel special. A quintessential LA spot. Only complaint, our water glasses came with lipstick spots on two glasses. Service was absolutely packed, we didn't have a chance to send the water glasses back."
8/4/2021,20210804,5,4.34,What a lovely place to run into your ex on a first date with some bitch that looks exactly like you. Outstanding baked goods though.
8/5/2021,20210805,4,4.34,"Came around 11am with my friend and there wasn't a wait thankfully. I read how it can get busy for brunch so I think if you want to avoid the wait come before 12! They have a order-now-sit-after system so we ordered the avocado toast, Belgian waffle and the fresh grapefruit juice. The Belgian waffle was pretty small but it filled me up. I took my sweet time finishing it. Unfortunately at one point while eating I noticed a fruit fly on my plate. Not sure how long it was there but it definitely made me lose my appetite. According to my friend the avocado toast was alright. She bit like a little rock that was mixed in her avocado paste. It sounded really hard so I'm glad her teeth are okay, but definitely interesting precaution one might want to take if they order the avocado toast... The juices tasted healthy. Very basic. The lost star was mainly for the price. Yes the food is good, but for something as classic as a fruit waffle and avocado toast with 2 glasses of juice the total was ~$60."
8/5/2021,20210805,5,4.34,"After having an amazing breakfast a while back, we decided to try dinner. We made a reservation on open table and was seated super fast. Our server was a little flat and unhelpful saying ""it depends"" when we asked what was popular or what his favorite meal was. (We we're having a hard time not ordering the whole menu; this didn't help us narrow it down) but nevertheless we picked the rodolphe Le Meunier butter, Kanpachi Crudo, Campanelle, and the Red Wine Braised Short Rib. When I say they were all good... they were all so surprisingly amazing dishes. The Crudo had so many punches of flavor and mix of ingredients went together so well. The butter was probably the best butter I've ever had. The campanelle had so much lobster flavor, we were so amazed that a pasta could even have so much lobster flavor in it. The short rib dish was tender and had a familiar homey taste but taken to the next level. We loved our meal so much that the bad service (just the server :/ ) couldn't even make us give 4 stars. Worth the price. Can't wait to go back."
8/6/2021,20210806,4,4.34,"Okay, again I was blind sided by who amazing this restaurant was. Went here for dinner and was blown out of the water. I would have given this place 5 stars but the service sucked that night. Didn't feel like the server was very good. Asked for recommendations on drinks (just wanting to see what's popular) and he couldn't exactly narrow it down. Same with dishes. Couldn't help us narrow down what to order. The items we did get were mind blowingly good. The crudo was out of this world. Fresh, seasonal, and packed a punch of flavor. The Normandy butter and bread with course salt was worth every penny. The lobster pasta was also very good. I honestly don't know how they managed to make the pasta taste more like lobster than the actual lobster. And the braised short rib was so tender it really did melt in your mouth. Over all great experience. -1 star for a indecisive server but would still go back!"
8/7/2021,20210807,4,4.34,"This is a fun eclectic space nestled in between buildings in busy LA. Once in though the tiles are different from space to space and the mix match of decor is all what makes this place charming. Love they serve breakfast items until 2pm. Ordered the breakfast sandwich, strawberry mandolin, and house made ginger ale. All were awesome and packed full of flavor without being overly to sweet or salty, just right. My only wish is that the sandwiches would come with housemade fries, chips, or even a few veggies something to make the plate filling. Once order is made just find a seat whoever you like. Staff will find your number and bring your order to you. When done they come by and pick everything up. Parking is street parking only. Great experience and look to come back and try more bakery items."
8/7/2021,20210807,4,4.34,Yummy food. Long lines and a bit pricey but worth it for brunch or lunch. We haven't tried it for dinner as it's crazy expensive but maybe one day we'll treat ourselves.
8/8/2021,20210808,1,4.33,"First and last time, the lady whose name is on the check ""Joanna"" if that in fact was her or whoever was logged into the register was so rude! She was an Asian lady with black straight hair. That truly just sours up the overall experience, when revising our order she coughed up an attitude over something we were confused about and I did inform her that it was our first time here so that is why we were inquiring about the waffles and she was so rude, she said that it was loud that that's why she sounded rude, I clearly stated it wasn't her tone IT WAS HER ATTITUDE. I don't appreciate being treated like this with family or in general. You can have great food but when the service is this bad it's not worth it."
8/8/2021,20210808,4,4.33,"Pretty good if you have dietary restrictions, a lot better if you do not. Quality ingredients and even if you order a lot, you won't come across a bad dish. Though I also wouldn't say it was the best meal I ever had. The fish and chicken were expertly prepared, but not at or beyond peak perfection. The soup was a tad too salty. I'm not usually a huge fan of sorbet to begin with, but theirs was almost as good as what I've had in France. I would rate the service and restaurant amenities at 9/10. Wavering between 3.5-4 stars, as the quality for the price was fair, but not exactly drooling over the idea of returning for another meal."
8/9/2021,20210809,3,4.33,"Vibes? Yes. Value/taste worth the line? No. Just a classic, ""looks awesome inside but have fun waiting in a 30-60 minute line on the weekends"" situation. The food itself is fine, the pastries are pretty good. It probably would have been a 4 star on a weekday but I went for the classic Saturday breakfast. So yes, if you are in your Instagram best and would like the photos and stories, not a bad pick. Personally, I think there are better spots in LA. We came here because we were meeting with friends and it's not a bad pick for that either."
8/10/2021,20210810,5,4.33,"this place is amazing!!! I've heard so many good things so decided to try it out for brunch and it did not disappoint. there are so many pastries, in addition to a full menu! we got a chocolate croissant, chocolate chip cookie, oatmeal raisin cookie, carrot cake, and the strawberry nutella crostata and there were all amazing!! for entrees, we got the regular breakfast and brioche french toast and holy moly, I've never had better french toast in my entire life. the bread was amazing texture and was SO fluffy but not soggy, and had enough flavor without syrup! highly recommend. the regular breakfast is delicious as well - the bacon steak was amazing (coming from someone who doesn't like bacon) and the baguette that comes with it is baked to perfection! SO worth it!!"
8/10/2021,20210810,4,4.33,"As far as brunch spots go, I think this place is kind of worth the hype. It's hard for me to give any brunch spot more than 4 stars, but the quality is definitely there."
8/11/2021,20210811,5,4.33,"This is a happening spot! We stopped in at 11am and place was jammed! You get in line to order then proceed to find a seat. They have beautiful French pastries and meals. I had croque madam. A delectable ham and grilled cheese on fresh baked bread served with a side green salad. Oh man! It was delicately fried in butter and was so so creamy. The egg on top was definitely not the run of the mill - it was bright orange and had a tremendous flavor. My cousin ordered quiche with side salad. It was made with seasonal veggies and was light with a perfect pastry crust. She also bought pastries to go, a chocolate croissant and a sticky bun. Me...I purchased a cookbook and can't wait to explore the recipes!"
8/12/2021,20210812,4,4.33,"Great food great atmosphere love this place. French, oysters, drinks, bar, great ambiance."
8/14/2021,20210814,5,4.33,"A shining star of LA dining.If you feel like you wanna have Parisian fine dining show up on La Brea. Good Lord the food was delicious.The tuna tartare was fantastic. i'm stealing the cantaloupe, stratciatella, and tomato balsamic salad for my kitchen. The Campagnelle was sublime. The braised short rib, while not quite separable by a fork had the perfect flavor.Even the bread and butter was amazing, and they kept bringing out fresh loaves which made a great mop for the sauce. The melon soda was also very tasty!And of course let's not forget the vibe, basically you're walking into a Church of flavor and deliciousness and you will leave a believer!I can't wait to return for brunch!"
8/14/2021,20210814,4,4.33,"Republique is a classic must-go brunch place for anyone who is coming to LA. It has great drinks, foods, and ambiance. They have a good balance of sweet and savory, and I love how they chop up mint in Shakshuka for a hint of refreshner. The menu isn't outrageously creative, but I love how they add their own trademark to each food. The reason why I'm giving 4 star is because there are so many flies during the summer that it is unsanitary and difficult to enjoy the food experience. Plus, I haven't tried all the menu, but I didn't enjoy mushroom toast. It was very blend, no smell, no taste kind of food. Maybe, adding herbs or cheese with distinct smell and flavor would help!"
8/14/2021,20210814,2,4.33,"Food is great, but man, service is just bizarre. Last month, the dishes came out heaviest to lightest (steak first and crudo and oysters last). And tonight, waited 45 minutes past our reservation, then was told shrimp was sold out for us but not for the table next to us. The table next to us was able to order shrimp because they knew the chef and the chef reserves certain number of dishes for friends. That can't be the official policy, is it? If so, not a good look. Live close by so really hoping to have this be a go-to spot, but alas...."
8/15/2021,20210815,5,4.33,"Yum. I am generally not a person willing to stand in long lines for breakfast. However, the line moved fast and we had no problem finding a table outside on the patio after ordering. The chocolate hazelnut bomboloni I started with was delicious, and my cold brew coffee was great. We ordered mushroom toast (so rich and delicious) and the French omelette which came with salad greens. I would definitely order the mushroom toast again and the omelette was great. The greens tasted like maybe there was some fennel pollen on them, very lightly dressed, perfect accompaniment to the eggs. I wish I lived closer, I'd come here frequently."
8/15/2021,20210815,5,4.33,"This place is amazing. For breakfast or dinner, high scale French food that doesn't disappoint"
8/15/2021,20210815,1,4.32,"Headline: lost its charm, prices over-the-top, service missed the mark. We've been here at least twice before. Once about 1.5 years ago and once before that. We had some friends in town and were excited to go back ... clearly the restaurant is still popular because it was nearly impossible to get an inside table on a Saturday. First bad sign was our really slow start at the table. Waiter said hello briefly and then there was a lot of waiting before we ordered wine. We probably killed at least 15 minutes doing nothing. After the wine was ordered we sort of had to demand to our waiter that he take our food order. It had been half an hour and we were starving. We ordered 5 cheeses and the bread board, which seemed like a good snack before entrees would come. He pushed us to order something else because ""he didn't want us to be sitting around for 40 minutes with just bread until our entrees came out"". Fine, so we ordered the tuna tartare. Gimme a break ... for $48 there were four servings of about a tablespoon of tartare. Save your money. The bread and cheese was very good.My main complaint is the - what, to me, seemed to be new - emphasis from the server on sharing plates. I don't recall being pushed in this direction in my past visits. Maybe I was, but this time it was super in your face. He told us more or less we needed to share entrees, everything was meant for sharing. But when you read their menu (online and in person) it's laid out very traditionally and doesn't emphasize this. Fine, we sort of ignored that and each of us ordered an entree. An astute waiter would have noted that we were obviously all ordering our own thing, and would have warned us that this would mean each of us would eat at a different time. When my husband's short rib (which was fine) came out first, and by itself, he kind of moved it towards himself. The waiter literally moved it back to the center of the table and told him he needed to use the sharing plate! (And that it was hot so he shouldn't touch it - it wasn't lol.)The other three entrees came out at different times, spaced apart by about 15 minutes. So yes, clearly they wanted us to share everything! But WE didn't, so we just ate our food staggered. The waiter mentioned that there are 5 separate kitchens working on plates at different speeds, as a flex. To me, this isn't a selling point. I'd be impressed by a kitchen that could magically make 4 dishes appear at once! The chicken and steak were fine, nothing to write home about. I was hoping the veggies underneath the chicken would be a high point, but they were pretty flavorless, oily, and lacking in texture. We opted to skip dessert. We had already been there 2 hours and 15 minutes and didn't want to be there til midnight. I know this is a thing for restaurants to do nowadays, but I'm also opposed to the 4% surcharge so that the restaurant can ""pay competitive comp and health insurance."" This is the cost of you doing business so either build it into your prices (already high!) or don't charge it to the customer. It's your responsibility as the employer to provide those services, not mine. P.S. I saw the prawns at the table next to us (four for $72, that's $18 each!) and boy am I glad we didn't order them. Looked like a lot of shell, not a lot of meat, and those prices, gimme a break. Overall, I would say this was not an eating experience designed to please the customer. Service was spotty/absent, food wasn't memorable, and the balance between quality and price was just way off. Sad to say I won't be going back."
8/18/2021,20210818,5,4.33,"Wow wow wow! If you're in LA, you simply must visit here. We came for brunch, but I feel FOMO because all the cafe and bakery items looked so amazing too! It's one of those places that has you already planning out your next visit before the meal is even over. BTW there's free valet parking next to the restaurant! Don't bother with street parking. STANDOUTS: EGGS: 6/5 all of the eggs are clearly pasture-raised with the most orange-y yolks I've ever seen. Seriously, order anything with an egg. Potato Pancake: 5/5 don't sleep this just because 'potato pancake' looks kind of boring on the menu. The crispy potato pancake comes loaded with salmon, roe, poached egg, and an absolutely insane hollandaise sauce drizzled all over. Brioche French Toast: 5/5 my boyfriend came here before and told me at least 10+ times how this was the best French toast he's ever had and I have to try it. I kept telling him to not overhype it and raise my expectations too much. Even despite that, this French toast blew my mind. It is SO unique. The texture of the brioche is so buttery, dense, and flaky - it immediately makes an impact visually due to its size and it tastes just as good. Highly recommend you douse it in syrup. Regular breakfast, croque madam, and Belgian waffle were good too. Skip the shakshouka for something more special :)"
8/19/2021,20210819,4,4.33,Saw this restaurant on the Cooking Channel - The Best Thing I Ever Ate - must try the Mushroom Toast
8/20/2021,20210820,5,4.33,"Republique was everything that I expected. Amazing! The entire cafe was an absolute fairytale. We went during brunch and got a few items, both sweet and savory. The honey cake was just okay, but the strawberry passion fruit pie was delicious. The earlier you get there the better, as the desserts are limited later in the morning/early afternoon. My favorite item that we ordered was the mushroom toast, next to the potato pancake. We both ordered the golden milk latte and it hit the spot, it was on the sweeter side. Upon arriving, the line was quite long, but it moved fast. Don't get discouraged with the long line, it's well worth it. You will order first and be given a number, to then find your own table. It is self seating, there is no ""putting your name in"". During brunch time, parking wasn't too bad, but it's the typical street parking. Service was good too, even with all the chaos. Republique is a must try, especially if you are in the L.A./ O.C. area."
8/21/2021,20210821,3,4.32,"Food and drinks are good, not the best. The vibe and atmosphere is great and the seating is plenty on weekdays. Long lines on weekends though, with very little room. Biggest complaint for me is lackluster portions for the price they are charging - especially for breakfast and lunch. For example: $20 for a shakshuka half the size of a $15 full size elsewhere in a higher end restaurant. Hence, the ""$$"" dollar sign here on yelp is inaccurate. Should definitely be ""$$$"", as nothing is below $15"
8/21/2021,20210821,3,4.32,"I've had a wonderful dinner here, so figured I'd try a stop through the bakery for brunch while I was in the area. Completely overrated. First, the bakery window was empty to bare bones maybe 4 items to choose. I didn't order anything to take home. Then I ordered the potato pancake for dine in and a matcha latte... lady at the register said the cooks tend to undercook the poached eggs, so I advised I like my yolks runny but whites cooked, what do you call that here? ""Medium"" great. I'll have it medium. My dish arrived with rock hard eggs, powdery yellow yolks. For a $35 breakfast I asked for it to be fixed. Got my plate back and the potato pancake itself was rock hard. Cold hard oily and bland. Staff said they are overwhelmed on weekends. Suppose they'd do better to have reserved seating with wait staff so they can manage flow and quality better. Today's experience just wasn't worth it."
8/22/2021,20210822,5,4.32,"My friends and I came here for a saturday dinner. We started off with some baguette and butter. They serve fresh baguette and I couldn't stop eating them! Also ordered kanpachi crudo and heirloon tomatoes; both were very refreshing and tasty. They were perfect summer dishes. For entrees, we ordered corn agnolotti and organic chicken. Personally I'm not a huge fan of pasta, but I enjoyed the corn agnolotti which was very flavorful. The chicken was very delicious, it was very tender, juicy, and flavorful. The skin was very crispy. Grits and veggies that came with the chicken was also very delicious. I highly recommend the chicken."
8/22/2021,20210822,5,4.32,Good food and service as always. Always pleasant to visit.Can't wait to try they new restaurant in century city.
8/24/2021,20210824,5,4.33,Super cute place! Line moved very fast and we had no issues finding seats. Loved it! Valet very convenient.
8/25/2021,20210825,4,4.32,"The prices were a little pricey (but worth it for the entire experience) and the place was PACKED (waited in line for about 30 minutes), but the food and service were great! Really beautifully plated food, and the ambience inside the restaurant made us feel like we were somewhere in Europe lmao. Lots of great breakfast options!"

8/29/2021,20210829,5,4.33,"Who's hungry? Follow the Range Rovers to Republique, absolutely one of the best breakfast/brunch/lunches in LA. It's that good!First, the bad and the ugly: parking. Ugh! Valet is a bit of a scene, but plenty of meters on La Brea and freebie two hour parking on neighborhood residential streets during the day. There always seems to be a line outside Republique in the morning, but don't be discouraged -- the line moves fast and you can listen in on Mom and Dad sending Marlborough School daughter off to Yale. Lacrosse scholarship! The Republique building itself is like 500 years old or something and is super cool. Bigger than it looks, too, so don't worry about finding a seat after you order. Ignore the old saying about not filling up on bread. Enjoy that fresh-based baguette with a side pot of French normandy butter ($7) that is so good you just cannot believe it. [Yelp tip: you can duplicate that butter at Trader Joe's -- look for the ""cultured salted butter from Brittany, France"" ($4.99) and have a pretend-Republique day at home]. I've never had dinner there, but the breakfast items are unbeatable and there are tons of baked goods. For lunch, try the arugula salad with fresh peaches. Want more carbs -- a $25 burger and fries? Yes yes yes -- it's Republique!"
8/29/2021,20210829,5,4.33,"Slipped in for a quick breakfast & had the Santa Monica Farmers Market fruit & chia seed pudding. Also the, smoked salmon on potato pancake. Both excellent!"
8/29/2021,20210829,1,4.32,Overrated bakery. They have varieties on menu but the portion is so small and nothing special about this place besides the amazing interior design.
8/30/2021,20210830,5,4.33,"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. My boyfriend and I came for brunch and there was a bit of a line but went by quick and there were plenty of seats. We got the BLT Benedict, Short Rib Sandwich, Carrot OJ, Grapefruit Juice and Banana Cream Pie.My BLT Benedict was very delicious. The egg was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got the short rib sandwich and he said it was good. He loves his sauce but there was way too much in the sandwich. The drinks were very refreshing and the banana cream pie was yummy!Definitely want to come back to try their dinner menu."
8/30/2021,20210830,5,4.33,"The egg, potato and bread breakfast was unreal! The bread with French butter and homemade jam was heaven. Switched out the bacon for avocado. Ordered around 6-7 pastries all were fantastic. I loved the chocolate chip cookie and the Basque cheesecake."
8/31/2021,20210831,3,4.33,"This restaurant was recommended by a friend. We celebrated a milestone for my daughter and had brunch there. I was expecting to be waited on. Instead, you order from the counter (pastries) and if you didn't want any thing from the counter, the person directed us to the cashier where we ordered our lunch/brunch. It was Panera type of ordering. The bus staff was quick and brought us water and our utensils. The restaurant had nice atmosphere, open and airy. We ordered the French toast, green juice, golden juice and eggs benedict. They food was delicious. Although The French toast was plain, with no berries, it was tasty, light, and fluffy. The eggs on the Benedict was made to perfection. Thought it was pricey for what we ordered."
8/31/2021,20210831,4,4.32,"Lovely restaurant! I especially enjoy going there for breakfast. Coffee is delicious and the assortment of bakery items look scrumptious although I usually go for the meals. I did eat dinner there one night but was not impressed with the steak I ordered, it was tough. There were other dinner items that I should have tried instead. The staff is very friendly and courteous. I am a solo diner so they were very considerate ."
9/1/2021,20210901,3,4.32,"Average food overhyped restaurant. Ordered the mushroom toast and fruit toast. Fruit toast was good but the mushroom toast is overhyped, not much flavor."
9/2/2021,20210902,5,4.32,"I dined at the restaurant for the first time last night. Overall the meal was excellent and maybe even exceptional and the service was top flight as was the ambience. They tout the bread and butter as being phenomenal and it did not disappoint. The seasonal tomato salad with burrata was awesome. Nothing was disappointing. Expensive but to be expected, and in line with similar places. I would like to see more selection of beers but the German pilsner Rothhaus was terrific - never heard of it before."
9/5/2021,20210905,5,4.32,"Republique is one of the best breakfast and brunch places in LA. They have a great selection of quality food AND the place is super cute inside.But before I get into food details, let's talk logistics. Street parking was easy to find (I typically find parking within a block of the cafe). We had a group of 5 on a Saturday morning (9AM), and only waited in line for about 5 minutes. They'll take your pastry orders while you're in line and get your food orders at the cashier, where they'll also give you a number. Seating is first come first serve. It wasn't difficult to find seats for my group, but I imagine it would become more difficult as you get closer to 11AM. The line gets pretty long and the cafe more packed as you get later into the morning. Orders:Kimchi Fried Rice: We were a little skeptical to order this because Republique is labeled as a French breakfast cafe, but it looked really good so we decided to give it a shot. It was surprisingly light for fried rice, which I loved! Tasted very fresh, had great texture, and the eggs were perfectly poached. I'd definitely order this again. Shakshouka: Whenever we come here, this is always on our receipt. A delicious blend of tomatoes, peppers, chickpeas, and yogurt. It's topped with eggs and is best eaten with their baguette. I read that there's kale in there too, but really couldn't tell (I don't like Kale, so I consider that a win).Mushroom toast: A perfectly balanced piece of toast with ham, spinach, hollandaise, red wine sauce, and the fluffiest scrambled eggs you've probably ever had. The crunchy texture of the toast and the softness of the eggs made me very happy. Regular breakfast: You can order your eggs any style with this one (we went with over easy). The bacon steak was pretty intimidating due to how thicc it was, but it was pretty good. The potates were cooked to perfection, and the baguette - omg, the baguette - with the butter - all the yes! This dish is basically a high quality / fancy standard breakfast, and I'm all here for it. Fruit tart: The fruit itself was ripe, but not too ripe. It was like the perfect fruit to go on top of the pastry. The pastry itself wasn't too sweet, and it was crumbly but not messy. I def recommend. Regrets: I wish we ordered extra baguettes to go. The bread here was SO good. However, by the time we finished eating, the line was too long and we had other places to be. Next time, we will leave with baguettes. Overall, coming here has always been a great experience and the food never disappoints."
9/5/2021,20210905,3,4.32,Update: We ordered the Berries Tres Leches for my birthday and it was the driest tres leches I have ever had. The only thing that helped a little were the cream and berries. Order a slice at the restaurant. It tastes a lot better than taking home a whole cake.
9/5/2021,20210905,5,4.32,"I absolutely love this place! So much to choose from! The Regular Breakfast is far from ""regular"" the bread pudding is to die for and the coffee.... Get in my tummy! We also grabbed some of their amazing French pastries for the road, oh and a slice of pie, and maybe a few cookies!!!Go visit!"
9/6/2021,20210906,4,4.32,"One of the most popular and best brunch places in LA! République is a modern French restaurant with a bakery and cocktail bar. We came to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were not able to make reservations in advance. The line was long on Sunday during peak hours but moved quickly. You order and pay for your food and then find seating. We ordered the regular breakfast, croque madame, kimchi fried rice, and Vietnamese latte. Presentation definitely looks nice and portions were a good size. The croque madame and kimchi fried rice are two of their popular dishes. I originally wanted to order the maine lobster omelette, but sadly they did not have the ingredients to make it. The food came out in a timely manner, but it was hard flagging down a server. We asked two different staffs for to-go boxes but they never came back. It took us the 3rd try asking the manager for to-go boxes to get them. Overall, they brunch was delicious and pretty solid. I definitely want to come back to try other french pastries and brunch dishes!"
9/6/2021,20210906,1,4.32,"Terrible service, totally not worth the hype. People at the counter were rude and inattentive. They just want you to get off the line as soon as possible to keep it moving. I ordered a box of pastries, the lady didn't know the name of the items and kept asking me to point at them very impatiently. They put all my pastries in a tiny box that wouldn't close and got pissed off when I asked to move them to a larger box, and asked me to move to the side of the line. Wow, just wow! I had a better service at a freaking 7/11! Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Overhyped and the food isn't even that great!"
9/7/2021,20210907,5,4.32,"Hands down to this amazing place. It was worth the wait. Arriving at the place at 10am seems like okay until you get there and see the long line. My bf and I almost left and just go to another restaurant, but we decided to wait in line and find out what's with this restaurant? Why are people falling in line? And I got the answers. As soon as you're inside, you'll smell the fresh baked goods and pastries! Heaven. You can order the pastries and you can choose to seat wherever. Then that's when you decide what meal to order. The food tasted great too. And the ambiance inside of the restaurant was really cool. Will definitely come back and try their other pastries."
9/7/2021,20210907,4,4.32,"Brunch review: Such a wonderful experience. As a major foodie I had very high expectations. My boyfriend found this place for us to have brunch on Labor Day weekend. So busy but the line was about 20 minutes and nothing terrible. I will say get there before 11am if you want any pastries they were wiped clean! Although anything they had left we ordered and it was fantastic baked goods. My boyfriend had the eggs Benedict and I had the quiche. What a delicacy that summer quiche was! The only change I would make is the organization of ordering is a bit chaotic. This is an order first then sit and get a table brunch, wish I had known before! Otherwise we will definitely be back because that breakfast was literally the best thing I've eaten in ages!"
9/8/2021,20210908,5,4.32,"This place has been in my bookmark forever, so I had to try it out before I leave. We started with the strawberry passion fruit cream pie and the baguette, and both of which were delicious. The pie was surprisingly not too sweet, and I love the jam that came with the baguette. I got the Kimchi Fried Rice, and let me tell you this is a MUST if you come here. Even though it's a dish I make at home myself, they made it so flavorful that I would definitely come back for it. We ended the meal with chia seed pudding. and it was very refreshing after the fried rice. You order first and get a number before you find a seat to sit down. Parking is tricky as always but there's a valet."
9/8/2021,20210908,5,4.32,"Dinner at Republique was a great experience. The server was very friendly and gave us great suggestions on the menu. For starter, the baguette was fresh and crunchy from the outside & soft from the inside. The butter was also very good! The tomato salad had some fresh ricotta, different types of tomatoes, melon, & BASIL (really made a difference for me) and it all just tasted so fresh. Great meal starter!The Campanelle was definitely a favorite. Pasta & lobster were Fresh & flavorful. I enjoyed every bite!The Liberty Duck was my least favorite but to be fair it wasn't a bad order. Just not my cup of tea.Also the place is so aesthetically pleasing. I loved the interior and the sunlight coming in the middle of the space.I would totally come again. Would love to try their brunch"
9/9/2021,20210909,5,4.32,"Many of my friends and YELP buddies have been raving about Republique, so when my group stopped by for brunch we were a little intimidated by the 30 to 40 minute line (reservations only available at dinner time). Being the foodie that I am I said lets wait it out and boy am I glad that we did. We ordered the pupusa, potato pancake, kimchi fried rice, bread pudding and a ube bobolini.Bread Pudding ($7) - This was everyone's favorite dish. The bread pudding was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside with some berries baked in. The cream that accompanied this dish really helped to take this dish to the next level.Kimchi Fried Rice ($21) - This rice dish was packed with so much flavor and consisted of pieces of beef short rib, pickled radish, sesame seeds, and 2 soft poached eggs.Potato Pancake ($21)- This large and extremely crispy potato pancake was topped with smoked salmon, salmon roe, hollandaise, dill and soft poached eggs. It was another great tasting dish.Pupusa ($18) - This was another amazing dish made of black beans filled with mushrooms, zucchini blossoms, oaxacan cheese, avocado, and top with salsa roja, crema and fried egg. So much flavor in this dish and it was so fresh!Peach Smoothie ($9) - I was looking for something to cool off on this hot day, and found the smoothie to be just ok and something I could have made at home. Not really impressed with this overpriced drink.Ube Bomboloni ($3.50) - This is an Italian style donut filled with ube cream. To me it was overpriced and didn't have much flavor to it, I would pass on this next time.Overall each and every entrée that my group tried was phenomenal! Without a doubt this is the BEST breakfast spot in Southern California! The group's favorite was bread pudding and it's a must when coming here! I'm going to have to check out their dinner options one of these days. The staff is extremely helpful. There is street parking around the area as well as valet parking."
9/9/2021,20210909,5,4.32,"The food, service, and ambiance were wonderful. I really enjoys how detail the servers were in changing plates and utensils for all the new dishes. They always coming back to check on your table. The chef even provides you a free corn soup as starter. That was the best simple corn soup I ever had. Let me start of the Kanpachi CRUDO fruits salad was the top 10 with very light and sweetness from peach, apple, cucumber, and Kanpachi fish. Even the salad presentation was beautiful and delicious. The red wine braised short rib was the best short rib I had with mushroom sauce. I couldn't stop dipping in the sauce. Great place and awesome food perfect for date night."
9/9/2021,20210909,3,4.32,"Made a reservation for 2 in advance at the back patio for an experience. Waited 30-45 minutes just to be seated. The server didn't get to us for another 10-15 minutes while they rounded on the other tables. Ordering food felt like I was being rushed to choose from the menu. The three stars are for the food. Quality and taste was very good-- also the hazelnut ice cream for dessert tasted heavenly. I don't think I will come back for dinner because it was such a long wait and the service wasn't as good as I expected republique to be. Hats off to the chefs though, great food!"
9/9/2021,20210909,5,4.32,"Cool architecture, long line to order. I came here to eat before my appt. nearby. Amazing architecture and use of space. I wanted to indulge in 2 dozen of their pastries, but I know it wouldn't be good for my already ""dad bod"", nevertheless, I ate like a pig and enjoyed everything about it except the line to order and the shared tables. A little to close for my comfort!"
9/9/2021,20210909,4,4.32,"Amazing pastries. Large restaurant with lots of seating. You pay at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The coffee is on the bitter side. If you eat meat, the bacon steak is heavenly! On the pricey side, but worth it."
9/10/2021,20210910,2,4.32,Lunch/brunch review- It was a far better experience when we used to go a couple of yrs ago. They took the better dishes off the menu and it is just way too pricey for what it is. 21 dollars for kimchi fried rice 18 for Dried up chicken salad. Really disappointed!
9/11/2021,20210911,5,4.32,"YES!!!!2nd time I've gone, and my family and I are looking forward to coming again! Everything was perfect from the food, service, cleanliness, looks etc! This is not a cheap place to dine BUT you pay for what you get. This is the PERFECT place for hosting celebrations and large group reservations! Highly highly recommend this place whether you are a local or tourist!"
9/11/2021,20210911,5,4.32,Staple place to go when visiting LA. The line can be long and daunting sometimes but it moves fast and I e never had an issue finding a seat!
9/12/2021,20210912,5,4.32,"Full disclosure, I Iove this restaurant, hence the 5 star rating. However, hopefully they will improve their banana creme pie. Crust was not flaky; it was tough & chewy akin to dried, wet cardboard. Balance btwn custard & whipped cream was 20-80 when it should have been 80-20. What custard I could taste was great, just needed more of it to taste like a BANANA cream pie. Cardboard slathered in whipped cream is not up to Republique's standards."
9/14/2021,20210914,5,4.32,11/10 came here for a rehearsal dinner and the servers couldn't have been more attentive. the food was insane - especially the meat and tartar toast. could not get enough. I know why this place has 5k reviews. BRUNCH IS INSANE AND REASONABLY PRICED!!
9/15/2021,20210915,3,4.32,"This place might be slightly overrated but still a decent place for brunch. Their ube pastries are delicious. I've had their mushroom toast, potato pancake, croque madame, and pupusa - they're all good but not really anything to write home about. I tried their chia seed pudding recently and it was unexpectedly good. They have an online pre-order process that's rather convenient. Expect a long line (about 30 min to an hour on a Saturday morning), but it moves pretty quickly. Overall not a bad choice for brunch, especially if you have friends visiting from out of town (mine really enjoyed Republique)."
9/16/2021,20210916,4,4.32,"Came for brunch and of course there was a line out the door...so the way it works is you order inside (lines mainly for bakery but you also order brunch items there) and then grab a seat.It's known for the baked goods and pastries and they are DELISH! Honestly would just come for those but brunch is good too.+ they had a few different seating options when we went in around 9:30/10 am+ my boyfriend loved his benedict (highly rated)+ got the cheesecake, canelle, and peach danish and loved all! The cheesecake is a MUST+ conveniently located near a bus stop+ interior is gorgeous, lots of natural lights and cool patterned floors!- the shakshuka fell flat for me mostly because I didn't get the tomato-y flavor I like and it was very greek style with the yogurt, also too sour for my taste (chickpeas was a nice add though)"

I've been coming here for years and have always been blown away by the cozy, up-scale ambiance, super knowledgeable staff (especially about wine), and delicious food. The menu's been a bit pared down during the pandemic, but when they're in full swing it's one of my favorite haunts in LA. I can't speak for the breakfast/brunch because I only ever go there for dinner, but I often see the line out the door during the day, so add some extra time in your schedule if that's your plan!"

9/18/2021,20210918,5,4.32,"Best breakfast spot in LA, whether you need a go-to for European pastries and breakfast dishes, or if you're visiting from out of town. The old church space is gorgeous, and there's plenty of seating for distancing inside as well as outside. It's definitely a bit of a splurge for a breakfast, but well worth it. Get there right around when it opens to avoid waiting in line. I haven't been for dinner, but have heard good things. It's difficult to choose just one pastry, as they're all so great. The Manzkes have really created something special. The cookbook is great, too. Love Republique!"
9/18/2021,20210918,3,4.32,"Food and service are great but we sometimes hesitate to come because the restaurant has a habit of being out of high chairs for our little one. Was willing to brush it off the first time, and even the second. But after three times it's a habit. Y'all need more high chairs, particularly on the weekends when a lot of families come to the restaurant."

The steak is cooked perfectly and the duck is tender and paired well with sweet caramelized peaches.Our waitress recommended the bread and butter and I'm so glad we took her up on her suggestion. The butter is flown in from Normandy and adds flavor and creaminess to the rich crispiness of the baguette.Service is top notch. The only thing that I didn't like was the Japanese highball cocktail. Too much soda water diluted the drink, and the overall flavor profile was a bit bitter."
9/19/2021,20210919,3,4.32,"The start of the night was great. They accommodated us after being a little late. Our server was amazing, very personable, and attentive. The food was absolutely delicious. The only complaint I would of had was the small portions of the dishes for the large price tags, but I was willing to look pass it due to all the positives. I mean, every plate we had was mouthwatering. Just wished there was a bit more. When we asked for the bill, we politely requested to take the 4% fee off so we could compensate that on the tip instead. On the menu it is written in small writing on the bottom of the page, ""If you would like this removed, please let us know"". Which we did. The manager or whoever was in the suit rudely snatched the check away. When he returned to our table he had a fake smile, gave us attitude and threw the check down holding it with his middle finger, ever so discreetly. Of course we wouldn't have noticed? On top of that, he added a $1.00 ""open bottle"" fee (but, we ordered a bottle of wine from THEIR menu, so I don't understand what this fee was for besides pettiness). If they had such a big problem about the 4%, don't write down that we can request it to have it removed. Such a good night ruined due to this person's disrespectful and uncalled for behavior."

Food - 4 stars - I ordered the regular breakfast $21 and the kimchi fried rice $21. The regular breakfast had this delicious baguette and a slab of bacon steak. Pretty good, but $21 seemed a bit steep. The $21 kimchi fried rice had 2 poached eggs on top with very little short rib - I counted 8 pieces of meat, maybe 1/2 inch cubes - not much protein in this entree, but tasty, not spicy.Ambiance-3 stars - the COVID seating area was adequate.Parking - street parking available on LaBrea- bring quarters since the meters have a problem accepting credit cards."

Their email ordering system was super easy. The staff was very responsive and answered any and all my questions. I pulled up to the dedicated window for pickup orders (no line!) And picked up my Tart. Super easy pick up. Now for the taste....tart crust is very thin and delicious. This tart is incredible! So delicious and fresh. They put fruit on top (they asked if this is what I wanted) and the fruit was so fresh. It's a fairly big tart --- it's delicious and I'd definitely order this again as well as other items from them. Everything was very clear,explained well and accurate. Thank you guys and whoever made our delicious tart!! :))"
9/22/2021,20210922,5,4.31,"Dinner at Republique was a great experience. The server was very friendly and gave us great suggestions on the menu. For starter, the baguette was fresh and crunchy from the outside & soft from the inside. The butter was also very good! - I know it's just butter but it was above than average butter The tomato salad had some fresh ricotta, different types of tomatoes, melon, & BASIL (really made a difference for me) and it all just tasted so refreshing. Great meal starter!  The Campanelle was definitely a favorite. Pasta & lobster were fresh & flavorful. I enjoyed every bite! The Liberty Duck was my least favorite but to be fair it wasn't a bad order. Just not my cup of tea. Also the place is so aesthetically pleasing. I loved the interior and the sunlight coming in the middle of the space.I would totally come again. Would love to try their brunch"
9/23/2021,20210923,3,4.3,"EaterLA: When Walter and Margarita Manzke took over the iconic Campanile space, they knew the stakes were high. And who in LA would have thought they would've succeeded this much, offering a breakfast-to-dinner menu with a French point of view? Throw in some pockets of new American and Asian influences, and the bill of fare will likely appeal to everyone. The desserts, breads, and pastries by Margarita are as good as one can expect, while the charcuterie board is sure to stun anyone."
9/24/2021,20210924,4,4.3,"The brunch in Republique is great! The eggs are so good and soft. We order Mushroom Toast and BLT Benedict. Overall, the quality of food is good and here are more details:Mushroom Toast: the combination of soft eggs, ham, sautéed mushroom and spinach on the toast is pretty good. The toast is soft in the middle since it absorb the red wind sauce but crispy outside. The only con is that the portion is kind of small and the red wine sauce is little bit salty. BLT Benedict: the Benedict is good but the smoked beacon is pretty salty. It also added lots of cheese therefore, it is easy to get overwhelm having few bites. The Rephblique has been there for over a decade. Overall, The quality of food is good but little bit pricy."
9/24/2021,20210924,3,4.3,"My girlfriend and I went to Republique as we heard their French cuisine was excellent. I guess everyone heard that too as the lines were long and reservations were hard to come by. Because of COVID guidelines, the communal table setup greatly hindered seating capacity - we waited for almost an hour to be seated.We both got the tuna tartare for starters - the tuna was very fresh, but a bit too salty for our liking. For mains, she ordered the lobster while I got the duck breast. We were both impressed with the lobster - it was juicy and still kept its distinct flavor despite the mix of herbs and spices. The duck was also tender and well-seasoned, but a bit dry. Our food took a while to show up, but props to the service crew for refilling our glasses and giving us regular updates. Food was pricey, as expected, but the portions and quality of cooking made up for it. All in all we had a good time - would rather go back when the lines subside, though."
9/24/2021,20210924,5,4.3,"So glad I chose to come to this place for breakfast. And we came early so we were able to not wait long and find a seat. You basically wait in line and put in your order, pay, and then go find a seat with the number they give to place on table. They will then bring you your food. My favorite was the BLT Benedict, delish! I liked the potato pancake also cause it was crispy. Everything I tried, I liked. Would definitely go back there if I'm in town again."
9/24/2021,20210924,1,4.3,"We showed up at 6:10 to celebrate our aunt's 75th birthday for a reservation that we double confirmed outside and then they claimed they didn't have our reservation after admitting they were overbooked for the night. Felt more like we were not pretty enough to win the table. At that time the restaurant was empty but seems like they were anticipating the tables to come later. Instead of seating us outside, after lots of back and forth and our visibly deflated dejected look they offered us a high traffic spot (seeing our older aunt would not be comfortable during the pandemic in that area) and told us we would need to be out by a certain time but that we could be move to the Bar! (The BAR!) for dessert! It was beyond snobby and insulting. A short time ago restaurants like this were begging people to come back so their industry could resume. Short memory I guess."
9/24/2021,20210924,1,4.29,This restaurant has some of the worst customer service that I've ever gotten in La. I ordered the potato pancake with no fish eggs at the door. When the dish came to my table I asked that the eggs be cooked hard and apologized for the change. It took over 20 mins for another plate to come out while other people where being served the same thing around me. When the plate finally arrived there are fish eggs on it ( that's after I had to stop two staff members about my order). So again I had to send it back this next plate arrived much quicker than the last I took a few bites then realized that the staff scraped the fish eggs off the top and gave me the SAME PLATE back again. After cutting into the third meal I found fish eggs were under the eggs and sauce. At this point I had to just ask for a refund. The manager never came by my table once! Please work on your customer service because of this I will never come back and spend my money here.
9/25/2021,20210925,5,4.29,"Republique definitely takes brunch to another level. Came here on Sunday around 1 PM. I was able to find street parking nearby. They do have valet parking - I believe it was around $8? There was a line to order food. My friend went to line up first and ordered the food for us.What we ordered:-Kimchi fried rice: surprisingly, really good! You wouldn't think to order it here.-French omelette-BLT benedict-This morning's bread (large): the butter and jam for the bread was delicious. Highly recommend this to get for the table to share.The food was really good. We even got the chocolate cake with salted caramel for dessert - that was super decadent and delicious. I'd definitely go back here if I'm ever in the area and want to treat myself to a fancy brunch!"
9/25/2021,20210925,5,4.3,"The entrees are delicious and the pastries are amazing. The service is friendly, fast, and wonderful. The ambience is cool, fun, and casual. The energy of this place is great overall. Highly recommend!!"
9/25/2021,20210925,3,4.29,"Went there for my birthday dinner! No one acknowledged it. I guess they did not believe me! I mean why would I lie? Going through the reviews it looks like this happens often. The place is very cute but overpriced. So, brunch might be a better option for people who don't want to spend $300. Also, if it is your birthday just chose another restaurant."

9/27/2021,20210927,5,4.29,"I've been to Republique for brunch before, but never got the chance to try dinner until now. FLAVOR (4.5/5):1. TAYLOR BAY KUMAMOTO OYSTERS: The oysters were a great way to start off the dinner. They were fresh and paired nicely with the yuzu. 1.5. At this point of the dinner, we received complimentary tomato coconut soup, which tasted like Thai coconut curry. It was a nice addition and balanced out the palate well. 2. BLUE FIN TUNA TARTARE: The highlight of the night. the bread was perfectly toasted and everything just melted in my mouth... We originally got just 2 of these, but just had to get seconds... 3. BRUSSEL SPROUTS CARBONARA: I actually don't like brussel sprouts, but will always try something I don't like at a restaurant like Republique. If a restaurant can make me like something I don't typically enjoy, it's automatically a win in my book... And Republique didn't disappoint. One thing to note is that it was surprisingly heavy. We almost wished there was a little bit less of it (it was split between 2 people), so that we would be better equipped to handle the rest of the dishes to come... But that's just because we ordered a lot. 4. WHITE TRUFFLE RISOTTO: The white truffle risotto was great. It was my first time having risotto and I was impressed, to say the least. 5. RED WINE BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIB: The short rib was a little much. The flavor was strong and rich; it was not a dish I wanted to end the meal on, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it. The rest of the dishes set a very high bar, and this dish fell a little short. The short rib itself, however, was cooked beautifully. 6. STRAWBERRY TIRAMISU: Since we got a lot of food, we wanted to end on a light note and opted for the tiramisu. The tiramisu was amazing - light and fluffy with some tart notes from the red powder on top. Definitely a great way to end the night. SERVICE (5/5):The service was perfect. We never ran out of water and were checked up on often throughout the meal. TAKEAWAYS: I would definitely come back to Republique again to try more of their menu. I had a great time and wish I could have eaten more, but I was so full by the end of the night..."

9/29/2021,20210929,5,4.3,Best breakfast burrito ever! I really enjoyed the burrito and I had thought the portions were gonna be smaller but they were actually pretty generous and the burrito was enough for my boyfriend and I to share. The pastries were super delicious as well. I would recommend buying a few pastries and sharing the entrees if you're hoping to try a few things.

To start this review, full disclosure that this is not a recent visit so the review may not be fair but I do remember the treatment we received. When we came here, it was pre-pandemic. I'm only writing something because it's on my Yelp list of unfinished reviews. We came here for dinner. It is hard to find street parking. It was extremely packed. We waited for a good 40 minutes. Then when I notice people that arrived after us were getting seated before us, I started to get hangry. When I brought it up to the hostess, she gave us attitude. Not cool. We thought it was a boutiquey type of restaurant since we had to wait for our ""table"". Instead, it has a bar / cafeteria dining hall setup where you share tables. We got seated at a high table that we shared with others. Somehow they were able to distinguish people's orders. With the reviews we saw on Yelp, we were expecting something great. Instead we just got average but pricy food. To say the least, we have not returned."

The pastries are to die for and I will admit I haven't fell into their trap up until the past few times I've gone... it is hard to stand in line towering over these beautiful, fresh baked pastries and desserts without ordering them. The food is always good and it always pushed me to try something new as everything on the menu sounds so good! The first time I went I had a sope and it was delishes! Hope for it to be in the menu every time I go. The breakfast burrito was also very good, super saucy which is how I like it! I've gotten to try many things and they are all good. I have yet to come here for dinner but it is surely on my list to try!"

10/4/2021,20211004,2,4.29,"This place is riding the wave of their reputation, as the ""it"" bar of la right now so put in 0 efforts for their customers. We had made a reservation for 7pm and checked in but could not be seated until after 8. This wouldn't have been such an issue if they kept saying ""oh 5 min, your table is almost ready"" clearly our table was not ""almost ready, just being cleaned."" Very strange interactions the entire time from the staff. When we were finally seated, we eagerly eye the menu and order prawns for an app. The waitress (who was rude but for the sake being unable to explain how rude she was, will continue on to the facts) said the restaurant was out of prawns. Okay disappointing but it happens. HOWEVER, about 60 min later while we had moved on and we're on dessert waiting for our check the table next to us orders prawns and it is brought out for them. What the heck?! We asked our (very snarky and not present) waitress and she says friends of chef so they reserve them and have a tally in the kitchen. Idk all very shady shady stuff.Come if you're idea of a good night is dropping around $200 a person, getting lied to, being gaslighted about said lied and feeling like a sucker.Also their corn chowder tastes exactly like Trader Joe's boxed one. Ok done!"
10/4/2021,20211004,5,4.29,"This place uses very high quality ingredients all around. I probably had the best breakfast in LA ever since I moved out here.Croque monsieur, eggs Benedict, Nutella bomboloni and freshly squeezed OJ and grapefruit.Nothing fancy, yet very well executed.Love this place"
10/5/2021,20211005,5,4.29,"I absolutely adore Republique. The brioche French toast is a must try!!! The ambiance, the vibe, the quality in food exceeds my expectations. Once you step into the restaurant, for a second, you forget you're in LA. Definitely a hidden gem."
10/5/2021,20211005,5,4.29,"If I could dine here everyday I would! This is by far my number one restaurant in LA. I've been here at least 5 times in the last year or so and every time everything is amazing. Interior, food, wine and spectacular service. My favorites are the short rib, pesto pasta and ""leftovers of the pan"" with butter and freshly baked baguette! So yummy!"
10/5/2021,20211005,5,4.3,Republique is hands down my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in LA. Everything I've ordered here has been incredible. Expensive but very much well worth it. I highly recommend the potato pancake dish!
10/6/2021,20211006,1,4.29,"Bad service, long waits, you have to find a place for yourself to sit in the crowded restaurant. They broke a glass in front of me bc they were rushing so much. It flew all around, they apologized but it's still dangerous. Chaotic place that's not worth your time. If at least food tasted exceptional, I'd understand but it's nothin special"
10/7/2021,20211007,4,4.29,"The ambiance is perfect for a casual, but cute and fun brunch vibe! The wait is very long if you're going on the weekend though so be prepared. There are tons of delicious looking pastries / ready made options or you can get something fresh off the menu. I got the ricotta toast which was really food but a little hard around the edges to bite into. Still very tasty and would recommend though!!My cousin got an omelette which was decent but I'd recommend getting something a little more adventurous. The smoothies / juice drinks were amazing, we got coffee and a smoothie because we couldn't resist. Can't go wrong with one of these regardless of flavor!"
10/7/2021,20211007,2,4.29,"Republique seems to have lost its luster. I love the space and have had many great meals there in the past, but lately it seems like while the food is good, nothing really stands out as amazing. At this level of restaurant that just doesn't cut it when places like Bestia or AOC are still turning out really great stuff.Last night I took foodie friends from out of town to dinner tonight and was particularly disappointed. They didn't have the bottle of white wine I bought, so they brought another that wasn't chilled. The service was sporadic... our server was rarely seen, but the guys pouring water were so overzealous that it got annoying (including continually asking people to move out of the way so they could pour water). We had one guest that was running late and they didn't attend to him for about 15 minutes after he arrived. I know restaurants have off nights, but the whole thing was just a disappointment and I'm just not sure I'll be back anytime soon."
10/7/2021,20211007,5,4.29,Dover Sole was the best I have ever had. service....parfaite It is satisfying when a place lives up to it's reputation
10/9/2021,20211009,1,4.28,"Food is really bad, I don't understand how anyone recommends this. I ordered a mushroom toast for $20 and it isn't even as good as street food. Mushroom is overly creamy and salty, and the toast is overly baked and bitter. The place is very noisy. Horrific experience"
10/9/2021,20211009,4,4.28,Place great nice crowd. Food was delicious. The only negative point is you have to preorder while queuing so make sure not to forget your toasts or feel an extra espresso.. the line is long and the staff a bit too busy.
10/13/2021,20211013,5,4.28,"Stopped in for a quick bite before lunch, so pretty much a brunch. Ambience is really great. A lot of space interior wise, with beautiful decor and the pastries were amazing; along with the cooked entrées as well. Definitely recommend it if you're in the area and even if you're not, it's worth a trip out here."
10/13/2021,20211013,5,4.29,"Sophisticated place, very authentic atmosphere and a story beautiful store behind this building. Have to be here :)"
10/13/2021,20211013,4,4.29,"This place came highly recommended for baked goods but overall I found it to be a mixed bag. First of all, this place has such a huge selection of goodies, I'm sure there is something for everyone. All the items were very well made and were of the highest quality. The items I particularly enjoyed were the matcha donut, berry croissant, and Créme Brulee Bomboloni. The donut was huge and the dough itself was incredibly well made, fluffy and light. The match icing was perfectly sweet and subtly flavorful. The berry croissant had the best cream I've ever tasted. It was generously filled and so light and sweet, it was like heaven in every bite. Easily the highlight of all the goodies. The Créme Brulee Bomboloni had a wonderful crunch to it with a flavorful filling inside. The other items were more disappointing as the pop tart was quite bland and hard while the ham and cheese croissant was very soggy with a poorly made croissant. Like I said, some items were great and some were below average but overall I think it is worth the trip to see what your favorites might be and to enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant."
10/15/2021,20211015,5,4.29,"Came here for brunch and had a phenomenal experience. The staff matches the beautiful high ceiling atmosphere with gorgeous arches and lighting. Definitely not robot vibes at this place. I don't know the name of the person who took my order but I asked for his recommendation. When he picked up the menu I thought he was going to just hand it to me instead of telling me since they were busy. To my delight, he enthusiastically walked me through a bunch of great options! When I sat down in the large open hall, I was greeted by James. As a lone wanderer, I found it really touching to be reminded that I exist and with such a warm, welcoming, fun vibe. The potato pancake was amazing. It's like a fried hash brown with salmon benedict on top! I don't know what amazing chicken lays those golden eggs but they are something special. The caviar or whatever fish eggs that are on it were the diamonds of food if food were rocks. The coffee is smooth, delicious, and a fabulous presentation."
10/15/2021,20211015,4,4.29,Came here on a random Friday day. Ordered the sangria carafe to share and had the steak with fries. The mail was just okay. But love the ambiance of the spot. Good times
10/15/2021,20211015,5,4.29,"Their dinners are just as delicious as their bakery and brunch items! It was our first time trying out their evening menu. Every item tasted so good and ambience (especially outside under the lights) that we actually lost track of time, sauntering out of there 4 hours later! We'll be back soon!"
10/15/2021,20211015,5,4.29,"Fan-f*cking-tastic! You won't regret it. Food, ambiance, friendliest staff, exceptional service. Can not wait to go back."
10/15/2021,20211015,5,4.29,"The mushroom toast was great. The topping was rich and a little creamy, which I like. The bread was crunch at the edge and some softness in the middle. Pastries hit my heart. Ordered the ones looked pretty and tasty. Though it's much an ""influencer place,"" I'll def come again."
10/17/2021,20211017,5,4.29,"Great experience,My favorite food is the breakfast shakshuka.I've been coming over for the last four months. I would recommend coming a bit early as the place tends to get crowded and the line is long.But worth every second of waiting."
10/18/2021,20211018,4,4.29,"Went here on a friend's recommendation for Saturday brunch. Line was super long (expected) but didn't mind it cause it was worth the wait. The place looked small from the outside, but definitely fooled me because it's quite huge once you go inside; loked like a quaint coffee shop from the outside, but beautiful interior. Pastries were top notch! Coffee was superb. Can't go wrong with mimosa either. But what blew me away was the lobster omelette. BEST OMELETTE I'VE EVER HAD! It was soft, buttery, rich, and just melted in my mouth. The only problem was that it was a bit pricey so I didn't order another one. But, I didn't mind paying the price for that goodness of an omelette."
10/18/2021,20211018,5,4.29,"My girlfriend and I's favorite restaurant in LA, food is consistently excellent and the space is HUGE. Only downside is valet parking can take quite a while on the weekends."
10/18/2021,20211018,5,4.29,Our first time for Brunch.. 6 girlfriends and we had an amazing time..it was very fast pace.. as it first come first serve.. you basically select your food/ pastries & drinks and then you are on your own to search for a table that is available. We were lucky we found a table in the patio area.. the rest of our day was great as we felt we had our private patio corner.. great for private sexy hilarious girl chats..the staff was great and accommodating..definitely recommend just go earlier.. as it is very trendy and in demand.
10/19/2021,20211019,4,4.29,"Came on a Saturday for brunch around 10:20 AM and waited 30 mins to get to the counter to order. There was a line but it moved fast because the inside of Republique is massive so lots of seating, and they have a cute little patio for covered outdoor dining as well. Food we ordered: slice of banana cream pie, croque madame, kimchi fried rice, Cuban sandwich. Banana cream pie: yum!!! Great slice of pie, love the addition of caramel between the crust and filling which made it stand out from all the other banana cream pies I've had. Croque Madame: deeeelish. The bread was perfectly toasted and crispy on the outside while soft and chewy on the inside. The ham and gruyere combined with the sourdough and fried egg was the perfect combination of a savory flavor explosion in every bite. The croque madame also comes with a yummy side of salad. Kimchi fried rice: while this was a solid kimchi fried rice, I don't think i would consider it one of the best I have had. There's nothing really that stands out about it that I would pay $21 for this dish again.Overall, food was good and I would definitely come back again to try some of the other pastries & pies - but it is on the more expensive side. Metered 2 hr street parking was surprisingly easy to find on La Brea just one block away from Republique - otherwise they also have valet parking available."
10/20/2021,20211020,5,4.29,"Don't think about it just go!I've been coming here for the last 3 months sometimes for brunch sometimes for dinner (reservations accepted) and have yet to be disappointed. The ambiance is lovely, the staff is kind and attentive. Last but not least the food is delicious! Do yourself a favor and make time to check this place out."
10/21/2021,20211021,5,4.29,"Great ambiance, i loved the interior of the whole restaurant.Came here during brunch on a weekday, didn't experience the long lines.All the pastries looked delicious and the ones we got all tasted amazing.We got the kimchi fried rice, shaksouka anf the potato pancakes. All were delicious. Will definitely come back here for a special day or just get some pastries from the bakery."
10/21/2021,20211021,5,4.29,"First Impression: Man this line is long for a Monday morning! I really appreciated how beautiful the line was up to the register was. Great decor on the shelves, nice lighting, and a beautiful display of all the pastries immediately get you excited. Ambiance: Interior is nothing short of GRAND. Tons of natural lighting, old fashion design, almost takes you to another time in history. You spend most of the time sitting, just captivated by your surroundings. Overall, just a beautiful spot for brunch and to spend time with loved ones. Food: Our party tackled the French Omellete, Burrata Salad, and the BLT eggs benedict. The presentation was excellent, and judging from taste and appearance, you notice immediately the quality of ingredients that they use. Don't get me started with the pastries lol. We had the berries croissant and the passionfruit key lime. AMAZING. Both have just the right amount of sweetness and tartiness to it. I was super impressed. Customer Service: The majority of your interaction is upfront where you order, but everyone there was friendly and hospitable. It is an interactive experience and you notice that they work with urgency and joy. Table service was great too, with staff bringing you water and bussing tables promptly. Lasting Impression: Price was reasonable, you really do pay for ambiance. Something about being in there brings you joy and elevates the food and company. The dishes were well thought out with great food artistry and usage of organic ingredients. Loved it here."
10/22/2021,20211022,3,4.29,"This review is for the dinner, not for the brunch service. The restaurant appeared to be understaffed. While the server was very friendly, he seemed overworked. The food was overpriced for the size of the portions and the quality. The sauce on the pasta (pictured) tasted of salt more than any other flavor. I couldn't notice the mushroom flavor. The scallops were ok but had a fishy smell to them. Nice atmosphere though. Maybe I'd try this place for brunch, but I won't be returning for dinner."
10/22/2021,20211022,4,4.29,"This place has such gorgeous architecture. I love the high ceilings and open space. They have delicious baguettes that are made there. I usually pick a few up with jam and butter. The jam is delicious. I will say it's a little on the pricey side, but hey, that's L.A for you.Food is delicious. 4 stars for the water that never came."
10/23/2021,20211023,5,4.29,"This is my second time coming here and both times did not disappoint. Both times were during brunch.Word of advice, get here early if you don't want to wait long in line and make sure you know what to order ahead of time.When you first get there, you wait in line to order and as your waiting you get to choose any cakes or pastries you want. Then you get to the cashier and order and they give you a number so they can bring your items to your table. Seating is first come so you just pick an empty seat and take it! Service is fast, we waiting about 10min for our drinks and food, so not bad. But the best part was the food!!! Ricotta toast is amazing! It's toast with ricotta, fruit, drizzled with honey and nuts. The fruit is fresh and flavorful, you won't be disappointed. Lobster omelette is light and flavorful filled with gruyere cheese and a light salad on the side. I've also tried the chia seed before and again they use fresh fruit on top which makes all the difference. Can't wait to come here again!!"
10/23/2021,20211023,5,4.29,"Amazing and delicious food!This place lives up to its reputation. I ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice ($21) and the Bread and French Butter & Jam ($9). The Kimchi Fried Rice is one of their popular dishes, and it was so amazing. The meat and everything about it was great and savory. The bread, butter, and jam was amazing. I know it sounds like just bread, but it was better than your typical grocery store bread. The butter and jam tasted so home-made or so sweet and great. The place has a structure where customers order first, get a number, and find a table to sit at. The line is always long, but it surprisingly goes by fast. The service of the place was good. Everyone was very friendly and great. Parking can be a bit difficult, but it's doable; you might just have to walk a few blocks.Overall, highly recommend trying this place! You will not be disappointed!"
10/24/2021,20211024,5,4.29,I could write a lot about how much I enjoyed my experience. At first I was turned off by the long line that extended outside the door and almost to the street. But the line was fast and the system that they have created within this restaurant is efficient. You have a chance to look at the menu outside with the QR code and you order at the register and given a number. You then are able to find a table and your food comes out within 15 minutes. The staff was quick professional and expedite. And the food was delicious and unique.
10/24/2021,20211024,5,4.3,"The bakery and breakfast is amazing outstanding extraordinary. Truly a show stopper in the entire LA. Their quiche is one of the best I've ever had in my life. Their pastry constantly changes on daily basis. If you need a good brunch spot to hangout and introduce your friends with, highly recommend this spot. However, their dinner is more of a meh when compared to its peer. Especially when compare to the new restaurant they own named bicyclette, Republique does not shine with its dinner service when it comes to both menu diversity and food quality."
10/24/2021,20211024,5,4.3,We went multiple times on a 3-day weekend trip because of how great it was! I loved the granola bowl and ALL the pastries but we tried half the menu and loved all of it. I bought the cookbook but unfortunately lots of errors so don't recommend that.
10/25/2021,20211025,5,4.3,Very chick. Fantastic for night out with your loved ones. I would recommend this place if your single and dating. Great place for a first date.
10/26/2021,20211026,3,4.3,"When Republique first opened they were phenomenal!! Like a new friend, on their best behavior, put their best foot forward and then...they got comfortable...went for dinner the other night and the service was OK at best...waitress looked like she wanted to go home, wasn't super friendly, not really the Republique I was used to dining at...I understand Covid has made a huge impact on the hospitality industry but that doesn't mean you can't provide good customer service...other than that the food as always was so good...pasta cooked to perfection, flavors full and balanced.."
10/27/2021,20211027,3,4.29,"3.5/5 for dinner, suspect it'd be higher for brunch as that seems to be their forte. FOOD/DRINKS: The food is tasty, no doubt. We started with the baguette, sea salt, and butter, which was hot, crunchy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. Would recommend, since the bread is bottomless (you're paying for the butter). My boyfriend got the lobster pasta (campanelle), which was solid. I got the vegetable tagine, which had wonderful fall flavors and was a creative spin on a traditional dish (there were 3 vegetarian pasta options, as well). However, where I struggled was the pricing for portion sizes. My boyfriend's pasta was on an appetizer-sized bowl and over $40, which seemed discrepant. Without the endless bread, he would have left hungry. My tagine was adequately-sized (including the couscous), though $40 for a vegetable dish containing 10 pieces of beets / potatoes / dates seems overkill. The cocktails were a normal price for LA and yummy, no complaints there. SERVICE: Spotty. All servers who helped us were very kind, but slightly disorganized. It took 20 minutes to get drinks. My dish was served incompletely (the couscous portion of my dish wasn't delivered until I was 3/4 of the way done with the vegetable stew component). They did ask about and confirm allergies, though, which was much appreciated. AMBIENCE: Outdoor seating in their converted lot with adequate spacing for COVID-times, as well as heat lamps that are moveable, which is a plus. There was also a fair amount of indoor seating. There is designated parking which is valet, but we parked for free on a nearby street. Seemed to be more of an older crowd on a weekday night. Wouldn't return for dinner just because the value isn't there, but would consider brunch where the prices are cheaper, service isn't as imperative, and the food seems to shine."
10/27/2021,20211027,3,4.29,"Baked goods were outstanding (the matcha raspberry Bundt cake and the strawberry passion fruit cream pie were delicious), but the breakfast entrees were lackluster. The potato pancakes with salmon and the Kim chi rice bowl both lacked flavor or spice, and we needed to ask for extra salt, pepper and Tabasco to make them more flavorful. Everything was beautifully cooked and presented however.Also strange were their juices, which were all served at room temp.In short, definitely go for their baked goods and pastries, but save your money and skip their entrees."
10/28/2021,20211028,5,4.29,"09/30/2021: Made dinner reservation and mask required. Celebrated my son and hubby's birthdays. Dark lit area so beware when visiting at night. Valet is available or street parking. They sat us in the patio area. Tables are nice and distanced. Heat lamps are available. Staff are friendly and food was DIVINE! The menu was confusing at first but our server explained that it's served family style and this is how journey began.HORS D'OEUVRESBlue Fin Tuna Tartare: They served 2 or 4 pcs. We opted for 2pcs. Small bite sizes. First impression was like ""really, that small thing?"" I tapped out and offered it to the birthday boys but they weren't about to let me hang like that. Hubby took a bite and shared the half with me and OMG... I did not expect that small thing to have so much flavor. I was actually satisfied with just tasting it!BAGUETTERodolphe Le Muenier Butter - Normandy France: We have had the privilege to travel to Paris many moons ago and while we were there, all we ate were bread, butter and macrons. So, we decided to try this and it was delicious but it was ok. Still not the bread and butter that we experienced in Paris but it's good. We saw a documentary about what makes a yummy baguette on YouTube and they mentioned that if you hold light against the bread and it glowed, it a good one. My son did it and past the test! Baguette glowed bright red!FIRSTKanpachi Crudo: OMG everything melted in your mouth. SECONDBrussels Sprouts Carbonara: So rich and warming. Comfort food like mac n cheese but healthier. or is it? FOURTHLiberty Farms Duck: Really? it didn't even taste like duck. I thought I was eating very tender beef. Rich with full of flavors dancing in your mouth. DESSERTwhich was recommended by the server and we shared the Strawberry Tiramisu... so I don't really care for Tiramisu cause of the rum but this version was like eating Strawberry Mousse, chiffon cake... I mean it was so different. I tasted the strawberry and also got the tartness from the dust on top of it. Highly recommend but do not share! Over all experience was more than we have expected! Servers were attentive. The spacing and timing of each food served from the last were spot on. We did not feel rushed at all and we just enjoyed each other and out of the house again. I would love to experience breakfast. Have read really good reviews. I will be back for sure! It's quite a trek from the valley but it's worth it!"
10/30/2021,20211030,4,4.29,"I FINALLY got to have brunch here after multiple attempts, so excited to make this review.Firstly, you cannot reserve a table for brunch--it's first come first serve! When you arrive, the line may look daunting but it moves pretty quickly. They say wait is 40min to an hour but we got seated within 25min. It's also market style open seating so once you order you can plop down anywhere. I do recommend getting there earlier rather than later (10:30/11a is the sweet spot) especially if you have a large group so that your wait isn't excessive and you can all sit together.Now the food, it was pretty good. I ordered the brioche French toast and every bite was a delight. Was perfectly sweet & you can definitely enjoy it without any syrup. I also ordered the French Omelette and it was just OK. They put a lot of cheese in it and it lacked flavor so wasn't the biggest fan of it. They're known for their kimchi fried rice but honestly I've had better. Their waffles were good as expected! Didn't get a chance to try their pastries but they looked phenomenal. I also loved seeing the chefs making the dough in the back with the large oven. Gave it a very authentic feel. Will definitely be back!"
10/31/2021,20211031,5,4.29,"Everything! Fresh, tasty food. Great, clean atmosphere.Friendly, speedy service.Great place to bring out of town family and friends."
11/1/2021,20211101,4,4.29,"Ate breakfast at Republic on a Saturday morning. Got there at around 9 didn't wait too long in line. Tried the breakfast, potato pancake, and French toast along with a golden juice. I cannot say anything was amazing. However, it was good overall. Took a sampling of pastries home and I must say the creme brûlée cream puff was really good!"
11/1/2021,20211101,1,4.29,Hey! You mother fuc*er!!!!! Call my friends as a kimch????? My friends were visiting this restaurant who came from Korea and i recommended this store and here it is...... one of workers call my friends as kimchi which is totally fucked up......that is so disrespectful...... i just heard this story from my friends. They were new here so she just thought it could happen often here because LA has lot of different races. But this is not acceptable you guys.... You better teach your employees better attitude and better service.
11/3/2021,20211103,5,4.29,Ive never been here; but i got a friend that never shuts up about this place so it MUST be good! Always mentions that butternut squash Agnolotti
11/4/2021,20211104,5,4.29,The service and quality of food here are truly top notch. I've dined here twice. Once inside for fun and once outside as a special occasion. The food is always fresh and perfectly prepared. The only problem is that I always eat too much!
11/5/2021,20211105,4,4.29,"Came for brunch on a Saturday. The pastries were good, but not my favorite croissants. The croissants here aren't as flakey or airy as the ones you can get in Arsicault (SF). Do recommend the choux pastries; they were v good as were the shakshouka and the mushroom toast. Note that there was a line but it moves quickly (love the efficiency). We got there at 10:40am and ordered within 15 mins. I think the place was more trendy than anything but it was a solid spot to eat at. Rounding up but I think it's more like a 3.5 than a 4 in terms of flavors/textures. Terrible photo but the pastries def look pretty!"
11/6/2021,20211106,5,4.29,"Came here for breakfast, got the Regular Breakfast and the French Toast. BOTH spectacular and worth the line wait. Highly recommended!"
11/7/2021,20211107,4,4.29,"Visited this restaurant on a saturday around 10AM. You wait in line, order pastries and/or your meal, grab your number and self seat. Luckily, the line wasn't too long when we went so we only had to wait like 5 minutes. We had a large party so had to walk around a bit to find a spot that would fit 8 people but the workers helped us. If you're with a smaller party, I don't think you'll have issues finding a seat. Though, when we left around 11:30, the line to order was quite long. There is both indoor and outdoor seating and there is a lot of seating options inside!! We ordered the two menu items as well as some pastries. We really enjoyed the pastries. I don't remember exactly what but one was coffee cake which was delicious! My friend got a cheesecake (which I tasted) and it was pretty bland (it tasted watery which was odd). The regular breakfast and croque madame we're good! Nothing too too crazy or special especially for the price but the ambience was cute and it's a good place to eat at. My partner would like to go again since he enjoyed the meal!! I liked the food too! It was cooked well. Though, some people in my party complained that their food was cold when it came out. I, personally, would try other places for a meal but may come back for the pastries!!"
11/7/2021,20211107,3,4.29,Papusa was decent but very small.Scone was very good.Mimosa tasted like it used tropicana ojPrices a bit high for level of food and cafeteria ordering.
11/8/2021,20211108,4,4.29,"Great spot for teriffic pastries with a side of people watchingLots of interesting characters young and old. Definitely a place to bump into some aspiring insta influencer wannabes if you're into that kind of thing. 'doin it for the gram'. It's nice sitting in the middle area with skylight, but not so nice when everyone's trying to get a gram in. Food was good though!"
11/9/2021,20211109,4,4.29,"My cousin was in town from the Bay Area and she was able to make reservations on a Friday night at 9:15pm. We showed up a few minutes early, checked in and had to wait about 15-20 minutes to be seated. We ordered a lot of different foods from the menu to try. I wasn't a huge fan of the kanpachi crudo because I normally don't like spicy foods. Staff was friendly, ambiance was good. We really enjoyed the food here especially the baguette with butter and the arugula casarecce. We ordered three different desserts and they were all so delicious!"
11/9/2021,20211109,5,4.29,"I decided to go during the week,the weekends are very busy. I ordered shakshouka,wood oven- baked tomatoes,farm eggs,chickpeas,yogurt,baguette and black pepper .sooooooooo delicious   You should try it.Market fruit crostata was fresh ."
11/9/2021,20211109,4,4.29,The cocktails here were out of this world. The food is good as well but was not my favorite that's why I'll give it 4 stars. I really like the vibe. It's super unique and I love what they did with the decor. I would check this place out if you are in the area!
11/10/2021,20211110,4,4.29,"The parking was just such a mess, because theres no actual lot to park in lmao. You have to street park, which is brutal in LA, unless you walked there or uber'ed. But once you get there, there may or may not be a line depending on the time. Don't ask me tho I just got there early, so smole line. But it went by fast because apparently everyone here is a regular who knows what they want. But you go down the line. Let me just tell you one thing you need to know coming here. Get the French loaf they sell by the door in a basket. I know you may be wondering like bruh a loaf of bread. I can get this at ralphs. No you cant. This is some special bread you can only get here. On the way out, too, get some of their special butter. Their bread and butter is all they need to keep them up and running tbh. Theyre just trying to be a little creative and continued with more variety. Its cute but the bread and butter, don't forget. Anyway, we got some pastry thing (link in the photo), and a breakfast plate. Idk what its called but just compare the pictures with the menu description. Its eggs (how you want them made), bacon (thick huge pork belly tbh), the potatoes are good though. Those are hands down the best potatoes ive ever had besides fries. And then we have it: The French bread. And the butter in a sauce cup. Lemme tell you im normally not a sauce boss. But this butter smacks so different id honestly let it smack me around and have ME call it daddy. I dipped it in and it was delicious. That part just blew me away. I loved it so much that's all I really wanted. Anyway, its basically like a portos where you get this number on a metal stand and you put it where you find seating and then they bring your food to you, unless you order a pastry (which they give to you right away). Pretty nice."
11/10/2021,20211110,5,4.29,I really appreciate all the attention to detail in the meals here. atmosphere is always nice. I had a chicken dish there that was really good. Will go back again. Its been weird post pandemic but this may be my go to place.
11/11/2021,20211111,2,4.29,"So sad to have to update my review about Republique! But when service is bad, it doesn't matter how good the food is. I've been coming to Republique for years and I've recommended this place to many friends and family. Sadly it has started to really lack the good customer service I was once impressed with. I had a negative experience a couple of months back and I reached out to them in regards to their employee and I had no answer from them. I thought maybe it was a one off and maybe that person just wasn't having a good day. Coming from someone who has worked in the food industry and customer service I'm usually pretty understanding and I like to say hello and thank you at all times because I know those little things go a long way... anyway today I decided to come and I was helped by Alejandra at the register. She had absolutely no personality and couldn't even greet me back. I said hello she didn't answer, while ordering I asked her to please make sure my chia pudding didn't have kiwi since one time it did and I'm allergic. She looked at me like I was dumb and said it doesn't come with it. I expressed to her that I once got it and it had it so that's why I was afraid. Once she charged me I said thank you and she pretty much just ignored me and said you're all set. I don't know what's happening here, but one thing for sure is that I don't like to be treated as if I'm bothering them while spending my money here. So sad to see such beautiful restaurants start to slack on their customer service."
11/12/2021,20211112,5,4.29,Great breakfast spot. You'll probably wait in line for an hour but you won't mind once you're eating
11/13/2021,20211113,2,4.28,"Overpriced under seasoned, Is all that comes to mind. We ordered more than I was able to capture. The goal was to order family style 1-2 dishes from each course, so I can say we got a good range of the dishes. My favorites were the cauliflower and the baguette. The short rib was not very tender, I didn't enjoy the halibut and the pasta with lobster was just not seasoned. The strawberry tiramisu was fresh with a tart after taste but I enjoyed it. Honestly, it's a beautiful place just not for me to return."
11/15/2021,20211115,5,4.29,"One of my favorite restaurants in LA! The duck here is a MUST! It's tender, juicy flavorful and the sweet potato stuffing that it comes with is amazing w the apple drizzle sauce. On drippings bread is also a crowd favorite of tastiness. The pasta here and sold is also great. Their brunch is extensive and has a lot of pastries so that's always fun! We sat at the bar and shout-out to the awesome bar staff during our dinner who was so attentive and gave us such great recs!FYI anything more than 8 is a private event and not a regular reservation so you have to then do an event contract with a minimum."
11/16/2021,20211116,5,4.29,Charlie Chaplin place! Corner to be here sometimes. Great breakfasts and dinners. Eggs. cappuccino and duck are my favorites so far :)
11/16/2021,20211116,5,4.29,"2 of us had breakfast on a monday at 9:30 am. No parking like most of LA--bummer. finally found a spot on a nearby residential street. The line was short--ordered in no time and easy to get a table, in or out--the place is huge!! service on point--water and coffee brought to the table right away. We both got Lobster omelets--excellent--""omlet"" more like a crepe-egg was delicate and cooked perfectly--lots of lobster, excellent gruyere cheese/lemon sauce and served with a big arugula salad rather than potatoes--very tasty and good value especially for LA. Just wish they had ample parking."
11/16/2021,20211116,5,4.29,"I really liked this place. The inside was gorgeous to the extent that I'd like to compliment the architect of this place. The food tasted great, too - this was back in the days when I actually thought brunch food bought in restaurants are somehow superior to that made at home, and that's because of brunch places like this. You'll see in the picture how they differentiate an eggs benedict."
11/16/2021,20211116,5,4.29,"It's a nice place for me and my friend to have lunch and take some Instagram photos .The food was really yummy,it took us an hour to drive here , but we had wonderful memories and both of us think it's worth the trip and thank God for such a good weather and good light to take photos."
11/18/2021,20211118,5,4.29,"This place gets extremely busy but worth the wait and money. The server was very friendly and gave us great suggestions on the menu. This is one of my favorite to-go places for brunch! Any dish here is good. I haven't tried its pastry section, but it looks good too! The service and food are equally excellent. You can pre-order their pastries from Tock if you don't want to wait in line. Definitely will fo back."
11/20/2021,20211120,5,4.29,"My fav bakery/brunch spot. I ALWAYS bring friends/family who are visiting from out of state here. Their pastry case is amazing. The Basque cheesecake is probably my favorite but I love their tres leech cake and flan pastry too! The vibes are on point. Also note- their pastry case is a little more limited in selection on weekdays but still really good!tip: on weekends go like 10 min before they open at 8AM to wait in line. For parking, park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant on the street for free parking. Otherwise you can try and find parking on La brea but might need to pay the meter.."

11/21/2021,20211121,2,4.29,I liked Republique but I won't return . The noise level was like a jet taking off. Who could enjoy very expensive food like that .Conversation must be yelled .I've eaten at numerous two and three star restaurants in France This simply isn't in the same class or the top places in New York . It is the best LA has to offer tho.

11/22/2021,20211122,3,4.28,"Came here on a Saturday around 11am.FOOD: My friends got the shakshouka, an oven-baked creamy tomato egg dish served with baguette. I ordered the pupusa, which I don't actually recommend because it was an odd fusion combination of Mexican and Italian. But I also brought home some of their pastries as study snacks, which looked and tasted so perfect. I wish I could tell you what I ordered but I told the guy to surprise me because their pastry section was ginormous! I docked a star because their menu didn't give great descriptions of the food and, for the price, I felt like it should taste better.PARKING: Valet is $8.50 during brunch/lunch and you can pay by card through a QR code. I believe it costs $11 after 4pm. I recommend parking in the residential area one block down (watch out for parking time limits) and making the walk over.SEATING: It was SO HARD to find seating. We didn't end up getting to sit inside where it looks pretty. There is limited outdoor patio seating, which is where we sat.SERVICE: The workers are super nice but it took so long to get anyone to give me water cups. I docked a star for this. The line was super long and it took 45min to order. You get in line to order and pay; then you are given a number and find your own seat."
11/22/2021,20211122,5,4.29,"I finally made it over after years of anticipation. Came in for brunch on my boyfriend's birthday and was pleasantly surprised. I have been to a lot of so-called great restaurants in L.A. that end up being mostly hype. The food was fantastic: fresh, flavorful, filling, and fun! You order at the counter then take a number to a table so be prepared and know everything you might want. We ordered the regular breakfast, a waffle, a few pastries, and coffee. I probably would sub out the waffle for French toast next time (a little dry), but everything else was 5/5. I can't wait to come back for dinner!"
11/22/2021,20211122,3,4.28,"Came here on a Saturday around 11am.FOOD: My friends got the shakshouka, an oven-baked creamy tomato egg dish served with baguette. I ordered the pupusa, which I don't actually recommend because it was an odd fusion combination of Mexican and Italian. But I also brought home some of their pastries as study snacks, which looked and tasted so perfect. I wish I could tell you what I ordered but I told the guy to surprise me because their pastry section was ginormous! I docked a star because their menu didn't give great descriptions of the food and, for the price, I felt like it should taste better.PARKING: Valet is $8.50 during brunch/lunch and you can pay by card through a QR code. I believe it costs $11 after 4pm. I recommend parking in the residential area one block down (watch out for parking time limits) and making the walk over.SEATING: It was SO HARD to find seating. We didn't end up getting to sit inside where it looks pretty. There is limited outdoor patio seating, which is where we sat.SERVICE: The workers are super nice but it took so long to get anyone to give me water cups. I docked a star for this.

11/23/2021,20211123,3,4.28,"I had to book a reservation an entire month in advance to get in for a 7pm dinner for 2 on a weekend. We got to the restaurant about 45 minutes early and asked if they had a bar that we could get a drink at before our reservation. However, they asked if we'd rather be seated right away, so we said sure. It was full but not as full as I expected it to be for needing a rez a full month in advance. They sat us at a cozy table in the back, which was much quieter than the front. Service: It was your typical upscale dining experience...water glass was kept full, silverware was cleared and replaced for each course, and my napkin was nicely folded when I came back from the restroom. With all that being said, our server was actually pretty terrible. I'm not sure if he didn't like us for some reason or what, but he avoided us almost the whole dinner besides taking our order and giving us the check. He asked how just one of courses was. I actually was disappointed in that particular course so I said it was okay and he just kind of awkwardly nodded and backed up. He just seemed annoyed by us. Food: We got something from every course. We got (in order) the blue fin tuna tartare, pan drippings baguette, tomato crudo (which I don't currently see on the menu), Brussels sprouts carbonara, butternut squash agnolotti and liberty farms duck. The beginning 3 courses were knock outs. I would go back for them, they were just phenomenal. The tuna was so tender and flavorful. The pan drippings were a burst of flavor with a yummy baguette (not as good as France though). And the tomato crudo was really well balanced, fresh and flavorful. They brought out the natural flavors of the produce perfectly. The butternut squash agnolotti was good too, but not as mind blowing as the first 3. Unfortunately, the brussels sprouts carbonara was not good. We didn't eat much of it. The sprouts tasted like they were from a microwaveable frozen bag. There was really large pieces of black pepper that you'd unexpectedly bite into and the egg on top just gave it all a slimy texture (I'm usually a sucker for an egg on anything). BTW, this is the course the waiter decided to come to our table and see how we're liking our course. The staff who cleared it from the table didn't ask why we had barely touched it either. The duck was just okay, it was kind of overcooked. The flavors on the plate were interesting though, however not really my taste. It was kind of sweet for a dinner entree. Overall, I think I'd come back to sit at the bar, have a drink and eat as much tuna tartare and pan drippings as I possibly could. But for the price, this dining experience wasn't up to what I'd expect. I wouldn't come back for a nice dinner, there is plenty of upscale dining experiences in LA to pick from that don't have crappy servers and have better entrees.Also, the front of the restaurant was playing music really loud and I felt like the music really didn't fit the vibe. It was really weird."

We made our reservations using our concierge at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills where we were staying. I will be calling the concierge at the Peninsula hotel to inform them of our crappy dining experience. Let me first say that the food was very good. The reason for the two stars was because the front of the house was a total disappointment making our whole experience one we will not repeat again...meaning we will not be coming back no matter how good the food is. We thought based on the online pictures of the restaurant, we would be sitting inside. Instead we were ""dropped off"" by the hostess in what seemed to be a converted parking lot for outside dining that was probably used during COVID days. It was ugly! If we were still under strict COVID rules, masks and social distance (non which were evident inside) we could be more tolerant of the experience...not so. But when I asked the hostess why we were being seated outside, her reply was very flippant...""we just decided to put you outside"". I suspect it was a business decision to keep the overflow (COVID) parking lot open to make up for the loss of revenue that the restaurant must have experienced during COVID. I get it. Some may think it is greed, I don't. I really get it. But if you are going to keep the additional tables (new found revenue) and have outside seating take the time (be thoughtful) to make it a wonderful experience just like one would get in the inside of the restaurant. If being outside in a horrible outdoor COVID ""ward"" parking lot was not enough our service with Shakira left a lot to be desired. If we spend close to $400 I expect the service to be extraordinary. Sadly it was not. Net-Net: If you decide to have dinner at Republique make sure you ask and get inside/restaurant seating.

The food will be very good but you will have a crappy overall experience seating outside. If you want to impress someone and your are seated outside you will be embarrassed.

11/25/2021,20211125,5,4.28,"Written by my 8 year old son. We went to Republique for brunch. The line was long but it moved quickly. When you get started you could order sweets, we went for the coffee cake and the blueberry muffins. While sold out this time, my mom loves the bombalinis and says they are one of the best pastries she has ever had! We ordered the breakfast sandwich, BLT Benedict, the brioche french toast. I had the breakfast sandwich. A very artisanal bun, the first bite was absolutely delicious! The egg was fried, the sausage was well sourced, and a nice sauce brought it all together. The brioche French toast is one of our favorites. Just add a little syrup and it will melt in your mouth. Everything else was also delicious and it's best to share so you can try more items on the menu. Mom says the potato pancake is a dish to remember!I recommend Repubilque because of their fine, delicious, and well sourced, food.P.S this is really good, so bring an appetite!!"

She was extremely unfriendly and Curt in her responses. She should not be working a situation where she has to deal with people.

11/26/2021,20211126,4,4.27,"Came here for my birthday dinner. Lots of my coworkers hyped Republique up but honestly I didn't think the food was great. Don't get my wrong--the food is good, but it isn't at the top of my list for best restaurants in LA.From the ""Firsts""- I started off with the kanpachi crudo. The fish was fresh and flavorful. This is a good option for a starter.From the ""Fourths""- my waiter recommended the liberty farms duck. The duck itself was just ok. It's cooked with pears, which were delightful. I just don't think I'd order this again. From the desserts- my waiter recommended the strawberry tiramisu. Now, I hate tiramisu with a passion but the waiter assured me that it wasn't your average tiramisu. He was so right! It's a delicious sort of strawberry mousse with strawberry powder on top. The strawberries themselves tasted like they were frozen out of a bag (lol) but I was still satisfied.Would I return to Republique? Tbh, probably not. Maybe I need to check out their brunch."
11/27/2021,20211127,4,4.27,"The line is long on a Sunday, for brunch, but it's worth the wait. Unfortunately, they don't take brunch reservations. The food is yummy and the vibe is really cool. You can also order tasty treats for pick up!"
11/28/2021,20211128,4,4.27,"The place has been updated, expanded from the visit three years ago, still lovely, the light clay bricks and red ceilings, walls, and dark wood beams exuding warm coziness and exotic airs.Glad smoothly gliding into valet parking immediately south, the line at 8:30am was not daunting enough. This breakfast visit is arranged before the Van Gogh Exhibits nearby, therefore one hour morning drive from Orange County is worth while."
12/1/2021,20211201,5,4.27,"AMAZING. The restaurant does fully live up to its hype. And I usually hate over-hyped up place. But this is a place I would love to come back over and over. This was my second time at Republique for dinner and I love that they always have new menu to try. The flavors are surprising, familiar, refreshing, and creative all at the same time. The only thing is their food runs on the more salty side - but can't blame them, salt does make everything taste better. First time I went, everything was mind blowing except for the short rib. I mean, short rib was amazing too but by the time we got to the meat, it was too heavy and we barely finished it. So the second time I went with my boyfriend, we actually didn't get any meat dishes (fourth dishes) and shared everything else and 'twas a magical decision! Next time I would love to come back for brunch!"
12/2/2021,20211202,5,4.27,Came to Republique on a Friday morning and waited in line for about 10 minutes before placing my order.All the pastries are on display as you make your way to the register. You'll order pastries first and then place your order. I tried a few things and everything was so tasty and memorable. The mushroom toast was phenomenal and the highlight for me.There are a plenty of seats indoor including communal tables so you won't have issues finding a spot here.Highly recommend Republique.
12/3/2021,20211203,2,4.27,"First time here, when you enter it's like a cafe, inside is cool but you feel like you're rushed to order. They ask for your vaccination card and identification to enter. There is menus in the beginning you have to grab, when you go down the line, they ask if you want pastries and automatically have you order your food. I felt like I didn't even have time to look at the menu. It's loud so you can't even hear the employees behind the counter speak to you. Ordered the green juice which was pretty gross (don't recommend). The brioche French toast was delicious. It's self seating and you take your number to the table of your choice. It's not a serving restaurant, they just drop off the food and pick up your dirty plates."
12/3/2021,20211203,5,4.27,"My gentle Jesus, is this not the bakery from heaven! The French toast was the size of a car door, the pupusa was the size of a hub cap! This place is fantastic but get there early because they sell out and there is always a line!"
12/3/2021,20211203,1,4.27,"My wife came home from here with amazing empanadas. That's where it ends because my wife said the service was rushed, the staff was rude and she was embarrassed by a hostess when waiting in line. I don't care to rehash what happened. Good food just rude L.A people."
12/4/2021,20211204,4,4.27,"Holy desserts! They have way more options for desserts than what is listed on their menu. Highly recommend going here for breakfast or brunch, especially if you have a sweet tooth!Hands down, favorite dessert that we had was their Black Sesame Pastry. Sooooo delicious with floral accents and cream. Totally delicious. Another favorite was the Coconut Lime and Passion Fruit Tart--very sweet and tropical and paired well with some tea.They usually have a line so a little bit of a wait sometimes, but you pay and seat yourself. We got there around 9 and it wasn't too crowded yet. Around 10 definitely picks up!"
12/4/2021,20211204,4,4.27,"This is for the cafe. SWe went for brunch on a weekday (around 11am). Super long line but it moves fairly quickly. This is a order at the counter situation then they bring the food out to you. We got a couple delicious pastries and a slice of banana cream pie to go. They even held the pie on their fridge until we finished our meal so it would stay good. We ordered coffees, a croque madam and I believe some type of steak and fries. The croque madam was good. Not too salty and nice and hot. The steak was cooked perfectly and was tasty but the fries lacked flavor. Also ordered a mimosa and that tasted good too! Glad we tried it and would come back if the line isn't too crazy!"
12/5/2021,20211205,4,4.27,"1. The Line My partner and I came Monday morning of thanksgiving week 2021 - the line had maybe around 20-30 people but moved fast as you order at the counter and find your own place to sit. (Not sure if it is a Covid specific event) but the line speed limiting factor was people's ordering time and not lack of seats. 2. Ambiance Honestly could be amazing or average depending on where you are able to grab seats and what type of ambiance you like. Personally I enjoy being by windows, but there weren't many windows to sit by and all seats happened to be taken. There were many booths in the back - but we decided on a counter seat. 3. Food Pastries were ok, maybe a 3 for me. Didn't seem like they were naked day of. French toast was delicious. Most French toasts I've had used standard bread to baste with egg and stuff - this French toast felt like the bread was made to be French toasted and was extremely fluffy. The mushroom toast was also very nice. But if I were to come again I would get the French toast and explore some of the simple things on the menu like the standard breakfast - I think the fundamentals are well executed here."
12/5/2021,20211205,3,4.26,"Food ok, pastries were amazing, and ambiance was good. What I would expect from LA restaurants. But the service- No. We were a party of 7. A few of us left our table to order the pastries but to only find the food left on the table was already cleaned up when we returned. The waiter didn't even bother to ask our friends to see if what's left on the table is for to go or not, even though a to go box was asked and was sitting on the table. The waiter literally swiped it and took it away because yes they are so busy and was consistently busy for the 2+ hours we dined in. The bowl that was taken away was the Chia Seed pudding which had more than 1/2 left. When we asked for the manager, she was going to replace it but with a small bowl. There were other things that were taken away too. So the point is, the customer service was enough for me to give it a low star rating. I think for the cost of the food, the quality and the flavor was ok. I live in the OC, and it took me about an hour to go to this place and I would not come back. All in all, take your money to the plentiful of yummy and hip restaurants in LA where the service may be much better and less crowded."
12/5/2021,20211205,4,4.26,As soon as we came into the restaurant the hostess was extremely rude. She took us to the table and before I could even sit down shoved the menu in my face. Honestly I don't get it. This was last night for a 9:30pm reservation. Other than the hostess the experience was overall pleasant. The food was delicious. The only thing I didn't like were the potato and leek appetizer.
12/5/2021,20211205,1,4.26,No clue what all the fuss is about. Average food. Uncomfortable seating. Tables are too small for the plates. Amateur wait staff. Pass on this one. You're not missing anything.
12/5/2021,20211205,4,4.26,"Came for brunch around 10:30am on a Friday morning. The line moved quickly (10 minutes - 5 parties ahead of us) and we were able to find a table quickly. There are plenty of seats both indoors and outdoors. We got an assortment of sweet pastries and savory dishes. Everything tasted great, but the croque madame was soggy."
12/5/2021,20211205,5,4.26,My friend was amazing the place so Beautiful.The pastries were very fresh and tasty.You want to try them all when you one the line . It didn't disappoint us. Everything we had were good.I look forward to go back again.
12/6/2021,20211206,3,4.26,"Been here a couple times. I think the pastry/desserts are quite good. The cream pie was excellent! But the brunch items we got were pretty... underwhelming. Brioche french toast was good but nothing exceptional. My friend's cuban sandwich was similarly okay and the salad had a very acidic vinaigrette. The burger and fries were pretty mediocre. The lobster omelette was okay, nothing special other than the lobster. The baguette was very good though!"
12/6/2021,20211206,3,4.26,"The food at Republique is delicious -- no complaint there. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars. My complaint is with where we were seated. The restaurant was very busy, so instead of being seated inside in their very lovely dining room, we were seated outside in what is surely the ugliest outside area I've ever seen. No flowers, no plants, just cheap tables and the most uncomfortable wooden chairs (no cushions) I've ever sat on. An alley has about the same ambiance. Given that Republique charges a pretty penny for its food, you would think it would spend a few extra dollars and spruce the place up a bit. If it means having to sit in this outside area again, I would never come back."
12/6/2021,20211206,5,4.26,The food is delicious and with great portions too! It was a long line but the wait didn't feel as long. Plentiful options for seating whether indoors or outdoors.
12/7/2021,20211207,5,4.26,"The ambiance and service are wonderful. I go here for dates, gatherings, every chance I can get. It's one of the best places in LA... chill yet refined."
12/9/2021,20211209,5,4.26,"I don't even know where to begin! I'm leaving this Thursday night after eating the most exquisite prefix meal that I wish was still ongoing! The liquified salsa verde with what I'll call a caviar cookie was the start to an EPIC EXPERIENCE!! A pappardelle pasta was OFF THE CHARTS!! A main Lobster with uni?!?! OH YES PLEASE!!! RIDICULOUS!!! The cocktails, wine pairing, flavors of food and total ambiance is just magic. I had to comment because there are so many places we've eaten that have accolades and stars but Republique..... if you care about food at all you cannot put this off any longer!! It will transport you! It deserves severe recognition!!! Bravo Walter and team!!!"
12/9/2021,20211209,4,4.26,"Republique's food is *chefs kiss*. Innovative, delicious, each dish we ordered was fantastic. We also ordered a special shot from the bartender who made one with passion fruit, coconut, and basil. Could not have imagined a better drink and dining experience overall. One star off because this place is pricey but I will be back to try their brunch!"
12/9/2021,20211209,5,4.26,"The quality of the food and was cooked to perfection. Everything was good with the exception of the kimchi fried rice. I think being Asian, I had a higher expectation for it and it was mediocre, lacking taste. Everything else was perfect, from the eggs to fresh baked bread, even the black coffee. Can't wait to return."
12/9/2021,20211209,5,4.26,"(Read the reviews and wondered which alternate universe did Republique get a three star review on Yelp?) I mean I know everyone's experience is different. And everyone's taste. But honestly, the food here is really good. Granted, I've only had dinner and brunch, and been in the pastry line, but that counts for something? Yes, it's pricey. This is Republique. Not any restaurant can occupy this space. That said, the food here is as you would expect for the price, it's really good. Now, let's talk about the pastries. Let's talk about 8:00 AM pastry line (notice I said ""line""). Now this review is not for the regulars. You know who you are, when I say ""8:00 AM"". This is for the new people who think they might have a go at the pastry selection at like 10:00-11:00 AM, kind of still early for a weekend? No, you are out of luck. They make the stuff once a day and when it's gone, it's gone. They don't make more until the next day. That person who bought the last croissant with the whipped cream and fresh berries ahead of you in line? He's the last person of the day to get to taste it's perfection. Now, now, hear me out though, it's not the end, because you could be the last person in line and there's like a lonely mysterious pastry left in the case with a couple of crumbs around it, and you sigh ""why not"" because it took you forever to find parking, and so you get it anyway. You don't know what you're eating but you take a bite and wow, it's perfection."
12/9/2021,20211209,5,4.26,"Great service and the food it fresh , the pastries are one of a kind, I live up the block I'm from New York and a neighborhood bakery is a must anywhere I live ."
12/10/2021,20211210,2,4.26,"Holy over-hyped and over-rated. This ridiculously expensive breakfast was so entirely mediocre it actually made us mad. We'll start with the pastries. The kouign amann was just kind of boring. It tasted like a plain croissant with some berries on it. The matcha Bundt cake was full-on gross. It tasted like fish. I know that some matchas have a fishy flavor, but why choose that kind for a pastry? I don't know. I ate one bite and was done. The best of the bunch was the passion fruit brioche. The merengue on top was delicious, the brioche itself was quite good. The only unfortunate part is that it's filled with passion fruit custard, which was an unwelcome surprise. On to the food. I had the shakshouka and it was fine. Not amazing, but fine. $18. And finally the latte. The only thing impressive about it was the price--way too much for a tiny, mediocre latte. Was it the worst breakfast I've ever had? No. Not at all. But at these price points, and given the long line outside, we really expected greatness and we were really let down. The only thing I really appreciated was the service--everyone was friendly--and they were really serious about checking vaccine cards."
12/11/2021,20211211,5,4.26,I came every Sunday straight lmao. The food is so good and a really good price for brunch. Valet only. The wait looks long but the line moves pretty quickly. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Great pastries and great food. The drinks are good too. Would recommend!
12/12/2021,20211212,1,4.26,"1 star for the service which was superb. Very friendly and patient and they check vaccine cards. Very impressed. Minus 2 stars for the disappointing food. I had the French omelet. Cooked perfectly but seriously lacking flavor. The pastries look amazing but the few we tried were all disappointing. Minus another star for the exorbitant prices. $18 for an omelet with a side salad. Minus the last star because they have a spacious outdoor patio--perfect for the Covid conscious among us--without ANY working heaters. We asked for one near us to be turned on and were told the heaters were out of propane. We heard him tell another table the same thing--and further that ALL the heaters were out of propane. REALLY? You're going to charge $18 for an omelet but you're not going to be on top of your heaters on a cloudy, 57 degree day in LA where any temp below 65 feels arctic to an Angeleno?"
12/12/2021,20211212,4,4.26,"Good brunch venue. Parking in the area is a little difficult so we gave our car to the valet. It was $10, FYI. This place doesn't do reservations I believe but the wait was maybe 15-20min to order at the counter. Once we'd ordered, we were able to find a table to sit without issue. The pastry and breads selection is good. The avocado toast was really good, but the ricotta toast was a little too sweet so I'd pass on that next time. Service was friendly but they are busy. Overall, would recommend."
12/12/2021,20211212,5,4.26,"I have been dying to try this place and finally got around to it. I have their cookbooks so I thought it was finally time to try them out for brunch. The building is beautiful and it's a very open seating with the high ceilings. When you first walk in you'll see the baked goods and I wanted to buy one of everything! The strawberry passion fruit pie was one of the best pie's I have ever had. Everything from the chia pudding, bread, and kimchi fried rice was honestly amazing. The workers were very nice and very attentive to tables and cleaning. I can't wait to come back here and eventually try their dinner options too! 10/10."
12/13/2021,20211213,5,4.26,"Fantastic experience at Republique for a Friday night dinner. They continue to prove they are consistently one of the best restaurants in LA. The hostess checked our proof of vaccination and cross referenced it with our IDs. I appreciate their commitment to keeping their employees and guests safe. We had reservations for their outdoor patio but since it is now officially cold at night in LA, we elected to take the empty seats at the bar. I prefer this because the ambiance inside is singular in that it feels old world European, a long dining room with cathedral ceilings, exposed weathered brick, and gorgeous tile. We sat at the bar and our gastronomical adventure commenced. We ordered a bottle of Cru Beaujolais, their wine list is extensive (a mere 100 pages!)We were treated to an amuse bouche of potato leek soup. Warm, comforting and a great ""small bite"" to start the meal. We ordered the Baguette with Normandy Butter, fresh crusty warm bread with salty, creamy butter. Perfection. The garden baby lettuce with green goddess salad was great, exactly what you'd want from a simple yet flavorful salad to accompany a bold meal. We followed this up with the Charcoal Grilled Cauliflower. This dish was revelatory. roasted cauliflower placed on top of creamy, tangy labneh, with bursts of pomegranate and crunch from the almonds. We loved it! We moved on to two pasta dishes. The Lobster Campanelle and the Arugula Casarecce with Black trumpet and Chanterelles. I love lobster and I love mushrooms, so both these pastas were standouts for me. My hubby said the Campanelle was the best lobster pasta he has ever had...We finished with the Short Ribs, which were melt in your mouth decadent deliciousness. We left absolutely no room for dessert. We departed feeling very full, happy, and grateful that this restaurant exists."
12/14/2021,20211214,5,4.26,The line is always so fast. They keep that well-oiled machine running.My biggest gripe is probably how you have to fight the other customers for a seat. I haven't had too much of a problem though as there's plenty of seating. It's so beautiful inside you forget about that two person party hogging a four person table lolFOOD - pastries are a must have. My favorite was the mochi cookie. Short rib sandwich was a bit heavy on the horseradish but great for someone who likes horseradish. Breakfast sandwich is a great option. The smoothies/juices were honestly smaller than I thought and imo not the most worth it thing on the menu.PARKING - you should be able to find metered parking nearby if you're willing to walk just a little.
12/14/2021,20211214,5,4.26,This is a solid brunch spot. I came here with a group of friends on Sunday at brunch hours. We had a party of 8 but surprisingly we were able to find a table and the line moved quickly to order. I got the BLT benedict I recommend it. I also tried the mushroom toast which was also tasty! This brunch place is also close to melrose where you can checkout vintage thriftstores!
12/14/2021,20211214,1,4.26,Slow & unfriendly service when we finally received our food it was COLD To Warm we never were offered a refill of coffee or asked if we would like another cappaccino & juice. Shame its a nice building that the service is HORRIBLE! Was raining and not to busy so we didnt understand the service or LACK OF.
12/15/2021,20211215,5,4.26,"Is this the best brunch in LA?? Went to @republiquecafebakery for the first time ever and I'm already counting down the days until I go back We got a huge spread so get ready for this goodness!! Okay to start we got two pastries from their GORGEOUS selection, the Ube Brioche and the Raspberry Passion Fruit Brioche This was one of the best pastries I've ever had in my life!! Everything in the glass cases looked so delicious, the pastries are worth the trip alone!! Both brioches we're fluffy and so flavorful, basically melted in my mouth I got a cappuccino which was ok and my cousin got a Latte which she really enjoyed.Ok for the mains I got the Mushroom Toast, @tara_ourfalian got the Shakshouka, and we got their classic Brioche French toast to share I can't praise the mushroom toast ENOUGH!! So much was packed on it like eggs, prosciutto, mushrooms, spinach, delicious sauces and the most perfect bread I am going back and getting that again if it's the last thing I do!! The French toast was soooo soft, their breads are baked in house so everything was so fresh My cousin said the Shakshouka was good but she would get something else next time!! All in all, this place was SOOOOOOOO fire like if you are in the area, you have to check it out!! Amazing food, amazing architecture 15/10!!Mushroom Toast- $19Raspberry Passion Fruit Brioche- $5Ube Brioche- $5Brioche French Toast- $17Shakshouka- $18Cappuchino- 5Latte- $5.50"
12/15/2021,20211215,1,4.25,Nice place beautiful building & thats about all. Service was extremely slow & how do you even get a seat? We stood there wondering if anyone was going to help us. When we finally were sat it took 15min tonight at 7pm to even get a server to our table at that point one of us just got up & got drinks at the bar & brought them back to our table. A neighborhood restaurant its a shame they dont know how to treat their Neighbors. Maybe management should train their staff on service!
12/15/2021,20211215,2,4.25,"First time, last time. I expected more got considerably less. We ordered short ribs, some kind of ravioli, and duck. Pictures in Yelp showed a leg and three pieces of breast. Our duck was three bite sized pieces, which comes to be about $15 per piece. Not much else but salt. Dessert was some kind of thick crepe, pancake over berries. Some call this place French, I call this place a rip. Probably much better choices out there"
12/16/2021,20211216,4,4.25,"Nice brunch place! Kinda crowded & loud so it's better for chatting with friends than enjoying alone time. I got the kimchi fried rice, basque cheesecake and another pastry. I don't exactly remember the kimchi fried rice. I only remembered that it was good but not exactly worth the price. The basque cheesecake and the pastry was really good though! They may be a bit too sweet for people growing up not eating lots of sweet food, but the perfection of their texture compensate for the sweetness. I like how creative their brunch menu is and would def take my friends who like brunch to try this place out."
12/16/2021,20211216,5,4.25,One of my favorite places. Cool building and the food is amazing. Very authentic French breakfast.
12/18/2021,20211218,5,4.25,"Their corn chowder is so good as a starter, I've asked for seconds many times. I love this place. Great place for any epicurean."
12/19/2021,20211219,4,4.25,"Beautiful brunch spot, possibly my favorite in LA! The line was long but don't let it intimidate you because it moves fast. Republique is legit - it's not just your average 'instagrammable' location. Just looking at the pastry menu you can tell they are legit. Their baguette is delicioussss! The waffles were nothing special - instead, I'd suggest trying some of their egg dishes as they were all delicious!"
12/19/2021,20211219,5,4.25,I can't say enough great things about dinner last night. The food is on a whole other level (along with the service) and worth every penny. One of the best meals I've had out in a very long time. I spent 2 and a half hours there with my fiancé and didn't even realize. Perfection.
12/20/2021,20211220,3,4.25,"We'd come here a few years back and my wife has been dreaming about it ever since. We finally made it back out post pandemic and while she loved it, for me it wasn't worth the expensive price point. The service was slow (like everyone else they seem to be short staffed, so not our waitresses fault), but you'd expect that with what we paid they could afford to offer more to their servers than the average restaurant. The food was also underwhelming. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either."
12/20/2021,20211220,4,4.25,First time! Food is an experience! So much yummy cheese. Make reservations for inside to get the full experience. Parking is valet only.
12/21/2021,20211221,4,4.25,"My wife and I were stoked to finally check out Republique and we enjoyed a very solid dinner with our doggo.'Eggs on Toast' - briny, warming, yummyBaguette with butter - hot and crusty, admittedly a little tough to chewKanpachi Crudo - unique flavor profile from the green Thai curry, persimmon, and coconutButternut Squash Agnolotti - delightfully creamy with a soft sweetness from the butternut squashLiberty Farms Duck - excellent sear and medium rareWild California Black Cod - fatty and flaky with much harmony between all the accompanimentsThe crudo and agnolotti were the standouts. We agreed that the level of execution was quite high across the board, it was just that the steep prices and meager portions were hard to swallow when we've had comparable or even higher caliber dishes for considerably less money. The spotty service didn't help the experience either.While we may not return for dinner, brunch is still very much on the radar."
12/21/2021,20211221,4,4.25,"A group of us came to celebrate a dear friends birthday. The food was delicious. Bread, uni, truffle risotto, even the chicken was to die for!There are some very great flavors and combinations on the menu. My only complaint was I felt it a bit ""too casual."" $1200 for a party of four is an expensive dinner (wine was maybe only 1/4 of the bill) and it's a fun vibe I suppose I'm just used to a bit more of an elevated decor when spending serious money on a meal. Music selection was unique. Kudos to the service who all did a fine job from the bussers to the sommelier. They are all clearly pros and I commend it during COVID where service has generally gone to the dogs."
12/23/2021,20211223,4,4.25,"Recommend this spot if you are looking for a brunch spot in LA. I ordered the brioche French toast. Really nice and butter but wish it was a little more rich in flavor. I paired it with a nice hot cup of latte! Additionally ordered a mimosa in which includes freshly squeezed orange juice, it's a must! My favorite item from the menu was the Kimchi fried rice! It will not disappoint! Service was great! We were in line and waited for a maximum of 20 minutes. The waiters were really nice and got out food out fast."
12/23/2021,20211223,3,4.25,"It's not bad but it's expensive and very snooty/snobby. They don't answer the phone (recording) and you have to wait in line a long time to get a table. So if you have enough money to afford this restaurant (which tastes fine, just not amazing), and you're driving by and there's no line, I ACTUALLY DO RECOMMEND trying it at least once. But if there's a long line, treat it like Pink's hot dogs and come back when they're not as busy."
12/24/2021,20211224,4,4.25,"Ode to Republique:I saw those pix, and I was mesmerized. You got me curious; you got me searching; you got my attention. I'm infatuated! How can I not? You look so succulent, scrumptious, and totally divine! I tried to forget you; I tried to brush you off; I tried to tuck you away, but I can't seem to get you off my mind. I must taste you; I must savor you; I must have you!But you are so far away; you're out of my way; beyond my horizon. I asked myself, are you worth it? Are you deserving of my time? Are you worth the drive? I shall give you up. Surely, there are better ones nearby.Then you popped up again! You are still as alluring like the first time I saw you. You're still attractive, appealing, and delightful to my eyes! I definitely want you! This time, I need you; I breathe you; I can't go through this all again! I have to succumb to these feelings of yearning!I've decided, I must have you! My longing can no longer be restrained. I am prepared to have all your sweet nothings and primary fare. I want to taste all of you!So, here we are, we finally met. Just as expected, so many want you! People line up to have you. I must endure, I must persevere. Finally, I get to face you. I can see everything about you! Your sweetlings are as colorful, attractive, and absolutely heavenly just like I imagined. Your primary fare are marvelous just as portrayed. Finally, I am gratified.Notwithstanding, I am left hanging. I can't seem to wrap my head around it. I don't get you. You're a mystery. We are not fully connected, you and I; there's something missing. The infatuation I envisioned, the intense feeling I yearned...alas, the absence of passion. Perhaps, I still have a lot to explore about you. So, let's end here, and 'til we meet again, maybe at dinner."
12/25/2021,20211225,5,4.25,"Nice food, nice inside interior! Good light for taking picture if you will come at lunch time. The sun is perfect at this time!"
12/26/2021,20211226,5,4.25,"Great fancy experience. Was greeted upon check-in and they follow Covid Protocol. Absolutely delicious food and fantastic service. République does not disappoint and lives up to its hype.Great pastries, coffee, and breakfast. Always busy and for good reason! This is a place to visit, when looking for something trendy and young.I would definitely recommend and go back again!!!"
12/26/2021,20211226,5,4.25,I enjoy the food and the lovely atmosphere. It's very zhen very nice to have dinner their servers are good. Dishes r small but good.
12/27/2021,20211227,1,4.25,"I'm now looking at the pictures that people posted on their duck entrees. My serving was three small slices of duck breast, many of the pictures show the three slices plus a duck leg. What the hell happened? I was expecting a serving that looked like the pictures and got a serving that was quite puny and underwhelming and I stand by the $15 per lousy slice. You guys should be totally ashamed. I lowered my rating down to one star."
12/28/2021,20211228,5,4.25,"We had expected a very long wait time for Republique, but to our surprise we were able to be seated right away. You line up to order at the counter, both the pastries and the meal, then take a number plaque and find a seat inside the restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is very beautiful and has lots of natural light inside. We ordered the strawberry passion fruit cream pie from the pastry stand and it was absolutely delicious!!!! All the other desserts also looked so good, it was so hard to pick. I heard that they are famous for their basque cheesecake so will definitely come back for it. For brunch, we ordered the kimchi fried rice and shakshouka, both of which were really tasty and yummy! Definitely deserves the title as best brunch in LA :)"
12/28/2021,20211228,2,4.25,"Food is good, not great. Service is terrible. My breakfast burrito was fantastic. The pastries we got were also great. Views in this place are amazing, but we actually didn't get to sit in the main area so it was underwhelming. They should definitely take reservations for breakfast. My GF thought her meal was average, didn't finish it. The ordering organization of this place is terrible. You're essentially rushed in and they act like you'd know what's going on. You're supposed to order the pastries first, then head over to the checkout to order your food separately. We're literally standing in line with 50 people behind us looking at a menu for the first time. Not the most calming environment. The worst part of the experience was the cashier being incredibly condescending and rude. I ordered a burrito and she said ""it comes wet is that ok?"" When I asked what a wet burrito is (not a hard question) she goes ""You don't know what a wet burrito is?"" she was awful and I should have wrote ""lol"" when she asked for a tip. If it wasn't for my GF wanting to visit this place I would have left right there. I don't need A+ service to have a great time at a restaurant. But when you're a brunch place charging $70+ for 2 people you need to have staff that doesn't piss people off before they even sit down."

Love the cafeteria-esque setting in the beginning where you can pick out desserts or pastries.Shakshouka is 11/10 every bite was delicious, the bit of egg yolk, tomato sauce and basil.

Rating for cafe/lunch only, I've had a few really solid experiences here. Lunch/Breakfast: Short Rib Banh Mi - I would normally scoff at paying nearly $20 for a banh mi sandwich (my Viet ancestors are surely groaning), but that rib tenderness, paired with aoli and housemade hoisin, that crispy bread that's not too hard like the way banh mi usually is, the light spring salad - I found myself surprised and delighted. Cuban Sandwich - perfect blend of garlic and mustard, not too heavy as I would expect from a Cuban. Yummy!Shakshouka - beautiful melt of flavors, spices, and herbs, that lovely bread dipped in perfectly soft, runny eggs, fresh mint - warm and comforting but again, not heavy. Dry Aged Beef Burger w/ Fries - okay, this is the dish that brought us here to begin with - we'd heard all the raves about it however we found it to be our least favorite thing. In fact, we were shocked at how ""basic"" this $20 burger is. It was very plain, not a whole lot of flavor to it at all, and it was weirdly underdone. We chocked it up to having it on a bad day but we know LOTS and lots of people come for the burger - we just didn't have an outstanding burger experience.Dessert & Drinks: Lots of gorgeous bakes to choose from but their tres leches cake with fresh berries is the best damn cake I've ever had. Okinawa Latte - earthy, warm, yumVietnamese Iced Coffee - not as sweet or strong as a traditional one, but still okayThai Tea Latte - very mild, light on flavorOverall, this place has good energy, their pastries/breads are wonderful, presentation is beautiful, ambiance is casual yet European classy, a solid, reliable choice for brunch/lunch. I've yet to try their dinner but look forward to experiencing their tasting menu.Other things to note for first-timers - it is cafeteria-style, so you order your food at the front, then find an open table and the servers will deliver your food to you.  Parking - valet is available right next to the building, but you can find street parking right out front or one block behind the building in the residential area."

12/31/2021,20211231,4,4.25,"Just had to see for myself what all the hype was about. We were only able to snag a reservation for an early dinner, but I think it might be better value for your money during brunch/lunch. Loved the bread to start! Given that there's also a bakery attached, I had high expectations, and they definitely lived up to those expectations. We got a whole loaf of fresh, warm bread for the table along with butter and pan drippings. The latter was an add-on that was so sinfully delicious. Next, we had the Kanpachi Crudo, which was very refreshing. Never would've thought to mix curry in a crudo dish, but it worked! Seemed a little pricey for the quantity, so don't know if I'd order it again. We heard good things about the Liberty Farms Duck, which was probably the other highlight of the meal. We also ordered the brussels sprouts carbonara -- creamy and rich, as it should be. However, seemed like the cracked pepper wasn't thoroughly mixed in though. Great to try at least once for the ambiance, but I'd probably try to go for brunch since the bread was the highlight!"
1/1/2022,20220101,2,4.24,"I went in for the first time with a friend a while ago (note that my friend is vegetarian) and once we were seated, our server told us that everything is meant to be shared but since my friend and I were looking to order different things we ignored his comment. Later our individual entrees came out (mind you, mine had lobster) and as we were eating the server came up and told us we're supposed to be sharing. I told him we had different dietary restrictions so we weren't planning on sharing. We thought that was the end of this whole sharing thing until my friend overhears our server telling the busser how weird it is we aren't sharing and basically judging us behind our backs for not sharing. My visit was not too recent and I've debated writing a review but I looked at others and saw this wasn't an isolated occurrence. I just find it weird how much pressure there was to share when it's not stated anywhere on their menu (at least when I went) or online. The food was good but honestly the experience sucked especially for how much everything was."

1/2/2022,20220102,5,4.25,"I really like the brunch experience at Republique! I've been here for dinner before but during the day, the natural sunlight makes the place look so pretty, AND they have a bomb pastry case that greets you as you walk in. Their baguettes with butter are to die for. One tip is make sure you know what you want to order before you get inside! There's a line that moves somewhat fast and it's a pay-then-sit type of deal."
1/2/2022,20220102,5,4.25,"10/10. The sesame cream puff ( special) I had was to die for . Shape looks like a donut / bagel , but texture is like a fresh sesame cracker !Even the salad on the side is so crunchy , salad dressing thinly coated on each leaf , with tingly sauce .10/10 lobster omelette, I never had lobster so moist , like it melts in your mouth ,not overcook at all ."
1/2/2022,20220102,5,4.25,The food and ambiance was GREAT! I highly recommend this to anyone visiting LA!! They have the best brunch in town! Please try the brioche French toast! It literally melts in your mouth! Best French toast I've ever had in my life!!!

1/3/2022,20220103,5,4.25,"YUM. YUM. YUM.What can I say that hasn't already been said? Republique has been on my list for as long as I can remember, but I usually refuse to line up in the long lines that occur over the weekends. The holidays seemed like the perfect time to finally stop by mid week. We arrived around 11:30 on a VERY rainy Thursday and there was a smaller line, around 15-20 people ahead of us. It moved really quickly, so that was great. The pastry cupboard had been cleared out of a lot of things, I definitely want to come back earlier another time and score one of their brûlée donuts.My dining partner went with the lobster omelette, I ordered the Mushroom Toast, then we ordered the brioche French toast to share and then a couple of delicious Elderflower Spritz's.The cocktails came out quickly, then shortly after the Omelette and then mushroom toast. We both descended into silence upon first bite. I was worried about the mix of flavors for the mushroom toast and maybe that it would go soggy, but the toast was crisp and the entire dish paired perfectly. A few minutes later the French toast arrived and holy cow!! The crisp crust, the perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth center, I've been dreaming about it since. I'll be back (likely on a weekday haha) and am so glad that Republique lived up to the hype."
1/3/2022,20220103,4,4.25,"Honestly, I was dragged to Republique on a Sunday morning and truly was shocked at the line my friend expected me to wait in. However, I was so happy at both the service and the food that it was definitely worth the sweat-drenched state I was in. Due to COVID, there were strict limits to patrons entering the restaurant, but it was still first come first serve. They had a QR code outside, so you can browse the menu before going in; however, you have to wait until you get inside to know what's in the bakery. You order when you enter the restaurant after purchasing your pastries, so KNOW what you want. At the bakery, I think I got overwhelmed very quickly. There are people next to you shouting off their orders while you stare at about 30 different types of desserts in front of you. We got the Bombolinis and the Kouigon Amann which seemed like more of their popular options. I think you can't go wrong with any of the flavors they have. My best advice is to just order whatever has a few left over because you know other people have liked it. Onto the food, we got the Shakshuka, Belgian Waffle, and Brioche French Toast. I think the Shakshuka is great and a must, but honestly you could get either of the sweeter options and you would be fine. Above all, I just loved the look of the restaurant. We sat at the tables in the middle opposite the kitchen. The large open window plus hearty looking tree was just so serene to look at while I woofed down all the food around me. Great for a brunch date!"

1/4/2022,20220104,5,4.25,"Updating my review to talk about their pastries! Picked up pastries for breakfast and a coffee and they were delicious! I had my croissant heated up  Which was super yummy and crunchy. Prices for all their pastries are around $4 and up so pretty pricey, but I would say it's worth it! They have so many unique options to choose from!"
1/5/2022,20220105,5,4.25,"Updating my review to reflect my love for this place. I've fallen in love with Republique's pastries (again) and couldn't help but write another review to praise the ube brioche. If only the lines for this amazing establishment weren't so long, I'd be a more regular visitor (but I suppose that's the cost of fame) - can't wait to be back when the opportunity allows"
1/6/2022,20220106,5,4.25,Great food and ambiance! The fresh baked daily pastries are DELICIOUS! Tip...place your order online first thing in the morning to ensure you get what you want.
1/7/2022,20220107,4,4.25,"The line is LONG so go early. However it moved relatively quickly. The food was a bit pricy for what you get but EVERYTHING is delicious. It's hard to find a seat and there were delays in clearing tables, but all understandable during high traffic times. I had the salmon toast and a matcha tea latte and it was delicious. Next time I want to try the bakery for sure, I heard and saw nothing but good things while I was there."
1/9/2022,20220109,1,4.25,"This place is totally overrated... The menu sucks and the servers have an undesirable air about them as if you're doing them a favor by being in their presence. Too fufula for my humble taste, will not go back!"
1/10/2022,20220110,5,4.25,"Definitely recommend this place. Such a beautiful space, that's designed so well. You order at the counter, no table waiters which makes for quicker and more efficient service. The quiche and pastries were delicious. Such a great menu and selection, you can tell the quality of food is really important here, especially when you sit in front of the bakery and kitchen to see what their preparing."
1/11/2022,20220111,5,4.25,"Amazing, just adding photos that were left out from the previous visit.Definitely looking forward to revisiting and trying some of the baked goodies as well as different items on the menu this time around!"
1/14/2022,20220114,4,4.25,"I am absolutely amazed how they manage to flow all those people into their restaurant throughout the brunch hours. There is usually a long line but it goes by in blink. The food was relatively expensive but normal for this part of LA and the portions were not bad. The highlight of my meal was definitely the basque cheesecake. If you don't get this at Republique, then you're really missing out. I'm normally not a fan of cheesecake, but this one is helping change that. I also got french toast, shakshouka, and my partner got the mushroom toast. Honestly, all these dishes feel like sides and although they were delicious, they left my mouth craving for some more variety. The french toast for example, was so decadent... so crispy yet soft on the inside... almost as if they fried it... but it was just a single piece... with nothing else but syrup... You're pretty much just munching on a piece of bread for breakfast"
1/15/2022,20220115,5,4.25,"Oh République, you sure know how to impress. I took my out of country cousin here for dinner the other night and she was so impressed. She tried for the first time, and liked, oysters and duck! I've come for brunch before - very impressive brunch options. But for dinner, that's a whole different look. Romantic, laid-back, and intimate. Fair warning, the price tag is not for casual dining, skinny wallets. Worth though. Especially for the 5-star service. Spectacular service, throughout the whole meal, from everyone at every point during the night. Now for the food...*eggs and uni toast: 5 stars, must get. There's a reason this consistently stays on their menu*bread and butter: 5 stars, must get for the butter alone*kumato oysters: 5 stars, who doesn't love oysters?*campanelle: 5 stars, must get. Hands down best part of the meal*duck: 5 stars, duck was cooked to perfection, great flavors*short rib: 4 stars, the entree as a whole was great but short rib alone was not impressive*potato and leek beignet: 4 stars, pretty potato filled*kanpachi crudo: hard pass, not impressive. Least favorite of the night, also why is it Thai flavors?For dessert...*apple tart: best apple tart I've ever had. Comte cheese needs to shaved on all apple desserts moving forward.*kaiserschmarran: this was like a berry pancake. It was tasty, but I wasn't in love"
1/16/2022,20220116,5,4.25,What can I say! We were in LA for 4 days and we went for breakfast here for 4 days. The pastries are a must try. The food was great and the service was awesome.
1/17/2022,20220117,4,4.25,"Rounding up 3.5 stars. The food stellar, the building is amazing but man did I feel like I was in the most expensive Denny's in the world with all of the shrieking kids and their toys going off in a desperate attempt to rein in emotions.Keep the kids at home LA."
1/17/2022,20220117,4,4.25,One of the best brunch spots in LA. Recommend getting their daily bread and favorite dessert! We got a variety of dishes and enjoyed all of them. The queue is usually longer and would recommend taking the time accordingly.
1/18/2022,20220118,5,4.25,"I have been to their brunch previously and had a good experience so I wanted to try their dinner service and was very glad that I did so. It is definitely more casual and fair in price compared to other restaurants close by and think that some other reviewer's are mixing it up with more fine dining establishments based on some of their comments. I have always had a great experience here and the food is delicious for breakfast and for dinner. It's a very well-known place so it can get busy but that also adds to the charm since inside it's really open with tall ceilings. Parking can get tricky in that area depending on day and time but I have always been able to find neighborhood parking within a few blocks at very worst.We started off the meal with the Santa Barbara Spot Prawns and they were delicious. The brown Normandy butter and the lemon mixed really well and made a really nice sauce for it. Next we followed up with the Munak Ranch Heirloom Tomatoes and that was perhaps my favorite dish of the night. It was extremely fresh and only slightly acidic and tasted like I was eating a bite of spring in winter. Next came the Sweet Corn Agnolotti and it was a small portion but it went very fast. I don't usually order corn dishes so this was a nice change for me. For the entrée I chose the Tare-Grilled Short Rib and it was 4/5. I prefer my short ribs to be more tender and this one was a bit more dense than I like but still I ate every bit of it.Overall a great experience and I would suggest to anyone. I would not suggest it as a birthday, anniversary, or important work dinner because it's not really designed for that. But for a date, dinner with friends or family, or a casual work dinner it would be perfect."
1/19/2022,20220119,4,4.25,"Both inside and outside it is very atmospheric, except that you need to stand in line. It was my first time and I didn't know about the order at the checkout. I couldn't even look at the menu. I had to order something hastily, because there were people standing behind and waiting. I ordered a cappuccino and a croissant, the most common thing that came to mind. They brought me a cappuccino in an espresso cup. It tasted the same. However, after I asked to add milk, I was changed and added. There were mixed feelings after the visit."
1/20/2022,20220120,1,4.25,"Strongly discourage you come here. The food lacked flavor, very minimal if any seasonings. The staff were not the friendliest. The valet closed without warning and I had to go through hoops to get my keys back. The food is way too pricey for what it is. You have to pay before you sit to eat, I had to ask multiple times for cutlery, salt, and ketchup."
1/20/2022,20220120,5,4.25,"The type of cafe where you order first, and grab a number. This system works well as it allows you to have 15 mins to hawk for a table. Once the table is secured, and the food comes out, your effort will not be in vain. I pretend to look the menu over when I know I'll get the quiche each and every time. I got my first and only parking ticket around the corner after eating here and I didn't even care because the food was worth it."
1/21/2022,20220121,5,4.25,"Finally came here for dinner after trying it for brunch years ago. Very delicious dishes overall. Started off our meal with the baguette and butter which was lovely. I could eat that fancy French butter all day. Server then brought us a small cup of soup, compliments of the chef which is always a nice touch. Then we got the kanpachi crudo which was served in a thai green curry style dressing, very good. We also tried the scallops, or should I say scallop, since it was literally one scallop LOL. Oh well, it was good, but definitely the most expensive single scallop I've ever eaten ($32 due to the freshly shaved black truffle). Then came the lobster campanelle. This was my favorite. Just so good overall with the huge chunks of perfectly cooked lobster, lemon sauce, calabrian chili, and basil. Lastly we ordered the duck which was part breast and part leg I believe. Finished off with the strawberry tiramisu which was simple and light and good for people who don't love super sweet desserts. Not particularly exotic, except for the freeze dried berry dust on top, but still good!"
1/22/2022,20220122,5,4.25,"Their brunch was quite the experience! I ordered their burger and it was a pretty well assembled burger. Good amount of juiciness from the patty and a beautiful brioche bun that gave a nice smell each time you bite in. Their brunch dishes were great, but their pastries were NEXT LEVEL. Literally a burst of flavours and it's not just a single taste. Since I got their strawberry tart, you get that initial tartness from the strawberry. Then the sweetness kicks in, but just at the end, the savoury crust gave it a well-balanced finish 10/10"
1/23/2022,20220123,5,4.25,"I love love love Republique, located in the old Charlie Chaplin building, the decor is brick, and large shared tables. Their hamburgers are fabulous, and the chocolate cookie my sister made me buy and take home, didn't make it there, once I tasted that good crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside chocolate goodness, I inhaled 2 cookies before blinking. Their salads are divine, as are their pork dishes. Writing this review makes me want to go there right now!"
1/25/2022,20220125,5,4.25,"Everyone was really nice and welcoming, the location was clean, and many varieties of food. Great place to bring the family, and ample parking ."
1/26/2022,20220126,5,4.25,"I came here for brunch with a friend on a Sunday around 12:30. They do not take reservations for lunch/brunch so there was a line outside. The line moved quickly though and I waited about 15 minutes for a table inside. You order by the counter when you walk in and find a table for yourself. They give you a number on a cup (pretty cute) to bring with you to the table and bring the food and drink to you. The food came out in a decent time and I appreciate that although it was more of a market style the order for both my friend and myself were served at the same time. Pictured here is the beautiful ricotta toast that I believe they adjust accordingly to the seasonal fruits. The toppings I got on my ricotta toast were cara cara, mandarin, dates, and kumquat and it was delicious! I also ordered a sesame pound cake to go and it was the perfect size (not too big so you can try more things) as well as a raspberry brioche. I enjoyed the sesame cake a lot more as it wasn't overly sweet and the flavors were well-balanced."
1/26/2022,20220126,2,4.25,"Nice premises, bu food average, service slow. Shouldn't take 30 minutes for salad & soup. The grain bowl veggies were boiled not roasted as advertised and tasteless. The dates weren't diced and overall the whole thing was too sweet. The soup was decent, but you'd do as well at a Lemonade franchise at half the price. Does not live up to its billing as one of LA's best, at least not in the cafe."
1/28/2022,20220128,5,4.25,"Came for Republique's special truffle tasting menu dinner. Been here a few times in the past for dinner, and the food doesn't disappoint. The dishes were substantial in size, the baguette and butter always amazing, and the crab risotto , turbot, quail, and chocolate ganache were delicious. The Brussels sprouts were kind of too mushy though. Price was fair considering the good amount of black truffles freshly shaved on each dish."
1/29/2022,20220129,5,4.25,"Truly some of the best cuisine LA has to offer. A point of pride for the city, sit back and take notes. I imagine this is how the pearly gates look when you walk into heaven."
1/30/2022,20220130,3,4.25,This is from a previous dining experience that I never got around to posting. 1. Eggs on toast with uni: 3.25-scrambled egg on crispy toast. I was expecting more in terms of how the uni would compliment the eggs but it didn't really 2. Seared foie gras with berries and a chestnut cappuccino with bacon foam: 3.25-the foie gras was good as well as the foam. The chestnut was too strong. The berries were not sweet enough to balance the rest of the dish. 3. Spaghetti with Dungeness crab and uni: 3.25-more of a salty sour taste. Not much crab or uni ok the dish itself4. Mafaldine pasta with truffle: 3.25-the sauce still tasted somewhat salty but slightly more peppery and drowns out truffle flavor. The pasta tastes better here and perfectly al dente5. Sonoma duck breast with pear and pistachio: 3.25-the duck was cooked we'll but slightly too salty. The service by waitstaff was overall very good and attentive. Breads:1. Baguette: normal baguette2. Lemon Poppy Mini Loaf: not too sweet or dry.3. Alfajor: dry4. Peach & Plum Brioche: the bread part was dry and lacking flavor5. Matcha Raspberry Bostock: don't remember anything special6. Raspberry Pistachio Kouign Amann: nothing special. The Bouchon Bakery one was better when they were still open7. Quiche Slice: pretty good. Not too eggy or cheesy8. Basque Cheesecake: nice and creamy. YumI did try their breakfast take out during Covid which was pretty good. Will have to try dining in for breakfast next time.
1/30/2022,20220130,4,4.25,"We arrived Saturday at 12:15pm. We valet parked and stood in line for about 20 minutes. Not bad for a Saturday. They do check your vaccination card and your ID once you get to the door so be prepared. We placed our order and then we had to run around the restaurant for a bit to find a table. We ended up sitting outside on the patio which was perfect. They promptly brought our food within six minutes but it was difficult to get a server to bring a fork, a glass or salt and pepper so be prepared to ask a couple different servers for the extras that you might need. The food was wonderful but I'm giving four stars for the difficulty in getting salt & pepper and the correct amount of place settings."
1/30/2022,20220130,1,4.25,"If you're eating inside, sure 4-5 stars. But that pick-up window culture has got to be fixed. A simple hot coffee that takes 15 minutes to get, meanwhile, a crowd of people also waiting for their coffee is being created and someone is actively sneezing and sniffling (seriously, stay home, you're fooling no one and spreading germs for a pastry?!)...then when the coffee comes it's lukewarm and the ""side"" of almond milk has been poured into it...and by ""side"" I mean so much cream, that is one can taste. If I wanted to drink straight almond milk I would have ordered it,Come one now, a simple drip (and the person behind me who ordered an ice coffee) shouldn't take 15 minutes and the three orders after shouldn't come out first. Don't create a needless crowd and don't pour in the ""side"" of almond milk that you charge extra for.Easy to solve. Get it together."
1/30/2022,20220130,3,4.25,"Great spot for breakfast. Pastries are delicious, staff is warm and welcoming. Only downside: the music inside during the mornings is way too loud. Even with earplugs in, it's quite obtrusive. Whenever I ask if the music can be turned down, the staff are pleasant about it...but to be honest, I don't really notice any decrease in the volume. This loud environment causes patrons to have to speak even louder, and it's distracting when I have to try and tune out the loud conversation at the neighboring tables. Other than the loud music, this is a good spot for weekday breakfast. I live nearby and avoid this place on the weekends because of the line. I have been often for coffee and pastries, which are good. Regarding breakfast food: I liked the croque madame (substantial, tasty, good salad), but the potato pancake with smoked salmon was too heavy and salty and I didn't finish it.The one time I took friends from out of town here for dinner, we agreed that the food was a bit too overdone. Small portions and heavily seasoned to the point where the natural flavors were hard to find. Our waiter was also a bit over the top: his praise of the food went on for a bit too long. and he obviously missed the raised eyebrows and awkward glances we were exchanging as he waxed on and on, especially about the pan drippings...which were, simply okay and not all that he made them out to be. Less is more with great ingredients. Measured, articulate praise beats rambling hyperbole. The one lunch I had there was a better experience, because it was done with a lighter hand. The short rib sandwich was decicious. The shakshouka was okay -- a bit too blobby and bland.Overall, I'd recommend this place definitely for the coffee and pastries. I haven't had enough of the other breakfast, lunch, and dinner entrees to offer an informed opinion there, but so far it's been a mixed bag. The loud music is a huge detraction, especially as the beautiful space is quite cavernous. Outdoors on the side and in the front is better, but can be unpleasantly cold in the morning. The staff is friendly and welcoming."
1/31/2022,20220131,3,4.24,"I also agree this place is a bit over hyped. I'll start off with the good:Ambiance: 5/5 - I appreciate how fast the line goes and the casual seating setup (breakfast/lunch only). Also the decor and the structure itself makes you feel like you're in Europe. Ordering: 3/5 - Like a good foodie I read reviews ahead of time so I'm better prepared. Even though I know once you get in past the door you have a short time to scan through the pastries - I still feel like I didn't a chance to evaluate what I want. The issue is there is multiple servers behind the counter, but it isn't lined up like Panda Express or Chipotle (I know I am comparing it to a fast food, but the point is about efficiency) - you need to tell the guy or girl what you want now even though you cannot see down the line what pastries are available since there's people in front of you. I really recommend management to reconsider the ordering system. Just have one person start the tray and push it down the line as the customer is going down the line. Towards the end someone can box everything in or plate it. As for the entree and drinks - there's a QR code you can scan or you can read ahead and be prepared. I also recommend to have at least a paper copy taped down near the cash register for people to easily order what they want.Food: 3.5/5 - For how much it cost, I don't think it's worth the drive. It taste honestly just ok, nothing to rave about. Food presentation was beautiful. Even the pastries were just ok, I think Paderia is still my favorite bakery.Service: 3/5 - Everyone was doing the absolute bare minimum since it's casual dining. Food and coffee did arrived fast. Took a few tries to flag someone down for coffee pot refill.Parking is available next to the building for a fee. There's also some residential parking about a block away if you want to save a few coins!"
1/31/2022,20220131,5,4.25,"Our first time here, I first saw the chef on Beat Bobby Flay on Food Network & he mentioned the restaurant. My daughter and I went for breakfast, line was long but super fast. It was so busy inside and everyone working so fast and non stop. It was pricey but once in a while it's worth it. Beautiful interior setting and seriously it feels like you're in Europe. My daughter had the regular breakfast & I had Brioche French Toast. We absolutely loved our food and coffee was strong and perfect. We bought few desserts but took it home for dinner and forgot to take pictures."
2/1/2022,20220201,3,4.24,"- Locale Destination - It's on S La Brea Ave and between W 6th st and Wiltshire Blvd in Mid-Wilshire. It's sort of hard to find it since it's in blended in the environment. Service: despite of the big size of restaurant, they don't have a server who takes orders for you. Guests are in line all the time because of it. You wait in line, pick the menu, decide what you want, order and pay at the register. They'll give you the number you put at your table so that the staff can bring you the food. Menu: coffee, pastries, lighter meals for both breakfast and dinner. Parking: street meter parking- Gluttony Expedition - Coffee: Decent. Pastries: plain, but not bad.Baguette: it's a hard American style, not a French one. My buddy told me it was good but I had a way better one in Paris, France. So this isn't good for me. Kimchi fried rice: Not so good. Probably non Korean people created this. The beef was way over cooked and $22 is a total rip off. Lobster omelette: decent but not a worthy. Meh. - Conqueror's Deduction - I think they are a bit overpriced for what it is - especially for the food. Too big menu really made them lost the focus on food. I don't come here for food - coffee and pastries are decent."
2/1/2022,20220201,5,4.25,"My mom is French and was visiting me in LA for the weekend. As could be expected she is critical of food she eats in the US. Luckily, I took her to my favorite breakfast spot, Republique. She was blown away by the pastries that she saw while waiting to order and made sure she tried a dozen of them. All of them received perfect marks. The breakfast sandwich and avocado toast all were well received as well"
2/2/2022,20220202,5,4.25,"Republique never fails to impress,We were there with the family for dinner.Amongst the dishes we orderedWere the Blue fin tuna tartare,Rodolpho le meunier butter,Taylor bay Kumamoto oysters,Campanella,mussels in salad,Black truffle risotto ,prime dry aged Ribeye. The dishes that are a must is Bluefin Tuna Tartare , CampanelleThe dark chocolate moelleux dessert absolutely out of this world .The customer service even on the phone by Shaun incredible . I had to call to make changes a couple of times and there were times I could not get through . Shaun called me right back having noticed a missed call and in his most professional way addressed my every request ."
2/4/2022,20220204,4,4.25,"Like we were told, you need to get there early for the bakery items. We arrived around 1:00 pm and not much was left. What we did order was good, not spectacular. The coffee bombolini was similar to a sugar cinnamon donut with coffee filling. The Brioche topping was very tasty but the bread/cake part was a bit dry. Maybe because we took them home and ate them several hours later?We had the Today's Bread, and this was fantastic! Slightly warm baguette with hard crust, soft center. The cream butter and jam was delicious! It was my favorite food we had there. Favorite drink was their house made ginger beer. Absolutely delicious!!! I ordered the vegetable quiche and it had spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms. The crust was delicious. Kind of like a croissant. I wasn't too fond of the side salad. It had a mustard vinegar dressing and just lettuce. My son had the lobster omelet, that he loved! I had a bite and the lobster melted in my mouth. He had a different type of side salad with only field greens and onions. It had a lemony vinegarette dressing.The building, itself, is spectacular and looks just like the photos! They also have a corner bar that's fully stocked. Nice place for Instagram!"
2/4/2022,20220204,5,4.25,Love love love the pastries.... And breakfast is amazing too! All of the staff is supe nice and friendly!
2/5/2022,20220205,5,4.25,"Everything was incredible. The food, the ambiance--just wow! The line can get pretty long but brunch is definitely worth it. Make sure to indulge and get pastries from the bakery as well, you won't regret it! Still drooling over the beautiful architecture and incredible food."
2/6/2022,20220206,4,4.25,We hosted a business dinner with over 20 individuals at Republique. The food was excellent! We sampled a variety of delectables and all were fantastic. My favorite was the brazed short beef ribs. The deserts were all incredible as well. The only downside to Republique is it can be very noisy inside so trying to have a conversation with someone sitting across from you can at times be a bit challenging. I should note we were seated in the middle of the restaurant which may have played a role in the noise level. Overall excellent place to dine!
2/10/2022,20220210,5,4.25,"We did a takeout order with a big box of pastries and they were amazing. The scone was maybe my favorite scone of all time, and the ube brioche was incredible too. The croissants, cookies, and everything else were also great. Still want to actually sit down and eat here some day."
2/12/2022,20220212,5,4.25,"I have not made it past the magical display of baked goods. I mean it's like something out of a utopian future where a bakery is really all you need.I'm scared to recommend things because they sell out. And I know the goal of a restaurant is for a lot of business, but I wish less people knew about it. It's a scene. You have to get there early, or late or lucky. Thankfully I've been there enough to sometimes just go to the To-Go window without waiting on the long line with greedy space invaders who don't want air to get between them and you as you stand on line. Back up please. But it's so good, you'll wait. Because they have staples, but they also offer new and special baked goods daily. Things like, Basque Cheesecake, A fresh made ""pop tart"" with different fillings...ie Apple, cream cheese. You can get a regular chocolate croissant or a milk chocolate croissant. The staff is pleasant and helpful and patient (I would verbally eviscerate some of these rude, ungrateful customers). Sometimes I wonder if they even deserve this place. I know I do. The parking can be frustrating depending on what time you go, but so what. I park far away and walk. I tell myself I'm earning my pastries. Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and share some of my favorites... The cream filled croissant and...drum roll.....the Chocolate Hazelnut Bomboloni. Gasp. A little ball from heaven. If I could, I'd just hand these out to everyone throughout the day. Share the joy. But at 3.75 a pop, for something I can take down in two bites...I gotta just do me and mine for now. Today I tried a Chicken Tikka Marsala hand pie...say whaaaaa? I would never. I don't even like chicken like that. And the thought of having something as strong in flavor in the A.M. kind of made me nervous. But I've been there enough to have faith...Faith maintained.. The flakiness of the crust, the quality of its innards. So delightful. So perfect. How sway? How?I feel like they have magical bakery Sprites in the kitchen who return to ""I did that"" land after they bake up the daily goods.I can't speak on anything other than the bakery, but based on this goodness I'd try anything they put in front of me. I mean this."
2/15/2022,20220215,5,4.25,"Food was yummy. Never made the inside of the restaurant thought, it was packed for Sunday brunch. Get there early I guess or go other times."
2/17/2022,20220217,4,4.25,"Coming here is definitely more for the experience than the food in my opinion. The food is good but the portions are quite small and very pricey. But like I said, makes for a great brunch experience. My friends and I came on a weekend and there was a decent wait but we eventually got a table. The service was amazing though and while we didn't try any of the baked goods, they looked really amazing and unique. If I'm being brutally honest, I probably would not come back unless I'm bringing friends from outside of LA for the experience. Maybe I'm just being a tough critic....hmm... I would say overall, food was a 3/5 (small portions and not anything too mindblowing for the price), service 5/5, environment 5/5."
2/17/2022,20220217,5,4.25,"Great menu very friendly optional staff, I would highly recommend trying. They don't take reservations that's the only downfall."
2/19/2022,20220219,5,4.25,Beautiful Brunch Spot ! The staff are all great and the spot is Just Wonderful! We have pretty much ordered everything on the breakfast menu so far! We are from Miami and have been here twice one in December and one in January. The line moves so fast even with it out the door ! Honorable Mentions that are Must Tries: BlT eggs Benedict and the Quiche of the Day and the Shakshouka
2/19/2022,20220219,5,4.25,"Didn't know where to go for a quick lunch and stumbled upon this place by accident. You do have to order and pay beforehand and when ready, you bring it to your table. Kinda unique. Great selection of food too."
2/22/2022,20220222,5,4.25,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in LA. I love coming here for brunch on the weekends with friends and family (beware!! the line can get so long if you visit past 9AM, but it's worth the wait). They ALWAYS have a gorgeous pastry display that is a tourist attraction in itself. My favorite dishes are the Kimchi Fried Rice, their omelettes, and The Regular Breakfast. I am ALWAYS dreaming of The Regular Breakfast, which is anything BUT regular! The bread is delicious with their butter and jam (which I think are made in-house). I never knew bread and butter/jam could taste so good until I came here. The bacon in The Regular Breakfast is one of those thick-cuts and super juicy. The potatoes are seasoned and paired well with red peppers, and the eggs are the most yellow I've ever seen. 5 stars all around. The atmosphere is very pleasant, I have never once come across a loud, obnoxious guest. It's also a nice place to just get a cup of coffee and read, which a good many people do!Dinnertime is also quite pleasant. It's a bit less casual, but the food is also just as good. I love getting the bolognese or whatever steak dish they have that night. It's perfect for date nights or special occasions. The servers and cashiers are the most pleasant people, too! They only hire the best, not once have I been helped by someone who had a bad attitude! We come here so often for brunch, the cashiers know us and sometimes gift us a free pastry. Will be returning soon!"
2/22/2022,20220222,5,4.25,"Incredible! Went here for Galentines, service was impeccable and the food, may be some of the best I have had in LA. You can be dressed up, or casual. We did family style dining, so ordered quite a few items on the menu and then shared it all, and we are glad we did! We tried a lot and left so full, so happy. I will definitely be back!"
2/23/2022,20220223,4,4.25,"Pro: *The line appears long, but it goes pretty fast* Food is good, not great* The desserts are outstanding!Cons:* Parking can be tricky* $19 for a chicken salad that didn't blow me away* They don't take reservations Overall:It's a super trendy and hip place. It's great for meeting friends, or having a fun day date."
2/23/2022,20220223,2,4.25,"Food is great, indoor seating atmosphere also very nice. Except their horrible valet guys - the street has meter parking spaces available after 9am BUT at around 850 their valet guys will start to park employees' vehicles at the meter spots right outside and across from the restaurant (without feeding the meters)!  So customers who drove to the restaurant will either have to go park further or pay for valet.  Mist businesses along that street are closed / gone / dying, who wants to look for parking space that is far far away?  Mist ppl would prefer convenient parking not to mention revenue for the city but if Republique employees are occupying most of those meters each day (I counted at least 11 metered spaces taken by employees (employees parked by their valet guys), other businesses will get less traffic and customers who wanna dine at Republique will be forced to pay for valet or park further.  Horrible practice and this has to be stopped!"
2/24/2022,20220224,2,4.25,"I am sorry but I guess you need to change your sommeliers, the wines by glass are horrible beyond imagination. How could a restaurant in this level mange to be so distasteful?"
2/26/2022,20220226,5,4.25,"One of my favorite haunts in LA. My boyfriends ""happy place"" as he calls it. The service is divine and the food is spectacular. It is expensive but that is due I believe to the high quality of ingredients and presentation. I'll never get over the interior of the space and how gorgeous it is. For me it makes me feel like I'm in a old church somewhere in Germany, with its high reaching ceilings and wooden beams. You do catch a influencer occasionally taking photos of themselves with an assistant but not eating the food which is a shame. More for us!"
2/26/2022,20220226,5,4.25,"Great experience dining here last night. To start off we had a reservation for 10pm and showed up at 10:15 and they still honored our table even though they don't sit anyone past 10. Veronica our waitress was awesome. Super attentive and recommended the best dishes on the menu which were honestly fantastic. We started off with the bluefin tuna , kampachi appetizers and they were amazing. I ordered the pate but wasn't a fan that's the only thing we didn't like. Then we had the dover sole and the duck plus the mushroom pasta with add on of truffles. Five star all around for this great restaurant!"
2/27/2022,20220227,5,4.25,"I've been here for brunch and dinner. For brunch, I've gotten the French toast and potato pancake. French toast felt like it was missing something, a little bland without fruits but the bread was fluffy. Both plates were delish! Beautiful space inside as well. Pastries/desserts look amazing but haven't tried yet. For dinner, asked for recs from the waiter and did not disappoint! Got the baguette with butter, butternut squash agnolotti - teeny tiny raviolis with squishy butternut squash with a tint of sweetness. The braised beef short rib -very tender. The wild California black cod - so buttery it melted in my mouth. Came with complimentary potato and leek soup with topped butter lol. Good too. The beef and cod were a bit too salty but very tender. Will be back many times :)"
2/27/2022,20220227,5,4.25,"I really like this restaurant, everything its really food, appetizers and drinks are just perfect. Most of the times when my husband and I go we like setting at the bar and the bartenders are very nice."
3/3/2022,20220303,5,4.25,"I heard this place usually has a line but it wasn't so bad this morning. Everything looked so yummy and I wanted one of each pastry but I settled on a salted caramel brioche and a latte. I was not disappointed. The brioche was sweet, sticky and had this crème inside that hit the spot. Will definitely try more next time."
3/5/2022,20220305,2,4.25,"I really wanted to like this place. food and ambiance is good , a little hard to find seating .There was a thick black curly hair ( you know what it looks like) in one of the dishes , which was really gross. The waitress switched for another one, but still, think about it, as soon as the mask mandates got relaxed, there's a hair in your dish. We waited for 20 min finally got served water, i kinda regretted that I paid 20% tip at the cashier."
3/5/2022,20220305,1,4.25,"SEXUALLY INSULTING JOKE FROM THE WAITER? WTF??Just had lunch here with my girlfriend who's visiting LA. It's actually my first time here and we got a big surprise. When we seated at a table outdoor next to the parking lot, a waiter came to give us water and utensils. My friend happened to be standing up and walking towards the restroom. The waiter looked at us and said, as I quote, ""oh beautiful ... how much? 100 dollars? 20 dollars?"" I'm so shocked and said what? Then he laughed and was like ""oh just a joke"". Is it because we're two Asian girls? Or is it because my friend was wearing a skirt? Or maybe both? I don't know if this guy has ever said similar things to other girls. Can't imagine if he did and is still serving here.Anyway I can't believe it's 2022 and I'm hearing this ""harmless joke"" when eating in Republique. Later I reported to a man who they say is the manager, which I'm not sure of and also not sure how seriously they will take it. My friend needed to be somewhere so we had to leave. Seriously there are so many good brunch places in LA that knows how to respect women. I will never eat here again."
3/5/2022,20220305,5,4.25,"Republique is always great! Service is on-point, no BS, the food was delicious and the ambience perfect. If you want a nice meal, go here."
3/5/2022,20220305,1,4.24,"No! No! No! Going here was a waste of time and money! This over hyped poor excuse for French food was pathetic and sad. Parts of our meal was under cooked, over sauced and uninspired."
3/7/2022,20220307,5,4.24,The pastries are unbelievable. The creme brûlée bolomboni is a must-get. Also try the smoked salmon montadito. They make the salmon themselves from fresh and the chive fresh cheese just makes it amazing.
3/10/2022,20220310,5,4.25,I don't even have words to describe how much I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone who visits LA. You can curb both your sweet and salty cravings in one sitting with options made with the freshest ingredients.
3/11/2022,20220311,3,4.24,"Came here for their pastries and spent about $50 on passionfruit pie, chocolate salted caramel cake, tres leches cake, sesame dulce de leche cake, danish, and yuzu twinkie. The best thing i had was the passionfruit pie. The twinkie and sesame cake were on the dense side (solid but was expecting a lighter texture). The caramel cake just didnt hit the right spot for me. The tres leches cake is also on the denser side (likely to hold up when being soaked). I didnt try their food only their pastries. Parking is hectic unless you valet."
3/11/2022,20220311,5,4.24,"I've been coming to this place for brunches for couple of years now. Food is delicious and they have a great selection of freshly baked goods every morning. They typically run out before lunchtime, so I recommend going in before noon. They have quick service despite large number of people coming in. Republique is definitely worth a visit."
3/11/2022,20220311,4,4.24,came here after the years of rave and hype. good to knock off your to do list! it's order from the counter then fighting for a table the most recent time I came. Came on a Saturday around 12- got seated pretty quickly. There's a line but it moves fast. got the kimchi fried rice to share w the table (10/10) 30 dollar full mimosa bottle (eh) madame croquette (18 dollars for an egg and toast) Typical la brunch prices. The interior is beautiful but it's crowded and loud
3/11/2022,20220311,5,4.25,"The pastries here are world class. I usually order the raspberry kouign aman and banana Nutella. I love anything with mangoes, the mango passion fruit pie is the best I've tasted. Brunch and lunch are good too. Well worth the wait, come early."
3/14/2022,20220314,5,4.25,really worth all the praises... must come and try!! fresh ingredients and all the good food!
3/16/2022,20220316,4,4.25,"Date night for my birthday. Such a beautiful building and way bigger than it looks from the outside. The service was nice, our main server had a trainee so we were lucky to have two people tend to us. We basically picked one item from each category and was too full for the cheese option at the end of the night. Everything was delicious but for me the appetizer Bluefin Tuna Tartar, Mushroom Soup that was compliments of the chef, and the Dover Sole was mouth watering! As risotto is one of my favorite meals, the Roasted Pumpkin Risotto did not disappoint! My husband's favorite part of the meal was the Pan Drippings and the Braided Short Ribs. We shared everything and it was perfect! I definitely want to come back for their brunch menu as everything sounds amazing. We very much enjoyed our experience here for dinner and looking forward to trying their lighter meals."
3/16/2022,20220316,3,4.24,"Came on a Saturday around 9 am. Not a huge fan of the ordering process I feel like a traditional waited table experience would do the atmosphere and decor justice, but that is just my opinion. I ordered the breakfast burrito and a latte. Both were good but nothing spectacular. I asked two separate food runners for some hot sauce but it never came which was a bit disappointing. Overall it was a decent meal but not sure that I would come back."
3/19/2022,20220319,5,4.25,"One of my top favorite spots to eat in LA! They do not take reservations during weekend brunch hours so this place can have a line out the door. They open back up for dinner hours so make sure you have a reservation then. My favorite drinks to order for breakfast/brunch are their fresh juices- the purple juice and golden juice. For their bakery, each item is baked in house and freshly made for that day. I've learned that they sell out quickly because their baked goods are delicious, fresh and really creative. For brunch, I love their potato pancake and brioche French toast. Dinner items are seasonal and can change on their menu. When we went for dinner, their fare was delicious and their service is always great. A fun date night spot !"
3/20/2022,20220320,5,4.25,Came here for breakfast while visiting my brother in LA and had some really delicious cakes here. The line was a bit long but the wait was totally worth it. 5/5 stars. Highly recommend.
3/20/2022,20220320,4,4.25,Drinks are great! The food is definitely over price for what they served; the quality does not match the price. I would go again for just for the drinks.
3/21/2022,20220321,5,4.25,Been here for brunch and lunch. Love that everything is grab n go sit where you want to. Bussing staff is great. Their patisserie is the best part! Don't love that they have a 5% surcharge since I'm sure only there management gets benefits from that. I'd rather tip the cashiers.
3/22/2022,20220322,2,4.24,Overrated. Had to wait in a line outside for brunch. The food was just ok... maybe I missed something?
3/23/2022,20220323,2,4.24,"Very nice atmosphere. Mediocre food. Below the average fine dining. Extremely over priced. (Dinner)Nice and kind, but pushy waitress - made us eat more than we want. Overall, feel like a rip-the-traveler-off restaurant. Party of 4, dinner, spent $355, not satisfied at all. Visit for a nice picture... not for food."
3/24/2022,20220324,5,4.24,"Food is as amazing as the incredible interior. The inside mimics a European styled castle with long wooden tables and an open ceiling for sunlight to come in. I went for a late afternoon brunch right before they closed at 2pm. The line out the door to order moved quite quickly and there was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The servers gave great recommendations and were very friendly. All the dishes were not only plated beautifully but were very delicious as well. First we had the Gioiella Ricotta Toast with hazelnuts on the side. The menu says they decline modifications, but we had no problem with that request. Toast was scrumptious! Probably my favorite dish. The ricotta and variety of citrus fruits blended so well together. It was topped with plenty of honey on thick toast. The potato pancake was my favorite savory dish. The pancake was really crispy without being too oily. On top was lots of fresh smoked salmon AND salmon roe. I've never had the two combined and was slightly skeptical, but I now want more of it. SO GOOD! There were two poached eggs covered with hollandaise sauce. So much packed into one dish. We also ordered the small baby leek and potato soup as well as a waffle topped with prosciutto and a sunny side egg. The soup was just okay, probably wouldn't order it again. The waffle was a mix of sweet from the syrup and savory with the prosciutto and egg. The kumquats on top were a little sour for my taste and wished the waffle was a little more crisp. BUT the egg was so fresh. I've never seen such an orange yolk!! You can tell all the ingredients are fresh and high quality. I really enjoyed brunch at République both for the food and atmosphere. The menu is full of many options, so there something for everyone. Downside is that it is on the expensive side. For four dishes and a drink, we paid just shy of $100. I think it was well worth it, so give it a try!"
3/24/2022,20220324,5,4.24,"For my second trip in LA, this is one of the best part. I was planning to go back to another one I went before but this place made me go twice! So I missed the other one, which is also good. Anyway, the pastries were all great sweet or savory options. The coffee menu includes basic and special provided by restaurant. You can dine here from breakfast, lunch through dinner time. Patio seating is also available. Parking can be a challenge but you can try street park around or valet."
3/25/2022,20220325,4,4.24,"Best quiche and french toast in the world. But we could not order the drinks exactly how we wanted. The person who took our order basically told us sharing is not ok there. It was odd to me to go somewhere, ordering brunch and been told exactly what to do with our food. The portions are small."
3/26/2022,20220326,3,4.24,"We were sat outside in the parking lot and there was a strong sewer stench. One of the main appeals of this restaurant is the picturesque interior. Being sat outside in the parking lot on a worn out weathered table was not ideal. To visit the restroom, you have to walk out to the street from the parking lot and enter through the main door, despite having multiple doors adjacent to the parking lot. The food was tasty, but the outdoor experience was mediocre. If you do visit, dine indoors."
3/27/2022,20220327,5,4.24,"Republique is popular for good reason. The airy, high ceilings and details of the space is gorgeous. It is also much bigger inside than it looks including an upstairs area. First off, you order your food, get a number, and then find a table.I came on a Sunday with a party of 7. We didn't have any problem finding a table and waiting in line took about 10 minutes when we arrived at 9am. Parking was a bit trickier, but they offer valet that's $5 in the mornings, $8 after 11am, and $10 for dinner. Note that you pay for the time you actually leave, so ended up paying for the lunch price.Between our group, we ordered the Chia Seed Pudding ($16), Potato Pancake ($21), Brioche French Toast ($17), Regular Breakfast ($21), Kimchi Fried Rice ($22), Southern Waffle ($18), and a Green Juice ($9). Everything was delicious, it was honestly tough to even pick a favorite dish. Despite how simple some of these dishes sounded, they were really tasteful, refreshing, and unique. All the eggs in every dish were in such a deep yellow and cooked to perfection. It's definitely best to come with more people, so you can try more items since I can't imagine how I could just pick one.To end, we also picked up a few baked goods. The display of baked goods looked so scrumptious. Everything not only looked good, but tasted even better. You really can't go wrong here --definitely easy to see why this place has garnered the attention it has."
3/27/2022,20220327,5,4.24,"Nominated for 'Outstanding Pastry Chef' by the JBF, Margarita Manzke continues to solidify Republique as one of the go-to restaurants for all things pastry!Food: A vast array of pastries are shown the moment you walk in. Coupled with a creative brunch and drink menu; you can always visit this place and be swept away with something new!Black Sesame Mango Eclair - A great pairing of tropical and tart mangoes with the subtle roasted-taste of black sesame. Favorite pastry thus far!Potato Pancake - Smoked salmon and the creamy textures of hollandaise and soft poached eggs makes this perfectly pan-fried potato pancake a brunch staple!Ambience: The Spanish-style architecture makes you feel like you're dining in another country! Perfect with a cup of coffee and weekend brunch with friends. 10-15 minute wait time on a Saturday morning.Service: Extremely helpful and patient when we needed time to look through all of their pastries. Packed during weekend brunch so please be patient with them!Arguably my favorite brunch spot in Los Angeles. Don't miss out on this iconic restaurant!"
3/27/2022,20220327,5,4.24,I had heard of this spot but I had never gone. I finally had the chance to go for the first time and it was very tasty. You can go for brunch or you can go for dinner. I love the vibe and it's so cute inside. You can go grab a coffee and study or hangout with friends. The flavors were great but my favorite item was the brioche French toast. OMG!! It's so fluffy and tasty. Literally that was the best French toast I've ate it was simple but amazing. The rest were good to but the French toast is a MUST!!
3/27/2022,20220327,4,4.24,"Been coming to Republique for a couple years now whenever my friends or family visits and they absolutely love the ambiance and the food here. They do have long lines but it does move quick in my experience. They also offer dinner items here as well. I never tried but definitely want to in the future. Every time I visit, it just really makes me feel like im in a movie or some instagram picture worthy place. They offer an abundance of pastries that you can choose from when ordering your food at the register. Notable Food Items:ShakshoukaBrioche french toastCoffee (i love their coffee)Parking is paid valet or street parking."
3/28/2022,20220328,5,4.25,"I've been to Republique a handful of times both pre and post pandemic and it has always been amazing and wonderful. There's usually residential street parking that is not very hard to find a few blocks away or metered parking right up front. When you walk inside, you immediately feel like you've been transported to a European building in another country. It is a casual bakery and cafe which turns into a formal dining restaurant at night by Chefs Walter and Margarita Manzke. On their menu, I've tried the avocado toast, regular breakfast, kimchi fried rice, mushroom toast, and shakshouka to name a few. No dish has ever been disappointing and the presentation is always aesthetically pleasing. The ingredients always complement each other very well without being too much. A few months ago, I was able to try their dinner for a special occasion and would have to say that I prefer their daytime brunch/lunch menu. We got seated in their outdoor patio area which was quiet so it was nice to be able to hear your conversation. We orderd their baguette with their rodolphe le meunier butter, lobster campanelle, and duck. Portions were on the smaller side but the food was still very tasty! I always take my out of town guests here and they always love it as well. Such a cute place!"
3/28/2022,20220328,4,4.24,"Despite the long lines, Republique still serves up a carefully prepared and presented brunch fare. Each dish features fresh produce, especially visible on their Ricotta toast! Loved their creative pastries and clever placement by the entrance. Nitpicks: the Maine lobster omelette tasted underseasoned. The non-assigned, find your own seating concept was different for sure. For a place so upscale and popular, them taking reservations for breakfast/lunch would be a huge bonus."
3/28/2022,20220328,4,4.24,Food is good! Love chia seed pudding !! But the minor thing is coffee.Coffee is bit disappointed
3/28/2022,20220328,2,4.24,"EXTRA butter in everything they make, Course you'd pay a lot of money to eat what is served. Also we saw a rat run along a pipe and back into a vent so nope, never going back"
3/29/2022,20220329,1,4.24,Terrible. My burger was overcooked and the fries tasted old. Our food was given to us about 20 minutes apart and when we asked for condiments or cups they took another 10 minutes to bring them over. The servers hardly checked in.
3/30/2022,20220330,5,4.24,"Second time coming here and am just as in love as the first. The architecture is breathtakingly beautiful especially when the sun is shining through the skylights and everyone who I dealt with was super friendly. Food is ordered at the counter first before getting a table and there can be a line during peak hours but it moves pretty quickly. The food is exceptional, the presentation beautiful, and the various options on the menu are clever and yet the flavors all seem to be perfectly thought through. There is a full bar open at night and they have good coffee drinks when you need them. This place really has it all."
3/30/2022,20220330,2,4.24,"The thrill is gone. There is absolutely NO passion or care in dining anymore at this restaurant. The service staff is stiff, coarse and deliver your food and beverages as if you are in a fine dining restaurant, but the food is - meh... now. In the beginning, it was scrumptious and felt like finding hidden gems in all of the dishes. Tonight - beignets were so greasy it was laughable. Don't make cheese filled beignets if you cannot get the dough right. Beef tartare was also a huge MEH! No flavor... had to ask for S&P. At these prices, why go again? I used to love this place but it's on the decline. Oh and the restaurant was half empty, which was a big red flag from the moment I walked in. Should've listened to my instincts and saved $100."
4/1/2022,20220401,2,4.23,"How could this be so bad??!! I'll give it two stars because I don't like fully dragging anyone especially a local business*, but I was so confused when I saw their ""pupusa"". I mean this is L.A. where Salvadoran masters are all over the county serving up great pupusas. In no way could I compete with Salvadoran cooks, but even I could produce some monstrosity closer to a pupusa than République.  It's as if they took two Mexican blue corn tortillas and made a crude sandwich. I don't know how anyone who has seen actual pupusas being formed could come up with something like this. Oaxacan cheese is all wrong for this dish for so many reasons**. Why use black beans when frijoles de seda are so available in this city? I have so many questions. République calling this a ""pupusa"" is like a chef putting ketchup, bologna, and American cheese on a bagel and calling it a margherita pizza, and then saying ""It's inspired by Neapolitan cuisine. Don't hold us to any standards."" In L.A. there is just no excuse for a serious professional serving something so uninformed and poorly composed. There is a pupuseria 1 mile and a half away called Con Sabor on Venice. Check them out for pupusas first, and then hit up République for your avocado toast needs.* check my review history. I'm usually passing out compliments like candy** Oaxacan cheese is obviously Mexican and not Salvadoran at all. It has it's own history, regionality and unique flavor. With Salvadoran cheeses like quesillo so available in L.A. why swap it out for a queso from a completely different country and culture? Oaxacan cheese has it's own strengths, but it doesn't crisp like quesillo does when it escapes the masa."
4/1/2022,20220401,4,4.23,"Good food. We had the French toast (excellent), waffle (good) and carne asada burrito (excellent) with an iced coffee (excellent). Decent prices, friendly cashier. Waiters are no where to be found unless you flag them down. Overall I would come back."
4/2/2022,20220402,3,4.23,"April Fools?!?!?! Are we being punked?!?!?! MayLene D. and I have both heard such great things about Republique from many of our Yelp friends so we were both incredibly surprised that our experience did not align with what we have heard so many times. Located off La Brea Avenue, parking options are scared with metered street parking or a small valet lot. Reservations not accepted for breakfast since it's a pay and seat yourself type of set up during the day time. The place was packed and it is quite likely that you will have to wait in a long line. All of that points to an experience that SHOULD be good if all these people are willing to wait in line for it. By the time we got to the front of the line we were crowded by the customers ordering with the cashier next to ours. It was so cramped. Definitely not pandemic friendly. From their baked goods area, we picked the Ube Coconut Bundt, Black Sasame Danish and a Creme Brulee Bomboloni. For our breakfast items, MayLene D. opted for the Regular Breakfast ($21) that comes with scrambled eggs, a slice of bacon steak, fingerling potatoes, a baguette, French butter and jam. I went with a Croque Madame ($18) which came with a house cured ham, gruyere cheese, baby green salad and a fried egg on top. As beverages, MayLene D. went with a Papa Hemingway Spritz ($14) that has a grapefruit aperitif, rum, passion fruit, maraschino, lime and soda. I went with an Elderflower Spritz ($14) which has a mommenpop meyer lemon, grapefruit, pisco, mint, presecco and soda. We were given this cup with a number to mark our seats when we found one. There was many long tables if you're into communal seating. We were lucky to find a table for two to settle down in. We sat against this wall and it was strange that their staff occasionally came to reach for ingredients behind us. To my surprise this was the worst croque madame I have had in my life. Why is it so bland? The filling was insufficient with the ham and cheese not reaching to the edges of the bread. I really don't need such a wide piece of bread. I prefer substance. The warm salad was overdressed and really plain as well. I was baffled considering this place had such high praises from my friends. I looked at MayLene and her fingerling potatoes were completely untouched. She usually LOVES potatoes so I asked her how she likes her food. Ohh goodness apparently her eggs and potatoes were all bland. The drinks tasted like flavored water. No detection of alcohol at all. Were we punked?!?! Did something happen to their chef on the one day we took work off to try their breakfast?!?!?! What are the chances that we are so unlucky?? The baked goods were just as disappointing. Ube bundt cake was DRY, the bomboloni tasted stale and oily and the black sesame danish was least bad but it had this sour lemony aftertaste. Pass pass pass. I debated long and hard if I wanted to come back for dinner before writing my review... but after having their bland breakfast I'm not sure I even want to come back for dinner."
4/2/2022,20220402,5,4.23,"Excellent Friday night dinner spot. We got a 9pm reservation for a party of 4 and the restaurant was definitely bumping. Since the menu was designed to share, we each got a mix of small plates and entree. Everything was 5 stars to be honest. My absolutely favorite was the beef tartare with the fresh made chips, the eggs on toast with Uni and the baguette with butter. The architecture was also amazing and the service was impeccable. I heard the menu rotates pretty often too so definitely excited to come back here and try out other stuff."
4/2/2022,20220402,5,4.23,"Must go to spot in LA. I went here for breakfast , a little before 10 am . The line was long but moved quickly and well worth any wait. Food quality is unreal! Anything you get on the menu is amazing . I ordered the shakshouka and it was delicious ! Fresh bread and pastries ! And great service. Parking is difficult but the bakery / restaurant offers valet !"
4/3/2022,20220403,5,4.24,"I really enjoyed my Sunday Brunch experience at Republique. The pastries/desserts, coffee and ambiance are alone worth the visit. Expect a line, you will place your order at the counter for pastries, food and drink, pay for your order and then they give you a number and you find a table and they will bring the items to your table. If you decide to add to your order you just go back to the cashier, you don't have to get back in line. Self seating had me nervous with the crowd they had going but it worked out perfectly, the dining area is bigger than it appears. I'm not sure what this building was before they opened, but it's clear that a lot of thought went into everything and I was mesmerized by the details. I ordered the Potato Pancake which is like a fancy smoked salmon eggs Benedict but instead of an English muffin. You get a giant hash brown. It was delicious and the hubs ordered a breakfast burrito which sounded simple but it was served wet and in a cast iron skillet. Coffee was brewed perfectly and I was thankful for valet parking. Street parking is hard to come by in this area."
4/4/2022,20220404,5,4.24,"Located on a busy street with valet parking available, this iconic building houses a perfect place to grab your break fast. With how big and busy this place is this is the first time in my whole life I have ever received fastest service possible. Great customer service and wait time is almost non existent. Our food was out within 15 mins from the time we were seated. Omelette and French toast were great"
4/4/2022,20220404,4,4.24,"large selection of breakfasts on the menu, I like it. It's tasty, fresh. Big choice for bakery"
4/4/2022,20220404,5,4.24,Everything is fantastic!! The pastries are so good but run out quickly..so get there early or order pickup!
4/4/2022,20220404,5,4.24,Chic French goodness with a side of artsy. Highly recommend and will come back. Loved the food and old Hollywood vibes.
4/5/2022,20220405,4,4.24,"Love the food. I've been here many times. Just one downside see the Photo: They don't answer the phone no matter how many times you call. What if I couldn't get ahold of someone and it's an emergency? At the price point I pay I expect a quality of service in all areas of the experience. Service needs to wake the hell up.But alas I love this place so much. People are lovely. Food is great. Service is attentive and accommodating. Highlights: wine selection, beef tartare, baguette with butter, steak, crudo... yeah all good. Please answer the phone! Then five stars ;-)"
4/5/2022,20220405,5,4.24,"What a treasure this restaurant is. Although it was crowded, the staff tried to be accommodating and the food was delicious.  And then there is the bakery, unbelievable. This is a great restaurant not to be missed by a visitor or a local, it will be one of your regulars. The building is historic and beautiful. You will love this restaurant."
4/6/2022,20220406,5,4.24,"One of my favorite places to go for brunch. I hate this area of the city but having valet is a Godsend. Don't let the long lines deter you, the cash register and bakery case is right near the door. Once you have ordered and paid, I've never had an issue grabbing a seat.Dinner is just as excellent and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. This dynamic duo can do no wrong and if you like their food, I highly recommend Bicyclette and Manzke as well."
4/6/2022,20220406,5,4.24,"The food, drinks and service was a 10 out of 10. I wish I could eat the charcuterie every day. The decor is really cool, I suggest sitting in the front room, the architecture is fun to look at. The rear room is darker and more intimate. Made a reservation online so I didn't have to wait for a table. Definitely going back."
4/7/2022,20220407,5,4.24,"This restaurant is one of my go to places for brunch! The food is great, pastries are bomb, and vibes are cute. Though Republique is super popular, I've never really had to wait too long for brunch. The line to order moves relatively quickly and finding a seat usually isn't too hard (especially now that they have both indoor and outdoor seating). My favorite dishes to get here are the mushroom toast and croque madame! Shakshouka is decent as well, and I would avoid getting the breakfast sandwich. For pastries, some must tries are the bombilinis, black sesame dulce de leche pound cake, and cookies. I usually park at metered spots or at nearby residential streets, but make sure to read the parking signs."
4/7/2022,20220407,5,4.24,"Food and pastries here would be 4.5, honestly. But the ambiance and aesthetic of the place tip my review over to 5 stars. I don't know why but the main hall kind of gives me some Hogwarts feels. The open space and kitchen for me is a sight to behold. There's just something amazing to see chefs and cooks in action, pulling dough and all. You get the picture :)The pastry counter here is beyond. You have to order your stuff first (for here and to go), check the menu via QR code and then sit anywhere you fancy. They'll give you a steel mug as table markers. Came here on a Wednesday morning around 9am so the wait was decent. It's metered street parking FYI so that might be a struggle if you come here on a busy weekend.Everything is worthy of Instagram. I personally loved the Brioche French toast (it's so fluffy! Like a jumbo sized toast), Ube brioche (the ube filling and cream with the crunch of the upper part is simply divine!) and the basque cheesecake. The matcha bundt cake was on point too. Mocha was ok, wish I explored more of their cafe selections, like the Vietnamese latte and the like.I didn't get to try the savory brunch items but I'll be back here for that! Definitely feeling the vibe of Republique. Not sure if you can hang out here and study for an extended period of time; but it's a cozy area to prop up and read a book."
4/7/2022,20220407,5,4.24,One of the best brunch places I've been to. The ingredients are always fresh and delicious! The ambiance is beautiful. I will for sure come back for more delicious stuff to try!
4/8/2022,20220408,5,4.24,I went last month to this restaurant. I must say everything was absolutely delicious. One of my favorites was their kimchi fried rice. I definitely recommend this place to others.
4/10/2022,20220410,4,4.24,"I came upon this place on my friend's instagram story and it was way too pretty to pass. The way it works is that you order everything you want at the counter, then they give you a cup with your table number. From there you may choose to sit wherever you please and the staff will bring the food to you. Service was mediocre in my opinion, it's a busy and very popular place so I totally understand when staff are not overly smiley and friendly. The food was what you expect. If you want to go to a brunch place for pretty instagram pictures, you should definitely visit!"
4/10/2022,20220410,4,4.24,A little on the pricey side but delicious! The chai tea was amaazzing. Highly suggest!
4/11/2022,20220411,3,4.24,"Tie me to a stake and burn me but this place is SO ridiculously overpriced.Republique is an incredibly trendy place that everyone in LA has gone to. The food is Instagram worthy and the interior is very pretty.I waited in line with my friends after we landed in LA and it was not worth it. The food was decent, but it was incredibly expensive and the portions are pretty small. I personally had to order two dishes to get full and it was over $30.Things we ordered:French toast - Literally a single piece of toast with syrup. I wouldn't order this.Shakshuka - My favorite time that we ordered here. It was very flavorful and the egg was runny. The portion was too small for me though.Cubano - I wouldn't recommend getting it here. It was just decent and the portion was small.Burger (Don't remember which one) - Decent, but the side salad was meh.Overall, I guess you could come here to say that you came here but I'd skip this place because there are soooo many other nicer options in LA."
4/12/2022,20220412,5,4.24,"Chicken and Waffles: the chicken was fried perfectly, moist and savory on the inside, especially for breast meat. The gravy and eggs worked well together to build a savory sauce for the sweet waffle. The waffle stayed crisp while soaking up the liquid even."
4/13/2022,20220413,5,4.24,"Might be my favorite brunch ever. All of the pastries and food was so so so good! All the flavors were like an explosion in your mouth like Remy's strawberry and cheese tasting in Ratatouille. Everything was so high quality which I really appreciated. Although everything is on the pricier side, the experience is so amazing that it is worth it. We got the BLT BENEDICT, MUSHROOM TOAST, CHIA SEED PUDDING, and AVOCADO TOAST as well as a slice of the Strawberry Passion Fruit Cream Pie, Raspberry Matcha Bundt Cake, and the Berry Croissant. The BLT Benedict flavors went so well together and the muffin on the bottom was so buttery and you could taste the quality. Mushrooms are usually my least favorite food, but if I had to eat mushrooms, I would want it like how they prepare it in the mushroom toast. The chia seed pudding was surprisingly large and so flavorful and refreshing. I don't usually like chia seeds but I really enjoyed this and would get it again. It tasted a lot like an acai bowl which I loved. As for the pastries, the Strawberry Passion Fruit Cream Pie was my favorite. I love passion fruit and the cream was so high quality. The only problem was that the crust was pretty hard to cut through as it was pretty thick, but it was still delicious. The same high quality cream was in the berry croissant which was also flakey and yummy, even though I don't normally opt for croissants. The bundt cake was also very high quality. I came here around 2019 and I have to say I was unimpressed then, but maybe because I got their berry waffles which did not highlight their culinary expertise and ability to create such fantastic flavors. I'm glad I came back because now I can't wait to go back!"
4/13/2022,20220413,5,4.24,"Cool boogie little cafe. Indoor and outdoor ordering. The sweets and food are very good. The menu is a bit pricey but good quality food, and excellent customer service:)"
4/14/2022,20220414,4,4.24,"We always go mid morning on a weekday or early on a weekend because the line can get long, but it's a favorite for the in-laws when they're in town."
4/16/2022,20220416,5,4.24,Great place for a date or with family. Great food 10 out of ten. I would recommend to a friend for breakfast Lunch or dinner
4/17/2022,20220417,4,4.24,"Went to Republique for brunch with my friend, and it was such a good experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was chill but gave off cool hippie vibes lol. The food is mainly brunch styled food + pastries. Also a lot of french inspired dishes. Very good place to brunch and catch up with friends.  Kimchi Fried Rice: I loved this so much! It definitely does not taste like authentic fried rice but the combination of flavors were all so good! The poached egg on top was cooked so well and gave the fried rice a creamier and more decadent taste to it. I also loved the radish and chili in it, really added another pop of color and acidity. The beef inside was also really tender and flavorful. 8.4/10 - Citrus Salad: I loved this salad so much! It was so fresh and packed with flavors! The blood orange in it was so refreshing, the goat cheese gave it a nice kick and a more savory taste to the salad, and the hazelnut added another nutty and smokey dimension to it. I truly enjoyed this salad and will order it next time for sure! 9/10 - Carne Asada Breakfast Burrito: It was a wet burrito and tasted really good. It was HUGE. Filled with lots of filling, and I really enjoyed the sauce on it. Avocado was too raw for my liking 7/10 I bought some of their pastries back home and they all tasted so good as well. I highly recommend! They have a wide selection too. Sadly I forgot to take pictures of it :("
4/19/2022,20220419,5,4.24,Ordered the kimchi fried rice and the potato pancake with smoked salmon. Kimchi was next level! Very creative dishes
4/19/2022,20220419,5,4.25,"One of my favorite restaurants in all of LA and the country. Excellent food, incredible and interesting selections. Beautiful and historic building and I highly recommend. You won't be disappointed."
4/21/2022,20220421,5,4.25,"This place is delicious, busy, but super fast paced. Open seating, I had the quiche & chia pudding which was delicious!! They have so many baked good to pick from. I cant wait to come back."
4/22/2022,20220422,4,4.25,Very beautiful inside and out. I ordered the moussaka and it was delicious. It was super busy yet the staff was very friendly.
4/23/2022,20220423,5,4.25,"The lobster omelette was to die for For the price, I wish there was more omelette and less arugula salad, but the greens were good, too, lightly seasoned with some vinaigrette. There was a long line to get in for brunch, but it went by fairly quickly, as you order first then sit down. The interior was high-ceilinged and rustic. They ran out of pastries/cakes by the time we got there (past noon), so if we go back it'll definitely be to try these!"
4/24/2022,20220424,5,4.25,"Review for their pastries, mainly. I am obsessed with pastries and couldn't resist trying most of their menu! Here's what I tried, in order of preference:Out of the sweet pastries, you have to try these:- Lime and passion fruit tart: Excellent tartness and flavors with a very tasty crust!- Creme brûlée bomboloni: super popular for a good reason- Berry crostata: Loved the custard in this. I saved this for the next day and the pastry was still crispy - Kouign amann: If you love croissants, you'll love this! - Vanilla canele: Perfect for those who love the burnt sugar taste with a hint of rumThe following sweet pastries were good, but I probably will skip next time:- Raspberry kouign amann- Milk chocolate almond croissant: I think a darker chocolate would've been a better fit here. Too sweet- Lemon poppyseed calamansi twinkieI enjoyed all the savory pastries (even more so than sweet) and recommend all of them! - Curry beef hand pie: This was the best thing I ordered!! Stuffed to the brim with filling, this was SO good- Montadito: Awesome sesame mini baguette with Brie and great ham- Savory danish: Loved this as well! The cheese and tomato topping was delicious- Plain & Ham and cheese croissants: Excellent croissantsDon't recommend:- Seasonal donut: I tried their coconut ube donut and this was nothing special. We also ordered their mushroom toast which was delicious. I also recommend their green juice, which you can see them making it fresh! Try to get their before 9 AM if you don't want to wait more than 30 min in line."
4/25/2022,20220425,4,4.25,"Fantastic brunch place in LA. Heard many great reviews so decided to come check it out, and it did not disappoint. We came on a Sunday for brunch and was prepared for a 1+ hour wait as warned by our LA friends. Although there was a decent line, but we were fortunate enough to order within ten minutes or so and found a seat inside upon ordering without any issues. From pastries to savory brunch dishes, everything we ordered were heavenly divine. Pastries we ordered included chocolate croissant, matcha Bundt cake, and canale. Though the pastries weren't heated, but we were pleasantly surprised that the texture of these pastries were all crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. For brunch dishes we ordered French toast, mushroom toast, and shakshouka. French toast was by far the most surprising yet delicious dish (even though all of them were fantastic). The server came with a huge piece of beautifully toast bread. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Perfect with or without the maple syrup There were so many ingredients on the mushroom toast - scrambled eggs, mushroom, house cured ham, hollandaise sauce etc, each bite was flavorful with an explosion of all these combination of ingredients. Highly recommend asking for hot sauce for an additional highlight of mildly spicy taste. Shakshouka was served fresh from the oven with toasty tomato based sauce with chickpeas, kale, poached eggs, and two slices of baguette. The only con of our visit was probably we over ordered and were in food coma for the rest of the afternoon."
4/25/2022,20220425,5,4.25,One of thee best restaurants in the city. Make a reso. Always a line. Make sure you get the Republique Old Fashioned with coconut bits. It's a winner!!
4/26/2022,20220426,3,4.25,"I went to dinner her for a birthday celebration and I was markedly underwhelmed. The quality of the ingredients and the desserts were solid, but the cocktails were disappointing as I tried 4-5 different ones. I'd chock that up to maybe the bartenders were experimenting.The dessert presentation was great but the actual taste wasn't up to snuff and I left expecting more."
4/26/2022,20220426,5,4.25,"I love their signature Potato Pancake. Unique approach to the pancake dish. I was surprised 1st when I saw it on their breakfast menu, but after I tried it, I totally recommend it. The perfect combination of the salmon tastes, be it smoked or roe with tanginess of the hollandaise and the aroma of the dill... this by it self is a culinary master piece."
4/27/2022,20220427,4,4.25,"It's no surprise why this place always has a line out the door. The food is really just that good! We arrived around 9 AM for brunch and waited about 15 minutes before placing our order. As soon as you enter the restaurant, you are immediately overwhelmed by all the delicious pastry options that they offer, displayed neatly for you to admire at. To make things even better, the ambiance and decor of the interior was truly spectacular. The whole look had both a contemporary and European vibe to it. Overall, everything was simply amazing, from the taste to the texture. It is a bit on the expensive side, but if you don't mind it or want a nice brunch experience, I'd say this place will definitely not disappoint.Potato Pancake (5/5): Incredibly crispy that paired well with the runny poached egg and fresh salmon. Hollandaise was also done perfectly. Ube Brioche (5/5): A nice, fluffy texture with a smooth ube cream filling inside. This cream alone probably made this my favorite pastry here.Créme Brûlée Bomboloni (4/5): Wonderful brûléed sugar shell that came with a nice coffee cream surprise. Pain au Chocolat (3/5): Was probably the least special out of the bunch, but it was still very flaky and delicious. Very similar to a chocolate croissant. For coffee, we got the Masala Chai Tea Latte and the Okinawa Latte. Both lattes were great but not really worth its price, considering the cup size that you get.The only thing I wished for was that we would've gotten fresher and warmer pastries, as they were all pretty cold by the time we ate it. Regardless, I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience here at Republique. Make sure to come in early, cause there was a long line out the door by the time we left. I'm glad I decided to make a pit stop here during my time in LA, and so should you!"
4/27/2022,20220427,4,4.25,"I had this place bookmarked for the longest time and finally had a chance to try it out. A friend and I visited on a Saturday, so it was extremely busy! The line does go by fast because you order and pay at a counter and then go find open seating. The parking situation was kind of annoying because they have a tiny driveway that you have to enter for valet, while you have cars stopped behind you and people standing around the area. Weird situation. I think they could definitely improve the valet situation because you could easily get into an accident with the way it's set up. Anyways, so we luckily found a place to sit and received our food pretty quickly. The food was great! We had the carne asada breakfast burrito, brioche French toast, French omelette, and some chicken potatoes. Highly recommend all of them. We also purchased some pastries to take home with us and they all tasted really good. I would return again, but maybe not on a Saturday. Oh! Forgot to mention the mimosa! It made the brunch just perfect"
4/28/2022,20220428,4,4.25,My friend and I waited about 30 min to get food but it was totally worth it. Their food was amazing especially porkbelly and i liked their interior a lot. Love their brunch menu.
4/29/2022,20220429,4,4.25,"I have visited this place few times now and has been my staple breakfast place for my relatives visiting LA. During my last visit, I noticed some differences. Prices have gone up as well as the service charge for their employees benefits (from 3% to 4%). Valet parking is now $8.50. There are metered parking spots around the area but only limited to one hour. The queue was not so bad on a weekday. We initially thought it would be crowded like it usually is. We ordered breakfast plates. I really wanted to have their chia pudding but when I saw how much it costs now $16, might as well just get a whole breakfast plate. Breakfast sandwich was just okay. The patty was quite salty to my liking. Our favorite dessert was the Mango-Passion fruit tart. It was so delicious, it was not too sweet at all. The quality of drinks have been consistently great. I would definitely recommend trying the pastries here rather than having big breakfast."
4/29/2022,20220429,5,4.25,The bakery here is AMAZING. So many options that are all delicious. The line is sometimes kind of long on the weekend but moves decently fast. After you get food from the bakery you can order your main brunch food at the register and seat yourself somewhere. The waiters will bring the food to you. Honestly have never had anything bad here. The only thing is the $$$ is slightly high.
4/29/2022,20220429,5,4.25,"One of the best restaurants around! Excellent service, food and vibe! I could dine here every night of the week."
4/30/2022,20220430,1,4.24,"I have been hearing all the good things about this place for so long and finally got time to come here to try! However, the experience was not so satisfying for a restaurant with such price and high reputation. First of all, they did not mark any raw food on their menu. I am 8 month pregnant, and my doctor suggested that I am not supposed to each raw egg, raw fish, or any raw meat. I ordered shakshouka without knowing it had raw egg in it. The menu didn't mention it, nor did the person who ordered for me. When I asked to return and reorder. They refused to return it for me and asked me to order a new one if I didn't want it, so I wasted $18 on my breakfast.Secondly, for 20 minutes we were seated, we didn't get any water or drinks we ordered. I had to get a waiter to at least get us some water. He gave us two glasses. One of them has white powdery scratch on it. I am not sure what are these. As a pregnant woman, I took precautions of everything that goes into my mouth. Therefore, I asked a waitress to change the glass for me. The waitress refused to change the glass for me and said, "" no it's not dirty. You can use it."" Then I asked if I could get another glass then. She took the scratched powdery glass away and came back with the same one and said, "" that's all the glass we got, you have to use it"". Wow with a restaurant that charges $45 for a meal for one person with mediocre food, they don't have budget to have enough glasses for their customers and keep their glasses clean????"
4/30/2022,20220430,4,4.24,"The food was good and inside seating area was beautiful. Not pictured* The Carne Asada Breakfast Burrito, but it's a must try! I got so excited that I ate it before snapping a picture. The meat is so tender! We also had Regular Breakfast with Bacon Steak and it was so good. Unfortunately, the service was not so good. We asked for water and it never came, but we understand that they are probably understaffed. I don't think we would come again, but definitely a place you have to try."
4/30/2022,20220430,5,4.25,The service was fabulous as well as the food ! The atmosphere is energetic and fun. Great overall experience.
4/30/2022,20220430,5,4.25,This is maybe the one place in Los Angeles that lives up to its hype. Get the regular breakfast and don't skimp on the pastries. They will literally change your life.
5/1/2022,20220501,5,4.25,"My boyfriend has been raving about this place for a while and this is one of his favorite breakfast spots, so finally I went. Overall, the food is priced a little high for portion sizes but the quality and taste make up for it. 5/5 would recommend to a friend. I do feel like the customer service experience is also amazing and I love a place where you are able to pay at the count. You also seat yourself but staff comes by with water and utensils almost immediately. I definitely would visit again."
5/1/2022,20220501,5,4.25,"The place is beautiful! I love the food and atmosphere over there. The line goes fast, so don't be afraid of it when you see the place first time. But one thing I don't get, if I want to order more, should I go to line again or bassers will take the order?"
5/1/2022,20220501,4,4.25,"Great place for a date! Fun & sexy evening vibe. DO NOT request ""OUTDOOR SEATING""! They added some tables, chairs and lighting to the section of the parking lot connected to their building but it's NOT WORTH your time or money to eat in that area. There is zero ambiance. This restaurant is a great combination of interior style, delicious food, and special cocktails. But wait to get a reservation INSIDE."
5/1/2022,20220501,5,4.25,Best french toast and an incredible ambiance. One of very few places I frequent and feel comfortable sitting alone and enjoying a meal!
5/1/2022,20220501,1,4.24,"I've been coming to Republique for years. It was one of my favorite restaurants in LA. The food is still good and the interior is beautiful but we experienced something rather disturbing last night. Upon entering the restaurant we gave our bottle of wine to the sommelier. She took it without asking us any questions and decanted it. Aside from a few mix ups on the ordering things were going smoothly until we received our bill. There was a $75 corkage fee. Yes, that is correct $75 to open a bottle of wine. The corkage fee prior was $25-$30 and again nothing was disclosed to us upfront. We kindly asked our server if that was accurate and we were told that it was. We had to go as far as talking to the manager to have the corkage fee reduced. Which she ultimately did take care of but only after being clearly annoyed at our request. First off, a corkage fee of $75 is absurd. And, if they want to charge a corkage fee that high, it should be disclosed upfront. Especially, since it was $30 prior. It could've been handled with grace but instead she was somewhat hostel. We spent over $350 on a meal for two of us and now we question whether we want to return. So sad that this restaurant has gone that way."
5/3/2022,20220503,5,4.25,Awesome pub. New to area and loved the service and atmosphere. Will be returning. Great menu options as well!!!
5/5/2022,20220505,5,4.25,Excellent meals everything I had was absolutely delicious. The Aviance was delightful. The waiter and waitress is for all nice and cheery.
5/7/2022,20220507,4,4.25,This place was super cute. Taking one star off due to price and portion size of the entree haha but loved the baked goods and pupusas. My oatmilk latte was great and highly recommend the golden juice!
5/7/2022,20220507,4,4.25,"Awesome atmosphere, awesome food. The pastries are to die for and the food is also. First time here and I will definitely go back when I'm in the area."
5/7/2022,20220507,5,4.25,Please please please go there and try the brioche French toast!!!! It's SPECTACULAR!!
5/7/2022,20220507,5,4.25,"What a fantastic restaurant! Repulique reminds me of hanging out at Spago in the late 80's , you would be never be surprised who walked in the door. For some reason this restaurant doesn't seem to attract the type of crowd I detest, people eating somewhere just to be seen with the in crowd. I know that I sound elitist but most people know who I'm talking about"
5/8/2022,20220508,4,4.25,"An excellent brunch spot (after a lengthy wait in line) with lots of options! The French omelette was, of course, perfectly cooked, topped with herbs and stuffed with oozy Gruyere with a baby green salad on the side ($18). I also recommend the bread! The French Normandy butter is out of this world. ($12)The kimchi fried rice ($22) was clean and surprisingly tasty. I say clean because I like my kimchi fried rice kind of greasy with those burnt bits but hey, this version was great for when I'm in a fancier mood. I did like the short rib in it. The BLT Benedict ($21) was super tasty with a perfectly poached egg on top! I would definitely order this again. Loved the chili hollandaise The brioche French toast ($17) was good but didn't blow my socks offThe fried chicken and waffle ($21) is a seasonal item. I thought it was just okay. Fried chicken needed to be juicier and crispierWill be back to try more options eventually."
5/8/2022,20220508,5,4.25,"République is an excellent popular restaurant and for good reason - the food lives up to the hype. We had the good fortune to dine there in person a couple times before the pandemic, and the lines were always out the door. Very glad they're still doing well.My husband decided to order takeout for Mother's Day brunch. It was a little confusing because after he placed the order he got an email saying that they couldn't accept orders over $100 and to call the restaurant, but he also got a text confirmation of the order. No one answered the phone last night or this morning. My in-laws waited in line 40 minutes but fortunately were able to pick up the food without any difficulty.All of the entrees we ordered were amazing - kimchi fried rice, Maine lobster omelette, BLT Benedict, and Gioiella ricotta toast. Would happily order any of them again. The strawberries on the ricotta toast were of top notch quality. Child devoured the ham and cheese croissant and declared that it stood up to the competition (Tartine). Of the pastries that we got, the raspberry passion fruit brioche was by far my favorite - if you like passion fruit, don't pass this one up. The creme brulee bomboloni is a classic and always worth getting. The ube coconut Bundt cake was very flavorful and had a nice bit of crunch to the crust.Looking forward to the next special occasion that might just justify the expense and all the crazy waiting"
5/8/2022,20220508,5,4.25,Food was amazing. We all shared the different dishes we ordered and everything was great!!!
5/9/2022,20220509,5,4.25,"Came here for brunch and it was packed! I'm not really used to how this place works, but you order at the front and then you sit down wherever there's a free area and they will bring your order to you. It's VERY aesthetic in here, so I feel like you can definitely get a nice photo of the food and yourself. Huge menu though. The food here was delicious! I especially liked the Belgian waffle and shakshouka! Both items were tasty with good level of flavour, nothing too salty or sweet. The other item was good too, but I don't really remember what it was. The coffee here was good but it's also just standard. I just liked how you get your own cream and sugar that they provide to you. It was kind of aesthetic too from my vague memory with the cups or something.Service was okay. I could definitely sense the people at the front were overwhelmed and were like ""Ugh"". It was super crowded with a line out the door so I understand why. It may seem a little overpriced, but I think it's worth it for the experience, food, and how pretty everything is. There is valet parking literally next to the place which is useful. Definitely recommend this place and big thanks to my friend who thought of going here!"
5/9/2022,20220509,4,4.25,"Extraordinarily beautiful location, even the floors are memorable.We ordered the famous bread and it was fantastic, we loved it. Beef tartare was good, as were the potato chips that accompanied it.The charcoal grilled veggies were fantastic, with the date and yogurt sauce making everything come alive.We shared the steak and then an apple tart for dessert, both good but not something I remember vividly.In the end it was an OK experience, even though our server was a bit on the upsell all night."
5/9/2022,20220509,4,4.25,"I enjoyed their food, drink and ambience, but their service was a little annoying. First of all, the line outside goes by decently fast so don't feel dreaded when seeing a long line. Once you're in, you order first then sit down. If the workers are not patient with you and it's your first time visiting, it can get a bit annoying cause you might feel rushed even though you can't see all the options of pastries. When I went, the cashier was a bit rude and impatient. Everything else was great. They offer valet parking for around $8, if you don't want to deal with parking in LA."
5/9/2022,20220509,5,4.25,We came to try this place because we were in LA. Ordered the French toast and the croque madame. The restaurant has really nice decor. The food was delicious .  Highly recommended if you're in the area.
5/9/2022,20220509,1,4.25,"The most overrated and underwhelming restaurant (if you can call it that) I have been to in a long time. The lines I believe are created on purpose just to make it look like there is really something to wait for. We tried various dishes and they was nothing special about any one of them. The Ricotta Toast with a huge slice of french bread that was dense and spongy but not in a good way, with a thin layer of ricotta and a few (not many) sliced strawberries on top. Ridiculous!! The spring salad mixes I know were purchased at Costco. I really thought LA had people with a bit more discerning taste than this."
5/10/2022,20220510,3,4.25,I truly do enjoy republic good and drinks but they are sooo expensive to me for just breakfast food. You don't even get a table it self seated and you get a number and they find you with you food. I hate that so much. Price is not reasonable for example brioche French toast omelet and a spritzer is like $60 . Too much it's pretty pricy but maybe not for everyone and I don't have a waiter to help me if I need something or if I don't like cause I paid in advance and now I'm have to go up there figure it out etc. again the food it yummy . Sorry can't speak too much on the service because I don't really see anyone serving us. Cause they drop the food off and go . No one checks on you and see if you are enjoying anything.
5/10/2022,20220510,5,4.25,"Food is good, pastries are better! A great place for weekend breakfast or brunch. Beat the rush by arriving before 10:30. Dog friendly patio is a plus!"
5/11/2022,20220511,4,4.25,"Ordered Kimchi Fried Rice and Regular Breakfast and an assortment of pastries (chocolate Nutella bombolini which was the total bomb and the gluten free cheesecake which was so heavenly!). The ambiance was superb, main dishes were okay and I appreciate the valet service since this is an area where parking could be difficult. I just wish there was a way to serve customers faster without us having to queue like cattle waiting to be fed and led to the green land. It's also sad how chocolate croissants were sold out before lunch time and that's exactly why I chose this place for brunch. Sad, sad morning."
5/11/2022,20220511,4,4.25,"Got a chance to try the weekend brunch menu at Republique last Saturday!Fun fact: Margarita Manzke, one of the chefs/co-owners of Republique, was born and raised in the #represent Potato Pancake 7/10- Like a dense giant tater tot with lox on the top- The hollandiase and the runny egg acted as a dipping sauce which were pretty goodCroque Madame 4/10- Honestly tasted like a regular ham and cheese sandwich with an egg on top - Salad had a salty vinaigrette on the top and that was also aightKimchi Fried Rice 10/10- Did not expect this to be a brunch item but I get the hype and it's the best thing ever- Kimchi is not too aggressive with the sour fermented flavors and spice- The tiny pieces of short rib are like hidden gems of pure flavorShrimp and Grits ?/10- Solid buttery and cheesy grits- I just had a bite and couldn't evaluate the shrimp so I can't give it a valid scoreStrawberry Passion Fruit Cream Pie 10/10- This pie came with a thin crust just enough to hold the cream but I was still blown away by the flavor and how it's crumbliness suited the pie- Well balanced, not too sweet and not too tart and the texture was not overly decadent"
5/11/2022,20220511,5,4.25,"It's Republique. Excellent for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. The pastries are divine."
5/12/2022,20220512,1,4.24,This was my first time here. There is only communal seating. The restaurant was full and there were no seating available. I also felt very uncomfortable that people were so close.  I canceled my order and left.
5/14/2022,20220514,3,4.24,"We came here for weekday brunch. How it works here is you line up to order food and you got a number, then you grab your own table, food will be delivered to your table. This place is big, so it is not too difficult to find a table, but it's not a place you can spend a few hours to hang out with friends because people may be walking around and look for tables, you better go to a coffee shop.Food is good but not very unusual. Short Rib Sandwich is good but not wow. Also, Croque Madame is good but I had better one. One of my friend ordered the famous Kimchi Fried Rice....I wouldn't order it here as there are so many korean restaurant in LA. This is more of a fusion French restaurant.   Actually I think it is more famous of the pastry but we didn't have chance to try."
5/14/2022,20220514,5,4.24,"Amazing brunch spot near The Grove! I came here one morning for brunch before visiting LACMA, and was wowed by their delicious Croque Madame (5/5). I really enjoyed every part of the dish: they gave a good amount of ham and cheese; the egg was cooked perfectly for the dish, and the salad had a great seasoning. I also got a Vietnamese coffee on the side, and it was okay (3/5)."
5/14/2022,20220514,5,4.24,I don't think I've ever had a better French toast. Me and my girls were just in awe of how delicious it was. The kimchi fried rice and mushroom toast were also a big hit for my group. Also certain tables at this restaurant have EXCELLENT lightning for photos. Will be going back soon!!
5/14/2022,20220514,5,4.24,"My 3 college classmates and I had a brunch get together yesterday. Coffee tastes so good. Food is so delicious. We had potato pancake topped with lox, brioche French toast, Maine lobster omelette, croque madame, kimchi fried rice, and mango pie. We loved all of them."

5/15/2022,20220515,5,4.25,"Came to this place a week ago for the first time and it did not disappoint. Long lines but because they're so efficient we didn't wait long. We got three separate pastries : lime and passion fruit bar, market fruit brioche, and a raspberry passion fruit brioche. Lime and passion fruit bar was definitely the best, it had the strongest flavors. Three pastries and two iced coffees totaled to about $40. Ambiance is amazing I truly felt like I was stepping into a European cafe."

5/17/2022,20220517,5,4.25,"Brunch at République is always the best -- a must for both locals and visitors. The line can be long at times, finding seating can be a little chaotic, and the food and service can be quite slow, but it'll definitely be worth it! The vibes and food are amazing.The mushroom toast has a wild blend of textures and flavors. To complement a crunchy, crispy toast, fluffy and light scrambled eggs are delicately placed on top. The mushroom toast was flavorful and very rich.The avocado toast was also very good and lighter than the mushroom toast. I love how it wasn't just plain avocado, and the balance of the seasonings were just right.The cheesecake was the perfect way to end the meal. The basque cheesecake was so rich, creamy and delicate at the same time. The brown butter oatmeal raisin cookie was also so good. I highly recommend the pastries and desserts!"

I love the Kimchi Fried Rice at brunch/lunch, the baguette with pan drippings is a must to start dinner, and the arugula pasta was exceptional. Come in a group, order a lot, share everything, taste it all."

5/21/2022,20220521,5,4.25,Awesome brunch food options! Came here right before they closed and got sandwiches and lattes. The bakery was almost wiped clean. The staff was very friendly and responsive. Parking was a tough one and we ended up finding a street spot a few blocks out. Dog friendly and loved the outdoor patio!
5/22/2022,20220522,2,4.25,"We were visiting LA and made reservations for 8:30 pm so we could continue with our plans to explore and be out by 10:30 pm. The service was not it. It took them forever to take our order, we waited over 30 minutes between dishes and didn't get out till 11:30 pm. It ruined our entire night's plans. The food was good but hard to complement when the service experience was so disappointing."
5/23/2022,20220523,5,4.25,"I have a new love... but it's bitter sweet.. Sadly I depart today to head back to Seattle. I've been romanced, flirted with and consumed EVERYTHING!! I had the Lobster Omelet, we shared Bacon Steak drizzled with maple sweetness, berry danish, Vietnamese Hit Coffee and Mimosa. So I flirted with the Bacon Steak, romanced and devoured my Lobster Omelet - it was garnished with Hollandaise and had lobster, spinach and cheese in every bite! I consumed my delicious mimosa and not too sweet Vietnamese Hot Coffee... I can't wait to come back!"
5/25/2022,20220525,4,4.25,"Fantastic place for having breakfast. We had, regular breakfast and milk chocolate almond croissant. Both were delicious. You may wait for to sit but it worths."
5/26/2022,20220526,4,4.25,"It's a good place to chill and enjoy the sun (but they only have some tables with natural light, the tables inside are dark af). My favorite in Republique is Brioche French Toast (it's a must and the texture is like crunchy on the outside and soft but not soggy on the inside). Pupusa was okay like you can get it anywhere in a Cuban restaurant. But I have to say that the service is bad. They didn't get us knives until we called them over three times."
5/26/2022,20220526,5,4.25,The atmosphere was amazing! I loved the food! So tasty. I did not feel bloated. I didn't gain weight next day even though I ate so much bread. The inside looked like a castle. I am definitely visiting this place again!
5/27/2022,20220527,5,4.25,"This has become one of my favorite restaurants and is a must visit when in LA. Their bakery looks amazing and most of the reviews are for breakfast and lunch but we went for dinner. Our bill came out to be 300 dollars but we also ordered 4 cocktails which is probably why. The restaurant was in an awkward spot in the city so parking was very hard. Theres 2 hour parking spots around the restaurant but some of them you can only park after 7 pm. So make sure to make reservation after 7 for parking ease. I would recommend making reservation since it was relatively full considering we went on wednesday night. You cant make reservation for breakfast and brunch so remember this is for dinner only review.I would say the price point would be a high $$$ or even a $$$$ for dinner. Everything was cooked perfectly though and we thought worth the price. Our server was very polite and her recommendations were on point!! She did get so busy towards the end and we felt a little forgotten but dont think it affected much of the experience. If you are impatient, dont come hungry and come with someone youre comfortable to chit chat for a while, stay and enjoy the experience.We got the milk punch cocktail, amazing. 5/5 if you like coctails that doesn't taste like cocktails. Honestly I can drink this all day and still get buzzed. Loved it.For food we started with butter baguette since everyone reviewed it. The butter was soooo good but really how can u go wrong with butter. The bread are all you can eat but not the butter. We got like 3 baguette, we were out of butter by the 2nd baguette but just had bread with leftover sauces on our plates. I would say it helped with feeling full but nothing outstanding for me. 3.5/5. The gave us potato and leek soup on the house, it was good 4/5 wouldnt order it if its on the menu but also helped with fullness and goes pretty well with the baguette.We then ordered the white asparagus. Tender with a slight crunch, perfectly cheese and peppery. Not too outstanding but good, cooked perfectly. 4/5 would try something else next time though.The campanelle was next and it was the best dish on our table. The pasta was al dente with a perfect bite. The sauce was amaaaayyyzing went well with the baguette too. 5/5 will order again!Then we had the duck. My bf is not a duck person, i on the other hand Looooveee duck. I had duck at spruce in SF before which was pretty good. But my bf thought it was smelly and gamey. We did end up ordering duck here since i was really eyeing the duck and he didnt hate it. He liked it but not enough to win him over to the duck side but enough to appreciate it. Its only slightly gamey which I thought the chefs did well to mask it with the sweet sauce. I do not like the oatmeal and beets that went with it though so 3/5 well cooked but small portion and the sides are not great so will not order again. We then ordered strawberry tiramisu for dinner. If you love strawberry dessert you should get this. It was perfectly balanced of sweet and tart. Love love love it! 5/5Overall we enjoyed our dinner and we loved everything we got and already planning what we would try for our next trip."
5/28/2022,20220528,5,4.25,"an la institution. sure it might be overpriced. sure, some dishes might be mediocre for the value. The coffee isn't amazing and the food isn't overly creative. but there's something about republique, about sitting on these gorgeous tiles in the ambient open space of those arches, chatting with friends on those wooden benches over pastries and brunch. it's a must do in Los Angeles in my opinion. there's no ambience like it honestly. i don't think you necessarily go to republique for the food. rather, you go for the whole experience. and it's an airy and delightful one. you order at the front and pay first, so you have to make your decision before walking to the counter. although usually there is a line, so it gives you some time. then you take your number to a table and your food comes in a bit.parking is a little iffy, although I've usually been able to find street."
5/29/2022,20220529,3,4.25,"Not exactly what we're expecting for a place so highly rated. They ran out of steak because it didn't qualify to their standards so we tried the $20 burger, which was ok. Pastries were also ok, kimchee fried rice wasn't very interesting. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes."
5/29/2022,20220529,3,4.25,"There's always a long line but it moves fast. The ambiance is pretty with the skylight ceiling. The counter displays a delightful array of pastries. I have enjoyed their chicken and waffle and steak frites in the past but now that's not in their menu. I tried their short ribs sandwich but the taste of Dijon mustard overpowers the overall taste. For dessert, my fave are the double chewy chocolate cookies and the dulce de leche bombolini. I loved their buco pie but that's no longer available here. It is available in their other store at Sari sari at the downtown Grand Central market. Please bring back the chicken waffle and buco pie!"
5/31/2022,20220531,4,4.25,We went here with a very large group. The wait staff was very kind and attentive. They gave us a custom menu which was great. Two of us have dietary restrictions and they accommodated us perfectly. The food was really good. We had so much fun and so many courses it all seems like a blur! The front of house staff and wine consultant were both a tad rude. But overall the place was great. It's also beautiful!
5/31/2022,20220531,4,4.25,"REVIEW FOR BRUNCH ONLY:This is tough one. I really like the food at this place but I think there's some things to be aware of which is that 1, parking is so terrible in this area it's almost worth it to order ahead and just take out. 2, it's a cafe style restaurant despite being incredibly overpriced. So, order at the counter and sit down. I would have someone hop in line while someone else parks the car and then the person who parked go find a table as you get close to the front of the line. Otherwise, you won't get a seat and the line gets really long. There is also only 1 line for eating in and taking out if you order there which kind of sucks. The place is quite small though and I don't think they would even have room for 2 lines is the issue.For brunch I've had the croque madame, the breakfast sandwich, mushroom toast, and french omelette. The dishes are overpriced in my opinion but they're very good so this place would be more of an occasion brunch rather than an every day spot. They don't come with any sides, so you're just getting the main dish and that's it, for usually around $16-$24 a dish. The croque madame doesn't have any bechamel sauce which I thought was quite odd as that's kind of what makes a croque madame. My friends and I also got drinks, the creme brûlée latte, vanilla latte, and the blueberry banana smoothie. For all 3 of us with 3 entrees, 3 drinks, and 3 pastries, it was $124 total.I think the thing that I'd love to come back for are the pastries! They're so fresh and delicious and if you order ahead early enough you can have first pick so to speak and just grab them and go."
6/2/2022,20220602,5,4.25,"Friend took me here for dinner; it was fantastic!!food-unique & seems to be a revolving menu with a few staples. i personally love the duck dish in their ""fourth"" course. great flavors!!ambience- beautiful whether the airy front area or the moody romantic area in the back. parking- tough as its most street parking or valetservice- GREAT ABOVE AND BEYOND THEY EVEN BE POURING ME MORE WATER despite the bottle being at the table"
6/4/2022,20220604,2,4.25,"Oh Republiqe... Such a shame.What did we get for $600 (4 top?)?1. We arrived before our friends and asked to be seated at our table so we can start with coctails. Sounds reasonable no?  Well, guess not... Were told that it's their policy to have us stand in the corner like a couple idiots and wait for our friends instead of being seated. Why? It's their policy... So there!2. So friends arrive and were seated. Big man waiter has the dryest personality and rattles off his specials. Meh.  He seems like he's in a crappy mood, but whatever. 3. We get our food. I don't know the name, but we got some HORRIBLE fish dish served with strawberries... Wtf? Sooo nasty! Then we get 4 pieces in of tuna tartar for $50.  That's 4 tiny pieces for $50, are you insane? Was there gold hiding in there? Rest of food not memorable, although dessert was retry good. 4. So we leave $600 in cash and frumpy waitor tells us, we don't take cash. Huh? What year is this? I'm not paying in rubles bro... What do you mean?  I have to talk to manager and basically beg her to take our cash. They finally do as a big favor.So will we be back? Heck no. Employees seem stuck up and follow absolutely rediculous policies. Just silly. Wish I gave money to a restaurant that appreciates their patrons and deserves my money. Silly."
6/4/2022,20220604,5,4.25,Amazing food and super fresh and tasty. Strongly recommend the kimchi fried rice. Line up to order and your order is delivered to you. Heard the pastries are great but I didn't try it this time around.
6/4/2022,20220604,5,4.25,One of the best of the best in the city. It's truly worth the wait which I hate to wait but once you put your patience vest on-you will be so thrilled that you did. Please try the coconut old fashioned. It's beyond delightful.
6/5/2022,20220605,5,4.25,"First time here for Sunday brunch. No reservations. Line was long but not overly long. Waited about 15 mins before ordering. Right when you walk through the door you see a display glass with tons of delicious pastries and cakes. I felt pressure to pick and choose.. so If they had a list of baked goods, that would be helpful. But everything was good that I got. Ube bundt cake was good.For brunch, I got the the potato pancake with smoked salmon and the egg on too... soo good! The chia pudding was loaded with berries on top. I had plenty of leftovers. Valet parking available. $10 for Sunday morning. You can pay through you smart phone."
6/5/2022,20220605,5,4.25,This was the best food I've ate in LA!! Hands down! I LOVE THIS PLACE! Can't wait to go back!!! Just one word AMAZING! The kimchee rice was what I had and I can't stop thinking about it. That toast wasn't mine but I damn sure ate half of it lol. Then stuffed my face with those cupcakes/muffins whatever it was good!!! I wish you guys were on NY! It would be my regular spot!
6/5/2022,20220605,5,4.25,One of my Favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. The best bread and drinks. Nothing compares
6/6/2022,20220606,5,4.25,I've been coming here many times and love this place so much. I always come here for breakfast or lunch. My current favorite is cream brûlée Bomboloni and chia seed pudding! So good...:) There is valet parking too!
6/7/2022,20220607,5,4.26,"We went here for a birthday dinner and it blew our minds. The food was absolutely delicious. The main restaurant is indoors and tight quarters, not recommended for dogs, recommended to get reservations. Republique serves small plates, we recommend taking them family style as the dishes are all amazing and worth a try. The chef masterfully twists classic French flavors and techniques with seasonal California ingredients. The result is a fresh and rich flavor unique to the time and place. The atmosphere is extremely inviting while maintaining an upscale feel. The modern California vibes are definitely here but the restaurant is tasteful, it does not feel needlessly trendy and incorporates facets of the historic building. High ceilings allow the moderately sized restaurant to feel spacious and airy. The service is top quality. Wait staff are highly knowledgeable in the food and drink, and quicker to respond to guests' needs than many similarly priced restaurants in Los Angeles. Highly recommend!"
6/7/2022,20220607,5,4.26,Great food. Long line. Everything is great. Go early lease they start taking the baked goods away. :(
6/7/2022,20220607,4,4.26,Food was really good! We also tried the kimchii fried rice but i felt that the eggs and sourdough are better options to have
6/9/2022,20220609,2,4.25,"Food is mediocre, not too tasty. Price is a little high. Asked for a iced chai latte, they served it to me hot. Waiter said he will come out with a new one, the cup was still hot but the drink tasted like water from the ice. Paid a hefty amount just for watered down drinks and not so tasty food. The presentation was good but had to try to swallow my moneys worth. Youre probably paying just for ambience. Wouldn't come back.Food 1/5Ambience 4/5Drinks 0/5"
6/9/2022,20220609,3,4.25,Avocado toast was decent. Viet Coffee was good I really liked it.The inside of the place looks really pretty
6/9/2022,20220609,4,4.25,LOVED this restaurant. Ask to sit inside because the décor is killer and the patio is a little depressing. Dinner was amazing. Waitress and Some were outstanding. LOVED!!!
6/9/2022,20220609,5,4.25,Food is amazing! Don't be put off by the long lines. It goes fast. Just be ready to order. Also... you get whatever table is available so you may share space with others. The inside of it is gorgeous.
6/10/2022,20220610,5,4.25,"Definitely worth the hype! Delectable pastries, strong and fragrant coffee, distinctive and flavorful dishes. Did not disappoint. The interior is so cute! very aesthetically pleasing, staff was efficient and courteous and everything was very reasonably priced. Will be coming back."
6/11/2022,20220611,5,4.25,I almost didn't come here because the reviews made it seem like dinner wouldn't be great.We actually had a perfect meal. We shared everything with 5 people and it was such a good experience.Sit at the bar with this guy and he will make your experience amazing.We got these and I would recommend to get the same things:bread with pan drippingskanpachi crudobeef tartarewood fire oven paellacampanelle - the gram of truffle is worth!chocolate hazelnut operamelon milk punchI don't think you have to order these:arugula casareccecherrycelery
6/11/2022,20220611,4,4.25,"My brother and I came here for brunch on a Wednesday around 1 pm. It wasn't first time here as I haven't had the patience for braving the long weekend lines. Republique closes at 2 pm for brunch, so we only had an hour to eat after coming. We were seated immediately after coming and brought menus and water immediately. They have a varied menu with lots of great options. After first deciding on the quiche, another member of staff came and told me that they'd unfortunately sold out for the day. I selected the shakshouka instead.My shakshouka was brought out quickly, but my brother's omelette took a bit longer. Both of our items were really delicious. My brother's omelette was stuffed with lobster on the inside. It had a sauce drizzled over it that tasted like it was made with egg yolks, and a refreshing green salad on the side that counteracted the heaviness of the omelette. We both loved the food here. Service here was a little bit lacking - I found that some of the servers were abrupt and rude in their manner. I would come back another time if their lines weren't so long on the weekend."
6/11/2022,20220611,5,4.25,"One of my all time favorite LA restaurants. Absolutely gorgeous atmosphere - you feel like you're dining in a chapel in France. I love the pastas, and the celery cocktail is one of my favorites in the city."
6/11/2022,20220611,4,4.25,"Came here for a birthday celebration and it did not live up to the hype. It wasn't disappointing per se, but things were mixed. I'll explain: Food was good but you need to know what to order. There seems to be no consistency on how well prepared some dishes are vs. others. Flavors balance worked in some instances, in others it was bleh. One dish was the pasta puttanesca and it was not enjoyable. The anchovies bring flavor, but this one seemed to be drenched in the anchovies oil/water from the can. The capers were almost not present. Yet the pasta al olio was great. The bread is also good as well as the butter. So... check the menu and the reviews and take the risk if you desire. Service is great though. If anything, that's why I give the four stars. If I were to review solely on food, three at most."
6/13/2022,20220613,1,4.25,Considering we spent over $60 for breakfast for two people I can't believe the a**holes wouldn't bring us a second coffee cup to share the small pot of coffee one of us had ordered. Food was not worth the price
6/13/2022,20220613,5,4.25,"A lot of businesses struggled during the pandemic, Republique just seemed to thrive! Obsessed with outdoor seating options here and love the customer experience here. It's so painless to order and pay for pastries and food upon entering versus waiting for servers to wait on your order. It's just such a no nonsense approach to dining. Then the food is absolutely extraordinary! Love that you can barely make any modifications to the dishes here, more people should enjoy food the way the chef intended. Seriously one of my favorite spots for breakfast but for all the meals!!"
6/16/2022,20220616,5,4.25,"Service, atmosphere was perfect. With valet parking being so convenient made parking easy. Upon entering I was greeting by friendly staff to wait for the rest of my party. We were seated promptly and were attended to quickly. We didn't feel pressure to order right away. We were able to have a cocktail and relax. I highly suggest the spicy margarita. We order the pate to start and it was a great indicator on how our dinner will be. Fresh ingredients and beautiful display of each plate was much appreciated. Highlight was the roasted vegetable I could have several bowls. Will be be returning soon."
