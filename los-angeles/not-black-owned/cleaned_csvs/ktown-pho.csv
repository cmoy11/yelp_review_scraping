2/22/2017,20170222,5,5.0,"DELICIOUS food! I've tried many pho spots around LA, and this is the most authentic pho by far. The owners were extremely kind and were super informative about the dishes. We will definitely be back for more!"
2/24/2017,20170224,5,5.0,I've eaten Pho all my life and this is the best pho ive ever had. Their meat melts in your mouth! I highly recommend this place!
2/25/2017,20170225,5,5.0,Best pho ever! The owner is super friendly. The place was extremely clean. The Thai ice tea was awesome! sweet and delicious. The first thing I notice was that the pho broth look different bc other place I've been to the broth is clear so when I had a spoonful it was out of this world! It was so flavorful... so good. Will be back
2/26/2017,20170226,5,5.0,Very authentic flavors! Happy that KTown finally has a great Vietnamese and pho restaurant. Owners are super nice and helpful. Parking lot in the backMy new go-to place in LA for pho!
2/26/2017,20170226,5,5.0,A real Vietnamese pho joint in ktown! Very nice owners and great food! Top quality ingredients and super tasty. It's highly recommended instead of all the other Korean pho joints that have watered down broth and so so quality ingredients locally.
3/5/2017,20170305,5,5.0,"I'm not really a big fan of pho but when I'm forced to eat it, this is the only place I'll go. Boyfriend begged for some pho so I had to give in. Decided to check this place out since it was labeled under ""hot and new"". It's a cute little restaurant owned by the sweetest guy, KT! This guy genuinely cares about making sure the service and food are beyond expectation. Really added something to the dining experience. Boyfriend got pho and I ordered the seafood crispy noodles. Both were SO delicious. Their pho differs from every pho restaurant in koreatown because this is some legit-ass Vietnamese pho. The pho broth was so perfect! Even I loved it and I don't even like pho. The seafood crispy noodle was also just as amazing. This place is great. That's all I really need to say. There's finally some real, good pho in koreatown! Highly recommend everyone to check this place out. I will definitely be going back!!"
3/6/2017,20170306,5,5.0,The owner of this place is so nice and caring. They make sure you have a great meal. The quality of the meat is superb. And the aesthetics of the place is really comforting.You wouldn't expect it when you're outside the restaurant. They have free wifi too. I def really like this place. Would recommend for so many reasons! (:
3/7/2017,20170307,5,5.0,"This place is sooooo delicious! I came here 2 times with coworkers during lunch. Prices are reasonable, friendly service and quality is top! The 4 season rolls are my favorite. So far, I had the fried chicken with fried rice, spicy ox tail noodle soup and the Vietnamese iced coffee. Definitely coming back this week"
3/9/2017,20170309,5,5.0,Cleanest pho restaurant you'll find in Ktown. Surprisingly nice presentation on pho and bahn mi. Owner is very attentive over the whole operation and service is awesome.
3/11/2017,20170311,5,5.0,New Pho shop in Koreatown. Very clean and the owner's  very welcoming.Had the Bun Bo Hue - flavorful beef and shrimp paste broth with generous portions of different meat. They have chili oil you can add for the extra kick. The dish was very tastyWill definitely come back to try their Kobe beef Pho and other dishes. The food here is worth trying. Definitely recommend.
3/12/2017,20170312,5,5.0,"First and foremost customer service here is A1. I really enjoyed speaking with the people here. They were just so nice! And so cool! I decided to get a quick bite for dinner. I ordered fresh spring rolls (hold the pork). I plan on going back and getting more off of their menu. Until then, this establishment gets a big thumbs up from me!"
3/14/2017,20170314,5,5.0,"Seriously the best pho in a 10 mile radius. I'm from the east coast where we have some of the best Pho. When I moved here I was disgusted by the quality of Pho in LA. Met the chef KT and after a few exchange of words I knew this place was different. He knows his stuff. This place is actually run by a native, as opposed to the Korean owned places. I'm Korean, and I hate Korean owned pho. The moment he said ""This area can't handle the real strong authentic flavors, so I rolled it back to help them acclimate"" I was sold. Tasted the broth, and it was exactly that. Could have been stronger as I preferred, but I could taste the true broth flavor. Only had their summer rolls that had a nice wonton surprise in each bite. And thankfully it isn't just stuffed with noodles. They were great! Anyways, KT if you're reading this, who cares if the area can't acclimate. I say you go 110% and bring out the true flavor you know is the best. This area deserves some real pho whether they can ""handle it"" or not. If else, you just get the watered down nonsense like the rest of the pho places around here. If my clothes don't stink after a bowl of pho it ain't good, just like Korean BBQ"
3/17/2017,20170317,5,5.0,"My first yelp review goes to this awesome new little pho restaurant in ktown. I've tried pho from all around Los Angeles, and I have to say this place is one of my favorites, and definitely the top pho in ktown. All the food is made fresh and the pho broth is flavorful and delicious. The pork banh mih is also one of the best ones I've had. The owner is delightfully nice and cares about his customers. The place itself is clean and quaint. Parking is a little weird, but there is a small lot in the back behind the restaurant. Highly recommend this place!"
3/19/2017,20170319,5,5.0,"I have died and gone to heaven.FINALLY, a REAL authentic Vietnamese restaurant to further cement K-Town's place as the most delicious neighborhood in LA! Not only is the grub kickass legit Vietnamese at excellent prices, but service is top notch AND there's even free parking (a tiny, slightly sketchy looking lot in the alley behind the building) to boot!I called a few minutes after their official 8pm closing time, and KT and team actually stayed open just to accommodate us. Can you believe it?From then on, everything was absolute perfection from the super friendly and prompt service to the incredibly fresh and tasty food. Hot and crispy cha gio (fried spring rolls) served the proper way with lettuce leaves for wrapping, a deliciously loaded bowl of bun cha noodles, the deep flavorful beef broth of my meatball pho... I ordered a large and DRANK EVERY DROP of the soup, no joke. I think we're gonna be here every week. Can't wait to come back and try their signature wagyu pho!Part of me wants Jonathan Gold to discover this little family business and help it fly off the charts, and the other selfish part of me hopes that never happens so we can still get a table easily. All I can say is go now, while it's still under the radar."
3/22/2017,20170322,5,5.0,"Ktown Pho is the most authentic pho you can get in koreatown and probably all of Los Angeles. The broth is super flavorful and all the meat they use is seems good quality unlike the meat at other ktown pho places. Their springs are really really delicious, lots of meat and veggies unlike other places that give 2 tiny pieces of meat. Service was just as amazing as their food."
3/23/2017,20170323,5,5.0,"Delicious food, super friendly service, clean atmosphere. I ordered the combination vermicelli which had a perfect blend of savory and healthy fare. There's a small parking lot I the back. If you're eating in, enter the restaurant via the second door on the right. Definately my favorite vietnamese food in koreatown!"
3/23/2017,20170323,5,5.0,"The best tasting pho you will find in Koreatown. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue which was flavorful and not watered down like some places which do quantity over quality. I saw an earlier review that said this was a Korean Pho place but the owners aren't Korean and none of the dishes have a Korean twist. The owner is also super welcoming and nice, definitely recommend trying out this place."
3/23/2017,20170323,5,5.0,"These people are the sweetest. I have an unusual and strong food allergy (white sugar). After working with me on the menu (Vietnamese food mostly has little bits of sugar in everything), the chef made me up a special sauce for the fresh spring rolls made with honey (which I'm ok with). Such excellent service!"

3/23/2017,20170323,5,5.0,"Woops reviewed the wrong place dunno how to delete this one. Choi oi! We tried to go here and it was closed, so we went to another place and I thought I was reviewing it because yelp suggested to review this one. You get a 5* for the mistake and clarification until I make my way out there again for lunch. :) Real Vietnamese people running a pho restaurant in Ktown is just what we need."
3/23/2017,20170323,5,5.0,"This place is soooooooo good that we have been coming here once a week! Pho, rice, and appetizer dishes are delicious. The coffee is very strong and i love it! Service is friendly as usual. Hieu, we are coming again for lunch today!"
3/24/2017,20170324,5,5.0,New favorite pho restaurant! Food and service were excellent. So good. Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu like the vermicelli noodles and banh mi.
3/25/2017,20170325,5,5.0,Great service!!! And so accommodating to dietary restrictions!!! I am vegan and I had a great meal here!!!
3/26/2017,20170326,5,5.0,"Great customer service, food was great and for having it in a small section it looked pretty nice."
3/27/2017,20170327,5,5.0,New spot! Great quality & family owned! I can see this place being the next big thing in K-Town!
3/28/2017,20170328,5,5.0,"I've been looking for a good local Vietnamese restaurant and I'm so happy with this new addition in K Town.The restaurant is small but it's very clean and not stuffy. The presentation of the food is on point.We ordered egg rolls, Bun Bo Hue and Crispy Egg Noodle (combination). Everything was so delicious, hot and fresh. Thai tea was excellent too. The owner is very attentive and very nice. We definitely will be your loyal customers."
3/28/2017,20170328,5,5.0,What the heck is this place!?!? I am so glad to find here to eat pho! Here's noodle menu are so delicious and I never feel food coma after eating. Server was so enthusiastic and warm. I already go there like four times with my friends but never disappointed yet. Their thai drinks are really gooooood. You don't have to worry about drink after meal. Just sit tight and order thai tea. You could feel difference with other places. Two thumbs up!!!!
3/30/2017,20170330,5,5.0,"Some serious good pho! The owner is super friendly and courteous. Highly recommended. The owners are actually Vietnamese, that's a rare find in town. Good job!"
3/31/2017,20170331,5,5.0,I love the beef and seafood fried rice! This is my 2nd time here and will be coming back for more. KT the owner is awesome!
3/31/2017,20170331,5,5.0,"As a disclaimer, I like Pho 2000, Pho 24, etc. decently enough like everyone else, but Ktown Pho is a step up - a new Vietnamese restaurant in Koreatown that actually serves high quality food. I'm so used to pho having tough, bland beef that I was actually surprised at how tender and flavorful the beef in the House Special was; the broth was very rich as well. This was overall the best pho dish I've ever had in LA. We also ordered the eggrolls, which were served piping hot with amazing dipping sauce on the side. They were extremely crispy and juicy, and were absolutely delicious when wrapped with lettuce and cucumber. The owner was really friendly and attentive, and didn't mind that we came in close to closing. I noticed some reviewers liked his attentiveness and some didn't, but the food definitely speaks for itself."
4/2/2017,20170402,5,5.0,"This place was excellent! So happy we found it, everyone received their meals quickly, the owners were kind and courteous, the restaurant itself was calm and quiet serving as a good environment to calmly sit down and eat in. The food was all delicious with reasonable prices for good sized portions."
4/3/2017,20170403,5,5.0,"I was craving Pho when I landed in town yesterday! So today, before I went back to my hotel, and since I was in Korean town, I had to Yelp & see where I should try. This is a corner little spot that I probably would've never stopped at if it wasn't for Yelp. A local ""hole in the wall"" spot, if you will. Parking in the back of the building, but I decided to park on the street. Walked into the front part, which is for take out & was escorted to the back where they have the cutest little setup. Clean, appropriate decor & my favorite part, a tv with their native music playing. Loved that! The service was on point. So friendly & welcoming. He offered to recommend, but my heart was set on Pho already. Ordered the House Special Pho & crispy spring rolls. Yuuuuuummmmyy!!! A huge piece of delicious tender beef steak, oodles of noodles, all the freshness that's served on the side, added a little chili and my life was complete. Crispy spring rolls were good and I ate them ALL!!! Delicious food! Great service! Do your belly a favor & go and get you some!!!"
4/3/2017,20170403,4,4.97,"Seriously a great little cafe.We met our friends at this place upon their suggestion. It's a nice, small cafe and the owners are very sweet.I am a Pho fan and I will say that Marjie likie this Pho better than any in Los Angeles.We ordered a few other items. But ask me if I remember the names because I don't! Everything was yummi though. Whatever it's called. Lol."
4/5/2017,20170405,5,4.97,"it is THE BEST vietnamese restaurant in LA area!!!food was AWESOME, AND SO FLAVORFUL!!!!and their thai iced tea --- OMG it was like the creamiest thai iced tea i've ever tasted!! their bun bo hue was also one of the best!!!we had such an amazing experience coming to this restaurant today!i highly recommend for those who havent come and tried this place out, please come and check it out!i guarantee you wont regret it ;)and also, the owner is super friendly - he makes our restaurant experience a lot better just by being friendly and attentive!thank you KTOWN PHO for giving us one of the best pho experience in LA"
4/5/2017,20170405,5,4.97,"Great Bun Bo Hue. The owner mentioned that the people in the area avoided eating the cubes of congealed pig blood and pig knuckles when they originally served the dish, and so they took them out and added extra beef shanks instead. This was perfect as those were the two things that I didn't like about Bun Bo Hue. Broth was clean and well balanced, and my bowl was bone dry at the end. I would definitely come back just for this dish."
4/6/2017,20170406,5,4.97,"Hands down the best pho place in Koreatown, if not in LA. Run by friendly Vietnamese folks, Ktown Pho offers authentic pho, excellent service, and free wifi :)I will return to try other dishes and boba!"
4/7/2017,20170407,5,4.97,"Amazing pho and a welcome addition to Ktown. Ordered the seafood pho which was delicious, and their thai iced tea was some of the best I've had in a while. The owner is incredibly friendly and helpful too. The place also gets bonus points for having MODERN pos cashier systems (i.e. they use Square on their smartphones and are 100% paperless). Most small, hole-in-the-wall type restaurants in Ktown have minimum requirements when it comes to using credit cards, as well as the type of credit card they take (good luck with an Amex or Discover card), so it's just refreshing that you don't have to worry about any of that nonsense with Ktown Pho. Will definitely make this my go-to pho place in town."
4/7/2017,20170407,5,4.97,"Great staff, clean space, and best of all, delicious pho and bahn mi! Try the house special with kobe beef-delicious!"
4/11/2017,20170411,5,4.97,"Discovered this place from ""Hot and New"" It was a nice little spot for some great quality pho. I had a Central Vietnamese style soup noodle that comes with rice noodles. It's flavor packed and with combination of beef and pork."
4/11/2017,20170411,4,4.95,"This place recently opened up close to my job and I am so happy it did. Vietnamese cuisine by actual Vietnamese people. I've tried the Beef Brisket Pho Noodle soup and it was very good. On another day, I was on a budget and tried the Beef sandwich and was surprised at how delicious it was and for such a great price. The place is clean and the people are very courteous."
4/14/2017,20170414,5,4.95,"The bomb dot com. So good that I thought I was over pho (turned off by the slop buckets most pho places utilize, tbh), but now will begin eating it here on the reg.First time I went 30 til closing, all they had was chicken pho ($8.49). The meat is sketchy, and I do not recommend. :(Went tonight and not only was the courteous service top-notch (I was offered WiFi and everything!), the beef pho was the best pho I've had--maybe ever.The House pho ($13.49) does have superior meat, but not so sure it's $5 better than more ordinary beef pho soups. I liked my large pho tai ($8.49). The meat was fresh and tender. The broth was bursting with complex, soul-warming flavors. The oil glistened on the surface quite gorgeously. The noodles even tasted superior compared to other pho places--and, yes, they were perfectly cooked. You truly cannot go wrong with either of these two soups. Highly recommend!!The pork banh mi ($5) is another must-try. Flavorful, decent size, great pork, nice bun, with all the accoutrements. Highly recommend!!Ktown Pho is my new one and only pho place. Hip hip hurrah! I am too amped."
4/15/2017,20170415,4,4.93,"Its the best bowl of pho you can get in ktwon for sure. Broth is clean and simply good. I also like how sprouts and basil is fresh. Its difficult to find pho this good in Ktown. Just wish they would put tendons in their pho combo. Clean nondescript place with excellent service. My mom, who is very picky with Pho also loved it! I wouldn't say its as good as my favorite pho places in s.cal (Súp noodle bar, golden deli) or pho bat dan or pho thin in Hanoi but when I'm craving pho in Ktown this will be my go to place."
4/15/2017,20170415,5,4.93,"This place is so good! The banh mi are on crispy French bread and super flavorful, and the grilled pork vermicelli noodles are also amazing. The prices are super reasonable and the owner is very friendly. The layout of the place is kind of weird, there's a front room where you order but if you want to eat in, you're taken around to the back where it has more of a restaurant feel. Unfortunately I moved away from Koreatown so I can't go there easily anymore, but if I still lived there I would probably go there once a week at least. I highly recommend giving it a shot!"
4/15/2017,20170415,5,4.93,Finally good viet food in koreatown. So much better than all the other pho places here
4/16/2017,20170416,5,4.93,"Koreatown does not offer good options for Pho. But KTOWN PHO DONE DID IT.I grew up in OC, so I know that authentic Vietnamese taste. Hungover, what's new - I was told that this spot is bomb. So, I went.The spot is super small. We ordered the Pho Tai, Spring Rolls, and the Cold Cut Banh Mi. You know a spot is good when the vegetable is fresh. My Pho came out and it looked delicious. I was excited to try the soup, and yes, it was GREAT. So much flavor. I thought I was in Westminster or something.The Banh Mi was super fresh. The spring rolls were awesome. The owner is extremely friendly!I found my new Vietnamese joint in Koreatown!"
4/16/2017,20170416,5,4.94,"This is the Vietnamese restaurant that LA has been looking for!Authentic, reasonably priced and made by Vietnamese people. The folks behind the counter are humble and concentrated on making a meal that you'll enjoy without gouging your wallets. They will serve you with a smile.Get the Bun Bo Hue - This rich beef noodle soup is the alternative to pho and very hard to find in LA.  It can be as spicy or mild as you want it to be. Just let them know. And eat it quickly since the bowls don't keep the soup hot for very long.The shaken beef is probably the cheapest I've seen at less than $12 which I think is nice to get if you're not craving a noodle dish. The nem nuong spring rolls are amazing, but I wish they served the dipping sauce hot (like Brodard in the OC) though that's just a personal preference.I've recommended this place to all my friends and they are visiting in swarms! Let's keep this place in business! There is a need and a demand and Ktown Pho has the winning recipe!"
4/16/2017,20170416,5,4.94,"I was recently in Koreatown and saw a sign that says Ktown Pho. I looked it up on Yelp and saw that it has great reviews.So I went in to have lunch. It's a small place with 8 tables but it was packed, which is a good sign. I ordered the oxtail pho noodle soup and spring rolls. It was really delicious although I think it would have been better if the fat around the oxtail meat was trimmed a little more and a couple of more pieces in the bowl would have been nice. A friendly young couple owns the place and I am glad I ate there because I am always about supporting small business owners! Parking is a bit of a hassle if you go there during peak times. If you get there early enough you can park behind the building where the parking lot fits about 8-10 cars tightly.I would go again if I'm in Ktown, so should you!"
4/17/2017,20170417,4,4.92,"This place was great! There's parking but it's super tight - we ended up at a metered spot right across the street. Service is friendly and attentive, even though there was a slight mix up with the timing with our appetizers coming out after our entrees. I had the chicken pho, which was delicious. Atmosphere was actually lovely (except for two cops loudly talking about violent arrests they'd made recently), kpop music videos playing on the television. Definitely anticipate coming back, but hope it's not a cop hangout."
4/18/2017,20170418,5,4.92,"Hands down the best pho place in ktown. Authentic Vietnamese pho. I love pho and I've tried other pho places in the area (pho legends, pho 2000, pho 87, thank you pho, simply pho you, etc...) and this is by far the best.I tried the pho dac biet and bun bo hue. They're both delicious and flavorful. The food rivals OC/Westminster pho. The place is a bit small but very clean. The owner is very friendly. Good service."
4/19/2017,20170419,5,4.92,"Wow, like everyone said, this place is really great. Will only go to this Pho place from now on. I think they'll need to expand the restaurant soon"
4/21/2017,20170421,5,4.92,I don't even live here and I've been back 4 times lol (today will be my fourth) Pho is really goodService is awesome Bun bo hue just needs the blood Other than that it's superrrrr good and authentic. I like it better than any other pho spot in ktown! 5 stars
4/22/2017,20170422,5,4.92,Best Pho I've EVER had!!! I've had dreams about this pho every night since I first ate it!!!
4/23/2017,20170423,5,4.93,"EDIT: Honestly, I changed it to 5 stars because I know how dedicated the owner is to providing the best experience possible to his customers. He really deserves to be at a better location with a bigger kitchen - someone help him out!Amazing authentic pho in ktown. You can taste the love and passion infused in the food. Whoever is making it in the back is godly!!!!! They also have a variety of other options, vermicelli, bun bo hue, broken rice, 4 different types of rolls AND fried egg rolls, banh mi, and more. Service is really good, but it's a small shop run by literally one guy (the owner), so don't expect speedy service like at most pho restaurants. He is super nice but can sometimes be a little too nosy for my own preference. Also parking is in the back next to a ton of garbage."
4/23/2017,20170423,5,4.93,"Wagyu beef pho was amazing! Meat was tender, soup was flavorful yet not too oily. Server was awesome and extremely welcoming and attentive. Made recommendations and was very accommodating even though it was busy and he was running the whole floor. Would definitely recommend!"
4/23/2017,20170423,5,4.93,"I only review a place if I have something nice to say. If I don't like a place, I just don't review it. I have eaten at every Vietnamese restaurant in ktown and this place is, by far, the best. The broth is very rich. It's obvious they do not skimp on the bone and seasoning unlike the other nearby restaurants who warm up Korean bone broth, add cilantro, iceberg lettuce, and call it ""pho.""If you're looking for something different, I'd recommend bun bo hue - tangy, spicy, fishy, stinky. They make it really well here. The price is fair and portions are light. I have yet to find a pho restaurant that has a ""large"" that is actually large. Typical ktown parking."
4/24/2017,20170424,5,4.93,"FINALLY awesome pho in LA!!!Ktown Pho has repeatedly popped up in my Yelp recommendations as a ""hot new business."" I am always on the prowl for good Vietnamese food closer to home but always find myself disappointed and faced with the daunting task of driving across the city to the 626 or Westminster for a decent bowl of pho.Ktown Pho offers 626 quality pho (perhaps even better!) in the heart of LA. I have had the house special kobe beef style pho and it was one of the most satisfying broths I've ever had. I often find myself adding an obscene about of hoison and sriracha to my broth to give it enough flavor, but NOT at Ktown Pho. The broth is perfectly seasoned and savory AS IS, I hardly needed to add anything. The owners are Vietnamese so everything tastes authentic. I love that they offer a generous platter of herbs, lemon and bean sprouts.The spring rolls are also ON POINT. My mom, Empress Ming, is a self proclaimed connoisseur of goi cuon, and agrees that these are just right. I have seen her chuck a bad spring roll to the side at many Vietnamese restaurants, but she inhaled these and we had to fight for the last piece. There is an art to wrapping the perfect spring roll and Ktown Pho has it down. The shrimp is super fresh, the pork is thinly sliced, the lettuce is crunchy and I love that they add a sliver of fried wonton to give it more texture. The peanut dipping sauce is full of flavor, though I always prefer nuoc cham. I love that their fish sauce is not too potent and garlicky and has just the right amount of citrus.The menu offers traditional Vietnamese fare and is not particularly extensive--mostly pho, vermicelli, rice dishes and bun bo hue. However, the few items they do offer are done right. Parking is convenient in the lot behind the strip mall and service is very attentive!"
4/24/2017,20170424,4,4.91,Great pho and a good price. I wish they gave more of the basil/sprouts/jalapeños without having to ask for more but the soup was overall flavorful and the host (maybe owner?) was super friendly and talkative. Will come again.
4/24/2017,20170424,5,4.92,Best Bun Bon Hue I've had outside of Vietnam and/or my gf's mother's house. Really friendly staff and we were seated and served very quickly. We will definitely be going back to Ktown Pho!
4/25/2017,20170425,5,4.92,"Browsing on my Instagram (the power of social media), I saw that a new pho restaurant opened up Koreatown. Not only that it was new but it was Vietnamese owned! There are a few pho restaurants in and around Koreatown and all of them are Korean owned and operated. Their take on Vietnamese dishes is of their own interpretation and most menus incorporated various Korean dishes as well. These places are decent but not never hit the spot. K-Town Pho is a game-changer.K-Town Pho is located on Western and Monette. There is parking in the back and some street parking available. If you walk in from the front, stay left and you'll see the entrance The staff is very friendly and helpful. I've tried the following dishes:1. Bun thit nuong cha gio - Vermicelli Noodles with pork and egg rolls2. Goi cuon - Spring rolls with pork and shrimp3. Com thit nuong cha - RIce dish with pork and egg/pork cake4. Banh Mi Thit Nguoi - Banh mi with cold cutsEverything I ate was on point. The pork in both the rice and noodle dish was very flavorful. The banh mi was consisted of all the proper ingredients - meats, pickled veggies, etc. The spring rolls were good and most importantly the peanut sauce was not a diluted version. Ultimately you know what the true judge of a good Vietnamese place is? The fish sauce! The fish sauce was perfect - not too watered down and not too salty. Just as mom would make it.I hate writing such a good review for K-Town Pho being that it's starting to get pretty crowded but the folks there do Vietnamese food right."
4/26/2017,20170426,5,4.92,"I'm obsessed ! Extremely affordable and incredible customer service. Banh mi #1, pho #1 and the Thai iced tea, you're welcome **walk to the back for additional seating and you'll never have to wait!"
4/27/2017,20170427,5,4.92,I am from nor cal and I used to eat pho in Oakland with my friends... so I know what good pho should taste like but this place is hands down one of the best pho places in ktown! I hope they will do well!!!
4/29/2017,20170429,2,4.87,"-Update to respond to Owner: Yes, I did order spring rolls. You took my order and you said, ""one spring roll ok"". If you didnt charge me for it and didn't make it, that's fine, but I did order it. Seeing other reviews here, it seems I'm not the only person who has had their order messed up. As to the Oxtail, you need to make enough to keep it on your menu, otherwise take it off. Finally, if the take out portions are the same size as the dine in then you're not giving enough food to the dine in customers too. Seeing as you forgot half of my order you can understand why I didn't think it was enough food.Came in this evening to order take out. The dish I was looking forward to, the oxtail pho, was sold out. Fine I'll order something else. After getting my order, I came home to find out that the not only did they forget to include the spring rolls I ordered and paid for, but the noodle bowls are soo SMALL! Are these kids sizes? This is not ok!It seems this place has bribed some elites with free food so don't trust the star rating. Definitely not worth the cost and hassle. Avoid!"
4/29/2017,20170429,5,4.88,Vietnamese owned pho shop in ktown with a back parking lot(its small but it's there)?! Dreams do come true! Delicious pho and bahn mi sandwiches! Excellent service and super kind and passionate owners. I'm not Vietnamese but it sure feels like home! I totally forgot my wallet in my other purse but thank god they accept Apple Pay! PHEW! I'll be back soon :)
4/29/2017,20170429,5,4.88,This place is so delicious! Didn't think I'd find a spot like this in Ktown. Also the staff and owner is very friendly and personable. Makes me feel like I'm in a home away from home. And the prices are an incredible deal!
4/30/2017,20170430,3,4.85,"Ordered online for take out over the weekend. This used to be Belly & Snout and is located on Western and Olympic. I've noticed all the Vietnamese restaurants in Ktown are Korean owned so I was pleased to find that this one is actually Vietnamese! It's a pretty small place so I wouldn't recommend dining in - there's a few tables inside and a small bar seat area in the lobby (it's a weird building).NEM NUONG CUON | $6.49AKA their summer rolls with grilled pork, crispy shrimp roll, and assorted veggies. I really liked these! On par with Brodard's and they even serve the shrimp-based sauce with it. Comes with three, generous sized rolls.COM SUON NUONG | $7.49Grilled pork chop with broken rice. My boyfriend got this and seemed to like it, but he said there wasn't a ton of meat. The broken rice was really good.BUN THIT NUONG | $8.49Grilled pork with vermicelli. This is my go-to dish whenever I get Vietnamese food. This one was just OK. The meat tasted different - not as charbroiled as I like and reminded me more of Korean marinated meat. Still tasty, but just not what I'm used to for this dish. The assorted veggies were really fresh. The fish sauce was on the milder side - I think I prefer my fish sauce a little fishier, haha.As for service, they did mess up our order but were very friendly and apologetic about it. They seemed understaffed and things were really hectic in the kitchen so I let it go. Overall this place is not bad especially since all the good Vietnamese places are further in the SGV area. We live walking distance from here so we will most likely come back!"
5/1/2017,20170501,4,4.84,"Was hungry for Pho noodles and spotted this 4+ rated restaurant on Yelp. Finding the place and parking was a challenge, but food made it worth while. Had chicken pho, spring rolls and took couple of pork Bah Mi sandwiches to go.All items were good, but my favorite was sandwiches which we had later that evening!Living on West Side, trek to OC is too much for authentic pho prepared Vietnamese style. No other fusion version would do.The owner is Vietnamese and his family is running the place. They work hard to keep up, but service can be spotty. Because the owner is so sensitive to that shortcoming, he is apologetic and it becomes non issue. Parking can be difficult!"
5/2/2017,20170502,4,4.82,"Exactly what it says when you give some place 4 stars. Yay! I'm a fan!!! As to the details it might be a bit different than other reviewers. I don't know what bun bo hue is supposed to taste like nor do I know what pho ""SHOULD"" taste like but I DO know what I like and what I don't like.I DON'T LIKE bland bun bo hue or pho. I LOVE oxtail. KTWON PHO combined everything I liked and mashed it into one scrumptious bowl. I got the Bun Bo Hue with oxtail ... oh jeez. I went back the next week .. not the next day because that's just too much more for haha!The fish sauce in the bun bo definitely caught me off guard but I still managed to devour through the bowl....and then regret for doing so. I ordered the shrimp summer rolls on top of the bun bo KNOWING I am CLEARLY and EXTREMELY too full.... yes gluttony is a sin... *sigh* ....but I couldn't resist.I told my friend ""let's order one and share next time"" didn't happen... I ordered oxtail again and guzzled it all...by myself.... and ate my friends eggrolls inside his vermicelli .... UGH hahaThe place is pretty small but they have a togo side and a dine-in side so it divides the place pretty well. The service is excellent, EXTREMELY friendly and pretty fast. I'll probably be back....this saturday. HAHHA"
5/5/2017,20170505,5,4.83,Ate pho. All over the World!!!Hands down . The best pho place. You can tell by just looking at the owner of the place.  They care.. what they are putting out to their customers.. Clean. And deep..Love it..
5/6/2017,20170506,5,4.83,Wagyu beef pho is amazing! Clean and the owner is extremely friendly and makes great recommendations.
5/6/2017,20170506,3,4.8,"The soup is OK. The noodle is not chewy. It is kind of disappointing having the noodle like this. The spring roll is OK. I would prefer larger shrimps, even if with higher prices. Total experience should be 3.5 stars. Since the food is not pricy, I choose to give 4 stars."
5/6/2017,20170506,5,4.81,"On a Saturday afternoon of errands, I had a craving for pho. It's a treat for me since my husband dislikes it -- ""typically brown mystery water with low grade meat"". After visiting this spot, I can am definitely dragging the hubby here for a wonderful bowl of clean flavors, delicious meat and quality ingredients. Spring rolls were exceptional too. The food is the star but I found the staff so endearing and attentive too. It was busy and they were hustling and yet I still felt super taken care of. Suggestion, either go at an off time or be prepared to wait. I'm not the only one that is loving this spot!"
5/7/2017,20170507,5,4.81,"Came here this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised. It's sort of hidden - if you enter from the front, take the second door, not the first.Let me start off by saying that I loved our waiter - he was fast and funny. We were quickly seated and when our waiter saw that we had an infant car seat with us, he quickly flipped over a toddler's highchair to fit the car seat between the legs of the chair. I ordered the #2 from the phos with the oxtail. The broth is soooooo good - clean, flavorful and with lots of depth. The owners are actually Vietnamese - rare in ktown - and you can tell. I didn't have to add sriracha or hoisin sauce to liven up the broth!!! Oh, and can't forget about the meat: tender and plentiful. Good pho for less than $10. WORTH.I'll definitely be coming back here for my pho fix!"
5/7/2017,20170507,5,4.81,Was looking for a pho restaurant while traveling LA. It was a very good choice!!! Awesome menu and very friendly staff. Loved all the recommendation. The only thing is parking. Go little early to look for parking! Definitely check this place out for pho
5/8/2017,20170508,4,4.8,"Yum! I really liked this place, I think I found the best pho place to go to in Ktown area. Me and my friend came here the morning/afternoon after Cinco de Mayo lol. You already know we needed that pho! You have to find street parking which is kind of a bummer, but it wasn't too hard to find so we didn't have to struggle too much. I can only imagine coming here at night though, parking would be very difficult! Anyway, as soon as you walk in there's the front where there is a cash register and two seating areas~ However, there is much more seating behind and bar seating on the side as well. It is kind of a weird set up, but they used as much space as they could to make do of customers. It took us 10-15 minutes to get seated since there were 4 people ahead of us. We got lucky though, after awhile there was a huge line on the side for people who were also hungover haha. I say come here before the lunch rush (weekends).The food was yum! I got a small pho rare beef and it was really good! I am pretty particular with my pho and the soup base, but this place had the flavor I look for in pho. It was better than the many other places I have been around in Ktown. We also ordered spring rolls and egg rolls and both were delicious. I did find a hair wrapped INSIDE the spring roll though...... lol normally that would really bother me, but I had my friend eat that one hahaha. Also, There was only one waiter! He was absolutely the nicest man I have met, he was very diligent and made the best of his situation working alone taking orders, serving food, and water.All in all, I liked this place! I will be back for sure, the only reason I would be deterred coming here would be because of parking! Oh, they also take apple pay - so quick and easy ;)"
5/8/2017,20170508,5,4.8,"Wow. Perf spot for a weeknight dinner.I ordered egg rolls, pho tai & egg noodles with seafood. The egg rolls were to die for - so delicious & crunchy... my mouth is watering thinking about them. The pho was good, the meat was perfectly medium rear and not over-cooked. The soup was a bit salty for my liking as I like adding sriracha and oyster sauce into my soup. Nevertheless, still delicious. It was my first time trying egg noodles so I have no other places to compare them to, but my bf really loved it. To me, it tasted like a yummier Chinese stir-fry.Definitely get the egg rolls. Our server (I think maybe the owner) told us they make the egg rolls fresh and they sometimes run out. Note that the parking situation isn't the best. They have a tiny lot available.. otherwise, you just gotta street park."
5/9/2017,20170509,5,4.81,"Finally. A legit pho restaurant, run by legit Vietnamese people. Not dissing Korean pho, but there is a difference. The service is excellent however a tad understaffed, I chalk it up to being new and growing pains. There's a nice air conditioned dining room in the back and a separate front section with 2 tables for take out. The pho is as good as the 626 or OC, broth is hearty and tastes right. Noods are chewy and perfect. Portion sizes are healthy for the price. I'll be back to try the bun bo hue.The thai tea is very sweet."
5/10/2017,20170510,4,4.79,"Really excellent pho, and good, friendly service. If you've got a pho craving, this is the place to go to!They've got a handful of beef pho options and some chicken ones. They also serve spring rolls, bahn mi (3 different types: beef, pork, and a ham combo one), and various drinks. (We spied someone's bahn mi order and it's a decent sized sandwich for just $5!)My friend got the beef special #1 pho, and I got the combo beef #3 pho. The beef special #1 ($13) has the most, I think. But I wanted a mix of beef and beef balls (beef pho#3, $9). The cuts of beefs in both were deliciously tender and thinly sliced, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Yuuum. The broth was suuper flavorful and both of us slurped all of that up!When paying for our check, it is done via, what I assume is the store owner's phone (Square pay) so he chatted with us a little. He told us that it takes two days to make their broth! Amazing! No wonder it tastes soo good!They have a small lot in the back, off of Monette/Olympic corner-ish, for parking, otherwise you gotta search the streets.By the way, they close on Wednesdays to catch up on their broth making goodness! Can't wait to go back!"
5/10/2017,20170510,4,4.78,"Delicious pho and quick, friendly and attentive service for an excellent price. A little hole-in-the-wall gem in K-Town.Also, highly recommend the spring rolls!"
5/11/2017,20170511,5,4.79,The staff is very nice and summer rolls are legit! Banh mi was good. Can't wait to try the pho.
5/14/2017,20170514,4,4.78,new ktown pho place; slow but friendly service; vietnamese owned. the oxtail pho was satisfying. definitely a spot for my pho rotation! p.s. closed on wed.
5/14/2017,20170514,5,4.78,"I'm so happy this place opened up! I've been living in LA for over two years now, and this is the best pho I've found near ktown. The pho is great, and the spring rolls and vermicelli are also tasty"
5/15/2017,20170515,4,4.77,I came here because I read that their broth takes two days to make! It was so flavorful. The best hangover cure!!!!
5/15/2017,20170515,4,4.76,"Good food, great service. Parking in a little lot in the back. Got Bahmi, Spring Rolls, and Vietnamese Coffee."
5/16/2017,20170516,4,4.75,"I want to start off by saying that they are closed on Wednesdays...I came on a Wednesday and saw employees working in the kitchen but store was closed. Decided to come back again to try their food. At first, I was confused about which door to enter through since they have two doors. One door (facing street) is for to-go and other door (inside hallway) is for dining in. They have a kitchen in the middle of both rooms. Weird set up but it's obvious the restaurant took over multiple spaces. In the dining room, there are eight tables. On the day I went all the tables were taken and it was tight where I was sitting.I appreciate that this pho restaurant is an actual vietnamese owner located in ktown. They had korean music videos playing on the tv. The owner is friendly and he was host, server, and cashier. He was very attentive. Every time he came back to the customers he always looked around to see if everyone was doing ok. He also had one other helper.I ordered their egg roll which were super crispy...yum. Their fish sauce was delish with the egg rolls. I also appreciate that the lettuce were perfect in size and not just some random huge lettuce thrown on the dish. I also ordered the ox tail pho and the soup was delicious but there wasn't enough meat (1 regular ox tail and 2 tiny, skimpy ox tail) in comparison to all the noodles. My friend had the pork chops and rice but we've had better. FYI: Parking is horrible here."
5/16/2017,20170516,5,4.76,"It's my third time coming here. :) I normally order Pho Tai, but not today! This time I went for the Pho Ga. Just hours earlier I was suffering from food poisoning and wanted to recover by having a bowl of good chicken broth. Because of that I didn't want to add on any sauces, just onions and bean sprouts. The broth was nourishing, rich, and delicious! Absolutely the best Pho in Ktown with amazing customer service! You are what you serve!"
5/22/2017,20170522,5,4.76,"AUTHENTIC and DELICIOUS pho in Los Angeles?! In Ktown? I came here FOUR times in one week after I had it for the first time. As a Vietnamese person who has been in Los Angeles for the past 3 years, the quest to find good Vietnamese food and pho has been a very very sad journey. Time after time I would be disappointed. I became reluctant to even try Vietnamese restaurants in LA. I thought that the only way to satisfy my craving for Vietnamese food was to drive to the SGV or the OC. I had lost hope in finding an authentic ...But Ktown Pho has restored my HOPE. When I walked into the door and heard the BEAUTIFUL voice of a Vietnamese grandma in the kitchen, I thought maybe this restaurant could be the one (it's a sad feeling when you walk into a Vietnamese restaurant and hear another language being spoken in the kitchen). The moment of truth came...my bowl of pho was in front of me. I took a deep breath hoping that my journey to find good pho in LA could be over. I sipped the broth...DELICIOUS. I almost shed a tear because of how happy I was. I took a bite of my Banh Mi Thit Nuong and it was also...DELICIOUS. THE JOURNEY IS OVER... good Vietnamese food in LA has been found."
5/22/2017,20170522,4,4.75,"Pros: Very nice people. Clean and quaint. Food is decent but not spectacular.Cons: Parking is in the street (metered) or a very small portioned shared lot in back with other tenants but wouldn't recommend parking there as people will park behind you or dung up your car. Menu is regular, and limited compared to other Pho places. If you order a drink, it is smaller in size than other places."
5/22/2017,20170522,5,4.75,"We ordered seafood pho, three meat combo pho, and spring rolls. So delicious while not breaking the bank. Left under $30 while tipping 20%. Great bargain and delicious food."
5/24/2017,20170524,4,4.74,"I love this place! It has the best Pho I've been able to find in L.A. Be warned that the front part of the restaurant is for the take-out orders. If you want to dine-in, walk a bit further along the hallway to the dine-in section. I've gone twice and have tried a couple of different phos. Both were excellent and satisfying. The price is also pretty affordable and while it may not be the fanciest place, it is nice and clean."
5/25/2017,20170525,5,4.75,"Hands down! The best pho soup we've had so far! We usually go to Pho 2000 but omg after finding this spot. We've decided to come here from now on. The service is A1. They are super friendly, very attentive to your needs. The broth smelled amazing and looked so amazing and it tasted so amazing!! I highly recommend this place!! You will not regret it."
5/28/2017,20170528,5,4.75,"I am in love with this Pho restaurant!! I almost want to keep it a personal secret because I know how once something blows up in LA, the wait lines will become tremendous. But because I want this establishment to do well, I will do my yelp-ly duties to give credit where it is due.First off, the name ""Ktown Pho"" may not give off a feel of authenticity, but the entire restaurant is run by Vietnamese people and the food is on point. It is the best pho I've had, and the first time I felt that the taste of the original broth was ruined after I added Hosien and sriracha sauce. (Usually, I am doing chemistry trying to match the spicy to sweet ratio with the sauces on top of the broth.) This time, the original broth was so flavorful and delicious. I immediately regretted after adding the sauces.Because it was so good, I went two times in one week. Luckily, their menu options have a variety of choices so you can try many different things. The second time, I ordered the beef and pork Bahn Mi sandwiches. They were both very very good and highly recommended! I'm glad I could find a great pho place near where I live.Definitely a must try and will love!"
5/30/2017,20170530,4,4.74,"I've been meaning to try this spot for some time now and I finally was able to last week! I got the wagyu pho and the goi cuon (spring rolls). I got the wagyu pho and was not entirely too impressed by it. The meat was tender, but it tasted like any other filet mignon meat that I could find in westminster for a better price. I think $13-$14 for a bowl of pho is pretty steep. I wasn't too impressed with the broth either; it was too oily for my taste. I am used to a broth that tastes very healthy and clean. However, I am giving this place 4 stars because of the spring rolls! I have never had a goi cuon with the fried crunchy things that are normally in nem nuongs. It's genius!!! It made the goi cuon just that much better. My friends have told me that their bahn mi is pretty legit here so that's something I am going to have to come back for next time!*There are two entrances to the restaurant, so don't get confused! The front entrance on the corner of the street is where you can pick up togo orders and the second entrance is the actual restaurant."

Ive been to all and Ktown's beef is on par or better then any of them.    Must try if in Los Angeles area. The owner is informative and very polite which adds to the overall quality of the restaurant."

The owner is actually Vietnamese and explained that they cook the broth for two days before serving, so it's extremely flavorful. What's also amazing is that the pho has been consistently good each time I have been here. I know this place is going to be really popular soon!"
6/10/2017,20170610,5,4.75,This is the best place for authentic Vietnamese pho in K-town! We keep coming back for more. Khanh remembers us as regulars here. Fast and friendly customer service and clean restaurant! --5-stars---FYI. Parking is tight. There is only a small parking lot in the back of the restaurants with capacity of 8 cars.

The Thai iced coffee was superb and the customer service was on par. This place is a little small I got here at a good time but after me was a small wait to be seated.

6/15/2017,20170615,5,4.75,"So I once dated a crazy Vietnamese guy (crazy in the literal sense), and the only good thing that came out of that relationship was a new found love for Vietnamese food. Bun bo hue is my favorite, I would have it over pho any day. So I'm beyond ecstatic that I now can get bun bo hue fix near my house!I would say it is more neat than most bun bo hues I've had. No gross looking pig's foot or blood cake floating in the soup. It is still very tasty though, and the noodles are on point.They have a variety of rolls. The summer roll with the pork sausage is a nice change from the ones with shrimp, which is typically the only option ktown.Oh, and they have banh mi thit nguoi! Yaaaaas please! Overall, a place with tasty clean Vietnamese food with a many more authentic Vietnamese options than most pho restaurants in ktown (even though it is called Ktown Pho, it is definitely more Viet, which is a refreshing change). The food was clean and ingredients were fresh.Super friendly customer service, also baby friendly! A+++"
6/22/2017,20170622,5,4.75,"I've been reviewing pho places the past 2 months that I've been to LA. Unfortunately I haven't had the greatest success with finding good authentic pho until today. We ventured to Korea town from downtown LA for some pho. After a 30 plus minute ride, let me tell you, it was so worth it. K town pho has been open for approximately 4 months and is slightly hidden in a building with several other establishments. I looked up on yelp to find the logo and that's how I was able to find it. When you first walk in, the front of the store is their take out area with 2 waiting tables. We were then gestured to the back by a friendly Vietnamese older man where their dining room was. I knew this place was going to be authentic just due to his accent. I was very excited. The dining room was quaint and at 1600, there were about 3 other couples eating there (I woke up at 3pm craving pho after night shift). We were immediately greeted by I'm assuming a man and wife, who takes care of the dining area. We sat and got menus and they immediately brought out water. That was a plus. I brought my two Caucasian roommates with me, 1 who has been sick and never had pho, and the other who had it, and they were both blown away as I was. As a group, my friends ordered unsweetened tea in which our server brought out a syrup sugar which they both liked. For food, we ordered 3 different appetizers and Pho's. We had the traditional egg rolls (cha gio), summer spring rolls (goi cuon), and their pork roll (nem nuong). Our Pho's were the wagyu beef, traditional rare eye round steak, and the chicken. Pho. These were all served with the veggie plates that included, bean sprouts, basil, jalapeños, lime wedge, and sliced onions. I at first declined the sliced onions because I don't like it raw, but per our server, he said that there's has very minimal onion taste, and even let me try it the traditional way with I believe vinegar and lime. I'm apparently now a fan of onion that way. So overall, our experience was great. The server was very attentive and showed us authentic ways to eat the food (I'm part Vietnamese and apparently very non-traditional) lol. The broths were all flavorful and the spring rolls were delicious. My only two cons on this place is that it is slightly hidden and harder to find, so you have to be attentive, and my friends chicken pho. The broth for the pho was great, but the set back was the chicken was a little tough. It was fine tho, because we were so full from everything and the service was great, but it wouldn't be something we ordered again. Overall, my new favorite pho establishment in LA, and I can't wait to come back and try more menu items like their bun bo hue and oxtail pho :) P.s they have a small parking lot in the park alley way of the restaurant we later found out, but we were lucky enough to find street parking right across the street."
6/23/2017,20170623,4,4.75,Overall good spot for vietnamese style pho.. here and simply pho on 7th would be the spot for the authenticity pho in ktown. For being in ktown and theres ktown style pho (korean style less herby and msg) the name of this spot should be pho real pho or something since the taste is pure Viet. Anyways 4 stars cuz the broth is too oily for my taste.. (you can see the separation after) and has the msg aftertaste (the feeling of thirst after) overall decent portions and the eggroll was good as well. Will try their other stuff next time im in the area!
6/24/2017,20170624,5,4.75,This place is amazing! I've been to almost all pho places in Ktown and this place is one of the most flavorful and CLEAN one!! Their food is good and their service is even better! Would love to come back here again!
6/25/2017,20170625,5,4.75,This place is amazing! I've been to almost all pho places in Ktown and this place is one of the most flavorful and CLEAN one!! Their food is good and their service is even better! Would love to come back here again!
6/29/2017,20170629,5,4.75,"To start off, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Their pho is BOMB. Im not a huge fan of pho and I've tried bad and good but this place is pretty good for me to go back again and again lol. I always get seafood pho with no cilantro. All their ingredients seems fresh and clean. Some places shrimp looks all over cooked and weird but this place looks fresh and looks good to eat . The owner is really nice too. He's very kind and also likes to keep their menu very authentic. 1 bad thing. This place parking SUCKS BALLS. if you go exactly lunch time or dinner time, you will not find any parking. They have a parking lot that only have like 5 space or so. It sucks. And sometimes you can never find street parking. Good luck!"
7/2/2017,20170702,5,4.75,"Very very yummy and the prices are great. The parking situation is not so great so I just street park. The owner is super nice!The Thai tea is awesome but I'll skip on the boba next time. And just like everyone else said, this place is pretty authentic. This is my go to place for pho. The soup base for the pho is a bit salty, but still definitely better than the other pho places here in ktown."
7/2/2017,20170702,4,4.75,Owner was friendly and chatted with us. Food was decent. This place was refurbished from a former salon.
7/3/2017,20170703,5,4.75,"A hit for Vietnamese pho! Vietnamese owned spot! The nem nuong was on point! A simple menu done well! Not only was the food amazing the service and kindness from the staff will make you want to come back!Viet coffee - strong!!!!!!Pho special - 5 stars, the broth was flavorful! Not salty! noodles we're firm not too soft! Beef was tender and easy to eatNem noung rice roll comparable to brodards in Orange County. Yea I'm serious about that last statement."
7/10/2017,20170710,4,4.74,"Amazing authentic pho in ktown. You can taste the love and passion infused in the food. Whoever is making the food in the back is godly. They also have a variety of other options, vermicelli, bun bo hue, broken rice, 4 different types of rolls AND fried egg rolls, banh mi, and more. Service is really good, but it's a small shop run by literally one guy (the owner), so don't expect speedy service like at most pho restaurants. He is super nice but can sometimes be a little too nosy for my own preference. Also parking is in the back next to a ton of garbage."
7/10/2017,20170710,5,4.75,Best food around. Was skeptical about this place because we've been to way too many different pho restaurants in KTown and got disappointed by all of them. The service and the flavors are on point and consistent. The guy that works there is really friendly and makes an effort to provide the best service and you can tell he's working hard. Appreciate everything about this place. The type of business I love to support.
7/13/2017,20170713,4,4.74,"I came here for my birthday dinner on a whim because I really felt like having a vermicelli bowl! I got the pork bowl with spring rolls and it really hit the spot. I wish they included more meat in their bowls though. My boyfriend got the fried rice and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Plus points for the mom and pop ambience in the restaurant-- it was cozy and very fitting for the homely dishes we were having. WAIT TIME/RESTAURANT SIZE: It was fairly crowded when we arrived so we had to wait 15-20 min. Others were waiting as well. There is a small counter and seating area out front and a larger (but still squeezy) dining area tucked away in the back. PARKING: We parked in Koreatown Plaza but I don't recommend doing that if it is getting late, since the ktown plaza parking lot closes around 9 or 10. Try finding street parking if you can!"
7/14/2017,20170714,5,4.74,"I was sooooo excited to try this place! I wanted to go on Wednesday, but they were closed. I got oxtail pho and spring roll. Food came out very fast. It was bomb!! I wanted to order bhan mi as well, but they were sold out. I came at around 7:30pm. I will be back for sure to try it"
7/18/2017,20170718,5,4.74,"The best Pho in K-Town for sure.This isn't some shitty pho place run by some Korean person. (I am Korean as well)The food tastes like the chefs here know what they're doing. Always consistent and flavorful.Their cilantro, sprouts, onions and meat are always fresh.The owners, who usualy serves, are very friendly and tries to commodate your needs.I have already been there more than 7 times in few weeks.Their Bahn Mi is very good too.The only downside is that their springroll doesn't have much flavor."
7/20/2017,20170720,4,4.74,"This place looks like a small place but everyone is very friendly and the food is delicious, forgot to take a picture of my food before I ate. I'm definitely coming back when I'm in LA again!!"
7/20/2017,20170720,5,4.74,The meal you get for the price you pay is exquisite. It's so good! Very flavorful broth. The staff was really friendly and could tell I had a cold when I ordered and they were so nice and said their pho would fix me up. It certainly helped to eat delicious pho.
7/21/2017,20170721,4,4.73,"One of the more authentic Vietnamese places in KTown.I came here on a Sunday to grab lunch with some friends. Parking was a bit of a struggle since the back lot of this place is teeeeny (can probably only fit 4 cars). So, street parking was the next option. The wait for a table on a Sunday noon was about 15 minutes, as the restaurant itself was pretty small. The restaurant is split into two sides, with the kitchen in the middle. This place is run by a Vietnamese couple - the husband can speak decent English but the wife can only speak very limited English, but both are very willing to help you if you have any questions! They have a wide selection of Vietnamese food, from pho to banh mi and Vietnamese coffee, not typical for a pho place! We tried the pho, dried pho, spring rolls, and this really delicious ox bone pho soup (my friend said it was AMAZINGGG). The place is pretty clean, with a few flies flying around, but what can you do? It was a hot sweltering summer day. This is a great place to try if you're in Ktown and feeling Vietnamese food!"
7/22/2017,20170722,3,4.72,"First visit: the pho was the best I have tasted in the area in awhile. I was a proselytizer of this Vietnamese-owned joint in Ktown. Second time: I had bun bo hue, and it was not as fragrant as it could have been, but very few restaurants can execute it the way my grandma or aunts can. Third visit (last week): stayed with the tried and true, and the pho broth tasted weak and diluted. The meat was skimpier and the meatballs tasted old. I know they can do better. Perhaps they've learned that the economics of a good bowl of pho doesn't make sense anymore, or it was a bad day. I any case, it will take awhile for me to want to try this place again."
7/23/2017,20170723,5,4.72,Probably the most decent pho restaurant in ktown run by Vietnamese people. Good service and great variety of food. They have free parking in the back. The place is small though I hope to see this business grow and expand to a more spacious location.
7/24/2017,20170724,5,4.73,Seriously some bomb pho. The flavor notes are very authentic. Swing around to the alley and park. My mouth is watering even after I've finished my bowl. My new favorite place.
7/25/2017,20170725,4,4.72,"Surprisingly authentic and delicious. True of what the yelpers say, the best pho in K-Town. Order a combo pho and everything was on point. Broth was delicious and herby. A big giant bowl to fill you up for super cheap. Lastly, the add-ins were tastey!Really wish I lived closer to K-Town now."
7/31/2017,20170731,4,4.71,"Best pho in LA without having to drive a billion miles east or south!The broth is the right amount of fatty, brightened by the cilantro and onions. The owners are super friendly, especially if you have kids in tow. Big screen with Kpop music videos was a big bonus because it kept our kid entertained through the whole meal. One bit of caution is that the ""Wagyu beef,"" just like at other restaurants, is more of a gimmick than something different. Recommend sticking to the regular pho bowls -- the standard meat is tender enough, you don't get that much more bang for your buck with the upgrade."
8/5/2017,20170805,4,4.71,Great pho. Ordered the chicken pho and it was delicious. The chicken was the moistest (if that's even a word?) and most tender and flavorful I've ever had in pho. Service was quick and good. My only complaints are that the ac was broken and pho is not very fun to eat in a hot room on an 85 degree day as it already heats you up and makes you sweat a little. Also I wish the broth had a bit more flavor as it seemed a bit thin to me. But other than that great spot! Loved how thin they sliced the onions for topping the pho too.
8/6/2017,20170806,5,4.71,"Update: came here for the second time ever over a month in between and was recognized, that's customer service deluxe. Sometimes all a place needs is good customer service and they are set. Here you get the added bonus of great food"
8/11/2017,20170811,5,4.71,"LOOOK NO MOREEEE BEST PHO I HAVE EVER TRIED IN MY LIFE. Like seriously I tried a lot of different places but this is hands down the best place I have ever tried. The broth is soooooo good and it has a distinct taste that I never have tasted and I was like wow, this must be real pho. Everything on the menu is good, also the pork bahnmi and the egg rolls. Parking, I never parked here but saw the parking lot and it's pretty bad so just walk here~"
8/12/2017,20170812,5,4.72,Finally got to try this place out after months of wanting to try their food. Place is very quaint and the parking is very limited as there are only 6 slots available in the back available for customers. I recommend parking on the street as we witnessed cars being blocked in due to the small space. Food was really good. Pho is great. Hot and not oily. The quality of the meat was on par as well. The egg rolls were great as well. Great flavor and well cooked. The customer service was a thumbs up. Husband and wife run place and they treat customers like family. Highly recommend this place!
8/13/2017,20170813,5,4.72,"I was soooo pleasantly surprised by Ktown pho. When I first saw it opened, I assumed it was going to be another Korean-run, below average pho spot. But I was WRONG! It's authentic, run by a Vietnamese family, great for both eating in and to go! Service is also great. The owner is friendly and comes by to check on you, recommends you dishes, gives honest opinions.Recommends:Oxtail pho Combination pho Pork spring rolls Banh mi (fatty tip: dine in pho, order banh mi togo for later)"
8/14/2017,20170814,3,4.71,I was hoping this was going to be the Pho place I was going to finally be my go to spot. I was sadly disappointed even though this is a Vietnamese owned restaurant. The service was great but this is a small spot in K-town. Parking can be quite difficult. The have only been around for 6 months so I hope they continue to improve.Chicken Pho- broth was sweet which is an indication that they put too much rock sugar or it has MSG. Making the broth from scratch and boiling many hours with whole chickens doesn't usually make the broth sweet like this. The broth was quite clear as well.Bun Bo Hue- the broth is quite on the light side. It doesn't have that kick that bun bo hue usually has. The didn't even put enough noodles because I felt like I could eat another bowl.Egg Rolls- Tasty but nothing special.I'll give it another shot down the line but for now this is out of the way for just so so Pho.
8/20/2017,20170820,4,4.7,"Ordered the Winter roll and Spring Roll (Nem Nuong) it was very delicious, flavor is good. Their sauces however are a little bit off. The fish sauce is a tad bit more sour than usual, and Shrimp sauce is very garlic-y. Also ordered their Pho bowl, the broth is so good. Definite 5/5 for flavor, meat is not old either. Noodles are boiled just right."
8/21/2017,20170821,3,4.69,"Thank you for coming to Koreatown! It's about time we have really good pho. The portion is a little smaller than all the other pho places in town but it tastes wayyy better. I wish the soup wasn't so oily and give more sliced onions, bean sprouts and lime that comes on the side. I also wish parking was more convenient. Oh and almost forgot about the ventilation! They need to find a way where their customers won't smell like pho all day. I could possibly give another star if they give more veggies on the side ;)"
8/26/2017,20170826,3,4.68,"Exhausted from a loooong week of driving, we decided on close eats. Pho was the idea and Yelp led us here. Funny set up-enter front door and immediately encounter the kitchen plus 2 table settings. Friendly hostess POPS out of nowhere and tells us there is more seating in the back-cool. It was hot upon entering the front door....Cute, back location with plentiful seating. Now, down to the food. Had the Spring Rolls- tasty. Rare Steak Pho- great flavor and noodles are perfect! Nothing about this place screams MUST try or best ever but certainly worth a try."
8/27/2017,20170827,4,4.67,"Found a new pho gem!! Their pho is authentic and not run by Koreans like every other place in ktown. The restaurant space is small inside a corner building. One of the few pho restaurants that have oxtail!! I'm used to oxtail pho that comes shredded and pulled apart placed in a separate bowl but this places literally has the oxtail bone and everything in the soup. So gooood!! The meat had no fat and is pure oxtail deliciousness. My fiancé ordered the Bun Hue which is a beef broth with round noodles (not pho noodles) and wow I liked it better than pho! I mean by no means was their pho below expectations, but I was surprised at how good this new dish (new in terms of my experience) was! It's a little tangy and savory all the while fresh and not oily/filmy. I can't wait to go back to order that for myself next time! The restaurant is run by a Vietnamese couple. The service was great. The male owner was very friendly and answered my questions regarding the different dishes with such patience and enthusiasm. At the end of our meal my fiancé to-go ordered bahn mi (Vietnamese sand which). He told the guy that it's for tomorrow's breakfast and he kindly told us he'll pack the veggies separately so that it doesn't get soggy for tomorrow. Normal server wouldn't have cared to go that extra length to make sure we have a great experience with food that's to-go. Was hoping they had Bun Rieu but unfortunately they didn't.One of the downside of this restaurant is there's not that many tables and the tables are pretty close to each other so it can get crowded but the foods worth it! Another downside is their parking. The parking lot is shared with unbeliever one other restaurant but it only fits about 7 cars on the lot. Unless you double park (leave your number on the window because there's no valet).I can't wait to be back!"
8/28/2017,20170828,5,4.67,One of the best pho places I've ever been to. Service was perfect pho was nice and hot!!!Definitely coming back
8/31/2017,20170831,5,4.68,"My boyfriend and I frigin lovvvvvveeeeee Ktown Pho!!! We go to Ktown Pho probably every week, it's THAT good. Delicious pho for reasonable prices AND amazing service! Thanks for everything Khanh, Boiling Crab Westwood appreciates you :)"
9/7/2017,20170907,5,4.68,"a pleasantly great surprise. Originally went to this location because I wanted to try out a filipino restaurant, Belly & Snout. When we got there we realized it is now Ktown Pho. I'm Vietnamese and I'm pretty picky when it comes to restaurants in ktown that serve Vietnamese food. The new owner was very nice and the service was very fast. and the food was authentic and so fresh! I was happy to find a place nearby that has legit Vietnamese food made by Vietnamese people. There are about 8 tables inside and a small parking lot in the back. I would recommend just finding street/residential parking."
9/13/2017,20170913,5,4.68,Probably some of the best pho in the LA area - ktown especially! This place is super generous with their toppings (meat for dayssss) and portions are quite large as well! My boyfriend postmated some pho from this spot because I wasn't feeling well enough to go out to eat and we were pleased that it was packaged so neatly and everything was still piping hot. The broth is a bit on the sweeter side for my taste but nothing some fish sauce couldn't fix! Prices aren't the cheapest but you get what pay for.*Edit: 5 stars because I've gone in to eat their pho fresh and it's even better + their service is AMAZING
9/16/2017,20170916,4,4.68,"Parking is non existent, we had to park across Western. We were told in the 4evenings we can park in the BofA lot, but also across Western, so we walked off our einner. That said, the food is GREAT, fresh, flavorful and service is good. They have a decorated dining room in the back, and two tables in the front, which is where the take out is. The dining room was full, so we sat in the front, which was actually quieter. Very good family owned business, good food. Also, they are open later on the weekends, till 9 PM."
9/16/2017,20170916,5,4.68,"This place is exceptional! Ive tried all the pho joints in Koreatown for the last 30 years and I must say this place is on my top 3. The broth is amazing, good quantity and quality of meat, and their service is great. Downside is the small parking lot but this place is worth going through the trouble of finding parking. Enjoy!"
9/18/2017,20170918,4,4.67,"Thank the gods of pho that one of them finally decided to descend down onto the streets of Koreatown and bless all of us hungover soju lovers with pho that has actual quality and true vietnamese flavors to its broth. Located on the busy street of Western, Ktown Pho does not have great parking. They have an extremely small parking lot in the back which they share with other stores in the small plaza. Which means, yes, you will have to find street parking somewhere around the area. The parking situation at Ktown Pho is about the first and only negative comment i have for this place. Outside of the areas of Alhambra and Westminster, Ktown Pho is hands down the best pho i've had anywhere. The broth that they make is unbelievably delicious and flavorful as it comes almost boiling in a large bowl. The best part about it is that it doesn't seem too oily or full of MSG (even though it may be). A lot of times, the meatballs that are served in pho restaurants in Koreatown are spongy. But you can bet your beef ball loving tummy that it is not the case here. I also recommend the egg roll and spring rolls here as they are both perfect complement dishes to your pho on a rough morning. I will most definitely be back and hopefully try something else on the menu other than their pho. But it's just so good i cant resist!"
9/18/2017,20170918,4,4.67,Very good spring rolls and the pho hit the spot - loved how everything was separated so it doesn't loose the flavors as it travels back to us.
9/21/2017,20170921,5,4.67,"Very good and will definitely come back again. Parking a little tricky, but food so good."
9/22/2017,20170922,5,4.67,Love this place so much more now. Brand new vegan here and they have the best pho vegan soup option! It's not on the menu but the man here was so nice to explain to me what it was and what was in it. Under $10 and so much flavor and a pretty late portion. He said they could also make other things on the menu vegan as well by choosing baked tofu as the protein. Definitely worth stopping in here.
9/23/2017,20170923,2,4.66,"WAY OVER RATED. Not worth it.The host was extremely friendly and nice, but my rating is strictly in regards to the quality of the food.Coming from a family that makes it a tradition to eat pho every Sunday after church, I loveeeeeeee pho and take my pho extremely seriously. * Ox Tail Pho ($9.49): the first thing that I noticed was that the Pho Rice Noodles were too soft/clumpy (probably over cooked?) & the soup was extremely lacking in flavor. The only reason why I ever pay for Pho is that ""restaurant quality pho"" is suppose to have that extra long lasting flavor, and distinctive mouth watering aroma that homemade Pho can never equate to. However, Ktown's Pho tasted exactly like homemade pho using ""Costco's 7 Hr Pho Kit"" & $1.50 noodle packets that you can get from any Asian store. Smh. Don't spend your money here. This place must be making bank, for what they're actually offering you.Ps. I only got one chunk of Ox Tail Meat (pretty stingy on the meat portions ):*Grilled Pork Chops ($7.49): there was so little meat and so much bone, side veggies, and empty plate space (the pic says it all). The meat was semi tough and again, lacking in flavor (as in I could taste the sauce that they were trying to use, but the meat was not marinated through and thus the flavor did not penetrate thorough the meat, but rather sat on the outskirts of the sear). The broken rice & sauce were great (but seriously, who'd ever mess up on rice?) *Winter Rolls ($6.49): If you've read a few other reviews under Ktown Pho, you'd know that their best item/least complaint item would be their ""Rolls."" Overall, I do admit that they were tasty and the sauce was bomb af. However, BRODARDs have waay better rolls & I'm not sure if I'd come back to here just for rolls...it is called Ktown ""Pho"" after all.Overall this place is just lacking the extra kick that's suppose to differentiate a home cooked meal from a restaurant quality meal.I'm guessing it's rated so high because it's new & their menu/display/choice variations are on point. However because the food quality is lacking, just give it a few more weeks/months & im sure the rating will soon average out.For amazing Viet places, visit:BRODARDSOrThien HuongI'm so sorry for leaving such bad review on this restaurant but I owe it to my fellow Yelp community for an accurate perspective. Best of luck Yelpers!"
9/24/2017,20170924,4,4.65,"Very pleasant owners. Very helpful in helping you decide what to try. I tried the pho noodles and the hue noodles(i.e. Central Vietnamese rice noodles per owner). The broth is probably one of the best broths I have ever tried!! The rice noodles are a little different than the pho rice noodles but still delicious! Make sure to put the sate sauce if you like your soup a little on the spicy sauce. They make the sauce themselves and it is excellent! I put the sate sauce on the pho as well and it was equally excellent. They bring you an individual serving or basil, onions, jalapeños, and bean sprouts. I would give them a 5 rating but the portions were definitely smaller than other pho restaurants whether in K-town or elsewhere. Overall an awesome place to have pho in K-town!! Not a lot of authentic Vietnamese pho restaurants around. Give it a try!"
9/30/2017,20170930,5,4.65,"Cozy little place run by husband and wife. The husband Hieu T was super friendly and went the extra step in bringing us a kid's bowl and fork and even scissors to cut up our little guy's food. They have an extensive menu of Vietnamese food, from pho, bahn mi, bun rice bowls and my fave, nem nuong rolls!! Noodles were cooked perfectly, the broth was clean and flavorful, the accompanying veggies were super fresh. Love this place.Parking can be a bit tricky tho. We had to drive around a few times around the blocks to find a spot."
10/2/2017,20171002,5,4.66,"I'm glad an authentic Vietnamese shop opened up. I grew up near Westminster/Little Saigon so I would like to think I know my Vietnamese food. The pho here is delicious as well as the summer rolls. I've had a couple of the broken rice dishes too and those are bomb as well. It's hard to find broken rice dishes at Korean owned places and instead, you'll get Korean-Chinese fried rice. However, my favorite dish from here would have to be the oxtail bun bo hue. Can't beat the customer service. I ordered to go once and noticed that the sauces were missing (oyster and hot sauce). I'm not a big fan of the sauces anyways but the dude, I think the owner, called on his own volition and left a message saying that he apologized for leaving out the sauces. Shi* happens! Much appreciated!"
10/2/2017,20171002,3,4.65,This place was a decent hole-in-the-wall pho spot. There wasn't much seating and the service was a little slow but the pho was good and hearty. I'd recommend this to anyone who lives nearby the location and wants a quick bowl of soup.
10/7/2017,20171007,5,4.65,"I like the pho. The size is very big. It tastes good! I also like the soup. Their boss is very kind. If I have time, I will go there again."
10/14/2017,20171014,4,4.64,"Tiny place, but food and service was excellent. There was only one server at the time we went in to get Pho. The server was very kind and was attentive to our needs. The pho broth was amazing and the spring rolls were also good. There is no easy parking in koreatown and we got very lucky parking on the streets. Suck it up and drive a little to find parking."
10/18/2017,20171018,5,4.65,"Finally real Vietnamese food in LA. This is the closest real VN taste you can get without having to go an 1.5hrs south to Little Saigon or 30 mins east to SGV.Their Pho is the best in all of LA, 100%. Tried them ALL. They also have Bún bò Hue. A noodle soup from the royal central Hue region (where my mom is from). Different than its cousin Pho, it has thicker round noodles with a rich lemongrass broth that is spicy, tangy, salty and sweet at the same time. Pho broth is typically not spicy and doesn't have lemongrass.They also have real VN style Bánh mì sandwiches, none of that ""inspired"" fusion stuff. If you read my reviews, you know that having lived in Saigon, always expect only the best of my 1/2 motherland, Vietnam.Other perk - won't set you back an outrageous $15-20 per dish like the trendy places."
10/21/2017,20171021,5,4.65,"Amazing. Always delicious. Everything on the menu has been really tasty. Plus the service of this family run business is spot on! Only negative is the small parking area, but still worth it!"
10/22/2017,20171022,5,4.65,"I have found my new favorite spot for pho in town.I have another place that have been a favorite of mine for a couple of years, but I might have to say that this place made its way to the top of my list for pho. The biggest minus to this place is the parking. I know parking in LA is pretty bad in general and most places have valet. This place has a tiny little lot behind it that barely fits any cars which forces you to street park and not gonna lie, that's usually something I would deduct a star for (I would want it to be half a star but since that's not an option here... haha) but I decided to give this place the full five star rating because I usually end up here in the evening time when it's not too difficult to park around the area. The meter parking on either Olympic or Western does become available after a certain time and parking hasn't been too big of an issue so far.The staff here are very kind and it was surprising but also kind of cool that one of the servers actually remembered my friend and what his order of extra meat for his pho from the last time he was there. The place isn't that big but it hasn't been an issue for me whenever I went and I would say that the place is fairly clean overall. And of course, the food. I really like the taste of their broth. And the noodles are on point as well. There's definitely a difference in taste between those pho places owned/worked by the Korean people in town versus a place like this that is actually owned/worked by Vietnamese people. I also love that for some of the pho (although not for all) you get to choose a size between small and large, and for someone like me who doesn't eat a lot, I love the option of being able to choose the small size. It's absolutely the perfect size for me.Something I also appreciated was that I asked for a half order of the spring rolls even though there wasn't an indication for that on the menu. The full order is 3 rolls and they accommodated to my request for half order and brought out 2 rolls instead. That was really nice of them and that definitely made me a happy customer. I would highly recommend this place to anybody who loves pho."
10/24/2017,20171024,4,4.65,"Pleasantly surprised at the solid, clean pho in K-Town. Been to numerous other pho shops in K-Town and while they are all decent, they lack a certain flavorful depth. Here, the pho is legit and rich, but not too smelly or got that murky old beef brother feel. The staff are extremely attentive and even noticed that my wife was pregnant and asked if she had any dietary restrictions. One notable thing is that whenever I go to pho shops, I always order a soda because I think the waters are kinda gross. Kinda like you're drinking residue dish water still in the cup. But their water was really good. Yea...weird thing to notice. Will be returning. Definitely would recommend if you want to give a new pho place a run in K-Town."
10/24/2017,20171024,5,4.65,"Love this place! I live in downtown LA and always struggle with the pho options (have to go to SGV) but this definitely is on par - flavor and price wise. Owner is super nice and friendly. Pho is delicious, good tasty broth that you can tell has been sitting for an appropriate amount of time, if ya know what I mean."
10/25/2017,20171025,5,4.65,"My car's tire popped so I got off my car and sulked on the street side. AAA came and as they were fixing my tire, I hungered for some food as it was 12:14 PM, my usual time on getting lunch. I looked around and saw this pho restaurant and I didn't have pho for a while so I walked up to the front of the shop and walked in. Little did I know what was going to happen next..The shop itself is pretty small, but there are a decent amount of seats and tables. I wouldn't recommend coming with a huge group (6+) as it'll be hard for the restaurant to accommodate that big of a group. But this particular pho restaurant is one of the cleanest shops I've been to in Koreatown.The food itself speaks for itself. The scent of the pho as the server walks up to your table on a tray reminds me of the summers I used to spend over my Vietnamese friend's house in high school when his mom would always cook homemade pho. The pho is super clean and there isn't a lot of fat. I've tried the spring rolls, summer rolls, and egg rolls. The season (spring & summer) are clean and fresh while the egg rolls isn't too oily. Eat it with the lettuce wrap they give it with if you want another level of crunch and some freshness to go along with the deep fried wonderful crunch of a decadent-filled roll. The service is good and the servers are wonderful. As a future chef and restaurant owner, I'd be proud to manage a staff as polite and professional as this crew.Ktown Pho is the pho place to be."
10/26/2017,20171026,5,4.65,"Hands down the best authentic pho in ktown.The broth is amazing, although I recommend you add a little bit of oyster sauce to the broth. The pork sandwich is also amazing, I highly recommend ordering the pho with the sandwich together."
10/31/2017,20171031,4,4.65,"I don't care for soup noodles but was tempted by their bun bo hue (apparently not a lot of viet restaurants even offer this dish?) anddd with oxtails? Yes, please! It was my first bun bo hue so I have nothing to compare to - I can compare it to regular pho though! Much fishier broth, extra spices/chili for a good kick, and rounder noodles? The oxtail was fall off the bone, melt in your mouth delish! Wished they gave more than two pieces. The broth was clean yet flavorful. I downed the whole bowl and didn't feel thirsty at home afterward (no msg yay!). We sat at the take out section of the restaurant since the main dining room was full. Service was lacking but expected. Overall - decently sized portion and fair prices - def worth checking out if you are craving a good bowl of pho or bun bo when in ktown!"
11/4/2017,20171104,5,4.65,"At first I was hesitant about this place, because I thought it was Korean owned. I'm sure the younger generation of Koreans make better pho than their predecessors, but the only reason I decided to try Ktown Pho was because I read on here that the owner is Vietnamese. Parking is pretty much nonexistent, and I actually did not want to give five stars because the portion of meat was small. The least amount of meat I've had in all of my experiences both Korean or Vietnamese, although I could be wrong. However, I did not want to give four stars because the broth is the best in this area, and, unfortunately, there is no 4.5 stars. If I could give an advice to the ownership, I'd say please give bigger portions. When you skimp out on meat the whole serving looks small, and the pricing isn't as cheap as the previous place I've been going to, so some people, including me, may tend to think it may not be worth it. I guess it depends on how desperate you are. I definitely will be back, but, considering difficulty in finding parking, I hope the restaurant will make up for it with larger portions."
11/7/2017,20171107,5,4.65,"This little spot is hidden away on the corner of Western Ave and Monette Pl. The only way you'll see it off the street is the small sign on the corner. Parking is horrendous but well worth the visit. This pho restaurant is in ktown, but it's run by real Vietnamese people! I ordered the pork bahn mi and egg rolls to go. It was DELICIOUS! I will have to come back to try their pho."
11/8/2017,20171108,4,4.65,"This authentic pho spot has delicious food for great value. The seating area is intimate and hidden behind the takeout room.I got a small pho with rare steak and brisket. I would give the pho broth 4/5 rating, it wasn't mind blowing good but I'd come back for it. My boyfriend got the oxtail pho and he loved it. The oxtail was tender and fell off the bone easily.The service, however, was lacking. After we finished our meal it took us forever to get the waitress' attention to get our check."
11/9/2017,20171109,5,4.65,"The best pho in Los Angeles, better than Legend Pho or Pho 87 (both really good). The broth is immaculate, and the meat is exceptionally tender. The only challenge with this restaurant is the lack of seating and limited parking. We had to sit at the counter and had to find street parking on Western. I'm looking forward to my next hangover..."
11/17/2017,20171117,4,4.65,I would say they have the best Nem spring rolls and bun bo hue in ktown !!!! it may be the only place serving bun no hue. i just wish that they are open little earlier on wkends... so i can have my hungover pho... :( and have parking lot... otherwise their food is very good!!!!
11/18/2017,20171118,5,4.65,"My new favorite pho spot!!!! I am the happiest clam alive. I'm sooo happy that I finally found a bomb pho restaurant in Koreatown. I do have another spot that I think is pretty good, but I needed the authentic, rich, makes-me-think-about-it-during-the-week kind of pho to get me goin'.Yes, parking is almost impossible. I say almost because honestly it's worth driving around for awhile praying for a spot to open up. I found a spot in the residential areas nearby because their parking lot isn't even a real parking lot.. I was about to give up until I finally saw a car leaving and hallelujah because I'm so glad I was able to try this place!The pho is so rich in flavor-- you automatically know it's authentic. ALSO, it's owned by the sweetest Vietnamese man. He was so friendly and accommodating! The wait was also a bit longer than I'm used to since the restaurant is really small. The seating is also spread out throughout the facility. The main seating area, another separated smaller eating area, and booths along the window near the door. My friend and I sat by the booths near the door; though it was uncomfortable, it was tolerable because we got a seat quicker than waiting for a table and the food came out really quickly. (we were hangry)What I ordered: - egg rolls: the best egg rolls of my life. I was super hungry so that could've added to the amazing experience but my friend and I ordered more to-go because we KNEW we would miss it later at night LOL.- pho tai chin (pho with rare steak and brisket): this is not in the menu but you can order pho with whatever meat you like! The broth was really flavorful but not too heavy at the same time. Portions are great!Cannot wait 'til I come back! Still a little concerned about parking... but it definitely is not a hindrance! Be back soooon Ktown Pho."
11/26/2017,20171126,5,4.65,Absolutely the best pho in Los Angeles everything's fresh and delicious this is my family's favorite Sunday dinner.. highly recommended
11/30/2017,20171130,3,4.64,"4.5 stars?! Really? It's decent but not worth 4.5 stars...First of all, the parking is shitty. But, they do have a teeny tiny lot in the back where the alley is. It fits about 5 cars...Second, I obviously didn't fall for the hype. I felt that the ratings didn't reflect the service or taste in food. They use quality ingredients, however, the food as a whole was on the sweeter side. If it wasn't for the hot sauce and lime, I probably wouldn't have eaten it.Order: Kobe beef pho $14.00 - The beef was tender and delish. However, the soup was slightly sweet.Eggrolls $6.00 - It was pre-made and luke warm when I got it. Blah! It was also on the sweet side.Cubed beef with red rice $10? - I had a few bites and it was actually one of the better dishes I've had.Pro - Actual Vietnamese owned.Con - Idk if I would call the food authentic. Seems to be catered to the American taste (sweet). Looks like I'll have to continue heading out to the 626 for authentic Vietnamese food. I'm kind of disappointed..."
12/3/2017,20171203,5,4.64,"What if I told you quite possibly the best Vietnamese food can be found in the middle of Koreantown, with the menu listed predominantly in Korean?! You'd call me a liar, and I'd understand....Ktown Pho is dishing out bomb Vietnamese food in the unlikeliest of settings. The egg rolls are a can't miss! And the amusing back and forth banter between you and the super pleasant owner? Well that's just the cherry on top...."
12/5/2017,20171205,4,4.64,"I got the bun bo hue oxtail noodle soup, spring rolls, and the pork bahn mi to go. The broth is very flavorful and I love the oxtail meat that just falls off the bone. Spring rolls and bahn mi were tasty as well."
12/7/2017,20171207,4,4.64,Not the best broth or cold cut banh mi evaaaaar. Does every place have to be or even claim to be? Not really a wonder why people are single with these impossible high bars. Still the best in ktown pho sho. The Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio was excellent! They do a fantastic job with lemongrass & grilled meats. Order a grilled banh mi over the cold cut.Loved what they've done within the building space. Front on Western is the takeout-pickup counter. In the back is a nicely remodeled dine in areaKT the owner-waiter is friendly and attentive. He made sure my to-go banh mis were not toasted and ingredients separated. Great service!
12/10/2017,20171210,2,4.62,"Who is giving 4.5 stars tobthis place , probably people who have not had a better tasting PhoFirst , its a struggle the parking 2. I ordered a house Pho, the broth needed more flavor, it had no tendon, tripe, sides is a bunch of onion, very little greens (greedy)3. The lady probably owner needs some customer service training...Coming back? I dont think so."
12/12/2017,20171212,5,4.62,"Our favorite pho spot in the down town /k town area !!!We are very picky with pho , and defiantly had bad pho in LA ,but this place is just incredible, they serve you really fast , and the taste is amazing !!! Highly recommend;))"
12/12/2017,20171212,5,4.63,"The best pho ever!!! So delicious, and flavorful. Try here beef sandwich as well!!! Our pho place for the next year for sure!"
12/12/2017,20171212,1,4.61,"Another one bites the dust.When I first came here, this place was brand new. 10 reviews on yelp, few customers, and nobody knew about this gem. The pho they served back then were of the highest quality. I'm talking real authentic Vietnamese pho in Ktown. I was actually excited that a pho spot like this finally opened up in Ktown. The broth were EXCELLENT and all my friends that I came with can vouch for that. Knowing how good this place was, I knew this place would gain popularity real fast especially in Ktown where everyone is out drinking and craving pho the next morning due to being hungover and it did. 3 months passed and this place became popular. They gained over 200+ yelp reviews and everyone knows about this spot now but they became what I feared would happen.They changed up their recipe and now their pho taste like sh*t. They started putting in massive amount of oil to their broth that you can actually see it and be disgusted by it. One time my bowl came with so much oil that you can see the oil lined up on the side of the bowl as the broth were fading. Me and my friend took about 4 bites from the bowl and couldn't go on. Since the owner was nice, I told him about it and he claimed that it's because they got a new worker. Alright, cool. Mistake happens and I thought this was one but I was wrong. 2 weeks later I drank my ass off again only to crave pho the next morning. Hoping that I was going to be digging myself in some bomb ass authentic pho, I was instead filling myself up with pho dunked in massive amount of oil.. again. It was very f***king bad. Tasted worse than those korean owned pho joints in ktown. 2 times in less than 1 month? Yeah, no thanks. This place is dead.What does popularity have to do with this? Popularity = more customers = more money. Being blinded by money, they find ways to make even more profit = change recipes = cheaper ingredients (since they have more customers now). Not only that, they find ways to serve faster = change things up in the kitchen = food quality drops. You should know the rest.Also, everyone hearing about how bomb this place was already missed out. It was literally the best damn pho in ktown when they were brand new and before words traveled. This place taste like sh*t now. They changed up their recipe and is now officially the worst damn pho in ktown."
12/16/2017,20171216,5,4.61,"Superior quality pho broth. It is apparent the time spent simmering to extract the flavors. The broth is deep and rich yet clean (I'm not a fan of murky pho broth).My go to is the oxtail. Meat is tender enough to peel off the bone but I also love sucking off the bits of tendon. Hien introduced me to real saté sauce as well. Love the smoky pepperiness of this for my dipping sauce.I also get a grilled pork banh mi. Really glad they have banh mi sandwiches. Great with your pho but i usually save it for later. Dry noodles with grilled pork and crispy egg roll is great. Goi coun rolls are great. Crispy fried rolls are awesome as well.Anytime pho comes up in a convo, at least one person mentions this place. Not just me but it seems that most friends of mine agree Ktown Pho has some of the best pho around. Great job Hieu and team!"
12/17/2017,20171217,5,4.61,"I've passed by so many times and had NO IDEA what a gem it would be. Then, I saw the yelp review count increasing with a whoppin 4.5 stars! I had the opportunity to try a couple days ago, so I did - and I'm so glad I did. I tried the Hue style noodle soup with oxtail. When I ordered it the owner guy asked me if it was my first time trying it and if I enjoyed fishy, spicy, and lime-y flavor soup to check. YESSSS. The nooodles are fatter in this soup too. I don't have any preference between the thin pho noodes and these fatter ones, but it does contribute to it being a completely different dish from pho. BANH MI IS HOT DAMN GOOD! In LA/ktown we are deprived of good, well-priced banh mi's - so I'm not comparing it with SGV places. The bread is so good. We asked the guy where they buy it or if they made it, and we ended up having a full on conversation about the French, the Vietnamese, bread, SGV, and ingredient differences... I went again today. So addicted... Egg rolls and summer rolls are so damn good. We were impressed that they actually had feuille de bricks in them (usually you get like egg roll wrap flakes...) and the pork sausage was flavorful and didn't taste super processed (like home-made tasting). I tried the kobe beef pho, and I like how clean-feeling the broth was. Very simple and good quality beef. I like all the intenstines, pig feet, tripe, etc. stuff too, but I think this one is enjoyable if you are looking for simplicity. The (I think) owner/server was super friendly and would walk around, make sure everything is good, and have a short friendly chat. Neat and clean feeling inside. They use the Square system and take cards. Parking is VERY limited and tight in the back (entrance in the alley). We lucked out and snagged a spot."
12/21/2017,20171221,4,4.61,"If I had to compare this with pho places in ktown, I would say that this is the best. The reason is because it is actually owned by a Vietnamese owner. I would say the best phos are in the OC, but this place will have to do if you dont want to drive all the way to OC. Its in a small corner. Best thing to do is park your car in the plaza nearby (free parking) then walk over"
12/22/2017,20171222,5,4.61,"best pho broth ive had in Los Angeles! never disappoints. Staff is awesome, and provides attentive and quick service. Will keep bringing family and friends here over and over again!"
12/23/2017,20171223,5,4.61,I got the No. 1 plus spring rolls to go. Everything was delicious. The pho broth was just right. Not too salty. The spring rolls tasted fresh. If you are dining in the seating looked sparse. Parking was rough. I parked illegally. The people are friendly and service was great. I would definitely recommend.
12/26/2017,20171226,5,4.61,"Hands down, if not the best, then one of the best Pho places in all of l. a. . Everything: the appetizers, the banh mi and the pho, combined to make a perfect trinity."
12/27/2017,20171227,5,4.62,"I've been coming here since when this place just opened. I remember just wanting to try it out, not having huge expectations or anything, and was BLOWN AWAY by the quality of the broth -- so fragrant, so beautiful, the aroma puts me into a trance!! Easily the best pho in Los Angeles and I say that out loud to my friends all the time and they all agree. I always feel food drunk on their broth.... that's how good it is. Yes, you can find incredible, authentic pho in garden grove but in LA it is a rarity. The price point is amazing and I'm so happy you can order a small size because it helps prevent me from wasting food (I usually can't finish large sizes at ramen and pho places!) I'll be honest, I've been to a LOT of pho places in LA (Nong La, Pho Cafe, Pho Saigon Pearl, Thank U Pho, Simply Pho U etc.) none of them can even touch ktown pho with a 10 foot pole. They don't even come close in terms of mesmerizing broth. My boyfriend and I recently moved to ktown and when we were looking on Google maps for places to eat nearby we both yelled in excitement when we discovered we're only going to be a 10 minute walk from ktown pho. The owner is the sweetest guy ever, he always recognizes me because I go ALL the time. He even notices when I haven't been in awhile hahaha. I seriously love this place! I would drive around the block 15 times looking for parking for this place! (which I actually probably have done multiple times, but it was worth it). Parking is abysmal but you can just get away with parking at the nearby mall ya know, the one right across the street *hint hint"
12/28/2017,20171228,5,4.62,"Ktown Pho is a little hidden gem. You can park in the back of the building but spaces are very limited and tight. Finding street parking is difficult mainly because Ktown Pho is off a very busy street.The staff is so welcoming. I've been twice only and the kind gentleman remembered us and greeted us back. The atmosphere is also quite welcoming. They have a TV for you to watch something if you'd like while eating. I would recommend this place for lunch with a friend/colleagues because the restaurant itself is quite small.I've only tried their rear steak pho and it's SO good. If you're craving pho that is affordable AND delicious, this is your place! They accept credit card, which is convenient.Overall,All though parking can be a real pain, it's all worth it for the quality and price of this pho!Highly recommend!!"
12/28/2017,20171228,5,4.62,Koreatown has been sorely missing an authentic pho restaurant for a very long time and Ktown Pho delivers. Hands down the best pho and vietnamese food you will find in the K-Town area by far.
12/28/2017,20171228,4,4.62,"I did not expect too much at a pho place in Ktown and I was surprised by how tasty their food was, from the broth, noodles, spring rolls to vermicelli. I'll definitely come back again!"
12/28/2017,20171228,5,4.62,"I came across ktown pho's Yelp page and wondered why I haven't written a review yet..and then I remembered when I first came here, when it was still new, when it didn't have people overflowing, waiting to have ktown pho's delicious broth and humble service, that I remembered thinking a bit selfishly, that I wanted to keep this place all to myself. You just have to come and try it yourself. The owner always remembers my order and he tries his best to keep everyone happy and everything running smoothly. If it gets a little busy, just gently get his attention. It's a small family owned business and everyone wants a taste :)"
12/31/2017,20171231,5,4.62,"Really great pho here. The egg rolls are excellent as well, and they stand out on the bun noodle bowls. I haven't tried their banh mi yet, but they look outstanding!Yes, this place has basically no parking, and there's often a long wait, because it's quite popular. It's worth it, though!"
12/31/2017,20171231,4,4.62,Ox tail noodle 9.49usd (12CAD)House special noodle 13.49usd(17CAD)So comforting it hit the spot it's packed full of people that when we left there was a long wait line. The person manning the place knows all sorts of languages from the time we sat to when we left think I heard 5 different languages! The pho itself is very flavourful and tasted a bit msg. I loved the oxtail. And the Kobe beef provided a greater quality of the beef. Don't know if I would say it's worth the $17cad pricetag but it was good. Better than most places in Richmond and comparable to some in Vancouver.
12/31/2017,20171231,4,4.61,Finally a good pho spot in Ktown. I've lived in ktown for a long time now and have been repeatedly disappointed by every spot. Some spots undeservingly have 4 stars and have tasted either very bland or like detergent. Ktown Pho deservingly has 4.5 stars. You may have to deal with a usual line out the door and a 20 minute wait to sit down but it's worth it because it's the best in the area.
1/4/2018,20180104,5,4.62,"BEST PHO IN KTOWN!This hidden gem is my go to place for pho...which is pretty big for me since I don't really care for pho all that much. I'm usually good with once a month IF that. But not with this place!! The thing that attracted me about this place wasn't the pho. It was the banh mi. I LOVE a good banh mi and this place does it well. The bread is fresh and has great flavor, and the meat with the pickled veggies and cilantro tops it off to perfection. Though, I wish that when I ask for extra cilantro, they would actually give me extra. My gf always get their Pho Tai and my favorite is the House Special. I have to say that even though I don't do pho often, I know what good and bad pho tastes like, and this place has the best broth I've had in a long long time. So good, in fact, that I came here twice in 1 week. No sriracha or hoisin sauce needed! Just a little of the fresh lime juice and I'm good!My gf is half vietnamese so she always orders in vietnamese and that's probably why the owner remembers us. Haha. He's always very nice and makes sure we're taken care of. He definitely cares about his customers and takes the time to chat with them here and there. The only issue I have with this place is the parking...there's never any parking in the back, which probably only fits 6-7 cars and half of which are designated for the massage place there. I usually have to circle the block at least 2-3 times to find street parking, so good luck with that. Haha.As I write this...I'm craving the house special and the grilled pork banh mi...fuhhhhhhhh"
1/6/2018,20180106,5,4.62,"THE BEST PHO IN KTOWN! I have been to about 4 different pho places in Koreatown and none have left the impression this place has. For starters, parking is a hassle! If you're lucky you will find parking in the tiny back lot which my friend did. Upon entry (from the back lot),this place looks very cozy and clean. Everyone was super welcoming and friendly which was a big surprise considering most, if not all the pho restaurants I've been to are the complete opposite. I had just gotten over a food poisoning episode so I was skeptical in trying anything new or even eating out in general. I really wanted something flavorful but soothing to my stomach. I went with the servers suggestion of the Pho Bac (the ginger part sold me too). It was perhaps the best decision in my Pho life! The meat was superb, juicy, tender and melted in my mouth...just amazing. I loved that the broth was flavorful but not overly salty. The toppings were also great! I can tell the onion had been freshly chopped considering the scent made my eyes tingle a little and those sprouts...Oh my goodness. The sprouts were fresh, crunchy and clean. I never thought I'd be so happy about sprouts. I am yet to try the rest of the menu but with my first experience I am delighted to do so! Also, if you like Thai iced tea do yourself a favor and try theirs....oh man!!!!! Ktown Pho is amazing. The food is superb, the service was great, the restaurant was clean, and it was just a joy being there. Thank you Ktown Pho!!!"
1/6/2018,20180106,5,4.62,This guy running around is really nice and attentive.. Pho was really Good! Worth looking for parking!
1/7/2018,20180107,1,4.6,First and last time here. Ordered the seafood pho and only contained 3 pieces of shrimp with the black vein hanging in. And some fish cake cut paper thin. And like ten pounds of noodles. Oh and can't forget the fake crab 1 piece. Seafood fried rice. Two pieces of shrimp and the fake crab piece and some chopped fish cake. The rice was extremely sweet. Not tasty! Crispy noodles with beef. First time trying this and never again. No flair very bland. Thai tea was very milky.They serve more garnish than the actual protein mentioned in the menu. Never going back for sodium hot water and noodles.I'm still sick to this day.
1/8/2018,20180108,5,4.6,Came to this place in search of pho! Boy did I find it! Other reviewers point out the difficult parking situation which is correct. I didn't find parking in the back but did find parking on the street over (a little inconvenient because it's raining today but didn't detour me) this place has a front section which has only two tables but there's a back section which has more. The staff is super friendly and accommodating and the gentleman who is serving everyone (I'm assuming he's the owner) kept apologizing about the delay in taking my order but really he did an amazing job and it fairly quick in attending to tables. Because of how busy it got though some ppl waited a while for some stuff. They are extremely busy here so I recommend they get another server to help seat and attend to tables though. Maybe they do have help but called out. Who knows. Now on the the food. I didn't order pho but instead ordered the bun bo hue. I also ordered a Thai iced tea which is amazing! They ran out of boba which was a bummer but didn't make the tea taste any less tasty! Oh my Jesus! The flavor of my dish was EXCELLENT! I LITERALLY DIDNT HAVE TO PUT ANYTHING INTO IT! Perfect amount of meat and noodles to get me full!  It looks a little skimpy at first (just to the eye) but believe me it will fill you up! This really is what a 5 star experience should be and looks like! Even though he was busy and could barely keep up you still felt like he was attentive because he keeps checking in on you and giving you the attention to make you feel like you weren't forgotten. I will definitely be back and this place deserves a 5 star rating!
1/10/2018,20180110,4,4.6,Longest I've ever had to wait for pho. From seating to receiving my order it took more than 30 mins... granted they did mention they were short staffed that day.. But still .. anyways the pho quality is quite good the broth is good.
1/12/2018,20180112,4,4.6,"First time here and I had their pho vegetabable. The broth had enough flavor but was too sweet to my taste. Service was great and Tai was very friendly. Tai wanted to hear our feedback before leaving the place. I am very sensitive to msg. For that I am very carefull when it comes first time trying a new place. I never eat fast nor finish the entire broth each time; first I try a spoonful broth, put the sprouts, lime juice, sriracha sauce at the end, stir and mix with noodles then wait a minute so. This way I will consume less salt and possible msg, if there is any. This time I had a half of the bowl, tasted very minimum of msg. For that I will give one more try and that will be pho tai. It's so hard to find a right broth these days:(We didn't drive to this place."
1/12/2018,20180112,4,4.6,First pho place I tried in LA. Pretty good and very cheap price. The customer service there is sweet and genuine and family style. They work hard too even with a packed house. The banh mi and pho was so good. I would eat it everyday. Banh mi beef was sweet and crunchy. Beef bone pho was a small amount than I'm used to but still full of flavor
1/16/2018,20180116,5,4.6,"It's official. Best pho in town!!! Fiancée and I have been wanting to try this place and thank god we did. Their broth is one of the best we have ever tried, didn't have to add much to it. The meats were great too. I ordered the house special and fiancée ordered the combination. If you come here whatever you do, you must order the spring rolls!!!!!!! SO GOOD"
1/18/2018,20180118,5,4.6,great Pho ... small And quaint... Service was awesome fast very nice staff ... very clean ... ... A+
1/20/2018,20180120,5,4.6,This place is my go to place for Vietnamese food. The bun bo hue is bomb here. Everything else is pretty authentic
1/22/2018,20180122,4,4.6,"Ok, I'm deducting one star because I just realized that I got charged additional fees for takeout order. The additional fees for takeout order are kind of stupid way to recoup the cost of to-go containers. Seriously tho, with a limited capacity for your dine-in customers, you should encourage people to order to go instead of dining in. That way you save the space for those that dine in, which requires more of your services..."
1/23/2018,20180123,5,4.6,I'm a fan of Ktown Pho! The broth in the pho tai bo vien was very flavorful and the ingredients were very fresh. I think the price point is fair and the portions are pretty large.Pho is the perfect remedy when you're fighting off a cold and I appreciate the lime and sate sauce at the table! So delicious I could go for another bowl.My friend who took me here raves about the bun bo hue. The owner is also very friendly and says he reads every review so hi. :)
1/24/2018,20180124,5,4.6,"I think this is my new go to pho spot! Service was great. The servers are really funny and accommodating. Food came out super fast and portions are big! When you first enter the building the front is the take out area, but the seating area is down the hallway. Street parking available."
2/1/2018,20180201,5,4.6,"Ktown Pho has become our favorite Pho place, and we come here regularly. The place is very clean and we love that the food feels very clean as well. Also, the thing that stands out for me is that KTown Pho very well balances the authenticity of their Vietnamese food WHILE choosing to serve a higher quality of food which caters to the health-conscious customer. As we know, sometimes the more authentic places aren't always that aware about health.In my opinion, KTown balances both very well. The owner is lovely and his staff is all very friendly. I LOVE the Vietnamese iced coffee they serve as wellWe are big fans and we thank the owner and his family owned business for providing us with great Vietnamese food at an affordable price."
2/3/2018,20180203,5,4.61,"First off, this is the damn best pho place in ktown. No doubt about it. All those other Korean pho places need to swing by this place and try this because the pho that they're serving are LIES.The staff is super friendly and they're SO accommodating. This place gets super busy and they're a little understaffed but that doesn't mean you're not going to get great service. Everyone on yelp that has given below a 5... get yo head out of your a55. Never seen so many pretentious snobs gathered in one place. Yes the parking is bad... no sh!t. Have you ever been to ktown? Instead of writing these snobby reviews, we need to start a gofundme for Tai so he can get a bigger place and serve the ktown community with real pho."
2/3/2018,20180203,5,4.61,"I'm from Orange County/Westminster area and tried many pho places. I was skeptical with the name of Ktown Pho...because I originally thought it was owned by Korean people. The owner is Vietnamese. He is awesome, polite, and provides excellent customer service. It's a family owned business. The Pho Tai is authentic and high quality of meat! I love their banh mi sandwich!! It tastes so fresh..also the cold pork is even better with slices of cucumbers and the banh mi sauce. I've been to Ktown Pho a handful of times. I love their pho, pork spring rolls, and banh mi sandwiches, and house coffee! It's one of my favorite restaurants in ktown! I keep coming back for more! Always hungry and always satisfied! :)"
2/6/2018,20180206,5,4.61,"Best pho in the area. Even though the restaurant is small, they have two areas in which you can eat. The food here is great. I always get the Pho Tai and usually get the spring rolls or egg rolls. Not only is the food bomb but the service is amazing. Also, they give you a lot of noodles compared to other places in the area. I believe the guy with the glasses is the manager or owner and he is always so helpful! The customer service here is A1!"
2/8/2018,20180208,4,4.61,"Honestly ktown has really bad pho but this place is one of two pho places I go to in Koreatown. I love that they have banh mis unlike other pho places in the area. But don't expect it to be $4 like typical Vietnamese places. It's like double the price but worth a try. Their prices are typical with other ktown pho places which is a little higher than typical Vietnamese joints in Westminster. The place is small but there are two different parts of the store and it's clean. The owners are super nice and are a Vietnamese couple. Their egg rolls, pho and banh mi are recommended."
2/12/2018,20180212,5,4.61,"A new favorite! Delicious, fresh, friendly service. I will crave the oxtail bun bo hue and drive across town for it if the craving strikes. Sauces and broths are bomb. I'm a fan!"
2/21/2018,20180221,5,4.61,"In LA visiting, I found this place thru Yelp so thought I would try it hoping it will be authentic bc it was in Korea Town. When I got it togo, spoke to the Viet owner, nice guy!Tried Banh mi, spring rolls, rice dish with pork chops...,All were tasty and flavorful I came back today bc I was nearby to try the PHOUnbeknownst and w o checking their hrs.,,Closed on Tuesday!I would recommend it but be forewarned of parking during rush hrs.Update review:I came back and tried the Kobe Pho...,Broth is clear and tasted spot on without the need to add fish or hoisin sauce. Got a combo noodles to go on top of my meal. Yes it's worth ordering togo!"
2/24/2018,20180224,1,4.59,"Not a good experience. Ordered the kobe pho and according to the lady the meat is more tender and better. It came out hard and chewy. My wife who eats pho with me all the time spit out the meat and was disgusted. When mentioned to the lady, she brought some lame excuses to not give us a better meat. She said "" the meat is soft and tender"" i told her "" i dont know what you are talking about. As you can see my wife has tried to eat your meat but spitted out every peace. "". Then she tried to trick me by giving me three shrimps when she originally said 4 shrimp per order if you want to add shrimp to your pho. Not going back. You can clearly see from my reviews I've been to many pho restaurants and it's hard to fool me or trick me about the quality of the pho. Not worth the price."
2/24/2018,20180224,5,4.6,Love this place. Always willing to wait. Super nice workers and servers. I recommend the oxtail pho or rare steak pho with spring rolls.
2/25/2018,20180225,5,4.6,"Excellent Pho!!! Service was great as well, really good food, the spring rolls were amazing.."
3/2/2018,20180302,5,4.6,"By far my favorite pho joint in K-Town! They have filet mignon pho, and their spring rolls are on point! All the ingredients are fresh and taste amazing!"
3/5/2018,20180305,4,4.6,"When I eat Vietnamese food, it's usually in the OC or SGV. Glad to have found a yummy restaurant so close to work. I ordered the pork and eggroll vermicelli and shared the pork spring rolls with my friend. Both were delicious. I would skip the thai tea though, it was a bit too creamy for my liking. Not sure how the parking situation is, but seating is limited. Try going slightly off hours."
3/6/2018,20180306,5,4.6,"Their pho will raise your pho standards drastically. The broth is perfect! They bring fresh cut onions, which is a game changer. Their noodles, the beef, the veggies are all so fresh. Another reason why I love Ktown Pho is the service. They're so friendly and accommodating. I've also tried the Bun Bo Hue which wasn't my cup of tea but the ingredients were still super fresh. Cannot wait to go back."
3/6/2018,20180306,5,4.6,"The best pho in LA so far. Don't let Sammy G.'s typical douche bag comments fool you. Pho is simple cheap comfort food not 5 star dining.Staff has always been friendly and good when I go, and I am a regular."
3/8/2018,20180308,5,4.6,"Was home with a flu, so I came in during the middle of the day on a Tuesday to get some nourishing Pho. Got the ox-tail soup, which is the most popular thing on the menu and it was absolutely delicious. The service was good too. Not as much meat as I would have liked, but for $10 that's ok with me; they made up for it with lots and lots of noodles anyhow. Also got the spring rolls, they give you 3! Recommended."
3/11/2018,20180311,1,4.59,"Ate here once a few months back and ordered pho. Service was good and although they were busy they were attentive. The pho is okay- based on our first visit we concluded the pho is better than what we call ""Korean pho"" in ktown but definitely not the best we've had. 3 stars for the pho. However, today, we were craving pho and decided to order take out - We ordered 2 pho dac biet, bun bo hue, nem nuong cuon and banh mi. The bun bo hue was extremely bland and we wouldn't order this again. The pho was similar to our feelings at our first visit, better than Korean pho in ktown but again not the best we've had. Nem nuong cuon will hit the spot but they don't serve it with crab/seafood dipping sauce as some may expect - it's served with fish sauce. Haven't eaten the banh mi so no comment on the sandwich. The reason for the 1 star review is when we were all done eating and throwing away the takeout containers in the provided plastic bags, I noticed there were 2 dead roaches stuck to the bottom of the bag. Pretty gross, wish I saw it before we ate everything... Wont be coming back."
3/12/2018,20180312,5,4.59,"My friend who is Vietnamese took me to this restaurant. He says this is ""as good as it gets in Ktown"".I would agree that it's pretty good pho. Noodles are cooked well, not stuck together in clumps as what you might see in other pho restaurants. Broth is not too salty. Meats are also pretty good quality. (You need to dip it into a mixture of half siracha and half oyster sauce. Then, add some lime juice to it). The lime takes away some of the saltiness. Portion a decent size. Price is also very reasonable. We also ordered a rice dish with pork which was good, but I would recommend the pho instead. The spring roll appetizer was good quality and filling. They had a small crunchy part in the middle which was bomb. (The crunchy thing is fried rice paper, the same thing that egg rolls are made out of).Vietnamese coffee is a must try if you like coffee. It's strong and tastes just like Kopiko coffee candy."
3/13/2018,20180313,5,4.59,"One of the best pho spots in K-town. I am all about pho broth and egg rolls. Their pho is so flavorful and aromatic. I can't help but keep going back. Anyway.. customer service is outstanding, I haven't had any issues ever. It's best to go on a weekday, parking on weekends suck. Highly recommended"
3/15/2018,20180315,5,4.59,Hands down best place to get pho in ktown. Went on a little quest for my next go to pho place after moving to ktown from the east coast and was so happy to find this gem. They are so friendly every time I go whether it's to pick up or dine in.The only down side is that there is very little parking available.. and even if you get lucky with a spot in the back it's pretty stressful getting out of there because it's so tight.
3/16/2018,20180316,4,4.59,"Dear Ktown Pho,Thank you for opening a restaurant near my work where my man and I can get quality food with great service! I have been waiting for this in koreatown. I could tell that the food was made by my fellow Vietnamese people! I have tried every (I think) pho place in the area and this is my favorite. From the pho to the bun to the banh mi to the rolls, to the coffee, those are my cravings that you fill. I like the pho broth here way better than Pho Vermont (formerly Legend Pho), better than Pho 24, better than Pho 2000). The pho was not sticky. The meat was soft and abundant. The fish sauce was the right sauce for the rolls (what is crab/shrimp sauce anyway)? And for the 2-star reviewer who suggested that we should go to brodard or thien huong, yes let's just go drive for an hour (or 3 in miserable traffic) to those restaurants. And to the reviewer re chewy meat and 3 vs 4 shrimps (omg, really?) yes, perhaps the server might've conceded since he was the customer, but spitting out your food? That's extra and excessive and might I say pretty rude, and then to comment on English comprehension and speaking is totally unnecessary, in my opinion. I hope he finds what he's looking for though.I wonder if Yelp should have a relativity meter too, like this is great, relative to the area, cuz if you're comparing to other counties or beyond then that's different.Anyway, service here is always great. We want to come here for lunch every week but moderation, moderation. For the rest of us, let's keep enjoying this place. :)"
3/18/2018,20180318,4,4.59,The wait was pretty long because the place is so small. It can maybe fit 20 people at most so not really ideal if you plan on going with a party of 6 or more. But the wait was definitely worth it! The pho here is so good as well as their baguette sandwiches. Best pho I've tried so far! Definitely a place to go check out if you are in the LA area.
3/20/2018,20180320,1,4.57,"Do not waste your time.They are so rude, rudeness rudely!Especially the guy, the owner!I went there 2days ago arround 7:15 pm.I had to wait around 30 ~40 minutes,Even other late coming peoples was serviced.Because I was just single person.After long waiting when I got serviced, I did complaine with a few word.And, the guy who is owner answer me,""If you dont like our service? You can leave now!"" with ...... smile.So, I came out!I had to find and had to drive to other place to goHard to find parking space?Just check yourself and waste your time.My review that I wrote yesterday was deleated.That is why I write review again."
3/20/2018,20180320,5,4.57,"Not sure if it was a combination of the rainy weather and our empty stomachs craving warm food, but this place met our expectations. The Oxtail Pho is amaaaaazing. Meat is so tender and falls right off the bone! My friend had the oxtail bun no hue and his was just as good. Full of flavor! And we added tons of spice that just gave the right amount of kick to our food. Winter rolls were delicious. Loved the dipping sauce. Definitely recommend those!The Thai tea was so creamy. I almost took one to go, but decided not to when I realized I couldn't get up - I was so full from the pho! The wait time can be a little long and parking is awful, especially around dinner time, but all worth it for the food."
3/20/2018,20180320,2,4.56,"Hey so like I don't get it ...The dp and I were scouting the area for an upcoming gig but it starting raining so we dropped in. Their pho was good, not out of this world though. The oxtail was definitely the winner out of everything but still not a main contender given the excess fat. We looked them up on yelp after the fact and were actually surprised they had such a high rating. Although I deduce that has more to do with the owners snarky defensiveness than the actual food ... had me contemplating bumping them up a star but alas here we are. I will say their crap parking isn't their fault. It's K-town, doesn't everyone suffer through that here?"
3/24/2018,20180324,5,4.56,Wow!! Amazing!!This has got to be the best Pho spot I have been to yet!! Very delicious flavors all around!!The customer service is nothing short of amazing. And the restaurant is very nice and clean. More suited for parties of 4 or smaller; and it's a great spot to take your date to Parking is almost non-existent since it is K-Town but if you circle around enough you'll find a spot.
3/27/2018,20180327,5,4.57,"I love this place!! So far I had pho, bahn mi, spring rolls. They are all so good!! Service is great as well. Parking is a hard to find since it's In Ktown.... but this won't stop me from going there!!"
3/28/2018,20180328,5,4.57,Best pho ever.Their broth is really something else.
3/28/2018,20180328,5,4.57,"Repeat customer-- great pho and decent price. I usually get chicken pho whenever I go to a pho restaurant and this one has great flavored broth. The broth is slightly more oily than what I am used to but definitely adds flavor. The quantity is not as large as other places because I can't finish the entire bowl at other places but I can I finish the entire bowl at this place. There is street parking around Olympic street near a bank, this place has no parking which is a downfall. To get in you have to go through a door that will lead you to the pathway to the restaurant but easy to find."
3/29/2018,20180329,5,4.57,"Finally getting around to reviewing this place.I'm picky about my pho, been eating it all my life, spent much of my childhood in garden Grove, Westminster, etc. I've been to many mediocre pho places, having lived around the u.s. in various places, especially some without a significant Vietnamese population.This is some of the best pho I've had in my life, and I say that sincerely. This is the only pho place I go to where I don't put Sriracha, sambal, hoisin in my soup. I feel like it actually ruins how good the broth already is. The spring rolls (goi cuon) are great, the addition of crispy eggroll paper in the center adds a satisfying crunch. Service is great, the owners will recognize you and remember you after only a single visit. They're incredibly kind and I wish them the most success, which I'm sure they'll have as they have a great product.Ktown pho is a much needed Oasis of quality in the desert of bad koreatown pho. Tip: try dipping your spring rolls in fish sauce with a bit of sambal mixed in. You won't regret it."
3/30/2018,20180330,5,4.57,"Love this place! Usually have to wait in line to eat here (especially weekend evenings & rainy days lol). I got the oxtail pho and pork bahn mi. Oxtail is well cooked and soft. Both were really tasty! I usually have to take a nap whenever I eat pho because of all the msg lol, but I don't feel that as much here. Good service, good food --highly recommend!"
4/2/2018,20180402,5,4.57,"Place has tasty Pho.... best I have had in LA though admittedly I live on west side and we are pho lacking.... noodle to broth ratio is solid... more broth less noodles, also the meat was perfectly tender! Big ups for holding on to my purse when I left it!"
4/2/2018,20180402,5,4.58,Best Pho joint outside of Orange County for sure. Consistently great broth. Best place to get some authentic pho.
4/10/2018,20180410,5,4.58,Many locals have recommended this so we had to check it out during a recent trip. Place is small so we feared a long line but luckily when we went there's no line! The food was really good - we had the combo bun (spring roll and grilled beef) and the pork chop with broken rice and drinks were fresh coconut juice served in a coconut...yummeez!
4/10/2018,20180410,5,4.58,"I must say, there is finally a really decent pho spot in Koreatown, and that's saying something! This spot seems to be family owned and run, and the main couple are just the nicest folks ever. Fiancé and I have been there so many times now that the husband recognizes us XD The broth is always delicious, noodles are fresh and never come out stuck and clumped together, which has always been my pet peeve at the other pho spots in Ktown. Plus, authenticity wise, if we wanna go there, this place is actually run by a lovely Vietnamese family. So legit that even the music videos playing in the back are Vietnamese, none of this kpop crap that's pumped out these days. ALSO their bahn mi is just FANTASTIC. We love getting the pork bahn mi and when we ask for a little extra meat, the owner is kind enough to oblige :) They close a little earlier than other spots, but I figure it's because they have an adorable little boy who stays at the restaurant until parents close shop. Parking is a hit or miss, and very difficult at peak dinner hours, but you can circle around for street parking, not the end of the world and definitely worth it!"
4/13/2018,20180413,1,4.57,"So sad, I ordered from Door Dash and was so excited to try pho from this place. I had been waiting about an hour when Door Dash called and said the staff was not allowing them to pick up my order. Door Dash said they did not want to offer their menu on the app anymore and that I would be refunded. So disappointed, seems like bad planning."
4/15/2018,20180415,3,4.56,"Tiny back parking lot means you either squeeze into a space in the surrounding neighborhoods, or take an Uber/Lyft.The food here used to be delicious, but the quality's gone down after it became a Yelp hotspot. So sad."
4/15/2018,20180415,5,4.56,Pho Tai. If one of the the best I've ever had! Come here for my lunch break. Food is great.
4/21/2018,20180421,5,4.56,"Pho this good reminds me that I really like it. The House Special is simply the best pho in LA. The meat is tender and delicious and the broth is seasoned perfectly. The bowl is light and fresh, but very flavorful.The owners seem like really nice people and I get the sense that they really care about the craft of making the meals. I am coming back soon to try more of the menu if I don't get pulled back to the House Special."
4/22/2018,20180422,1,4.55,"Left off an item from my to go order and when called to ask about it they were insistent they did not mess up. Banh Mi was awful- all you can taste is mayonnaisePho broth leaves much to be desired- very little flavorOxtail pho was given very little oxtail meatBroken rice was the only decent item in our orderDo not recommend as the food was mediocre at best and the staff was rude and did not care for customer service at allUPDATE- response to owner:Regardless of the order being postmates your staff failed to include on of our phos. Postmates does not bag up the items, your staff does. NO ONE offered to help us at all. See receipt that shows 2 phos ordered but we only received one. Your condescending responses to negative reviews show you clearly do not care about customer service and making things right. A simple apology goes a long way."
4/23/2018,20180423,5,4.55,"Good place in K-Town I can go to eat Pho. Friendly and feel comfortable, I enjoyed it.Just a problem about the parking ,not easy to get one."
4/24/2018,20180424,4,4.55,"Nice crunch pieces in the soft spring rolls; excellent vermicelli noodles. House pho #1 had high-quality meat and noodles, which was a relief. Only downside is that despite all of this, the pho broth was slightly bland and had little of complex character of other phos with inferior ingredients. Still looking for the perfect bowl..."
4/28/2018,20180428,5,4.55,This place is just amazing the pho is the best around and the owner and his wife is just amazing!
4/30/2018,20180430,3,4.54,"I heard that this is one of the places to go to when you want pho. Looking at the menu, I can tell they seemed pretty authentic since I had no idea what the heck I was ordering. I wish they would put more English descriptions on their menu. Maybe my experience wasn't that great because I ordered delivery, but I can still give my honest opinion on the food. I placed the order, and it came pretty quickly, and the food was separated very nicely. I loved that they were very organized, and put the liquid in a separate bag. However, I just wasn't impressed with the food. - Cha Gio - Egg rolls - I liked this egg roll since it was filled with meat and not all veggies. It is hard to find a place where you don't feel like they ripped you off on the meat to veggie ratio portion in the egg rolls. It wasn't overly fried, and it wasn't disgustingly greasy.- Goi Cuon - Spring Rolls - It was three very large spring rolls in rice paper. I love spring rolls, and it came with peanut sauce that seemed pretty fresh. The only downside is that I wish they put a bit more shrimp. The other twist was that there was something in the middle where it was deep fried, where it gave it a nice crunch factor to the roll. - Bun Nem Nuong Thit Nuong Cha Gio: I think they gave me the wrong order because the description said I would be getting noodles with grilled pork and eggrolls. Instead it looked like I got noodles with spam and some kind of grilled meat. However, whatever this dish I tried was not great at all. I can pretty much eat anything, and I just could NOT eat it. The spam was gross, and the meat was really slimy...umm....no thanks. - Pho Dac Biet - This is one of those traditional Pho where it is in hot liquid. This was a combination of thin steak, brisket, and beef balls. I saw it disappear in front of my eyes as my husband ate it within minutes. He said it was good.At the end, I could not give any reflection on the service, but the food wasn't to my liking. Maybe it was too authentic for my taste, or I just hated the entrée I got since It wasn't what I ordered. However, the food could be better in some parts. I am not a fan of their meat since the texture of the one I got in my noodle was just gross. All in all, I am willing to give it another shot, but maybe I should go to the restaurant and not order to go."
5/4/2018,20180504,2,4.53,I'm only giving 2 stars because my husband enjoyed his pho. I ordered grilled beef and this is what I got. Totally not what I had in mind.Response to the owner:Your menu says GRILLED BEEF not shaking beef. If you claim to have seen me it was obvious I was a first timer. My husband asked if you had teriyaki chicken because pho is not my cup of tea and you responded with what you did have so why didn't you explain what your definition of grilled beef was??? You're so defensive with every single customer that doesn't like your food. Instead of finding excuses for your shitty food you should focus on servicing your customers and finding a solution. I was kind enough to mention my husband enjoying your pho. I shouldn't have zoomed in the pic so you could see all the other scraps I left behind. I didn't let the bad outweigh the good in your business. You have a nasty attitude and very poor customer service. I wish you the best with your business
5/4/2018,20180504,5,4.54,"Their Pho is almost as good as Pho in Vietnam! Reminds me of home when i walked in, straight smell of Pho (i walked in the wrong door at first though lol) The nooldles they use is not fresh (because most of their customers prefer dry noodles) so that's a bummer. But the broth is good, not too salty. I got #5, but will come back for their house special #3!Love the service, very friendly and nice."
5/7/2018,20180507,5,4.54,"Ktown pho is my NUMBER ONE pho restaurant in Koreatown. I have been coming here ever since it opened and it's still and will forever be my favorite. It is a family owned restaurant and the boss is extremely friendly and I love how he remembers exactly what I want and like. He seems to really take care of his customers. They have two sides, which is in the front and in the back side of the parking lot entrance. One downside is finding parking, but trust me once you try this place, you'll be driving in circles to look for parking. I usually get the spring rolls and Pho Dac Biet. Their Bún bò Hu is pretty good too if you guys like a little kick in your flavor of soup. Very interesting taste. I have yet to try their rice plates, which I will eventually try very soon. If you guys are looking for an authentic pho restaurant, I would seriously recommend this place. The broth is enriched with so much flavor and you don't feel all groggy and heavy after because of how clean the broth is. Once you start coming here, you won't be able to stop~"
5/8/2018,20180508,3,4.53,I have to say the Kobe beef is thee softest beef I've ever had in a pho. The quality of the Kobe beef made up for the lack of flavor in the broth. The broth lacked flavor and I think they use a lot of msg. Spring rolls were pretty good
5/11/2018,20180511,5,4.53,Great!!!!! Small dine in spot but very clean great decor and service was fantastic I'm guessing the owner or manager helped us great service regardless..... food was great..... perfect seasoning for the broth... will be back for sureIn case the owner reads this we were the Nissan downtown L.A. employees
5/15/2018,20180515,5,4.53,"Ktown Pho is the place! I enjoyed my first time there, will definitely come back. Prices are great as well as quantity and flavor. People working at the Restaurant are very nice too! The Beef Baguette Sandwich was a good entree to start and The Pho Dac Biet with 4 different types of Beef was insanely good!"
5/15/2018,20180515,5,4.54,All pho is not created equal but this pho was soooooo good! Hit the spot on this cold night. Great friendly service. Egg rolls and pho bac has me ready for my nightcap! I would recommend this pho spot to all my friends.
5/16/2018,20180516,4,4.53,I was glad to see ktown with more Vietnamese options because a lot of the viet places are Korean owned and the broths there are no bueno. This place offers all the classic dishes with really good quality meats. I like their sauces. They seem to be homemade and I especially loved the chili oil. I put it in everything lol. This place is not my first choice but it's combine t as I live near by. I usually street park and order Togo.
5/19/2018,20180519,5,4.54,Great pho and great customer service! We stopped by for a quick dinner with our two kids and the host/waiter was very attentive and even got my kids to eat! Their sate is a great condiment to add to your pho if you love spicy foods!
5/21/2018,20180521,3,4.53,Came to Ktown pho on a Sunday afternoon. Found some convenient street parking nearby. Pretty busy with most tables occupied. The restaurant is on the smaller side with only one waitress attending to the place. We decided to go with the house special pho and pork and egg roll vermicelli bowl and some spring rolls. We also tried the Thai iced tea with boba. The Thai iced tea was very rich and creamy and delicious. However the boba were very hard and inedible! I just left the boba on the bottom and otherwise enjoyed the drink. The pho was flavorful but not as good as other broths I've had. They really skimped on the meat which I was surprised they would do for their more expensive house special! Otherwise a very large portion but I've definitely had much better so a little disappointing. The vermicelli bowl was also pretty good but def has better. Also skimped on the pork here! Wish it was more grilled tasting but otherwise can't complain too much. Also very large portion. Last we had the spring rolls. They weren't anything special. Mostly lettuce with a small sliver of shrimp and pork but otherwise not too impressive. The peanut sauce was just mediocre. Overall I don't think I'd come back. Mama Hong's is just down the street from me and WAY better.
5/27/2018,20180527,3,4.52,Food was delicious but as far as customer service and friendless horrible we order the number 4 which was beef and chicken pho also a thai ice tea after we got our food not once did they come to see if we needed water. I literally had to stop the bust boy to ask for water. This place needs to work on there customer service and friendless.
5/27/2018,20180527,5,4.53,"I've been there 4 times for the past two months. I'm now on my way there. I've never been to Vietnam, don't ask me about authenticity. But compare to all of the Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been in Los Angeles, this place is the best. I always get the Spicy Oxtail Soup, the broth is refreshing, the meat is tender, flavor just hit all the right spot. The crispy noodle with seafood is delicious too. They keep the place clean. People who work there are friendly and kind.They never fail me. Try it for yourself! I hope you have the same great experience as I do. I rarely review anything. They didn't ask for my review either. but I feel like I owe them the credit they deserve if i don't. That's how good KTown Pho is."
5/30/2018,20180530,4,4.52,Clean and friendly pho place. Meat is fresh and the soup is delightful. You will not be disappointed with the food served there.
5/31/2018,20180531,5,4.53,"This is the most authentic Pho you can get in Ktown, LA. The owner is friendly and dedicated to turning out the best food. This place is a welcome gem from the myriad of ""Koreanized"" pho places around town. Parking is very limited. There's street parking around the area and metered along Western.Also, they are closed on Wednesdays. I have to write that down cause I always seem to come on a Wednesday."
6/3/2018,20180603,5,4.53,"You want great pho? This is the spot you won't regret! Great pho is in the soup. No extra condiments is needed unless you want it spicy and that's how the pho is here! I love coming here with my family, specially when KT is our server. He's so attentive with a good sense of humor. What I love the most is that he's great with the kids! My nephews LOVE coming here. He always gives them a little treat if they finish all their food and it always works! He just knows how to serve their plates. And you have to try their Thai tea! It's not too sweet like most places. I've also tried their spring rolls, egg rolls and Banh mi sandwiches. All of it is good! But don't take my word for it; go try it yourself! ;)"
6/7/2018,20180607,5,4.53,"The hubs and I arrived RIGHT before the lunch rush. Thank goodness for that...I always order oxtail pho whenever it's available at a pho place, and I was told that this place makes a great bowl of oxtail pho. The broth was clean, and it had a deep flavor to it that I really appreciated. The meat was tender, and overall, it was a great bowl of pho.My only grievance with this place is the parking. They're located on Western, one block away from Olympic, so street parking can be a hit or miss. But even with that limitation, the food and friendly service may make me go back when the craving hits again!"
6/8/2018,20180608,5,4.53,The hue style oxtail soup with round noodles was delicious. Nice change of pace if you're not quite in the mood for pho.
6/11/2018,20180611,5,4.53,Ordered some lunch using Postmates was craving a soup kinda meal so I order some pho it was great can't complain good food need to visit them now to try different things and see their service
6/14/2018,20180614,3,4.53,"Based on only 1 visit, so please keep that in mind when you read this review. Service: 5/5, friendly and warmParking: 3/5, only limited spaces in back. had to park 5 blocks awayOxtail Pho: 1/5 - watered down broth, tough stringy oxtail, the veggies that come on the side was very much tailored towards Korean palette who generally do not like aromatics like basil, cilantro. Came with a huge side of onions and 2 leaves of basil and a mountain of sprouts. Spring Rolls: 3/5, ok but pork smelled very porky but not in a good way :(Note to self: Won't be going back, sorry, our waitress was super nice, gave an extra star for service"
6/15/2018,20180615,2,4.52,"I am so confused and not sure this is better than any other pho places in LA. Really.....how did you get 4.5 stars?My girlfriend & I were both disappointed after we had our first dig into our pho soup. The egg rolls were disappointing, too as well as our coconut juice from fresh cut coconuts. !SAD!We were expecting just average pho noodle~~!!!Another minus factor is the parking. It is so hard to get in & out."
6/15/2018,20180615,5,4.52,"Seriously, no need to drive all the way to Alhambra anymore. Thought it could be Korean-owned based on the name and what looked to me like stock photos, but when I noticed the green onion/chive sticking out of the summer roll with a skinny crispy eggroll inside of it and the bun bo hue on the menu, it had to be legit, and it is. Their homemade sate is amazing - tastes like a perfect blend of the usual chili garlic sauce and fried chilli in oil, which I typically find at Thai restaurants."
6/18/2018,20180618,4,4.52,Good pho! Really yummy actually. I love the whole in the wall aspect! The portions are huge so don't over order as everything tastes better once fresh ;)
6/21/2018,20180621,4,4.52,"I was in the area and I finally stopped by after reading the rave reviews on Yelp.Parking in this area is awful (well as most areas are in K-town). I stopped by for lunch so it was particularly hectic and it took me at least 15 minutes to find parking.They say they have a private lot but it's hard to find and located in some small alley way and there were no spaces available (plus it looked like it would be pretty difficult to get out of those parking spots- car scratches ready to happen!).Once inside I was seated pretty immediately as it wasn't completely full. I pretty much knew what I was going to get- I ordered the oxtail pho, the summer rolls and a thai iced tea.For the oxtail pho- I thought it was pretty good, but oxtail is kinda hard to eat since you gotta suck it off the bone. It wasn't a pretty sight watching me gnaw on the bone to get the meat out. To be honest, it wasn't a lot of meat in general so it was kinda disappointing. I did like the broth which was nice and clean, not too salty. In the future I would probably get my usual option of combo meats (basically all the meat options you can get).The rolls were pretty good though- lots of flavor and I love the fish sauce (that's primarily why I ordered this, the other rolls had other dips).The service was great, they were quick and speedy and refilled my water when needed.I would have to try their other more traditional pho options to really see if this place is worth it, perhaps another time I'm in K-town!"
6/24/2018,20180624,4,4.51,"Ktown Pho is on my LA Pho list Pho-sho! I like that the name is also indicative of where it is located such that when you suggest this place with friends, you need not wonder - 'what part of town is this in?' It's simplicity is simply great. You know (1) where it is and (2) what you are getting. Though this Pho is not extremely authentic - it does not bring you to that fishing village in Hanoi - it is nonetheless a good bowl of LA (no, Ktown) style Pho. TIP: The parking in the back is quite narrow and steep, so I suggest finding street parking. Ktown Pho is in an interesting location - its signage is situated on the corner of S Western and Monette Pl. Enter the first set of glass doors and you will enter a corridor to arrive at a wooden stand. There will be a wait no matter what time of day you opt to go so be prepared to pen your name down and window gaze over the happy patrons consuming the bowls of Pho noodles under a television screen featuring an Asian music video or soap opera. Interestingly, the plaza features Ktown Pho as well as a pet store that remains, for the most part, closed. When your name is finally called, you will be greeted by a friendly staff member who will provide you with the menu of wonder-Pho eats. My choices?(1) Spring Roll - I love the spring rolls at Ktown Pho because they have the perfect proportion of shrimp to pork to rice noodle to mint and herb ratio. And the best part is that crunch of fried garlic/onion that adds a unique texture to what otherwise is a very tasty and crisp, fresh spring roll. Just like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, the spring roll is not too large or too small, but just right. (2) Pho Ga - The chicken pho was light and soothing, with a clear chicken broth base and thin noodles, complemented by chunks of chicken and a plate of bean sprouts, onions, pepper, lime and basil for each person. I love that they add onion to the mix, which is quite special as compared with other Pho restaurants. I also like that each customer receives his or her own plate of bean sprouts, onions, pepper, lime and basil accompaniments. The one minor disappointing factor? I had requested thicker northern Vietnamese style noodles which Ktown Pho previously offered. However, I was informed (to my dismay) that a previous customer had complained about the northern style Pho. As a result, it was taken off the menu. Whaaaaaaaaat? And Whyyyyyyyy?! Would someone ever complain about that? One other great point about Ktown Pho is that it has modernized its payment system such that they accept charges via their iPhones - not only was the consumption of the Pho quick, checking out was also very efficient. Ktown Pho, you have clearly un-Pho-lded your ability to cater to the need for the taste of herb and lime infused Vietnamese noodles."
6/24/2018,20180624,4,4.51,"Ordered the banh mi, house special pho, egg rolls, and sweet milk coffee. I split everything with my boyfriend and staff kindly brought out an extra bowl for us to share. We started with the egg rolls. We were kindly told that eating the egg rolls wrapped in the lettuce would taste better, and it did. But I didn't enjoy them beyond an ""it was okay.""I honestly have had better pho- the broth tasted plain and there wasn't really much in the special pho order - noodles, thinly sliced beef pieces, and the usual veggies (bean sprouts, basil, lime, onion). The banh mi was delicious and I was really satisfied with the taste. I'm extremely happy we ordered one. The baguette was crispy with adequately portioned meat, pickled veggies, mayo, and pate. The coffee tasted strong and was also delicious. Overall, the food was a mere ok. However, staff was amazing and really nice; great service. I also liked how they did the check; swiped on the phone so it was extremely fast to leave once we were done eating. Parking sucks... we ended in the parking lot for the galleria grocery building and didn't have to pay. Other than that, it's difficult to find even paid spots. The restaurant is also quite small on the inside."
6/26/2018,20180626,4,4.51,"I don't know what all the bad reviews are about. I work down the street from Ktown Pho and I eat here at least once a week. The parking is pretty bad, but it's like that everywhere in Ktown. I usually find parking on the street. As for the food, I grew up in the 626 and Ktown Pho's pho is just about as good as it's going to get in this area. I usually get the combination meat, with the rare meat on the side and it's always been pretty good. There's a lot of reviews about the owner there, but he has always been nice and polite to me, even when it was busy at the restaurant. I've also tried the shrimp spring rolls and they were really good, my coworker always gets the ox-tail pho and he said that it's good too. The food here is non-fussy and as authentic as you are going to find Vietnamese food in Koreatown. It definitely hits the spot when you want something warm but not too heavy. I always ask for the cabbage that comes with their bun bo hue instead of beansprouts and they have always been accommodating. There's usually only the owner and one other worker there so when it does get busy, it gets difficult to flag someone down, but the owner always comes by and asks how everything is, etc.I do recommend this place as I've tried other pho restaurants here in Ktown and this is honestly the best one."
7/1/2018,20180701,5,4.51,"Oh my goodness... a gem in the midst of Koreatown. I have been here before many times and came back today with my friend and was reminded of why I love this place. The exterior of the place is really small, so it's easy to drive by it. However, there is a huge sign saying Ktown Pho, so look out for it and try not to drive too slow if you don't want people to get pissed off at you. The interior is also relatively small, but very clean and you can tell that they take really good care of the restaurant. Menu wise, they not only have your spring rolls and different kinds of pho, but they also have vermicelli to bún bò hue. They are definitely there to make sure that everyone has a great taste of Vietnamese food. The price is definitely affordable, and portions are generally huge, especially the vermicelli. Speaking of the vermicelli, I ordered the eggroll and grilled pork vermicelli and my friend ordered pho tai, which is their pho dish I usually get when I go to get pho. You can order the pho bowls either in a small or large, so it's good for those who want to either share the pho bowl and try other foods. Their pho though is honestly amazing! Their broth is very fresh, and it's definitely a bowl you just want to keep eating. The vermicelli bowl is given in a generous portion and comes with sauce. The sauce is amazing, with some sweet and a hint of sour. It's also a good dish that doesn't weigh you down, but you still get full after eating it. Basically, it's pretty good. Customer service wise, yes. The owner is really nice, and they love having regulars there as well. Honestly, I give their customer service 5/5.Parking, however, is horrible. They do have a back lot, but it's really small and you need to either be really lucky to snag a spot or find a lucky street parking. But it's definitely worth trying to find parking. Or, if you live around Koreatown, definitely try Ubering there. Overall, great food at affordable prices and amazing customer service! Will come here often to fulfill my pho and vermicelli cravings :)"
7/1/2018,20180701,5,4.51,"Most legit pho in Ktown by Vietnamese American family. I recommend this place because of various options including Bon Bu Hue, Ban Mi, Boba, Fried Rice, and egg noodle. Parking is tough and limited but there are 8 tables here you could sit in. 2 two sweaters and 6 four seating tables. Enjoy"
7/5/2018,20180705,5,4.52,"Best pho place in the world. I came here 2 times a week. Love fresh fresh spring roll. Pho, of course. Try everything. Worth it!!!"
7/5/2018,20180705,5,4.52,"Pho is a good style of soup if you are a person who enjoys a nice soup now and again. It's pronounced ""fruit"" tho so make sure you really say it the right way. It doesn't come with fruit."
7/9/2018,20180709,5,4.52,This is a literal hole in the wall and it's amazing. They have a fast take out spot in the front and a sit down restaurant in the back. The pho is the best I've had in los angeles. I got oxtail soup and the meat fell right off the bone! The prices are also pretty good. Parking is street parking which can be a pain but it's worth it!
7/9/2018,20180709,5,4.52,The Best Pho in Ktown. I was looking for a more legit Viet Pho place and my prayers were answered. The summer roll is bomb and the fried rice is exceptional. Great service but parking its bit of issue
7/15/2018,20180715,5,4.52,"This place is AMAZING! We moved here from Seattle and have been disappointed with the awful Vietnamese restaurants in Santa Clarita. We are happy to drive to Ktown when we crave Pho. We ordered a variety of dishes and everything was delicious. The owner is very helpful and genuinely cheerful.We got 3 bowls of Pho (special, Oxtail and northern). We ate every last bite and left almost nothing (as you can see from the pic). The banh mi was crispy on the outside and the vegetables is fresh. We also ordered a broken rice dish and it was also delicious.Can't wait to go back! We have recommended this place to all our foodie friends. Who knew.... best pho is in Ktown."
7/15/2018,20180715,5,4.52,"Very friendly staff reasonable prices and great pho. Now take in mind that eating at the restaurant is tastier that the takeout version, still delicious. To reiterate the staff is very friendly and the restaurant itself is cute and makes for a wonderful pho experience."
7/19/2018,20180719,4,4.52,Ktown Pho was phenomenal!! The service was great and so was our waiter.! I definitely recommend this to anyone that would be in the Ktown area and had a taste for Vietnamese food!
7/20/2018,20180720,5,4.52,"I tried this place because I was curious. I eat pho probably about 5 times a year.First - I was happy to see that a Vietnamese couple own this place.Second - the food is fabulous.Best Vietnamese pho, spring rolls, and eggrolls in this area. (Ktown Los Angeles)Thank you so much! :)"
7/21/2018,20180721,5,4.53,"BOMB !One of my college roommates used to make Pho all of the time, but when I came back home to LA I couldn't find a place that made it as good as hers ... welp now I have... and it's a hole in the wall (my favorite). I got the Chicken Pho ... delicious ... I highly recommend it, and the staff are super friendly."
8/7/2018,20180807,4,4.52,"Excellent pho, especially after a long night. I ordered spring rolls and the pho dac biet. The spring rolls had a lot of herbs and wasn't overly stuffed with noodles. The pho broth was good and the amount of meat was good. I usually say no tripe when I get pho dac biet but it wasn't listed in the description in the menu so I assumed it didn't come with any but I was wrong. Service was quick and friendly. The actual entrance was a bit confusing to me when I first arrived. Walk down the hall on your left."
8/14/2018,20180814,5,4.53,The spring rolls are amazing the small pho was just enough to satisfy my appetite. Also the peanut sauce is amazing not super thick and not super loose. The servers are very patient and friendly service. Will bring my husband when I come back
8/18/2018,20180818,4,4.52,Great good and amazing service. Located on the corner the prices are reasonable and service is quick. Wait staff actually spoke Vietnamese and it was pretty authentic. I got the pho and it was good but a little bland but nothing hoisin and hot can't fix. The spring rolls were really good and they added fried onion inside which added a surprising nice crunch. I would definitely come back as this is prob the best pho in LA outside of driving far to OC or SGV. No parking but plenty of street parking
8/20/2018,20180820,5,4.53,"This place was seriously good. We ordered the veggie egg rolls and they were so fresh, hot and crispy. Chicken pho was solid with a delicious broth and fresh chicken. The surpriser was the vegan pho! It had such a flavorful broth, unlike any I've had before. I will definitely be back."
8/25/2018,20180825,2,4.52,"It took a while for them to take our order and even longer to get it. And we didn't get it our order all at the same time. One of my friends had to wait for 45 minutes to get his beef and rice. He had to sit there and watch us as we ate. When I asked for condiments for my pho (because they don't have it all at the table) the waiter was upset and sighed. Needless to say, the service sucked. And my pho had no flavor. Will not be returning."
8/26/2018,20180826,2,4.51,"Service was good, but the pho was remarkably bland. It was so bland, my friends and i are trying to understand how it is even possble for pho to be that flavorless. Also, the oxtail i got was practically inedible. Mostly just the bone/tendons...no meat. Also very bland. Everything tasted like nothing."
8/27/2018,20180827,5,4.51,"Duuude the Oxtail Bun Bo Hue is amaziiiiiinggggg!!! The best we've ever had! KT, the owner is the kindest man as well. He's so catering to your meal throughout and makes it feel like you're eating at home! 100% recommend for all to come!!"
8/31/2018,20180831,5,4.51,"Best pho in LA hands down. Family owned and they're great people. I've been coming here at least once a month since they've opened and I never have had a bad meal or a disappointing experience here. Great service, great food quality - no complaints here. If every restaurant was like this the world would be a better place."
9/5/2018,20180905,3,4.51,"Good I'm a pinch when one is craving pho or my go to: Bun thit nuong cha gio.There was a short wait on a Sunday and for some reason our name was crossed off before we were called so we had to rewrite it on the list.Staff was very nice and the water is limey and refreshing.My bun looked great but fell short on flavor. The amount of grilled pork felt stingy so maybe that contributed to the flavor or lack thereof. I did like the generous amount of lettuce and sprouts though. If you aren't a fan of crispy onions, ask for those in the side or 86 them since they do come on top.Parking lot in the back which is convenient."
9/14/2018,20180914,4,4.5,"This is my 2nd or 3rd time dining here! I ordered pho tai and spring rolls. Both tasted good but the pho broth tasted weak this time. When I tried their soup for the first time, it tasted amazing!!! It was little too oily for my liking but other than that it tasted great so I was a bit disappointed this time because the soup didn't taste as good as before. My spring rolls tasted great and the service was good. They def should hire more ppl tho. It's always understaffed. Anyway, overall this is a great place to eat and one of the best places to eat pho in town!"
9/15/2018,20180915,5,4.51,"( )ｰｰﾝ I absolutely adore this place. To be honest, Pho doesn't really excite me since I wasn't a rice noodle fan. Howeverrr, this divey place changed my perspective! Now I am dying to go back again. I would say, this is by far the best pho I've ever tasted. The soup is thick bone broth, and the meat is fresh ox tail. What more need I say? Btw, their spring roll is also amazing especially with that magical peanut butter dipping sauce! Must try. Thank me later."
9/16/2018,20180916,3,4.5,"Ordered the house special pho (Kobe beef steak), IMO the broth was a little bland and they could've cut the steak into more pieces. Nothing special. Cross off my list of restaurants."
9/21/2018,20180921,5,4.5,"THIS IS THE BEST PHO RESTAURANT EVER! HANDS DOWN! (I'm not sorry about the all caps.)I dream about the pho at this place, so much so that I go almost every day. You heard that right, EVERY SINGLE DAY. I have no regrets. The broth and noodles are out of this world. And the service is exceptional. They're just closed on Wednesdays. But I can live with that...for now. And while there is a small parking lot in the back, it may be full at peak times. There's street parking or you can probably park at the Korean market across the street and just walk over. Don't walk...run!"
9/24/2018,20180924,2,4.5,"Service: 4 out of 5Food: 3 out of 5Authenticity: 1 out of 5Walking in, I realized the staff was Viet, which is always a good sign for a Viet restaurant; however, I was not impressed at all. If you are Viet or grew up eating Viet food, this place is mediocre at best. It wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. The Bun Bo Hue was lacking in flavor and aroma. The crucial ingredient in bun bo hue is the chili oil and lemongrass. It brings out a distinct flavor that makes the dish. Not only did this dish lack lemon grass, it also was not spicy at all. When the waiter/owner (an extremely nice man btw) asked my opinion on the dish, I gave him my honest opinion. He explained that they don't add much lemongrass/chili oil because they want to cater to the Korean taste (since this place is located in Ktown). This didn't really make sense to me since Koreans also eat spices and lemongrass. I understand their perspective; however, this is supposed to be Vietnamese restaurant, not a Korean restaurant. As such, should serve authentic Viet food. If I wanted Korean food, I would go to a Korean restaurant. The Banh Mi was good, but was overpriced (Banh Mi is usually supposed to be ~$3) and wasn't authentic either. The ingredients resembled an American fusion sandwich rather than the Vietnamese Banh Mi I grew to love.I came here because a lot of people recommended it to me, the ratings were stellar, and driving all the way to OC sounded unrealistic. I might come back again out of desperation, the owner was very kind, and due to the fact that it is convenient, but I can't say I'd go out and recommend this place to others. Sadly, my search for yummy authentic Viet food in LA continues."
9/27/2018,20180927,4,4.49,"Just moved to KTown like five months ago and we discovered this place going to a friend's house and ever since , we have been hooked!! Not only is the food great but customer service is awesome; the only thing is parking is small, so you'll need to find street parking and the place itself is not that big so it's best to come when they aren't busy, but overall love this place.  I love their Bo Hue Oxtail and my boyfriend gets the Northern Pho and of course the eggrolls... I can not stress enough how flavorful the Bo Hue soup is here and I've tried it somewhere else in Chinatown and it was not as good as this one. The eggroll is like any other, nothing out of this world. The Northern PHO per my BF it's probably the best PHO in town and it's better than the Southern Pho. So I definitely recommend this place!!"
9/27/2018,20180927,4,4.49,Great service and good food? Yes please! So the front entrance is for to go orders. Keep headed towards the back and you'll see the dine in area.Small menu with typical Vietnamese treats. The seafood pho has more than enough items in it. The pho tai was perfect. The meat was good quality unlike some other places I've had it at. The pork bahn mi was perfect.Tiny parking lot but there's plenty of street parking. A must try for Vietnamese food in ktown.
9/29/2018,20180929,4,4.49,"Probably the best pho you can get on this side of town. Or the greater Los Angeles area. To get anything better, you absolutely have to get on the freeway and head east. Or south. Lol. Parking...yes, I will be the 475th person to say it...is an absolute horror. It is through a tiny alley behind the main building, and then up a small ramp. There is no other way out, except through the way you came in. Reversing the whole time. Down the ramp. Through the narrow alley. We ordered the Nem Nuong and two Pho Tai to go. Tip: Ask for the noodles uncooked and heat them up in some broth when you get home! The broth is pretty good. After having watery ""Korean"" pho in town for the last 30-something odd years, who can complain? Nem Nuong were also pretty good. Although, we weren't too crazy about the dipping sauce, which was a little heavy on the fish sauce. Will be back again!"
9/30/2018,20180930,5,4.49,"My friend and i came here for comfort food since we've been eating unhealthy for the past week and we were not disappointed. The pho soup was extremely tasty and didn't leave a salty aftertaste. The beef balls complemented the noodles well, and the overall taste was a light and comforting one. We both got the small sized dish and it filled us up perfectly. We also asked for a banh mi to-go and the owner was super friendly and considerate. He separated the vegetables because we told him it was for tomorrow, and he taught us how to heat it up so it would taste good. A small setting in ktown, but cozy and delicious. The prices are on the cheap side too. Highly recommend!"
10/1/2018,20181001,5,4.49,"Wow! I had the Bun Bo Hue duoi bo and it was so good! The oxtail was gender, the flavors rich (and you can add your own spicy level - all made from scratch)Also tried the winter rolls - delish!!If you like Vietnamese you have to come here and prices are reasonable. The only con is that the parking can be difficult and the place is small. But so worth it. And the owner was super nice. Can't wait to try other items on the menu!!"
10/2/2018,20181002,5,4.5,"I could tell even before stepping into the restaurant that the food was going to be amazing by the heavenly aroma. This truly is authentic Vietnamese food. I didn't order the pho, but just by the smell I can tell the broth is going to be amazing. When I don't know what to order, I get a little bit of everything. The owner was kind enough to take his time to explain several menu items. My friend and I split the beef spring rolls which were stuffed to the brim. Flavorful, fresh and crispy from the vegetables. I also ordered the beef banh mi and really appreciated that they didn't overcharge. I see some restaurants that charge $8+ for a banh mi, which is a little ridiculous considering in Vietnam they're literally $1. I also got the grilled pork and fried spring roll vermicelli bowl. Make sure to pour the fish sauce all over it for extra flavor. I also added in some of their homemade chili for a little heat. My friend got the Bun Bo Hue which they don't offer in a lot of Vietnamese restaurants around here. It was her first time and she is hooked!This is as good as it gets! I'm not going to take a point off, but parking is very limited (behind the restaurant) and the the restaurant is an intimate space. I'm hoping he does well and moves to a bigger location. Wishful thinking! Will definitely be back.Thank you!"
10/6/2018,20181006,5,4.5,I love the beef and seafood fried rice! This is my 2nd time here and will be coming back for more. KT the owner is awesome!
10/8/2018,20181008,4,4.5,"Another great spot to fulfill your Vietnamese cravings. Came on a Saturday around lunch time with a group of 8 and was seated right away. The space isn't all that huge, but there's additional seating at the front and outside.I always order pho at Vietnamese places, so I decided to try something else this time. Ordered the #3 (Vermicelli with Grilled Pork and Eggrolls), which I was pretty happy with, and all my friends who ordered pho seemed to be pretty happy with what they got."
10/10/2018,20181010,5,4.5,"This place is amazing! We go there almost every week. Yes, the parking mostly sucks but their bun bo hue is soooo worth it. And the service is always the best."
10/11/2018,20181011,5,4.5,Super tasty pho .! I'm very picky wn it comes to pho .. so from 1- 10 I give it a 9 .. a 9 just because I think the place is not big enough . But if you love pho I really recommend this place to you!
10/14/2018,20181014,5,4.5,"So this is legit one of the best pho places in LA. Most closely resembles the flavor of Vietnamese restaurants in Irvine. I got the bun bo hue which did not disappoint, minus the fact that they don't add pork blood cubes to it. But it makes sense with the demographics. Parking in the rear and I will be coming back. But I will say the highlight of this place was the service... I know; at an Asian restaurant the service stood out positively? Yes! Our waiter was extremely friendly and conversational and instructive to my friends. Loves seeing the interaction and would recommend."
10/19/2018,20181019,2,4.49,"Everything was very bland. Price are decent for the LA area, but the noodles were just okay, and the soup had no taste. The utensils were washed in some sort of bleach because the stench was repulsive. I asked for another spoon, but that one too had a bad smell so we had to make do without spoons. I don't know how everyone else had great reviews for this place, but I'm assuming most were for service. My viet friend who I came here with told me that the best authentic pho places had bad reviews due to the lack of good service. But the food there is good. So I won't be targeting 4-5 star pho restaurants in the LA area anymore."
10/20/2018,20181020,5,4.49,Love the spring rolls! So fresh and a bit crunchy inside. I had an ox tail pho. Reasonable price with large portion!!!
11/2/2018,20181102,5,4.5,"Best pho in ktown. Hands down. Friendly staff and owners who actually care about the quality of the food they serve and customers who eat it. My kids love coming here. They provide small bowls that are more suitable for kids. Unfortunately there's no kids menu. I've talked to the owner about making one, you should too. Let's peer pressure him into adding a kids sized pho/combo :)Sure, parking sucks but for good food you make it work."
11/3/2018,20181103,4,4.49,"Giving a 4 star because the workers were pretty friendly. The food didn't really satisfy my cravings for pho though :(. I had been craving pho for over a month and finally went. I already ate dinner right before going, so friend and I shared a large rare steak pho (pho tai) ($9.99) and an order of fried egg rolls (4 for $6.49). The pho was a lot sweeter than I'm used to. Compared to the pho back at home in Washington state, the broth was sweeter and blander. I've only tried this place and one other place when it comes to pho in LA, so I can't really compare it to how pho tastes around SoCal. But yeah, I was underwhelmed. I would give the beef pho a 3/5 and the egg rolls a 3.5/5. My friend taught me how to wrap my egg rolls. I always thought the lettuce and veggies that came along with the egg rolls on the plate was just for decoration LOL. I was like, ""Why do they give such big lettuce for decoration.."" and my friend was so confused hahhaha. Use the lettuce + cilantro + carrots to make an egg roll wrap!! Put the egg roll inside the romaine lettuce and dip it in sauce :) It's even better this way! The egg rolls themselves are really small haha. The workers don't really go out of their way to be friendly but they were friendly when asked to do something. The older man in the kitchen was so adorable :). The restaurant itself is tiny, so don't come here if you have a larger group. There was one table of four and two tables for two. We got lucky and found street parking right by it though."
11/4/2018,20181104,5,4.5,Wish they had better parking but easily the best pho place in k town. Owner I think takes a personal approach to running the place you can really feel it.
11/9/2018,20181109,5,4.5,DELICIOUS. The Autumn Rolls & Spring Rolls Were Absolutely Delicious. The broth for the Pho was savory!
11/11/2018,20181111,5,4.5,Best pho in Ktown. Hands down. Spring rolls have the little crunchy egg roll skins in them. The sauce is perfect. The pho broth is clean. The restaurant is small so there will probably be a wait. But the turnaround time is fast. I predict a new large location move soon. These guys will out grow this little place if not already. We will be back!!
11/13/2018,20181113,5,4.5,"great service and food. soup in pho felt cleaner than others. definitely, will be returning."
11/15/2018,20181115,5,4.5,"This place serves great Pho in the area in a no-frills, intimate restaurant. My go-to is the veggie with tofu that comes with big yummy mushrooms, baby corn, broccoli, carrots, spinach along with an optional vegan broth or the heartier beef based one. Parking in the back, restaurant through the back of the entrance, also some decent appetizer options like the spring rolls."
11/25/2018,20181125,5,4.5,"BEST PHO I've had in Los Angeles. Wish I knew about this place earlier. Oh and did I mention that they have bahn mi sandwiches for $5.50!!!!!! Say what? I'll tell you what to say--""KTOWN PHO!""My recommendation is the House Special! You will not regret it. If you do, you need your taste buds examined. Thoroughly."
11/26/2018,20181126,4,4.5,"Great food, great service, terrible parking and closes at 9pm. Good luck with that. The pho bahn mi and chicken fried rice was on point. Here's a tip, have someone in your party sign your name while you search parking."
11/27/2018,20181127,5,4.5,"This is probably the best soup I have ever tried here in Korea town... the flavors are really delicious, they put a lot of meat,the service is fast and even though they have a waiting list is not bad, onece you get the table the service is fast, the service is excellent! Victoria is so nice she got a good customer service skills!! I definitely recommend this place specifically if you want to eat soup with this whether."
11/29/2018,20181129,5,4.5,Best pho in k town. Come at least 2 times a week.Try it out. Won't regret... Better yet. You willbe hooked.
12/4/2018,20181204,5,4.51,"Hands down, some of the best pho I've ever had! All of the ingredients were fresh and came in a decent portion size. The noodle to broth ratio was perfect! The broth was amazing! I have no complaints about this place. It gets pretty crowded and the location is small, but service is pretty quick."
12/4/2018,20181204,3,4.5,"Nice people, easy to order for pick up over the phone. But I was disappointed in this broth. Did I come on an off day? Too early in the day? I expected a phenomenal broth based on reviews here but I didn't get it. Disappointed. Pork banh mi very tasty. Also, do not pay attention to any menu pics here on Yelp as the prices are completely different. I wish I hadn't paid $9 for this small pho to go but I wanted to try this place because of the reviews, so I did. I will go back for the sandwich. Have not had a pho in LA that I absolutely love yet. Still the best I've had is in Toronto."
12/11/2018,20181211,5,4.5,Everyone knows it's hard to get a taste of authentic pho in this area. If anything we would need to go to Chinatown.I'm glad Ktown pho is here to stay. There is usually a long wait (don't come hangry) and don't expect to find any parking. Very small lot for a couple of cars. You're going to have to find street parking. I love how they have a variety of spring rolls and this is the closest I can get to Brodard's summer roll. I also like their banh mi sandwiches. They are on the smaller side so be aware one might not do you in.
12/20/2018,20181220,2,4.5,"Came through on my last day in LA based off the strong recommendations from other Yelp reviewers. Immediately upon arriving, there were some red flags: a public health rating of B, a loud and rambunctious dog grooming facility next door. Nonetheless, it was packed, so we put our names on the list. Soon we were seated at a 4-top in the middle of the restaurant. We ordered some food and waited. The service time was pretty quick, and the pork banh mi very tasty. The baguette seemed freshly baked, though it really tore up the roof of my mouth.And then there's the pho. Major disappointment. The broth was weak and oily; the noodles, overcooked. I also felt like the provisions of sprouts, cilantro, and jalapeños were insufficient. The rare steak was tasty, but hardly able to compensate for the utter lack of any other redeeming qualities. I had hoped to try some really good pho in LA, but this ain't it. Happy to see that other people have enjoyed their experiences here, but it wasn't for me. At least it's cheap."
12/20/2018,20181220,5,4.5,"So it was my first time having pho and I did my research to find a place near by. I had such a good experience I can say the only bad thing about this place is parking, they do have parking in the back but it's very small so we had to park outside , but then again where do you find parking in ktown? I had the pho tai. It was delicious. It's a very small place but we didn't have to wait. The highlight of this place has to be the service. Our server was very nice and funny. Next time I go I will try their sandwiches only 5.99 :0"
12/23/2018,20181223,5,4.5,"We should have posted this sooner but we didn't want word getting out. Looks like it's too late for that now. This place is amazing. The owner is so friendly and consistently provides amazing service (believe me we go all the time and he remembers us every time). In addition to delicious pho broth they also use high quality meat which is difficult to find in some of the more authentic mom and pop pho spots. The ban mi is the best. The beef is, again, high quality and the baguette is crispy and doughy. We've also had the fried rice and egg rolls--all so good. Honestly, we are so happy this place opened. It was difficult getting good pho around here that wasn't loaded with MSG and crappy meat. I really hope they expand soon, the owner shared how he'd like to expand and it sounded really good. So if sharing how amazing this place is means we'll get another KTown pho shop, then so be it. Oh, one last thing because I just love this. The owner has a trick for getting picky kids to try pho. It actually worked on our super picky eater so give it a try!!"
12/27/2018,20181227,2,4.49,"I honestly don't understand the hype of this place. Yeah, the setup and interior was clean, but the pho itself was quite disappointing. The pho was really bland and lacking in many aspects. I will say that the rare steak was alright and the noodles were just okay. The reason I gave two stars was because the summer roll was delicious. I don't know about the sauce being so thin and tasteless, but the roll itself was delectable. Probably won't be coming here again for the pho, but perhaps for the rolls!"
12/30/2018,20181230,5,4.49,"Love their meatball pho and spring rolls! So yummy, and the staff of so friendly and attentive Can't wait to come back!"
1/4/2019,20190104,5,4.49,"Amazing service and amazing food! Definitively would recommend! Phenomenal egg rolls, house pho with kobe wagyu beef and bun bo hue with oxtail! Absolutely delicious!"
1/5/2019,20190105,5,4.5,"I've been looking for a good Pho place since moving to LA. This place really hits the spot. It's been a little challenging finding an authentic Pho, Vietnamese place. The food is great. Friendly staff. My go to Vietnamese restaurant."
1/5/2019,20190105,3,4.49,More like 2.75 stars. Hard to find good Pho in LA. Actually it's damn near impossible especially in Ktown. With that said just gotta suck it up and just try it and be disappointed. The pros: 1. Got a seat fairly quickly with it being such a small spot. 2. The staff is friendly. 3. The waiter happily gave me more basil and lime and didn't make a big fuss about it. The cons: 1. The broth is flavorless/bland and was hard to eat. The broth is the key and if that is off it automatically is going to go downhill from there. I got the rare slice beef and the pieces were so small and very few that I had to stir my bowl multiple times to find them. 3. They have a B rating (not unusual in this neighborhood). Anyways don't expect anything great. It was whatever.

1/6/2019,20190106,5,4.48,"As many reviews as this place already has, I never felt the need to leave a review...however, since this is by far my favorite pho place in the US, I think I have to write a review.Ktown Pho, is the place I now compare all my pho to. I am living in the east coast now, and I alway make a stop at Ktown Pho anytime I go back to LA. The soup is so good that even if I didn't have my usual fixings, which includes a generous amount of lime and garlic chili, I would still be happy with Ktown Pho's soup served as is. I usually get the Pho Tai, but I have had the Hue style soup, and also delicious. Everything that I've had there as good. The food is excellent and unparalleled. The only downside to this place is that it is soooo busy...all the time. I wish there was more seating, otherwise, I just turn to ordering the food to go. Thank you Ktown Pho for your amazing pho!"

I would definitely come back to this location!The Vietnamese iced tea was a favorite!THE STAFF were friendly and quick. They were very efficient in bringing our food out and also ringing us up.

I think this place is the best Vietnamese food in Ktown. There is parking in the back. Good service too!"

1/22/2019,20190122,5,4.49,"Im no pho expert, but I've tried pho at a few different places and none of them get as bomb as Ktown Pho. Their house special is out of this world with the tender Kobe beef, and the lemony (is that even a word?) broth. I've never strayed from ordering that and the spring rolls which are just as yummy! I'm sure their other menu options are equally great. The one thing that is a downer is that parking can be tricky, so be prepared to circle the block a few times if you don't find a spot in their lot (up a hill in an alley). Once you get your food though, you'll find that braving the parking situation is worth it."
1/23/2019,20190123,4,4.49,"Ktown pho is a great neighborhood spot. Definitely the best pho in the area which is nice because I don't like driving to the SGV or OC every time I want good Vietnamese food, which is often. I usually go with the pho tai which is a norther style pho. A more tenderized meat and thin slices of ginger. It definitely hits the spot when you need that beefy cinnamony coriander broth. Spring rolls are solid and the service is not bad. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the hood and need a pho fix."

We both had the special Kobe beef pho mine was with xtra noodles and xtra beef. The broth was perfect. Had a citrus infused flavor. The noodles were great and the beef was tender and super tasty. Amazing! Plus the service was excellent. The servers were on top of it and they were very friendly. Will be coming back for sure..."
1/30/2019,20190130,4,4.49,"Pho is good, all the fried rolls are good, they just need to do something about the fried beef cubes; it comes with like 7 small pcs of meat for $12. Overall, I would recommend everything but the beef cubes."
2/3/2019,20190203,5,4.49,"Love this place it is my go to pho Place on a nice rainy day or when I'm feeling a little down under the weatherThe wait staff is amazing, you are practically seated immediately and receive your food within 15 minutes or less after ordering.As far as the food the Pho broth comes out nice and hot, the noodles are not over cooked or soggy, and the side veggies are fresh. I have no complaints and will return again."
2/4/2019,20190204,5,4.49,"Best filet pho in town. Such a quaint little place in an inconspicuous building. Such a gem. Also - the most interesting, unique - tangy and sweet - plum soda. Loved everything about it!! The waiter was so nice and recommended my meal - always trust the waiters recommendation."
2/7/2019,20190207,3,4.48,"Lovely little spot. Pho broth is good. Grilled pork in the fresh rolls tastes slightly more like Korean grilled pork than Vietnamese, but delicious nonetheless, though this isn't a Korean restaurant masquerading as a Vietnamese one. Their bun bo hue here is legit, deeply funky and fish sauce-laden. There's a funny thing that everyone in this particular restaurant seems to do, putting sriracha (and sometimes hoisin) on there onions and the putting the onions in the soup, rather than putting it straight into the broth. Never seen anyone do that before, but nearly every person in the restaurant did so, and I loved seeing it. Nice service, quick for lunch. Will come back for the oxtail pho!"
2/7/2019,20190207,3,4.48,I was not impressed by this pho place. It was nice and convenient but it's obviously no MP or SMV pho. I probably won't come back. Staff is nice though.
2/9/2019,20190209,3,4.48,Was really excited to try this place as the reviews were stellar-- found it to only be okay. The noodles are not the best texture I've had after having pho all across the U.S.
2/20/2019,20190220,4,4.48,"Just wanted to update my review cause I ordered the pho during my last visit. I got the Pho Tai with rare steak, which was pretty good. The large was more than enough food.The server working the back room was really funny and nice. I accidentally spilled my water before I got my food. (Yeah I know, I really shouldn't be let out in public.) He said it was totally fine and moved me over to a new table and got everything cleaned up real quick. Thanks for making me not feel like an idiot!"
2/28/2019,20190228,3,4.47,"This place is MSG overload. I could barely walk out of this place without almost knocking out from overdosing on salt. Service is great, I appreciate them trying to get your food out as quickly as possibly as you could be waiting to get your food here. However, please dial down on your msg. They use good ingredients, let those flavors do their magic. I get the combo with the flank (one of my favorite jelly like cuts of meat) but the broth was way too salty. Reminds me of when I accidentally gulped the water from the dead sea. There is a reason why there are no fishies swimming in that sea.TIP: if you are dragged out here by your friends who think this place is bomb, make the broth bearable by adding a ton of limes, extra cilantro, a bit of hot sauce, and some hot water."
3/4/2019,20190304,5,4.47,This place is great. Price is great. Food are delicious. I am a sucker of delicious food and good price. WINNER WINNER WINNER. love this place. The restaurant is medium size and ok for kids.
3/5/2019,20190305,5,4.47,I give it five stars and haven't even been there yet. It's the only Vietnamese restaurant with Bun Bo Hue in KTOWN!!!!!!!! Just that alone has it my regular spot nowEdit after eating the #12 bun bo hue. It's 12 dollars A little steeper than most Vietnamese restaurant but considering it is in ktown the price is what's normal around here. The broth I give 4/5. The main part was the oxtail. It was fire. Meat drop off the bone fire. Quantity for price. I would say the portion is smaller than most average bun bo hue place. For 9 bucks in china town I can get a large with double the portion. I still give the place a 5/5 for being one of the few authentic Vietnamese restaurants. I will def go here again.
3/5/2019,20190305,5,4.48,"Best pho in LA. I've tasted them all. LA, Valley, west LA, OC, Torrance, Gardena, Alhambra, pasadena..Ive been all over China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand..No PHO beats KTOWN Pho. Go try it. Lunch time is super busy."
3/6/2019,20190306,5,4.48,"Best Authentic Pho in Los Angeles. They're closed on Wednesday's- I know this because I'm always craving it on a Wednesday and they are closed! Boo-boo!!! The food is wonderful here. Service is great. EVERYTHING is good!! pho, bun no hue, Banh Mi, Cha Ga, Nem Neung!!! I'm just glad I do not have to drive all the way to Orange County for the real deal."
3/11/2019,20190311,5,4.48,Legit Vietnamese pho!!!Best banh mi in town!!
3/11/2019,20190311,5,4.48,What a wonderful place. The food was amazing. The guys that work in this please are amazing and very helpful. The taste of the food is wonderful fresh and yummy! I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends. I'm going to come here very often.
3/12/2019,20190312,5,4.48,Best pho in ktown!Legit Vietnamese pho - you know it's legit when Vietnamese people are preparing your food!Only downside is the parking that is hard to find. The summer roll is fresh and crunchy. One of the best pho places I have been to~
3/14/2019,20190314,4,4.48,"Probably the most authentic pho in la, a bit far from downtown but it's worth the drive They have their special which is filet or Kobe not 100% sure Combination pho Also have bun bo hue - which is a Vietnamese beef noodle soup (so delicious) And a lot of rice dishes Family owned the couple is super sweet"
3/17/2019,20190317,5,4.48,Tried this place out for the first time today. They didn't disappoint. Great food can't wait to go back.
3/21/2019,20190321,5,4.48,"I came to Ktown pho to help my boyfriend best his cold. It was a little having a restaurant split into two, but once we sat down(they sat us really quickly) we had a wonderful experience. The staff was super nice and gave us suggestions on how to eat our egg rolls like they do in Vietnamese culture & how to make our pho spicer. We'll definitely be back."
3/25/2019,20190325,4,4.48,"we stopped in for a quick light lunch, I ordered the tofu bahn mi and I enjoyed it. My husband ordered a the vermicelli bowl, and it was good but could have had more meat. The pho looked delicious. It's a small place, and seems to be very popular as there was a line shortly after we were seated."
3/29/2019,20190329,5,4.48,"It's been awhile since I came here and it never disappoints me! The BunBoHue Oxtail here is the best one in LA, I haven't tried one that meets the level this soup is at in my radar. The customer service is great! I love this place!!! My soul is satisfied..."
3/30/2019,20190330,5,4.48,"My Pho game up until early 2017 lacked profusely due to one bad experience and a few 'I already know this isn't going to be good' outings to follow.Ktown Pho, however, became the spot that changed that mindset completely. Attentively gracious service is accompanied by a hearty bowl of Pho [House Special] with all the fix-ins; rice noodle, thin sliced Wagyu steak fillet beef, cilantro, bean sprouts, onions, basil, jalapenos and limes.The servings are large and can easily serve two people per bowl. That said, the Pho here is so mouthwateringly delicious your mind frame will go back to your youth and the bowl of Pho is ""MINE, MINE"".Aside from my girlfriend, the owner is one of my favorite people to encounter in Koreatown. He's friendly, always recognizes us, and makes his customers feel like regulars. It frequently gets crowded here - but don't let that deter you from putting you name on that wait list. Everything here is fresh, affordable and tasty - which outweighs a little wait.Pro Tip: Be prepared to smell like Pho til' ya get home, so add a layer you can take off after you indulge. FYI: The House Special served at Ktown Pho officially turned me into a fan of Pho over Ramen."
3/30/2019,20190330,5,4.49,Good pho and most importantly clean and fresh ingredients. Had house special pho and veggie rolls. Both were very good. Rolls were warm too. Parking in the back.
4/6/2019,20190406,4,4.48,"Had this in my bookmark to try out when I'm at LA. the bowls are enormous. The size of the restaurant is quite small. The service is great! The parking is very hectic but we got there on time to grab a good spot. The food, its pretty good. We got the house special which has Kobe beef. Them meat was so good that it melted! However, the broth was a little bland. I came in with my boyfriend, who is Vietnamese. I noticed that both of us were always putting extra stuff in our bowls. The broth could be more flavoring it just seemed abit bland."
4/12/2019,20190412,5,4.49,Best pho I've ever had in my life!!! The oxtail pho show should not be missed. Excellent service. Sooooooo dumb good! Yes! Tiny place but very clean.
4/18/2019,20190418,5,4.49,"In the last several years, the Korean run pho restaurants in Ktown have been getting progressively worse and worse. The basil and sprouts are always wilted and rotten, and it just feels very dirty inside. My husband and I discovered Ktown Pho by chance and it's now our favorite spot to go to whenever we are in the area. We're not huge fans of the oxtail pho, but everything else is great. I think we just like when the oxtail meat is picked apart for you rather than getting it whole. :) As other reviewers have stated, parking is crap. There's a tiny lot in the back and so your best hope is to find metered or street parking."
4/21/2019,20190421,5,4.49,"This hit the spot because I was having insane allergies and needed to clear them. I need to go back and have a full experience. I just needed to find an alternative to the pho spots by me because the pho spots by me are so bad. I am so tired of mediocre pho. Ktown pho is great if you live mid-city because it's not that far and it's better than all of the options closer to me. Do yourself a favor and avoid every pho place in weho for convenience and drive the extra 15 minutes to this spot. They have a tiny parking lot, so you'll have to get lucky for a spot and it's not easy to get out, especially if 1. there is someone waiting to get in and 2. there is another person waiting to get out - both of these things happened to me while I was there."
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.49,"So good! Had the spring tools and chicken bahn mi, totally satisfying on a warm spring day like this. The staff is very friendly and attentive (our server was so nice). The ""hole in a wall"" vibe only adds to the charm. Will definitely be back to try more."
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.49,Pho was amazing and everyone working there was super friendly! We always had someone there that could answer questions or get us refills. The only downside is that the parking is very sparse but there's a garage a couple blocks down that isn't too bad of a walk.
5/1/2019,20190501,5,4.49,"Had some terrible pho nearby the day before, so I had to replace that experience and boy did I find the right place. The reviews were so over the top that I had to try it out. Even for a party of 2, we had to wait 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon, partly because the seating area is very small - 6 tables that seats maybe 20. The pho was huge, the soup base was AMAZING, the beef was cut thin and perfectly raw when they brought it out, and even the bean sprouts and cilantro were good. Definitely going back there as my go-to pho spot."
5/6/2019,20190506,2,4.49,This place was refer from my co worker location very difficult to park small tiny alley parking the lady prepping spring rolls behind counter No gloves umm it's kind of outrageous not wearing glove when you are literally prepping food.Banmi sandwhich was very mediocre not flavorful sauce for spring roll were not good at all I guess this Vietnamese Pho place is authentic compared to other K-town Pho but overall rating was not a place I would want to come back.
5/8/2019,20190508,5,4.49,"I'm not really into pho, but this is probably the best I've had. I came with my partner, and he had the house special. The noodles were nice and chewy and the beef was tender, but the soup was amazing. The broth tasted different than any other pho I've had, not too sweet with hints of cinnamon. I had the spicy rice noodle soup, which was not particularly spicy but was very good. I think the recipe is the creation of the chef, and the noodles are handmade. The waiter was super nice as well."
5/18/2019,20190518,4,4.49,"Pho broth tasted good, not too oily and portion was large. However, it was mostly noodle and broth, the meat portion in the pho is too little for the price. Egg rolls were crispy and delicious. Vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls was delicious. The chicken with tomato rice was horrible. The rice was hard and inedible. Service was prompt and attentive. Appetizers arrived quickly. Water was not automatically served; it needed to be requested.Parking space in the back was limited and tight, but street parking wasn't hard to find."
5/25/2019,20190525,5,4.49,Hands down best Bun Bo Hue in town!! Craving satisfied. Authentic Vietnamese food in the heart of Ktown.
5/25/2019,20190525,5,4.49,Live this place i go here with my sister shrimp pho is definitely the go to. Took my bf here he got the meat pho n did not like it (hes a ramen lover so he expected ramen???) anyways bomb spot and the shrimp rolls deerlish!!!
5/26/2019,20190526,5,4.49,Amazing. Total hole in the wall this spot with killer pho and other traditional Vietnamese dishes. Very nice and attentive staff. Parking is really bad so plan on walking a couple blocks but there are a couple spots in the back.
5/28/2019,20190528,3,4.49,"I was craving pho and this is the only spot of heard of in Ktown so I decided to give it a try. It's a super small spot with very little parking in the back (literally like 5 spots). Pho is pretty basic in my opinion but what do I know. The service isn't so good. Our food took a while and they kept apologizing so obviously they knew they were in the wrong. Maybe I'll give this spot another try one day, not too sure."
5/29/2019,20190529,4,4.48,Great food! I would give it 5 stars but last time I went there was a B rating and the portions to go are drastically different to what you get when dining in. Great pho (concentrated broth yummy) and spring rolls! Servers are nice and attentive. Small location and parking.
6/2/2019,20190602,4,4.48,"Ktown Pho is close by to me and very clean. The only drawback is that the parking lot is very tiny so your chances of finding a spot is slim unless you go during slower hours.The flavor is there and and so is the service. Especially after they changed ownership. However, the meat quality of the brisket was unsatisfacotory. It consisted of the very chewy parts that barely have any meat. They also forgot to put the meatballs in my order, but when I brought it to their attention it was fixed.I like how Ktown Pho has sate sauce as many pho places do not offer that. The nem neuong was also surprisingly good, almost comparable to, dare I say, Brodards??? I am curious to see how the bun bo hue is. Might try that next time."
6/5/2019,20190605,5,4.48,Really great pho. Fast service . Much better than I expected actually. Coming back soon
6/6/2019,20190606,5,4.49,"I love soup Moved to Koreatown a while back, found this place out a few days ago, pho is amazing here, taste fantastic, nice guy at the front desk will be coming back for sure."
6/12/2019,20190612,5,4.49,This is seriously the best pho I have ever ever had in the 3 years I've been living here in California! Hands down and the vegetable egg rolls are to die for
6/29/2019,20190629,5,4.49,"There are great pho spots in Longbeach and in the 626...In Ktown out could be a HIT or MISS HOWEVER, this spot literally blew me away!Barbeque Pork Bahnmi with extra veggies are jalapenos are on point with the crisp of the baguette and tender, perfectly seasoned pork. Boba Time spots don't even compare to what this spot serves for Thai Ice Tea with boba. For coffee lovers, this is not filtered or watered down...it is strong and flavorful!Their Special pho with kobe is absolutely tender... noodles al dente and broth balanced ....My official Ktown spot for Pho"
7/1/2019,20190701,5,4.49,I've been to 7-10 Pho places in LA. This one is literally the best. Food quality and taste is ridiculously good. My favorite part is how the servers and owner remember me by name and what I usually order so I don't even have to tell them what I want anymore. It's a family owned business so they're very kind and friendly. Give them a try!
7/8/2019,20190708,4,4.49,Loved the pho and summer roll here! I'm so glad I live close by. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. Perfect portion. All the staffs were friendly too.This will be my go to pho place now. Want to try their rice plates and vermicelli...and everything else. Highly recommend.
7/8/2019,20190708,5,4.49,"One of our favorite spots to go in Ktown, legit Vietnamese owners that cooks authentic Vietnamese cuisine. My go to, phobanhmi (pork or beef) Vermicelli noodles (beef or pork) Fresh Coconut water"
7/14/2019,20190714,5,4.49,"Best pho in town in my opinion. Parking sucks so if you live close, walk or get lucky with street parking. Prices are great and so are the portions. Ive had multiples of their pho. Pho's always good. Their bun thit nuong isn't as great but pretty good and refreshing. Looking forward to trying other items. Can't think of any downsides for this place aside from parking. The restaurant is kind of small but that's about it. Service is so nice!"
7/20/2019,20190720,5,4.49,"The pho here is amazing! Very good balance of flavors, meat was tender and not dry at all, service was quick and friendly. Will definitely be back!"
7/22/2019,20190722,5,4.49,"The food was beyond delicious! I got the chicken and egg roll vermicelli bowl, it was extremely fresh and flavorful. Everything was cooked perfectly, the noodles were spongey and the egg rolls were crisp. There was a hint of ginger somewhere and that was a delicious surprise, all the flavors were unique and distinct. Food was 10/10, server was nice."
8/1/2019,20190801,4,4.49,"Better pho place in LA. Owned by Vietnamese, this place offers flavorful broths. I usually get the pho ga (chicken pho) and it never fails. The only issue is parking. Koreatown is limited in parking space and during peak hours, street parking can be very difficult to find."
8/4/2019,20190804,3,4.49,"As much as their pho good their seafood rice is bad. I've tried their pho Thai at restaurant and it was very good. I've took away in box their seafood rice and was very disappointed. In rice were 3 shrimp, a few crab sticks and something like thin slices of dry and antasty fish. A few days ago I eat rice with seafood in other restaurant and it was with five shrimp, octopus, squid and mussel. It was much cheaper and very teasty."
8/4/2019,20190804,4,4.49,The food was okay but the staff was great and very friendly :) we surprisingly found parking very easily
8/9/2019,20190809,4,4.49,Amazing food I can't wait to go back. Hands down the best Seafood Pho in LA at the moment. Very limited seating prob 20 in their dining portion of the restaurant. The front dining area is extra laid back cool for ordering something to go. Would've gave it 5 stars but I may have came when it was understaffed for slightly slower service but the food is well worth it. My fave PhO spot right now for sure. Coming back for more next week.
8/11/2019,20190811,1,4.48,I ordered their number 8 under the rice dish part of the menu. It was beef with fried rice on the side . I ordered it for take out. My food looks like left overs. I will probably not order any food from here again. My dish looks sad . Waste of money and my time.
8/14/2019,20190814,5,4.48,"Best pho in Ktown and really all of LA. I lived right around the corner so I came here frequently. I also lived in Vietnam for a while so this was an authentic treat! I typically get bun bo hue because that's my favorite dish, but I've tried other dishes on the menu and they are all awesome!"
8/18/2019,20190818,4,4.48,"Coming here made me want to eat meat again! Having just come back from Vietnam, this place felt so close to the real deal. The only non meat item on the menu is the veggie banh mi, which was very yummy and full of flavor. My friends got the chicken and a beef pho and both really enjoyed the food. The service was friendly and prices are very reasonable. Would defo stop in here again."
8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.48,"I don't think I really know what authentic Vietnamese food is supposed to be like but I'd imagine it's something like the food they have at Ktown Pho. We come here bc it's close, but I'm sure we'd go out of the way to come here for some good Viet food. Their food is good and fresh, and whether or not it's authentic , I'm a big fan of it (but I think it's authentic based on our friends' comments). We came here yesterday with a group of friends and some of us had a few different requests with our orders (i.e. we had a Vegan friend who asked for no mayo, no milk products, etc). Despite the large order, I'm pretty sure they got every single order correct. It's always a plus to have good service to make the dining experience even better, even though the food itself is worth going for.I debated between a four star and a five star, but their coffee pushed it over the edge to a five. It's worth all the jitters you'll get to have the Vietnamese coffee here (either black or with condensed milk)."
8/23/2019,20190823,5,4.48,Best pho in Koreatown. Big portions and everything tastes authentic and good. Banh mis are pretty banging too so make sure you get them too. This is the only pho place I come to anymore because it's that good!!!
9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.48,"First time trying pho and it was great experience. The place was small but roomy, very clean, and service was great and respectful. I ordered a pho bowl with 3 kinds of meats, maybe that was my fault but it tasted very forced if that makes sense. They had a lot of toppings to put on maybe to much, in this case less is more. But overall it was great! The eggrolls and the house sauce were definitely my favorite. I'll definitely consider coming here again, or be recommending."
9/9/2019,20190909,4,4.48,"The Pho was not bad, it was a good place to have lunch if you feel like eating vietnamese food. Hard to find where to park as expected from LA area."
9/11/2019,20190911,5,4.48,"Everyone needs a go-to Pho spot, and I'm glad that I've found mine here. The prices are decent and the food is delicious. The menu is extensive and I find myself ordering pho for dinner and grabbing a banh mi after to eat for lunch the next day.Now the pho itself is just average, but the sate sauce on each table is what makes it magic. It's not terribly spicy and gives the broth a kind of subtle back end heat at the end of each bite. It's the kind of thing I wish other pho spots would have (though it's possible I wasn't looking). The restaurant is broken into two separate parts: one for to-go orders with few tables and the actual restaurant. The staff is very nice and will refer you where to go! Parking in the area can be a little hard. Seems like street parking is the only way to go."
9/12/2019,20190912,5,4.48,"Space is kinda small, but its clean and we'll organized. Spring rolls is good to me as well as Pork Chop plate. You can sense pretty good Vietnamese foods in Korean Town."
9/17/2019,20190917,5,4.48,"Best pho I've ever had, and I'm annoying about pho. This place is unassuming but a real find. The staff is incredibly sweet, service is fast, but the pho broth is BEYOND. You'll die."
9/27/2019,20190927,4,4.48,"This is my favorite Pho place in Ktown.... which the competition isnt that great... keep it simple here so i enjoy it. First, shit parking but its parking if youre lucky and get a spot. Be prepared for an asshole to close you in though if youre one of the first cars. But as for the pho, def the best here. I really only get Pho Ga (chicken) and its tasty and the chicken isnt tough at all. Very soft delicious white meat [= havnt tried anything else. Oh the Vietnamese coffee is always good after a nice meal"
9/29/2019,20190929,5,4.48,"Best pho I've ever had. Giant bowl (house specialty- only made it 1/2 way through). Kind, accommodating, family owners. No wait time either- my dad is something of a pho snob and said he'd have gladly waited over an hour. The broth marinates for more than a day, can't recommend enough."
10/3/2019,20191003,5,4.49,"I'd say this is the best Pho place in ktown! I'm willing to come even though the parking is horrible (that means a lot).The restaurant itself is pretty small so it can get crowded. I try to avoid peak hours. If you come during the busier times, be prepared to write your name down and wait. I usually get the combination pho ($10) - it's huge and very filling!! The broth is very rich and flavorful - legit pho! (not watered down, like some other places in ktown)Today I went with my mom who is a light eater so we shared the combo pho and I ordered a pork banh mi. It was really good too :)This is my go-to pho place. I usually come here with my family but I've also been here with my friends. My non-pho eating friends have ordered different things on the menu and it seems like their non-pho items are good too! ex) vermicelli bowls, meat plates, etc.Reasonable prices, great food, friendly service, well-managed and clean!! I highly recommend Ktown pho!PARKING: limited metered parking on western, free but competitive residential street parking, they also have a tiny lot in the back too."
10/6/2019,20191006,5,4.49,"I'm very particular about my pho because 1) I'm Vietnamese and 2) I grew up in San Diego where we had great authentic pho and visited Westminster and Garden Grove as a kid too often.If you ever want authentic pho, I recommend going to Ktown Pho. It is not my all time favorite pho restaurant, but it is the best in Koreatown. Almost every single pho restaurant in Koreatown is Korean-owned, and I feel as if there's always some missing ingredient that doesn't make the pho taste like pho. Usually the noodles at other restaurants are boiled for too long, the broth is salty, the broth doesn't taste like pho broth, or there are missing toppings like mint and onions. I like getting the Dac Biet here at Ktown Pho. Their egg rolls are good too and you can also get banh mi. If you want fresh squeeze lemonade, they have it here! There are lots of different Vietnamese dishes you can try here, not just pho.Parking is horrendous here, and it may be difficult to find street parking, but it's worth it!"
10/7/2019,20191007,4,4.49,"This place does make an excellent bowl of pho and that is its most redeeming quality but there were a few things I didn't like about dining here. Number 1 is the fact that there is little to no parking by the restaurant and this place isn't in the best neighborhood. We came in and were seated in the dining area ( they have a back side for take out orders and the dining area) and were seated immediately. The wait staff was some what curt and rude when we were ordering. Also when we got our food and added the toppings, the bottles of the condiments like chili sauce were crusted on with old sauce which made it hard and kind of gross to get into the sauce We had to get up and ask for more napkins and for a fork because no one came back to our table after bringing food. All in all this place is a good place for pho but their customer service leaves more to be desired."
10/17/2019,20191017,5,4.49,"KTown Pho is THE BEST Pho I have had in LA. The owners are welcoming, the staff is friendly, and the food is consistently DELICIOUS. I would recommend this to anyone willing to hear :)"
10/20/2019,20191020,5,4.49,Their Signature Pho (Listed #1 under Pho in menu) is so bomb. Wagu beef is super tender and the broth is full of umami. Parking might be very difficult. No valet or lot nearby.
10/24/2019,20191024,3,4.48,"First time been here and I would say this place is just ok. Nothing very special, nothing standouts from other vietnamese restaurant, food selection is just as same as most of other viet's restaurant. I had Pho #3 and it was ok. One thing I notice is something in the air is burning my eye (like onions). Service is ok, price is reasonable. To sum up, it's just ok ! (Nice restroom tho)"
10/28/2019,20191028,5,4.49,"It was pho-licious! I was impressed to see how they can make an authentic pho here since I heard it's korean-owned restaurant? They did a very well done job and I believe it's one of the best in koreatown so far. I'm not a real expert on how authentic the pho should be but I do believe it has all the right ingredients in it. They didn't boil it too much and the broth tastes like the actual pho flavor. The noodles were well prepared as well. They also have all the right toppings along with our pho bowls and the best part is the fresh half cut-off lime that I would squeeze right away into my beautiful bowl. I ordered the seafood mixed pho and it is one of my favorite main dish now because I love seafood so much.I must admit it is in a very unusual spot where the seating space might be a little tight and the parking situation isn't that good at all (I would recommend to do street parking around the restaurant). Still, I would come back here for more pho since I'm possibly having another pho fever now. The estimated waiting time wasn't that bad either. Me and my two friends signed up for our table and we only had to wait for about 8-10 minutes instead of 20 minutes! Even all the staff are quite friendly and became helpful with our orders then gave us some good recommendations since two of my friends were kinda undecided for what they truly want. In the end, both of my friends were completely satisfied with their orders: the house special beef medium pho bowl and banh mi chicken sandwich."
11/6/2019,20191106,5,4.49,"Hands down the best pho restaurant in Ktown and overall LA! Pho and bun bo hue is legit as the owner is Vietnamese. The owner is a really nice man who takes pride in Vietnamese food and really cares about the quality of it. Also the egg rolls are one of the best I've had. It comes out really hot and what I love about this place is that the veggies it comes out is really fresh. Usually at most pho restaurant the lettuce is usually wilted but this place serves their egg rolls with nice, fresh lettuce! Service is really good, fast, and friendly. Tables fill up extremely quick! Only con is parking as their parking lot in the back is extremely small but it is self parking."
11/7/2019,20191107,5,4.49,The best Pho spot in Ktown area. The beef broth is authentic tasting. The noodle used are the correct type of noodles and is cooked perfectly. The number 1 Pho with wagyu is really nice. Delicious. Parking is behind the restaurant. Enter theough the alleyway but its tiny has about 3-5 parking spot. You're better off finding street parking and walk. A hidden gem.Update: Tried their Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle) and KTown Pho got this spot on. The broth is authentic. I order with ox tail and it was as delicious. The ox tail was nice and flavorful and the meat is very tender. The Vietnamese coffee is also legit. 2nd visit was excellent. I'm a fan.
11/10/2019,20191110,4,4.49,"This Pho restaurant is located on the corner of Western and Monette. There is a small parking lot in the back down a small alley. Vietnamese owned no-frills restaurant. No wait at the particular time we came, but could see how this small place could easily be filled up. Ordered a few dishes: Kobe beef pho, chicken pho and vermicelli with pork and egg rolls. The chicken pho was good, not overly salty. The vermicelli dish was good . My only complaint was small met portion and the egg roll did not seem freshly made. I know it's a cold noodle dish but the rolls were not hot and not freshly fried. The service was good (we were one of a few tables in the place) but he was friendly and was able to provide good service. Would be back to this place if we are craving Vietnamese food in ktown."
11/10/2019,20191110,5,4.49,Wow the Pho Bac was amazing!! Beef was tender and the broth was delicious! And I just came from two days of eating pho! Never have I ever found a good Pho place in Ktown until now!! I think this is the best Pho I have ever had! And I have had actual authentic Pho Bac in Vietnam!
11/19/2019,20191119,5,4.49,"Great Bahnmi and Pho. Every time I dine here, it gets better and better. Very impressed with the quality, flavor, and value here. I am a big fan!"
11/23/2019,20191123,5,4.49,Extremely satisfied with their soup. I love it! Just as how I was craving for a hot and right soup for my throat. Servers were nice too!
11/28/2019,20191128,4,4.49,"One of the best places I've had pho, in LA! I take everyone here, just like my friend brought me. The owner is very nice as well, always checking to make sure his customers are enjoying their meals. The staff is quick! I will always recommend!"
12/2/2019,20191202,5,4.49,"This place is a legit. Great broth. Taste it before you add things to it! Service is excellent too. Parking is the only problem, but worth it."
12/6/2019,20191206,5,4.49,"Since I moved to LA, the search for authentic pho hasn't stopped. I would say this place is the one. As a Vietnamese American I have to give it to them. I truly felt like I was eating at home. The broth was flavorful, the meats were nice and tender. The noodles were perfectly cooked. I will definitely be coming here often for my fix of pho! Highly recommend this place over all the other pho restaurants in the Koreatown area."
12/6/2019,20191206,1,4.48,"I really want to like this place, the food was just okay. The manager was very passive aggressive when we requested a to go box for our banh mi sandwich, by saying he did not have any. We saw take out boxes in front of the counter and asked if we can have one of those and he ended up getting it for us without saying anything. Im just so confused why we were singled out when I saw him happily helping out other people."
12/6/2019,20191206,5,4.49,"This is easily one of the best phos in town. The broth is so good I didn't want to do anything to it. I got the house special. Wagyu in a broth doesn't look like it will be special, but it is. Can't wait to come back."
12/8/2019,20191208,4,4.48,"Been looking for a pho place in LA ever since I moved here. I am Vietnamese so I'm pretty picky with all the pho I've had and living on the west side is just a bunch of Americanized pho. We ordered a chicken pho, spring rolls and vermicelli with pork. The chicken pho broth was so good and it tasted very authentic. Only negative was the chicken was a little dry but nothing major The spring rolls were in a 3 count rather than the typical 2 which was nice. The vermicelli was flavorful but the portion is a little smaller than other places. Overall, great place and I would definitely be back for some authentic Vietnamese food!"
12/8/2019,20191208,5,4.49,Loved their pho!! So delicious. The restaurant is a treasure in a little hole of a wall.
12/21/2019,20191221,5,4.49,The best Pho spot in Ktown area. The beef broth is authentic tasting. The noodle used are the correct type of noodles and is cooked perfectly.

12/21/2019,20191221,5,4.49,My absolute favorite is their spring rolls!! It's a must order! It has a crunch that most places in LA does not do. My family take a Togo order of it when they are near the area for me every time!
12/21/2019,20191221,5,4.49,"I love this place, great service, excellent food, from the spring rolls to the pho, I've been back at least twice a month. I'm obsessed!!!!"
12/24/2019,20191224,5,4.49,I think this place is pretty good very clean legit flavors from the soup and the noodles are so thin and nice. I usually come here for a quick meal egg rolls are okay here but I come here for the soup and noodles anyways so I would definitely recommend for the pho here I usually get the number one steak pho tried the seafood too and really good ! The service is wonderful too !!! Very nice employees very good service very considerate and there always attentive! I like their banmi sandwich too pretty good ! I usually get the pork and their filet mignon plate with red rice and veggie is bomb too ! Only bad thing I would say about it is they dont really give you much meat for a meat plate so hopefully they can change that ! Other than that I always come here and never disappointed in the noodles and soup so come here for your hangovers if your near by~
12/29/2019,20191229,5,4.49,"Always great food, and the service is top class as well. Expect to always have to wait at least 5-10 minutes, as they are usually pretty full. They are very accommodating though too. And if you don't want to wait too much there is seating outside in the hallway where they do service as well. The pho broth is so rich and clean, it's some of the most delicious bone broth I've had in town. The service is always helpful. While we waited for our table, they served us water and asked if we needed anything. I usually go with the house specials with everything in it. The tendon, tripe, flank is all delicious. Thankfully there is also a restroom, which is a nice plus (not guaranteed in little hole in the walls like this). I highly recommend this restaurant."
12/30/2019,20191230,5,4.49,Chicken bahn mi is bomb. The spring rolls are someof the best I've had. And good prices Will be back
1/6/2020,20200106,5,4.49,"I decided to try a new place in the ktown area and honestly happy that I did, I have no regrets. There is seating both inside and ""outside"" the restaurant. I prefer the seating indoors. There is a small parking lot in the rear, but if that's fully packed there's street parking, meters, only. The service is great! As soon as you walk through the door you are greeted instantly. Friendly, quick, and work together efficiently. The food quality and portion is worth the price. Their pricing is normal. I will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu. Generally, I would add spices and seasoning to my pho, but it was not needed at this location! Major points for not needing to add anything!"
1/10/2020,20200110,5,4.49,"A gem tucked away in a modest Koreatown setting. I tried the oxtail and combination pho, both of which were absolutely delicious. The broth is spot on and the prices are reasonable for the quality + location. Limited, cramped seating inside but there are a few tables outside, and you can always (like I did) bring your pho to go. They wrap it nicely and the broth stays hot. Overall highly recommend!"
1/12/2020,20200112,5,4.5,"2 girls behind us were looking for free food about 3pm on SUNDAY, they wanted to TALK to the manager because they found HAIR in their SOUP BUT THEY ATE ALL THEIR SHIT. It's my first time here but my friends are regulars and they would NEVER do that here. The servers are so sweet and so considerate. The food was great. So thank you to the employees. Those two girls are the reason why I hate people sometimes."
1/12/2020,20200112,1,4.49,"Today my daughter and her friend came to this restaurant for lunch. My daughter's first time having Pho but not her friends. They ordered their food and my daughter was putting her food in her container to bring the rest home and found a HAIR in the bottom of the bowl. They told the waiter and he tried to make a joke about it being my daughter's hair. So the waiter and my daughter and her friend were going back and forth, then my daughter's friend demanded to speak with a manager, the waiter had attitude but went and got the manager.  Manager came and said he would give her $$ back, but when he found out it was already paid for in advance she couldn't get her $$ back. So they left and will not be back. Hair in my food and you can't give me my $$ back get out of here. SMH."
1/19/2020,20200119,4,4.49,"Came here because of its high rating reviews and we weren't disappointed! It's a small restaurant; maybe about 10 tables? There's supposedly a parking lot behind the restaurant, but we found parking on the street curbs.The broth for the pho had a delicious flavor. And you know it's tasty when you don't have to add sauce or seasonings to it. You can add extra noodles for $1. We just wish it had more meat. It's nice that they put the raw onions on the side though. The rice platter with beef (com chien bo luc lac) was well cooked; not chewy at all. I just think $14 for that amount was pretty pricey. And it didn't come with the fish sauce which was different from other locations. The Thai tea we ordered was too creamy, which made it lose its tea taste. But they were nice enough to add more tea to it, which made it better. Overall, we were satisfied and will be back!"
1/28/2020,20200128,5,4.49,"This is me and my buddy's favorite spot for pho in Ktown. Always get the pho tai and add ginger. (The ginger is a game changer)Egg rolls and spring rolls are well made and delicious. Service is always great and they take real good care of you. They even gave out free desserts for the lunar new year. Parking can be tricky, but know that there's a small parking lot in the back."
2/2/2020,20200202,4,4.49,"I am picky when I choose for pho restaurants and this is the one of the best place to go. This place is small but has Friendly staff. I think they're using natural MSG. Super delicious, simple and rich. One of my favourite! I highly recommend this place. Only thing is parking Situation. They have a parking area so need find street parking but it's worth to try!!"
2/2/2020,20200202,1,4.48,Waited more than 15min to order and super rushed us when they were taking order from us. Took wrong order for drink then trying to blame and correct us. No parking space. Rude
2/4/2020,20200204,3,4.48,"Okay, I never had a bad bowl of pho at this place and I still think that Ktwon Pho makes the best pho in Ktown. Since I only tried Pho at Ktown Pho, I decided to be adventurous and try other item here at Ktown Pho. I So I ordered Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. It came with marinated pork (tad salty), noodles, shredded cabbage and fish sauce. It was perfect for a hot day! The problem was the eggroll it came with. Egg rolls are pretty much a staple in Vietnamese restaurants. My egg rolls were so disappointing today. It was over fried (very dark brown) as if they fried it multiple times, drenched with oil and extremely dry. Sadly, I couldn't even take a single bite. Vietnamese food without a crisp fresh egg roll is disappointing."
2/5/2020,20200205,3,4.47,I googled best pho in town and this was on top of the list. I should have Yelped it. What was I thinking?I was expecting much more and it did not turn out. The broth was flat and was bland and not full flavored . Not expecting this while in CA. They do have their specialty Kobe beef pho here if you want to try. The ratio of noodles and meat was excellent but the overall taste of the bowl was not there. The spring roll was great and it had some fried onion stick in the roll. Something different and not typical but overalll still good. Trying to find parking and its location was hard to spot as well. Enclosed are front of store and corner what it's next to for better finding.
2/7/2020,20200207,5,4.47,"Bo bun hue is sooooooo delicious and satisfying! Came here specifically to try it and I'm not disappointed! Spring rolls ordered with fish sauce instead of peanut. Again, delicious. I'm so happy I live nearby-ish, within 3 miles and only a 30 min bus ride! Fast service and great waitstaff. I Recommend this place. I will definitely be coming here again"
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.47,"I never truly had pho until I came here. All I'm going to say is Oxtail Pho!!! The broth is so flavorful you don't have to add anything to it!! Shrimp rolls were amazing with a crunchy centre which was unique. I'll be back for sure! Thai tea was delish, not too sweet! And the servers are so kind, funny and doted on all the patrons. So happy I found this place"
2/12/2020,20200212,5,4.48,Straight up authentic Viet food for sure!Love the Bun Bo Hue you can't often see unless at an authentic one!!
2/26/2020,20200226,5,4.48,Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!Everything that I have tried so far has been nothing short of delicious!Best Pho in LA/Metro Area!
2/28/2020,20200228,5,4.48,"My go-to place for pho in ktown - I don't like koreanized pho, so I avoid most other pho in the area. I've been to lots of pho places in SoCal and this one has me coming back regularly (mostly for location, but also for the quality of the food). I get disappointed sometimes with other places - usually don't have enough flavor in the broth, too much MSG, or are inconsistent in the quality of their soups. Here, I've always been served quickly, consistently delicious pho, and had very nice servers. Never had to wait long, but I usually eat here around 11-12 weekdays. Only downside is limited parking, TLDR: Parking is limited in the back, nice servers, consistently great Vietnamese pho. Recommend!"
3/2/2020,20200302,4,4.48,"I had lunch here last week and was pleasantly surprised. This place is Vietnamese owned which is rare in Koreatown. The pho broth is a little darker than other places but it is pretty flavorful. I got the Oxtail pho and the reason for only 4 stars was that in my bowl, I had 3 oxtail bones, only 1 of which had a good amount of meat. The 2 other bones were those tiny ones with 1 tiny bite of meat. The oxtail meat was also not as tender or fall off the bone as I have become used to. My buddy got the #1, kobe beef house special pho. He also said that there wasn't much meat in his bowl. I did try one piece of the beef and it was pretty tender!We also split an order of the Summer rolls which are pretty standard in the SGV or Little Saigon but a rarity in Ktown. They were good with the pork sausage and crispy roll. I added a bit of sambal chile paste into the sauce for a little kick.I would definitely come back here but would probably skip the Oxtail. One note is that they don't seem to have Tendon. I didn't ask but I also didn't see it on the menu anywhere. Odd."
3/9/2020,20200309,4,4.48,"The good: the broth, as a Vietnamese/Chinese guy who's had pho since childhood, I must say I was impressed by the beef broth, which was very onion-forward, not too salty, and rich with beef bone goodness. service is quick, very efficient, and attentive. The bad: the smell of the building as you walk in, parking (I guess they have a parking lot but I've never parked there). Some may say it's not as ""clean"" as say a modern Viet place like NongLa. I've never went during busy times but there is strange overflow seating in the hallways outside.Bottom line: This is the best pho in Ktown. It's Vietnamese pho, not Koreanized pho.Location: SE corner of Monette and Western, inside a building next to a Puppy Day Care."
3/15/2020,20200315,5,4.48,Really nice casual place for some nice hot pho! I don't eat meat so I always get the vegan pho and vegan spring rolls. The young coconut and vegetarian egg rolls are nice too. They don't have many tables for patrons to sit down but they are always great about takeout. Highly recommend this place for vegetarians and vegans alike!
3/19/2020,20200319,3,4.47,"Parking is very limited with street parking. Located on the corner, the place is split in 2 with the main seating in the bigger area in the back and then a couple tables in the front.We went here and orderer their bun bo hue with oxtail. Broth had an overpowering taste of fish sauce. The oxtail meat itself was well-seasoned and tender. Overall not too bad considering it's hard to find establishments around this area serving bun bo hue. They do not have pork blood served in their bun bo hue which strays for me from your authentic viet bun bo hue.Service was relatively okay. We had to flag down the waiters for water or for our check."
3/21/2020,20200321,5,4.48,"I really love ktown pho. all their food is fantastic, and their summer rolls, cha gio, and vermicelli bowls are great. on top of all that, with the self-isolation in place they also do take-out with a lot of safety protocols in place (masks and plastic shields), and have hand sanitizer for guests after touching the credit card screen. I appreciate all their hard work and doing what they can to accommodate people in this crisis."
4/5/2020,20200405,5,4.48,I have never ordered pho to-go before. Never thought it would be good but due to the Covid-19 lockdown I caved and ordered pho To-go. This is my favorite pho place to go to in LA. The food is great and the staff is so friendly. Everything was neatly packed and so organized. It made everything even more enjoyable. Also- I picked up my food without a mask on today and the owner gave me a mask. Turns out he's giving masks made by he's family to people who does not have a mask on. I'm not really good with words but this just made me feel all warm inside. For a business to care about he's customers the way they do is unbelievable. As he cares for us we should give back and order from local businesses. Thank you for everything you do and for feeding me delicious food every time.
4/7/2020,20200407,4,4.48,"At first, I was skeptical about a pho place in ktown. But, this place is super authentic! I ordered to-go and they offered FREE delivery within a 5 miles radius! I ordered the Banh mi sandwiches and egg rolls. The sliced pork was a thick cut of meat and super tasty! And, the veggies were still fresh and crisp! I liked my sandwiches so much that I had to post this review right after. Their eggrolls come with a side of fresh veggies. And the filling was bursting with so much flavor! A lot of small businesses are affected by the Covid-19 crisis, so I def recommend supporting ktown pho!"
4/7/2020,20200407,5,4.48,Great food easy to order and quick turn around. Food was hot fresh and delicious and they even where giving out sealed masks amidst all thsi
4/15/2020,20200415,5,4.48,Their ginger add-on elevates their already excellent broth!! Everything from freshly cut veggies to superb service sets this pho place apart. Appreciate them even more during this time of covid.
4/21/2020,20200421,5,4.48,"Still the best pho I've ever had and by far the best in Los Angeles. A really cozy little shop I've been visiting frequently for all the years I've been in college now. Not only is their pho great though, but I've never had a single bad thing on the menu; my favorite additional orders are either the autumn rolls or the egg rolls. The broth is super flavorful, loaded with plenty of meat (if you order it) and always high quality. The noodles are also great! Can't wait to go back."
4/26/2020,20200426,5,4.48,"Best broth in LA! Super good pho, even my husband was obsessed and he isn't usually a huge fan. We ordered delivery and it was super quick and easy! Will order again."
4/29/2020,20200429,5,4.48,"So yummy and the services is great. The owner puts a lot of effort showcase Vietnamese food and also its that you don't find at many pho places. You won't regret it. If you can control yourself and not eat everything, you will have the best leftovers!!"
5/1/2020,20200501,5,4.48,Very fast delivery and extremely friendly employee who delivered the food + thoughtful and prepared with providing hand sanitizer after the delivery exchange during this pandemic!! I am really grateful and appreciative that Ktown Pho is still open during these times. Food was excellent as usual!
5/5/2020,20200505,5,4.48,"This is our favorite pho place in LA, and we're really picky. The broth is really deep and flavorful, and the owner is super friendly. They also have great veggie spring rolls and the best bahn mi in the area! This is definitely our go-to pho place."
5/8/2020,20200508,5,4.48,"Don't let the name fool you, this is a vietnamese owned establishment so you know it's legit! They offer all the viet staples: pho, com tam, bun thit nuong. I was craving a hot bowl of pho and was so happy this this place was still open and serving. They had small tables for eating that would be great if dine in was still allowed. I'd love to come back here and enjoy a fresh, hot bowl when they're allowed to operate normally again"
5/9/2020,20200509,5,4.49,"Come for the Bahn Mi, stay for the Pho. I am a bit of a Bahn Mi connoisseur. I am willing to search far and wide to find the good ones. You have to get the bread right, and so many places don't. The ones here are perfect and I order them two at a time. Pork and Beef please! Also the pho is excellent. Take out is great, but if you can, stop in and eat at this little unassuming place. The service is real and fun."
5/14/2020,20200514,3,4.48,"I only ordered the banh mi sandwich. Nothing else. The parking lot is terribly small and dangerous to use, it is a maze in an alleyway. The meat for the sandwich is microwaved and became cold by the time I was able to eat it. The bread is very thing and a little too dense for the sandwich. The sandwich lacked flavor and the pickled carrots and daikon could have been fresher. Service is good, but food is so-so. Wouldn't come back unless I was really craving pho."
5/19/2020,20200519,5,4.48,"Best pho in the city. I also grab a pork bahn mi (only 6$).If you have them deliver, and it's within 5 miles, the delivery is free. I order a bahn mi and bac Biet to my door when I'm hung over and it's around 19$ before tip. Also some of the best spring rolls. They put like a little rolled up fried thing inside that adds texture, very nice.The staff is amazing and some r actually funny. The only bad part is the parking, but once I learned of the free delivery, all Gucci bb. Five star five star five star."
5/23/2020,20200523,5,4.48,"This is my favorite pho/Vietnamese place in the area. The employees are always SO friendly. I've dined in once, but lately I've been placing my orders for delivery and the food arrives super fast and hot. I texted my order and the transaction was incredibly easy and smooth. My delivery driver was really nice and even brought me a face mask. Thank you Ktown Pho for providing delicious food and top-notch service during this time! We really appreciate you."
5/25/2020,20200525,5,4.49,"Yesterday I called for a take out. And I am so glad I did! Pho is not the most convenient menu item for a take out but they really did well in packing food. I went 15min after I placed an order and my food was ready. Portions were ample, provided enough sauce, sprouts, cilantro, onion, basil and lime. I recommend that you boil the broth at home and pour it unto the noodle and meat so that your meat will cook. Meat came uncooked and even though I picked up my order right away, soup was not piping hot. When it comes to pho, you want to make sure the broth is hot since you'll be putting in cold veggies, herb and lime. I was pleasantly surprised that noodles didn't stick together (i was thinking of ordering uncooked ones to boil them at home but forgot to ask). Also ordered pork chop and rice. Pork chop was seasoned real well. The only gripe is that it had too much fat but otherwise, it was delicious. The only only item i don't recommend at Ktown Pho is their egg rolls. I think they fry it once and refry them when they serve it. Its too dry, hard and oily.  So glad there's Ktown Pho during quarantine! Will definitely order again."
5/31/2020,20200531,5,4.49,Ymmm so good. Ordered the vermicelli pork with egg rolls. Was really craving egg rolls. They offer local delivery.
6/3/2020,20200603,5,4.49,"When I saw this place I was ecstatic because I lived just around the corner. LA doesn't have any good pho restaurants so I didn't have high expectations, but I was blown out of the water after eating here. This pho joint serves the BEST tasting pho you will find in LA. The broth is flavorful (just right), the vegetables are fresh, the coffee actually tastes like Vietnamese coffee, and the service is wonderful. The owner and staff are attentive to their customers and they pride themselves on the small details.I have already told everyone at school and work about this place, so we will be frequent eaters here!Shout out to KT!"
6/7/2020,20200607,5,4.49,Favorite place to get authentic Vietnamese food in ktown. Love this place! And they're really great for take-out. :))
6/13/2020,20200613,5,4.49,OMG best oxtail pho in LA and I've had them all. The closes next ones would be Pho Saigon Pearl and maybe Pho Hoa in DTLA. But maaan... every time I crave it... this is 100% the go to... also they have Beef Stew which for some reason is hard to come by... unless I'm just not looking in the right place... or I have to go all the way to the east side. Anyways this place is delicious and amazing... only issue is I wish they had delivery.
6/17/2020,20200617,5,4.49,"Delicious, consistent Vietnamese food to fill all your cravings! Best customer service in LA, even during the coronavirus pandemic. The owners & workers really care, and it's obvious with each interaction. I haven't been to many restaurants like this one. Truly a gem."
6/19/2020,20200619,5,4.49,Hands down my favorite pho place in koreatown. Authentic Vietnamese owned restaurant. Customer service is always friendly and welcoming. Pho is so tasty ~ broth is delicious & the spring rolls are always fresh. Loyal customer!
7/2/2020,20200702,4,4.49,"Love this place! I Order from here at least once a week. Only thing is I wish the large to go bowl was a bigger portion. Most other pho places I can never finish a large pho bowl in one sitting, but this one I can. OBSESSED with their Thai iced tea and not stingy when you ask for extra sauce. Delivery drivers and employees at the register are always so kind and always working so hard!"
7/7/2020,20200707,5,4.49,"Absolutely amazing! KT is such a great guy and the quality is as good as the service. Will be back! Tried all the spring rolls and egg rolls with sauces, and the pho, everyone adored!"
7/8/2020,20200708,5,4.49,"My favorite go-to of all time. Any time the girls can't think of a place to go, we end up at Ktown Pho. The guys who work the front of house are always so attentive and sweet (we love ""Pho Dad,"" the title we've dubbed the owner of the place) and the back of house employees are also always patient and kind whenever I come in to pick up orders!! They're all totally willing to make adjustments to orders based on dietary restrictions and everyone I've encountered has been happy to give me extra lime (or lemon, depending on what's available)!!! The combination pho with spring roll, pate banh mi and lime soda is an unbeatable combo. Their delivery service is also prompt and reasonable! I dream of the day I can once again wait for a table in the queue outside on a busy weekend !!"
7/11/2020,20200711,4,4.49,My new go to place for Vietnamese food in Koreatown I can't give 5 stars just yet. Gots to try more of their food. This place maybe the most authentic Vietnamese around here. 100% authentic Vietnamese? Probably not. They don't have everything. Come on. You really wanna grub on Chicken feet and pork blood soup? No right. Me neither so for the limited selection we take wha they offer. Pho rice dishes and the famous banh mi. The banh mi bit on the small side but trust me. It's better than the nasty ones nearby
7/11/2020,20200711,5,4.49,"Great tasting food and seamless, FAST delivery service during COVID. Will definitely be ordering from this place again!"
7/16/2020,20200716,5,4.49,"I don't really leave reviews, but Ktown Pho is extremely worth it. Not only is there service 5 stars, but their food too, I love getting their Vietnamese coffee, oxtail bun bo hue, and still trying out other items from them and so far the ones I try are just as delicious. Keep it up Ktown Pho, you guys are awesome!"
7/17/2020,20200717,5,4.49,My go to spot before COVID and it's still amazing even during the pandemic. Oxtail pho is liquid gold. Their takeout packaging is great and doesn't cause the noodles to be gross. Quick turn around - called in the pick up order at 11:10 and was able to get the food within 20 mins. Love this place and will continue to support them as much as I can. Best Pho in Ktown!!! Tons of social distance measures too - I saw employees wearing face shields and they have plexiglass barriers up as well.
7/20/2020,20200720,4,4.49,It was my first time trying Vietnamese foodI ordered house noodle and delivery person was so nice it was in medium size container with soup noodle meat and some veggies. Maybe because it is my first time trying pho but soup tasted wierd but not bad. I would try again
7/20/2020,20200720,5,4.49,"I am crazy about pho. I can say This place is the best! The people who working there was such good energy and the service was great. And the take out bowl is just exactly perfect size and noodle, soup, veggies all fresh! I definitely recommend this place!!"
7/21/2020,20200721,5,4.5,Seafood pho - broth was so tasty and it was such a huge bowl. 10/10! *Takeout second time getting!
7/22/2020,20200722,5,4.5,"MORE THAN JUST A RESTAURANT. The owners treat their customers like family. Pre-pandemic they already gave out hand sanitizers to everyone. During this difficult times, they do free delivery within the area and free homemade mask for every order! The quality of the food is of course still the best in the area. Even when they were allowed to reopen they still did not want to because they put their customers' health their top priority. They have a life-time loyal fan (me) and I will continue to support and tell everyone how amazing they are. Excited for their downtown location to open as well. Ktown Pho FTW!!!!"
7/22/2020,20200722,5,4.5,My favorite pho spot in Ktown! Authentic & my favorite is their Oxtail Bun Bo Hue :) Ask for extra garlic sauce!!
7/23/2020,20200723,5,4.5,"Probably one of the best deliveries I've had, in Covid out of Covid the service was great! I love how he calls me sweetie! Couldn't wait to finish the food before the review but so far so good! Egg rolls are great! Ordered the pho ga can't wait to eat!"
8/1/2020,20200801,5,4.5,"This is the only pho in Koreatown that tastes similar to my mom's authentic Vietnamese homemade pho! Anywhere else, I refuse to go to. I wish they'd open longer, but the customer service is great as always and the pho ga & pho tai are by far my fave! I wouldn't really recommend the rice dishes & have yet to try everything else. 10/10 would recommend trying their pho!!"
8/2/2020,20200802,5,4.5,"My all time favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Ktown/West LA area. I've had the opportunity to dine in here pre-COVID and order take-outs from them. This restaurant is Vietnamese owned and their food is pretty close to the quality you'd get from places in OC. Some dishes to consider - their pho of course and the spicy noodle beef (Bun Bo Hue). The ordering and pick up process has always been seamless for me. The food has always been thoughtfully packed to let you prep and clean up easily afterwards. So if you are in Ktown and don't feel like going to SGV for Vietnamese food, this is the place to be.They accept credit card payments and are part of the AMEX small business program so get your credit back while supporting them during this very difficult time."
8/4/2020,20200804,4,4.5,"Great Vietnamese food in Koreatown area. I got the combination pho and pork banhmi, thai tea, and ordered their free delivery. Food arrived fast and their delivery guy, which may be one of the bosses, saw him at the restaurant before taking orders, is great! He brings a credit card machine and makes sure you get ample hand sanitizer afterwards! Would definitely order delivery through them again. The pho came with a lot of noodles. I could eat it for at least 2 meals."
8/6/2020,20200806,5,4.5,"Delicious!!! You can tell how legit they are by tasting their appetizers, rolls and eggrolls were so crunchy and fresh!!!!It was my first time trying bun bo fue, the broth was awesome and the meat quality was great, no smell at all. The person that took my order and the delivery driver were both very kind and the food got here in no time. Also the delivery driver had hand sanitizer on him, right after he gave me the food he gave me some hand sanitizer to feel safer ordering during this quarantine... I just thought that was awesome service :) will be back again!"
8/11/2020,20200811,5,4.5,Ordered out for a dinner for 2 over the weekend from a friend's rec. We ordered the spicy Vietnamese beef noodle soup(Bún bò Huế) and the House Special Pho with kobe style beef. Delivery was fast and very easy with owner guiding you through every step of the process. The simple packaging is also very accomodating for takeout and to go so that's also a plus. Driver was very respectful of sanitation guidelines during this whole pandemic and wore appropiate protective gear before handing off the food. The broth was so flavorful and tasty complimenting the perfectly cooked beef and firm noodles. If I do have one minor gripe it would be the spicy noodle soup wasn't that spicy but thats only a nitpick on a otherwise exquisite meal. Expect another order very soon!
8/12/2020,20200812,5,4.5,The ordering was easy and the delivery guy was fast and super friendly. This place is a great option for quick and delicious food in KTown.
8/13/2020,20200813,5,4.5,I am glad I found this place! Was craving Pho because I was not feeling good! Read the review and ya they are right about friendly great service and delicious Bun Bo Hue and autumn roll!Also more great that they deliver and can pay with credit card with the delivery guy. He carries Hand sanitizers too! Thank you!
8/18/2020,20200818,5,4.5,"Fantastic! Great customer service, had a nice time chatting with the staff. Got the pho of course - unique broth, packaging that allowed the food to travel well. Will be back to try more!Don't be fooled by what looks like a dead end alley - parking was easy in the lot in the back."
8/18/2020,20200818,5,4.51,"This is the to go spot for me and my girlfriend. The soups always come out hot and full of rich flavor. I always get the oxtail soup with the thicker noodles and it never disappoints. The banh mi's are also among the top dishes here in my opinion, super simple but the care and freshness of the accoutrements elevate it."
8/20/2020,20200820,5,4.51,"We stumbled on this place when it was labeled a ""hot & new"" restaurant on yelp. It quickly became one of our go-to spots and 3+ years later, this is still one of my favorite Asian comfort food joints in LA. The broth for pho is sooooo good (sliced beef, tripe & meatballs w/ extra jalapeños is the way I go!) and the quality has never faltered. Especially now during the covid-19 pandemic, it is incredible how Ktown Pho adapted quickly to ensure safety for their staff and customers as well as keeping the quality of the food at its best. They deliver to neighboring areas without need of 3rd party service (support your local restaurants directly!) and it's on point every time. Attention to detail: They put the fried rolls in a small brown bag so it's not soggy upon arrival. The pho containers separate the dry contents from the broth which is KEY to not having soggy pho! If the broth isn't hot enough when you're ready to eat it, simply heat it up on its own and pour over the dry content and it's just like the delicious bowl of pho you get when dining in!PS banh mi sandwich & com ga roti (fried chicken & fried rice) are also really delicious!!"
8/21/2020,20200821,5,4.51,Great food and great service. These guys are awesome. Best pho and service in Los Angeles!
8/24/2020,20200824,5,4.51,"I get the Pho Tai every time and it is so good! I really love this Pho restaurant - I'm a bit picky about my pho and theirs taste truly authentic. Aside from Pho, they can make traditional Vietnamese dishes upon request - the people that work here are passionate and happy, which makes me feel great each time I order from them. This is my go-to pho spot in LA"
8/30/2020,20200830,4,4.51,Great little place that's a bit hidden. The pho is rich and flavorful. Most everything else I've tried is also very good.
9/1/2020,20200901,5,4.51,Loved this place! I just moved to the area and decided to try it. We ordered house phó and marinated pork and rice plate. They were delicious. My boyfriend demolished the pho.
9/2/2020,20200902,5,4.51,"Customer service: 5/5 I am beyond words. The cashier had the absolute best customer service. He was super patient with my family as everyone tried to figure out what they want, he had very good hearing as my brother whispered asking questions about the menu to me, and even offered a box since we were driving home. Food: 5/5 To-go packaging was on point. Chicken and eggroll vermicelli was delicious. I also heard the grilled chicken and rice was delicious. Spring rolls had a crunchy element in there that wasn't for me, but the rest of my party loved them. Iced coffee was good. Thai iced boba was good. And coconut pandan jelly was good.WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND. They definitely earned themselves a regular customer in this one trip."
9/5/2020,20200905,5,4.51,"My favorite vegan pho of ALL TIME! My boyfriend and I drive all the way from west LA to Ktown to get our weekly dose. We like the vegan pho, tofu spring rolls, veggie egg rolls with extra lettuce, and whole coconut. Food order usually takes about 20 minutes. The broth is irreplaceable!"
9/6/2020,20200906,5,4.51,"Love this place! We love the fried egg rolls, Banh mi sandwiches and the pho of course! The owners are so nice and everything is high quality and very reasonably priced! So glad that this is just down the street from us as it's becoming our go to spot!"
9/6/2020,20200906,5,4.51,"Came here a week ago for a to-go order of the house special pho and com thit nuong. Really big portions, social distancing was enforced, and they had a pick up area where the food was labeled and ready. Really enjoyed my food!"
9/9/2020,20200909,2,4.51,Ordered the assorted meat fried noodles but got the seafood instead. Service was quick and friendly.

Also great customer service, the folks behind the counter are always smiling and so friendly. Would give 6 stars if I could!"
9/11/2020,20200911,5,4.5,"I've had pho in just about every city in California, in almost every major city in America, all over Vietnam - basically I know my pho. This is hands down the best pho in LA area. And their BBH is pretty damn good too. Owned and operated by a Vietnamese lady. Worth every penny"

One sure way of getting us to come back often is for sure, the gummy bear bribes given to my kiddo.The food is good tasting, a variety of different dishes are available. The take out process is easy and containers are in good shape. Store is relatively small with little dining area. Not a date spot, more of a grab and go place. Go for the meatballs, kiddo friendly and I like it!"

Every dish I've had here has been spot on, including the pho, filet mignon pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, Vietnamese iced coffee are all delicious. I'm so happy to see the restaurant doing well because they deserve nothing less for the bomb food and service they dish out. I can't wait for dine in again so I can enjoy a fresh bowl of ktown pho, which I dream about often :)"

10/6/2020,20201006,5,4.51,"LOVE ktown pho. my friend recommended it and I thank her so much for the recommendation. I've been three times in a week because I have just been unable to stay away. The broth is absolutely perfect and warm. The to-go packaging is really helpful and keeps things from getting messy or accidentally spilled. The service is also great. The staff is always sweet and my food is ready to go when I get there. I ordered a limeade soda and they were thoughtful enough to wait until I got there to mix my soda with the limeade so it would still be fizzy and satisfying in case I showed up later than anticipated. I have read that not enough meat is added for the House Special but for someone, like me, who is visits more for the noodles and the broth, it's the perfect amount. My partner who hated pho has even begun to love pho as a result of ktown pho! Will definitely be returning this week!"
10/10/2020,20201010,5,4.51,I love this place! I went just to get spring rolls and ended up getting with banh mi and pho. So DELICIOUS!!! There only time I experienced a long wait was during lunch time but other than that one time I've waited 5-10 minutes from my entire order. Staff is very sweet and makes you want to come back. The broth is also PERFECT. I add the vegetables but I always fear I'm gonna ruin the taste by adding sauces (I still do). Is just so good you have to try it for yourself. Also the spring rolls are FAT/STUFFED. Definitely worth every penny.
10/22/2020,20201022,5,4.51,"Bomb food, great staff and ownership! Great prices! Came here while waiting for my car to get tinted, the owner is very involved in the business which I think is good. Top quality from food to the service. They have a parking lot in the back too"
10/28/2020,20201028,5,4.51,"My favorite spot for pho in LA! A must try for rich, flavorful pho broth. They're very generous with their portions. I usually order a small Pho Tai and it's incredibly filling (granted this is for those who drink all the soup).The takeout packaging is great to eat anywhere since the noodles are separately stacked on top of the broth all in one container."
11/1/2020,20201101,5,4.51,Great Place owned by a husband and wife team from the home country with traditional authentic receipes.
11/15/2020,20201115,5,4.51,I just ordered egg rolls winter rolls and chicken Bahn mi sandwich for the first time. Never had any of these before. So let me tell you! It is a cardinal sin if you eat here and don't give a good review! Cause any time it's something negative to say people come on Yelp very quickly! I had to write as I'm eating!!! I will be back and the owner was nice with my weird request I made lol. Thanks for your patience and the price was very good servicing size was perfect for me and my hubby!!!! Love the food and will be back!!!!!!!!!!
11/16/2020,20201116,5,4.51,"I LOVEEEEE this place! The shrimp vermicelli with egg rolls and the spring rolls *chefs kiss* They're my go to menu items. I could eat there everyday! The staff is also super nice, and the food is always ready when I arrive"
11/22/2020,20201122,5,4.52,"I've ordered takeout from these guys a few times now. Its been great both times, the broth is tasty, spring rolls are great, and the takeout packaging keeps everything right. Beyond that, the guys in there are super nice, I'm assuming the main dude in there is the owner. Definitely the kind of people I'm happy to support. I you go in they also sell authentic chili oil, fish sauce and some other sauces all at reasonable prices. Two thumbs up"
11/22/2020,20201122,5,4.52,My favorite spot for pho! Service is always great and the workers are all so friendly :) Always get the seafood pho + pho tai! Their egg rolls are good too! The parking lot is teeny tiny so I usually street park or take out!
12/6/2020,20201206,5,4.52,I think I've found my new go to spot for pho in ktown. We've tried other pho restaurants around the area but this one tops the rest.I ordered the oxtail pho and summer rolls and it was great! The broth was flavorful and not too salty. There were actual bone in oxtail in the broth. Normally I don't care for pho to go and prefer to dine in but that isn't an option nowadays. The summer rolls were refreshing and delicious.Glad we took the chance and ordered here. Will definitely be back!
12/6/2020,20201206,5,4.52,"Bahn mi tasted great. Perfectly crispy baguettes, mild flavored toppings. Tofu was very tasty"
12/11/2020,20201211,5,4.52,"The best pho in LA, I've been here many times and still high of quality Pho especially broth, I highly recommend this place to everyone!!! Will return!"
12/12/2020,20201212,5,4.52,"My absolute favorite pho spot in KTown. Normally I get just regular pho but I tried their bun bo #2 and it always hits the spot. Their egg rolls, broken rice with pork and egg is always bomb. Every order I always get a bahn mi & order a side of the pate sauce in a bottle.The owner and staff are super attentive and always works with me on special orders. They communicate well and are the sweetest people. SUPPORT YOUR SMALL BUSINESSES!!!"
12/13/2020,20201213,3,4.52,It was all good until I got home with my takeout order and discovered the packaging used for the soup leaked out all over my order. The fried egg rolls were reduced to a soggy mush and the pork chop dish was soaked in broth. My oxtail pho experience was a failure. I'm convinced that pho is one of those foods that doesn't travel well and is best served while dining in. Will try again when the pandemic is over
12/19/2020,20201219,5,4.52,"So good, always hits the spot. Heat it up at home to enjoy the same quality meal as in the restaurant. Unlimited shout-outs to Antonio!"
12/28/2020,20201228,4,4.52,"Covid Takeout reviewWe called in an order, they said it would be ready in 15 minutes and it was exactly that.We ordered: -Spring Rolls - not my favorite-Egg Rolls - tasty-Pho Tai - very, very good-Crispy Noodle with Seafood - the seafood wasn't the best (imitation crab mean, fish cake)Overall I think it's a great option when you can't make it out to The OC (Little Saigon). If you live in ktown and hung over, get their pho. The price is reasonable for the area.It's an easy take out place, parking shouldn't be too hard."
12/28/2020,20201228,1,4.51,Pretty disgusted.. Was starving so I ordered delivery. Remembered my first experience ordering delivery here was pretty good so I was excited... this time I noticed the bag of meat was full of blood so I tried my best to pick out the meat without the blood. Put the meat in the bowl and poured the broth in the bowl. Broth turned into a bloody color. Kinda sickening.. Don't even want to eat this bloody mess. Maybe I should've just grilled the meat and had kbbq and pho. Probably not ordering here again.
1/3/2021,20210103,1,4.5,Gross. I'm half Vietnamese and this was not how pho is made. Your chicken was old and dark meat chunks! I have never had pho with it like this! It's suppose to be white meat slices not old dark meat chunks and the broth was dark and not tasty. If I could have given you no stars I would def have done so. Lol to the comment the owner gave back no they don't if they did it would not be old chicken meat chunks and not in pho.
1/3/2021,20210103,5,4.51,I was looking for a good place to eat some Pho and oh my gosh! This place is absolutely delicious. The packaging was great and it was great quality. I highly recommend this everyone.
1/4/2021,20210104,5,4.51,"Roommates and I have loved this place for the past 3 years (feels like we've been going longer tbh). Have tried a variety of items on the menu, but personal favorites are the spring rolls (comes with an extra crunch in the roll), pho tai #5, bun bo hue #1, banh mi #3. The owners are really great and the workers have been lovely. Pre-pandemic, my roommates and I dined in at least once a month (miss it so much!), but we've tried to support as much as possible with take out! They package all their items really well and provide a lot of sauces on the side. Would definitely recommend their in house sate! They now sell it in batches at the store and I love adding this to my meals at home (mixed veggies, soups, stir fry, and more!) I think at this point, my roommates and I have tried half the menu and I can say that everything we've tried so far has been great (the pho broth is always yummy, really love how thin they slice their onions too)."
1/4/2021,20210104,3,4.5,"Food is good but they really need to work on hygiene. Saw the cook eating with his bare hands in the kitchen while making food and touching the food also. During covid the cooks should be strictly hygienic. I saw a previous poster complain about this and the owner saying if you dont like it then stay home, which is unprofessional. I'm sure the owners would appreciate the same courtesy if they ate out"
1/5/2021,20210105,4,4.5,"It has been almost a year since we have had pho since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic around March. Having a craving for it I asked around and many recommended this establishment to fulfill my pho needs. They accept orders my phone and text. That's great! The pickup process was a breeze. They are located inside of a food mall with one or two other restaurants as well which don't appear to be open at the time of this writing. Entering the restaurant they have a plexiglass dividing the customers from employees. Everyone was diligently wearing masks as well and at no point did I feel unsafe in regards to COVID-19. Our food was waiting for us all bagged up on a shelf inside the restaurant, waiting for us. They also have large bottles of condiments available for purchase. We collected our food and paid using a chip reader on their credit card machine and the receipt was emailed to me. Only possible downside is that the parking lot is rather small and beside a somewhat shady looking alleyway. Food portions were generous and came with all the toppings you normally see in the restaurant such as onions, sriracha, bean sprouts etc. Soup itself was flavorful, still not beating my favorite pho place but it came pretty close. Definitely found my go to spot for pho during the lock down. Definitely try the Kobe Beef Pho, very tender - its well worth the $13."
1/14/2021,20210114,5,4.5,LITERALLY THE BEST PHO I'VE HAD THUS FAR IN KTOWN!!! I could probably have it every day and not get tired of it. The broth is so flavorful and the Togo packaging is pretty cool !
1/27/2021,20210127,5,4.5,"they have THE BEST veggie pho in LA! the broth is sooo good and they are very generous with the toppings too! a bit overpriced compared to most other places though, but the overall quality and taste make it worth it."
1/29/2021,20210129,2,4.5,"This place is known for having the best pho in k-town, which I enjoyed many times.. However, the Pho Tai (rare steak) that we ordered today , the noodle was so overcooked I could hardly use the chopsticks. And the soup was very greasy. Definitely not the same pho that I had in the past. Also, the fall roll (bbq pork roll) was unbearably sweet..Has the owner or the cook changed?I enjoyed as much as I could, but I miss the ol' taste..Hope it's just a random thing."
2/1/2021,20210201,5,4.5,"In a totally spontaneous move an hour ago, I ordered their pho tai (rare thinly sliced steak, which cooks in the hot broth) to go with an extra serving of bo vien (Vietnamese beef meatballs) and it is the BEST pho I've had in LA! Great prices, amazing portion size.I am first gen Vietnamese-American and grew up in the San Gabriel Valley; I also spent a lot of my childhood in Orange County. I've had a hard to finding good, authentic pho with a broth filled with umami and savoriness in LA, especially at a good price point. This is my new go-to spot whenever I want some soup to make myself feel better. If the pho is this good, I'm inclined to believe their other noodle soups and com tam will be just as excellent!Very excited to explore more of the menu in the future. I ordered through Chowbus, but I suggest calling or texting them for your orders rather than going through a third-party app, especially during this pandemic when fees often end up going to the big tech companies instead of small businesses. One of the employees at the restaurant also suggested to call in your orders instead of going through apps.Support Ktown Pho today, you seriously won't regret this amazing food. I can't wait until this awful pandemic is over so I can actually come in and eat here every single week!!!"
2/10/2021,20210210,5,4.5,"Best vegetarian pho in LA. Broth is complex and the toppings include a variety of fresh veggies and fried tofu. Owners and staff are all super friendly and always helpful with suggestions. I miss eating there in person, but their to-go packaging is really well done."
2/14/2021,20210214,5,4.5,"YUM! Our new go-to Vietnamese spot! We struggle to order just pho or just a bahn mi, so we get both. Food has always been ready quickly, and prices are fair. Togo orders are packaged nicely, making it easy to reheat the broth at home."
2/16/2021,20210216,3,4.5,"ordering was easy via text messaging, food was ready when i arrived for pick up...orders the beef combo pho and spring rolls and came out to over $20. A bit expensive for what it is. the taste was okay, nothing special, and food was a bit cold when i ate it. parking is hard, you have to find street parking."
2/19/2021,20210219,5,4.5,Always kind and very good service people there And the food is also very kind haha thank u guys for good food !!
2/20/2021,20210220,5,4.5,My favorite pho spot in LA. Highly recommend the ox tail pho. I have been converted from rare beef to ox tail. The meat is so tender and flavorful. Their delivery kit is really great with the broth and noodles/toppings in a single to-go bowl but the lid has a neat compartment that holds the noodles and toppings.
2/22/2021,20210222,5,4.5,this place it! used to only go to pho in Chinatown but we have better pho now in Koreatown
3/1/2021,20210301,4,4.5,This would be 5 stars if it wasn't for their Goi Cuon. I love spring rolls and peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was good but the spring rolls literally had 1 stand of noodles. It was mostly lettuce. It was okay but would have been great if they had the proper ratio of noodles to lettuce and they would've easily gotten five stars from me.
3/4/2021,20210304,5,4.5,"- Covid 19 Post -I don't know why I haven't tried this place earlier! The food is flavorful, fresh, and easy to eat right out of the to-go container! I ordered: - Oxtail Pho- Fried Egg RollsVia ChowBus app. Oxtail Pho was extremely flavorful, authentic in my opinion. It reminds me of the small mom and pop shops I go to around Riverside and Garden Grove. On a cold day, it was exactly what I needed. Plus, I loved how much oxtail there was in my one bowl of pho! More so, they packaged in a way where you can eat from the container it comes from. Their fried egg roll tastes extremely fresh. I loved how it came with veggies so you can have a variety way of eating the egg roll. I personally like having the lettuce wrapped around the egg roll for a crisper taste! Dipping sauce complemented the savory roll, and overall would order again!"
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.5,"best pho in LA! everything is so fresh and the staff was THE SWEETEST! we had the wagyu pho (#1), the egg rolls, and Thai tea. Everything is a 10/10. definitely coming back here for my next pho fix. :)"
3/11/2021,20210311,5,4.5,"I'm updating my review to give them 5 stars. Despite the fact that I asked them to add more noodles (suggested by response to this review) as to be to be proportionate to the lettuce, it still was not. That being said, their veggie egg rolls are so yummy (as is all of their food) and they are so nice that I have to give them 5 stars. I have found my go to Pho place since my favorite Pho 97 in Chinatown closed. I will continue to push for more noodles and less lettuce in the Goi Cuon."
3/21/2021,20210321,5,4.51,"God damn delicious. Had house special pho, summer roles, and grilled pork bahn mi. All good but pho was just exceptional - soup was greasy yet didn't taste light, savory, meat was fresh and succulent. I've been to many vietnamese restaurants ran by vietnamese that serve phos that doesn't even come close to this place."
4/7/2021,20210407,5,4.51,"I've been getting takeout from this restaurant since the beginning of the pandemic and have been beyond impressed. My experience dining in was even better! Everyone I've spoke to while picking up my orders/dining in have been beyond kind and I find the prices and portion sizes of the pho here to be more than fair. The pho itself is 10/10 and I 1000% suggest getting the spring rolls, WAIT FOR THE CRUNCH. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this establishment and I proudly consider myself to be a regular now :)"
4/13/2021,20210413,5,4.51,"I was out here with my sisters yesterday and we all definitely recommend this spot when your in the mood for Vietnamese or Asian cuisine . They have dine in again and are safely practicing the 6 foot rule. Our first time dining in since the shutdown last year. Their egg rolls were nicely seasoned and right amount of crunch.. their spring rolls were delicious and fresh where they also added some onion crunches to which gave it a nice palate texture when you bit into it. One of my sisters ordered the pork vermicelli which she enjoyed very much. The three of us ordered the pho; Kobe beef , ox tail, and combination pho, all of which we enjoyed very much as well. The broth is always the key to amazing clean pho and theirs hit the spot. Thai teas were also on point,  Not too sweet/sugary . We all ended up ordering to go more food for our families back home. Next time we come out to the area we will stop by again. Thank you!"
4/25/2021,20210425,5,4.51,"Our new go to pho spot in Koreatown. My boyfriend and I been looking for a good pho spot that we can eat at when we come to L.A. We came across Ktown on Yelp and simultaneously agreed on this place. As soon as we arrived, we felt the good vibes (which plays a lot into an experience). I grabbed a menu and asked if we needed to order through scanning the barcode and the manager said very politely, ""No. I will take your order."" As soon as the manager came over he asked if we were ready to order. In short, let me just say that he was the most polite, friendly and wonderful server/manager and knows how to treat his customers! I'd like to also shoutout the rest of the staff that showed the same kindness and professionalism as the manager. Now, most importantly the food... the pho was delicious! Totally hit the spot! In all, we bookmarked Ktown pho and are coming back!We recommended you to come and try it! #SupportAsianBusinesses"
4/26/2021,20210426,5,4.51,The best in the hood. Great people great food.One of the few places to serve nem nuong.
4/27/2021,20210427,4,4.51,Great pho and great service. I called in about 20 minutes beforehand with my order and it was ready when I arrived. Everything was correct & I had/have no complaints.The inside is clean and the employees are very nice and efficient. I got the #2 (oxtail) and devoured it. There was a generous amount of meat that slid right off the bone. All the fixings were fresh and tasted very good in the pho. Parking is kind of ugly since it's in the heart of Koreatown but I lucked up and found a spot literally right up the street. Try it out!
4/29/2021,20210429,5,4.51,"I love this establishment. I've tried their Bun Bo Hue, Banh Mi, and their Bun Cha. Everything was good and I have yet to be disappointed. This place is as good as it gets in Ktown for Viet food, so go here now. For parking, they do have 1-2 spots behind their building, but don't rely on it. Find a spot in the street in the neighborhood."
5/1/2021,20210501,5,4.51,"My go-to bahn mi place! Local gem. It's a pretty small location, but I always come back here for their bahn mi. Cant complain for the price and it's always a perfect quick fix. I ordered this for dinner for our team once and even my boss had to agree that it's pretty good. I'll prbly have to try their pho too sometime but i'll always be back here for their bahn mi. They're not open Wednesdays tho so just keep that in mind."
5/4/2021,20210504,5,4.51,"Tucked away in the heart of Ktown, this gem is my go-to for amazing food! You won't regret ordering the Pho Tai and Fried Eggrolls. TRUST!! In my five years of living in LA I never found a better spot for my weekly pho cravings.This is a family owned business and KT really makes the restaurant feel like home. He gets to know everyone and is an all around warm and kind person. I'm moving away but Ktown Pho will be a place I always come back to"
5/8/2021,20210508,4,4.51,Great Pho! Service was excellent! Would differently recommend. Can't wait to visit again! My daughter had the Oxtail & I had House special. Very yummy!
5/17/2021,20210517,5,4.51,"Best Pho ever!!! This place is one of legit pho place you can visit in Ktown.I'm so glad I don't need drive to SGV or Garden grove for pho after I get to know this place.Their broth is clean and not too much MSG (or maybe no MSG). Meat is always fresh , staffs are friendly as well.I wish they have more dine-in area."
5/20/2021,20210520,5,4.51,Ordered the pork banh mi sandwich with beef winter roll. Place is on a corner so parking is hard to find on a Wednesday or Thursday because of trash days. Nonetheless the meal was delicious. The banh mi tasted very good with fresh ingredients and the breading was nice and crispy. The beef winter roll was also very tasty. Highly recommend this place to others on
5/23/2021,20210523,5,4.51,Pho is the perfect light comfort food. This one is so so good. I've always loved the food at Ktown and this is definitely among the hidden gems. Coming back to try their banh mis.
5/23/2021,20210523,1,4.51,"Two nights ago, I dined here with a friend during lunch and ordered one of their ""wagyu"" $15 pho, a combination pho, and a thai tea. The soup was extremely bland so i proceeded to flavor the broth with the one piece of lime they provided per person and two jalapenos. I asked for extra lime and they brought out a couple more. Even still, it wasnt enough to flavor the broth. I later realized that they didnt bring us the basil, so upon asking for some, they brought out the saddest and smallest piece of basil. At this point, i thought they were just very stingy with their condiments. I had a bite of my friends ""wagyu"" meat and it the meat was super tough. The thai tea was gone within a few sips because we ordered ice with a splash of thai tea for $4.50. We ask for the bill and see that they charged $1 for the lime without our previous consent. Very dishonest business practice. At least tell your customers in advance and let them decide if they want to be charged $1 for three pieces of lime or not. I've had my share of bad dining experiences but everything about here was so off."
5/27/2021,20210527,5,4.51,"My boyfriend and I were wandering around Koreatown looking for a spot to eat that would also allow pups, and were elated to find Ktown Pho! They happily seated us on a table outside of the restaurant in the hallway area, and brought waters for us AND lil Chewie. I got the Bun Thit Nuong with the Chanh Day to drink, and it was very delicious! About halfway through our meal, a kind woman in the restaurant asked if she could offer Chewie some rice, and he got his own little meal as well! We couldn't have asked for better hospitality and kindness in a restaurant, and are looking forward to coming back in the future! This spot is incredible, and has gone above and beyond in terms of accommodation. Thanks again for everything!"
6/11/2021,20210611,5,4.51,"I'm not normally a big pho fan, but I was really impressed by the freshness and the flavors offered by this small pho joint in Downtown. The owner and employees were really friendly and attentive as well!My friend and I both got the house special pho. It came in a big bowl and plenty of beans and onions and sauces on the side! The meat is served a little red so that it cooks in the broth. It comes out really tender and flavorful :-) The noodles were a little firmer than I would've liked, but I was still satisfied nonetheless!They have a small parking lot behind the store, but if that's full there are some limited street and meter parking options in the area as well. Overall a really cute pho joint, would really recommend to anyone who's craving somepho in the DTLA area!"
6/13/2021,20210613,5,4.51,"Time & Date: Sunday, 6/13/13 @ 4:20pmVisit: Walk in, no reservationPayment: CardOrdered: Duoi Bo Oxtail & Bun Bo Hue OxtailThis restaurant is located inside a mini plaza in ktown, but there's no lot so you'll need to find street parking. This pho spot is opened by very warm owners, and the servers are also extremely kind! They got rid of physical menus, and instead tell you to scan a QR to pull up the menu on your phone. I ordered 2 types of oxtail dishes -- pho and bun bo hue.DUOI BO / OXTAIL -- $15Imagine your classic beef pho, but instead of slices of beef, you get pieces of oxtail! The oxtail was honestly the star of the dish, the meat was so well marinated and fall-off-the-bone tender. I dipped it in this chili oil and omg it was the bomb. BUN BO HUE OXTAIL -- $15If you love bun bo hue but are not a fan of pig hock, you will absolutely love this dish. This was the tastiest most flavorful bun bo hue soup ever -- it was shrimpy, beefy, tangy, yet umami. Literally the perfect beed noodle soup with the perfect amount of fragrance.TLDR: If you ever come to Ktown Pho, order a noodle soup dish with oxtail!"
6/21/2021,20210621,5,4.51,Best pho I've had! This place is excellent and the food is very fairly priced. As someone who had tried at least 20 pho places in LA this is easily my favorite.
7/8/2021,20210708,5,4.51,"I think this is the best Pho I've had in LA so far!!Fresh and flavorful noodles + broth + meats.Spring rolls were average, tasted kind of dry.Lotsss of seating.Super friendly service."
7/17/2021,20210717,5,4.51,"Ktown pho is a hidden gem. The food here is incredible, the broth tastes so freaking fresh and everything is incredible. The packaging itself is also one of a kind. It's made and packaged in a way where it's very compact and keeps all of the items in tact for to go orders.The staff are also extremely nice. I Was afraid that this was going to be just another pho joint and I was afraid that it wasn't going to be authentic but so far this is one of the best places for pho in Los Angeles."
7/24/2021,20210724,5,4.51,"Loved it!! Had the chicken Pho and it was absolutely delicious. Flavorsome broth, noodles and tender chicken. Friendly owner :) Will be back!"
7/29/2021,20210729,5,4.51,This is the 2nd best vegan pho I've ever had! And I am comparing to pho in many different countries. Truly amazing comfort food
8/11/2021,20210811,5,4.51,"really good pho! lowkey hole in the wall, which obvi means they're super cheap. spring rolls are really good too."
8/20/2021,20210820,5,4.51,"Tasty tasty pho - house special what fantastic. Large portions, fresh fixns', great staff, fast service. Price excellent. Most definitely would recommend"
8/21/2021,20210821,5,4.52,The Pho is amazing here. Super flavorful and big portions. Friendly staff. Don't let the location fool you. I love the unique back room. Very KTown.
8/22/2021,20210822,5,4.52,"This place needs way more recognition. Crazy good and cheap, and they're really nice. Banh mi was crusty, chewy and light. It's hard to not support small businesses with places like these."
8/29/2021,20210829,4,4.51,"The food is pretty good, but don't Google their menu. Google gives you a completely different price list. My order came out to $30. I did a bit of calculations and should've paid 20 max. I came back and the guy said that they don't recognize any other menu other than that QR code one they have upfront."
8/29/2021,20210829,5,4.52,"At first I was hesitant about this place, because I thought it was Korean owned. I'm sure the younger generation of Koreans make better pho than their predecessors, but the only reason I decided to try Ktown Pho was because I read on here that the owner is Vietnamese. Parking is pretty much nonexistent, and I actually did not want to give five stars because the portion of meat was small. The least amount of meat I've had in all of my experiences both Korean or Vietnamese, although I could be wrong. However, I did not want to give four stars because the broth is the best in this area, and, unfortunately, there is no 4.5 stars. If I could give an advice to the ownership, I'd say please give bigger portions. When you skimp out on meat the whole serving looks small, and the pricing isn't as cheap as the previous place I've been going to, so some people, including me, may tend to think it may not be worth it. I guess it depends on how desperate you are. I definitely will be back, but, considering difficulty in finding parking, I hope the restaurant will make up for it with larger portions."
8/31/2021,20210831,3,4.51,"We tried them for the first rime today. Their pho's were yummy, but their egg rolls taste like they've been x3 fried."
9/19/2021,20210919,5,4.51,"I drank the night before and had a pho craving. No hangovers but figured that something hot and soupy might bring me back to life. Usual spot was closed so decided to check out Ktown Pho. I had to circle the block a few times for parking.Upon entering the establishment, I was instantly seated and ordered the filet mignon pho and plum soda. I really liked how tender the beef slices were compared to the regular one. Broth was super flavorful. I finished all my noodles and took the remaining broth home. It was that good!Overall, I didn't have much expectations coming in, but I was very pleased with the quick and friendly service and the quality of the pho. I will definitely be back soon."
10/1/2021,20211001,5,4.51,Some of the best pho I've tasted. My kid is a pho fanatic. I'm not too big on soup. My kid loves this place! And honestly I've yet to try a better pho place. And there chili paste is amazing. Took a jar home for the fridge. 10/10 would recommend to a friend
10/13/2021,20211013,5,4.52,"This Koreatown eatery has quickly become my fave destination for its trademark Oxtail pho, which boasts deliciously clean and savory broth each and every time. To add more to my dish, I love adding Chinese broccoli and black mushrooms, with an added dollop of smoky Satay.During my last visit, I was unfortunately shorted change. I took note a few hours later, and quickly sent a note via IG. I was pleasantly surprised by an immediate response, stating management would review their video for any oversight. Not only did I receive an expeditious response, once the video was reviewed, I received an apology for the waiter's accidental mistake and a complimentary offer and repayment, upon my next visit.Thank you to Helen and her staff for such exemplary customer service and the immediate attention in the matter.Do yourself a favor and go experience a bowl of pho at KTown Pho!!!"
10/15/2021,20211015,5,4.52,"Dear Ktown pho,Where have you been all my life? For so long, I've been scouring all of Ktown for a delicious bowl of Pho, only to be left disappointed time after time. Alas, my search has come to an end and now I may finally rest in your #2 Ox Tail Pho and your #5 Pho Tai. When life gets hard, I can lay my head on your light and fluffy spring rolls. Your Thai Tea though... you might have to work on that tbh. Alas, Ktown Pho, I pledge my loyalty to you. You will be the only Pho establishment located in Koreatown that I will eat at."
10/16/2021,20211016,5,4.52,I actually throughly enjoyed my experience here. I usually go to the 626 area for pho but my usual place was closed so we decided to try this place. Parking is street only and pretty impossible. We ended up parking at hmart since we were going there anyway and parking is free on Sundays I believe.We ordered the kobe beef pho and combination pho. Both were super delicious. The kobe beef in the pho was super tender. The broth for both was also super satisfying! Overall this is probably the best pho place in ktown. Only issue might be parking but it's highly worth it!
10/24/2021,20211024,5,4.52,Cero complain PriceFlavorTerder meatGood service Im student next corner in my break time I use to come here fast service.
10/25/2021,20211025,4,4.52,"I generally don't eat Pho so I don't have much to compare this establishment to. However, it was a very clean and light broth. The meat was delicious and the portions are pretty hefty. The Thai tea was amazing!"
10/30/2021,20211030,5,4.52,"Went here today and I must say they had great service. The young man made sure my grandson was happy and comfortable too. Most places don't care about children in a mostly adult environment and he went above. Thank you for your hard work. As a restaurant owner I am very critical, but they got me for Pho."
11/7/2021,20211107,2,4.51,Let's just say I won't come and pick up oxtail pho here. I get it prices went up and everything is pricey but let's not skimp on the food. Noodles was so small. Noodles aren't that expensive to buy in bulk. And the one big pc of oxtail and two tiny pc for how much? Yeah too much! Maybe I need to go into the restaurant and dine in. But I probably won't. The flavor is OK nothing wow about it. Parking sucks In the back. Good luck in finding parking on the street. Thanks but no thanks. I can say the employee are friendly.
11/7/2021,20211107,5,4.51,"Love this place!!! Gotta say, the best pho in ktown LA. In fact, all of their food in the menu is good! Highly recommended if you're looking for some goood pho. Their soup is very bold and flavorful! Their Thai tea is good too. Only bad part is parking. Their parking lot is really tiny. Only about 7 parking spots. I've been lucky every time I went though. If you're not from LA but in the area and craving some good pho, go here! Must try!"
11/9/2021,20211109,5,4.52,"I lived in DTLA and this Pho is my go-to now. It was so flavorful and the portion was filling! At first the amount of noodles concerned me, but once I added them to the broth and mixed in the meat, I was definitely FULL after I finished. My BF doesn't really like Pho, but this place made him a believer!! I ordered Pho Tai and Cha Gio. (and will again and again)"
11/20/2021,20211120,4,4.51,"I've heard this is the best place to get pho in K-town. I've been here twice. I think this second time around was much better.Granted, it's been years since I checked out this place for the very first time. I recently ordered the House Special Pho with Kobe style beef. The meat was great. Deliciously soft and easy to chew away. The pho itself was decent in taste. I had no qualms. Maybe a little bit overcooked as it seemed too soft. Otherwise, the waiter that took our order was friendly and was talkative. Perhaps it's because we're in LA, the pho price seemed heftier than your typical bowl of pho. Regular bowl was about $12. The House Special was like $16. I guess that's what helps to pay the bills? Overall, an acceptable pho dining experience."
11/20/2021,20211120,5,4.52,Recently moved to Dtla & found the best pho restaurant in town! Soup is so bomb. Spring rolls so fresh everything about restaurant is amazing keep up the great work! Will always be returning & brining new friends!
11/26/2021,20211126,4,4.51,I've tried this location multiple times but seeing that there were bugs/rodents/some kind of creature during their inspection makes me a bit uneasy. I'm hoping they keep the place more sanitary.
11/27/2021,20211127,1,4.51,"I don't know if there's new owners but this place fell off. Used to be one of the best. Prices are raised, portion sizes seemed smaller too. Right before my pho comes out a girl with red hair comes up and says ""no onions sorry"" and walks away. Probably should of told me that before I ordered a 15 $ bowl of pho huh. Rest In Peace ktown pho."
11/28/2021,20211128,5,4.51,"There's a lot of good pho in so cal so it can be hard to stand out, but this place really hit all the marks. The broth is very clean and light yet deep and flavorful. It's not overbearing either and has just the right amount of richness. The bean sprouts/veggies were given in individual portions and were very well cleaned and pristine which is not the case in a lot of places. The wagyu beef is the most tender and well trimmed beef I've had in a pho before. The oxtail is also good and there's a decent amount of meat on them. The only con would be the price as it's more expensive than most other pho places. But when I think about having pho, I'm likely to go to and remember this place instead of that average pho I had but was sub $10."
11/29/2021,20211129,5,4.51,"This pho was absolutely great, the service was great! Everyone was so nice, such a cute place to go out to eat!"
11/30/2021,20211130,5,4.51,"Another pho restaurant review?! Why the PHO-ck not! Second day after Thanksgiving and by this time, definitely not looking forward to having leftovers again. After dropping off my sister at SoFi stadium to watch BTS on their 1st concert since the pandemic, I definitely wanted to treat myself to some self love. KTown Pho is located on busy Western Ave (between Olympic and 9th street). It's in an unassuming strip mall so be prepared to find parking on the street or if you're lucky, behind the building if there's any. There is a counter as you enter where you can order food to go. If you make your way back to the side of the door, there is a small restaurant which can sit 30-40 people comfortably. I opted to sit outside adjacent to the restaurant along the corridor, still able to see the buzz from the main dining area but able to enjoy the privacy of my own company.As I normally do each time I eat in a pho noodle house, I get the combination bowl, theirs is #4) Dac Biet with thinly sliced rare Steak, Flank, Tripe, and Beef ball. As you should before dressing your pho with the traditional accompaniments (bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño and sliced white onions), you should dig your soup spoon into that broth. Soup should definitely waft the air with spices: star anise, whole cloves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and coriander seeds. And of course, KTown Pho's broth did just that. It was hot and was comfortingly delicious. What I particularly appreciated with their dish is how thinly they sliced their tripe. The tripe was sliced so thinly that it almost seemed to blend with the rice noodles with each bite. Nothing worse than going to a restaurant and the tripe is cut to unevenly that you can definitely tell what you're eating. Of course, I also tried their Spring Rolls (3 rolls) #2 appetizer, Goi Cuon with Shrimp, Pork, Vermicelli, Lettuce w/ a Peanut dipping sauce. As with authentic Vietnamese spring rolls, these came with the crispy fried rice paper in the middle that adds an extra texture to the bite. Sadly, I didn't get to taste their iced coffee because my sister already ordered my iced latte from Alfred Coffee. Which of course being a good patron that I am, I politely left in my car because there's a nice sign that reads ""No Outside Food or Drink Allowed.""This was a nice break from all the heavy holiday food I have consumed in the past couple days. Yes, it's okay to eat alone once in a while. It gives you time to reflect and appreciate what we often times take for granted, a little ME time."

I will say the outside seems sketchy but once you're inside, you can see how relaxing the atmosphere is. I got a Thai iced tea and beef pho. And it was really good."
12/11/2021,20211211,5,4.51,The pho tai is my go to! Their broth has SOO much flavor. I love eating here on a rainy day.
12/13/2021,20211213,1,4.51,"After reading the reviews I thought this place was the best. Unfortunately my experience was not best. I had combination pho and my partner had eye round rare steak. Honestly, we both didn't really like the soup because the taste of fish sauce was overpowering. BTW the amount of meat we got was not satisfying. The funniest part was they only gave us a little bit of bean sprouts, a little tiny piece of basil, 2 slices of jalapeños and 1/4 slice of lime each person."
12/25/2021,20211225,5,4.51,My go to pho place! I always order the same thing here which is the rare steak pho. I've tried many pho places in Ktown but their broth is amazing! Make sure to ask for the sauté sauce on the side
12/28/2021,20211228,4,4.51,"Definitely appeased my pho craving! I also enjoyed the spring rolls. Flavors were all there and the take-out packaging was nicely done. My only complaint is that the fried rice was a little dry, but adding some sauce does the trick."
1/9/2022,20220109,4,4.51,"We'd been looking for a new spot for Pho as our old favorite switched to take away only during the pandemic and never looked back. Good for them. Not great for me because unlike many other kinds of food, Pho doesn't really travel that well. Sure they can separate everything and I can put it together when I get home, but I just want to eat... now. Anyway, my wife was looking around and saw Ktown Pho was well reviewed and pretty close to home. So we were in. We went on Saturday afternoon and found easy street parking right out front. They have a parking lot but we didn't realize until later. Next time. We tried the Bo Bun Hue, the house special Kobe Pho and some fresh spring rolls. Great depth of flavor and just all around satisfying. Everything was really tasty and the service was fast and friendly.We will be back because this is my new favorite spot for authentic Pho. Yeah!"
1/12/2022,20220112,5,4.51,This is my go to pho take out spot! I usually get house special pho. Everything is very fresh and flavorful!
1/21/2022,20220121,3,4.5,Portions were small for two. I got the seafood pho' without noodles and rice on the side. It was ok but I won't eat there again. I also got spring rolls and egg rolls. They were mediocre.

1/22/2022,20220122,1,4.5,"I'm very disappointed. For all you vegetarians and vegans be aware vegetarian pho, they used BEEF BROTH. HOW DECEIVING AND CONTRADICTING THAT IS. I was really hungry and was eating the VEG SOUP And it taste like I was eating BEEF, so I only ate the noodles and vegetables. I didn't think that they would actually used BEEF BROTH ON A VEGETARIAN DISH, I thought that maybe they used some kind of seasoning to make it taste like beef, like Beyond Burger. I was curious and I called and ask, OMG!, they said it's BEEF BROTH!!!No wonder, I couldn't drink the soup I felt like throwing up."

They use fresh ingredients and the most important ingredient, the bread, actually the baguette has a nice crisp into it, while still soft inside. I've had their pho too and I loved it too!"

2/1/2022,20220201,4,4.49,"Pho is very hard to review for me because most places taste very similar. My boyfriend and I both got the House Special Pho and we shared the Four Season Rolls. The house special pho comes with Kobe beef which I haven't seen in LA before. The meat is super tender! The broth was a bit bland for me but tasted a bit ""healthier"" or more refreshing than most pho places. Maybe cause they put less msg, idk. I still enjoyed my meal.The Four Season Rolls is an assorted roll plate so you can get a taste of each one. Dip it in some fish or peanut sauce and it's the perfect juicy bite!"

2/21/2022,20220221,5,4.49,"Truly authentic and absolutely delicious food!!! Recommend by a friend to me, I will be eating here moving forward!"
2/21/2022,20220221,5,4.5,Amazing! Def the best pho in town. Highly recommend beef pho but bah mi are good too! Great customer service. Spacious.
2/23/2022,20220223,4,4.49,"Had the taste for a solid banmi and darted into Ktown Pho. First time in place and it appears there are other restaurants within the building. Anyway, service was quick. Ordered the chicken banmi. Well prepared as the key to a great banmi is the roll. Also, ordered some egg rolls which were nicely packaged. Almost forgot what looks like a salad is actually lettuce portions and seasonings for the rolls. A great taste.Nice visit. They have earned a return visit."
2/27/2022,20220227,5,4.5,"Highly recommend! I ordered the chicken pho and added all the veggies for takeout, and what a treat! Plus, the portions were large enough for 2-3 bowls. Enjoy!"
2/28/2022,20220228,5,4.5,"Came here on a Saturday with my girl friend, and we had the best experience. As soon as you open the door, you instantly get it with the smell of pho broth which is truly indicative of a solid pho restaurant. It's so low key and small, but I loved it. Service was so quick and friendly, and they made sure that our order was to our liking. My friend got the pho tai and I got the oxtail bun bo hue. Pho definitely hit the spot and the bun bo hue was well-seasoned though it wasn't as spicy as I would have initially hoped for. That's okay! I think they really tone down the spice level to cater to a broader clientele. I would definitely come back to eat here again. Parking is somewhat spotty though!"
3/11/2022,20220311,5,4.5,I LOVE PHO. Ktown pho is one of my favorite pho venue in Korea town. The food is delicious and dine in experience has been as good as always. Super friendly staffs and togo packaging are just amazing.
3/12/2022,20220312,5,4.5,"Best Pho in town. Super busy on rainy days. Not much seating inside and parking can get tight but the pho is worth picking up, and the owners are very friendly. Truly a neighborhood place that should be supported."
3/16/2022,20220316,5,4.5,"Our orders:-- HOUSE PHO ---- SPRING ROLL ---- SUMMER ROLL --This is our go to pho place. We get the House pho and sometimes the spring/summer rolls. The pho is good enough that we won't be looking for pho anywhere else. The order comes out super fast, it's clean, and it's not too oily. The rolls are OK - good, they're definitely unique and are crunchy. The only thing is we wish they give us more noodle because the serving size is pretty small."
3/17/2022,20220317,5,4.5,Best Pho restaurant in k-town. Definitely would recommend.
3/20/2022,20220320,5,4.5,"This place is tasty!!! I love their shrimp pho, even though it's a little sweet (they clean their shrimp). Their fried egg rolls are great, too. As far as customer service, they are always busy, but move quickly."
3/21/2022,20220321,5,4.5,I'm so glad I found this gem! This place serves legit pho by Vietnamese owners! I Love Korean Pho just as well too but I'm so glad that I don't have to go out to SGV 626 for Vietnamese pho anymore! Staff is super friendly and don't forget to try their special chili oil mix that they have too! Makes the meats tastes so savory. Highly recommend this spot! Def very homey and makes me feel like I'm at some strip mall in Asia (:
3/22/2022,20220322,5,4.5,Best pho place in K-Town LA! Service was fast and the place is clean with great customer service. Love their pho soup and bun dry noddles and their grilled bbq pork was good as well! A must try place when you're in LA!
3/26/2022,20220326,3,4.5,"We were in the area and decided to have some pho. A little on the pricey side, prob the most I've paid for a bowl of pho before but it is what it is. The quality of the oxtail was good. The spring rolls were fresh and I loved the crunch inside. Would I probably come back? Probably not. But the service was good. I did have to wait for my bowl, even though the customers that arrived after me got their order first. They were apologetic about it. If you're in the area and want some pho, you should give this establishment a try."
4/2/2022,20220402,5,4.5,"Pho ga & spring rolls + peanut sauce . Tucked away in an offset building, small dining area, all noodles @ their DTLA location (so I heard) definitely worth a spot on the bookmarks for ktown"
4/3/2022,20220403,3,4.5,I'll give 5 star for the taste however tooo much MSG and sodium in the pho to make it taste so great. After I eat here literally I can't move I get sooo sleepy and tired. Sodium makes my eyes and face puffy and getting thirsty like crazy really bad for kidney. 5 star for the taste 1 star for using too much MSG and sodium.
4/5/2022,20220405,5,4.5,"Oh man we love this place! K town Pho is a great spot for a number of reasons; the food is on point, we always get a parking spot out front, and there isn't a wait even though there are always people eating there. Service is quick with a friendly attitude at minimum.We have gotten a combination of different pho every time we go, so I'll say so far we have liked each one every time. I don't recall a time we haven't. Parking is on the street, when you walk in to the building take a left (to the right is another place) and head down the hall. Definitely a solid place when craving Pho!"
4/16/2022,20220416,5,4.5,bombbbb some of the best broth i've had in a while / great service. they are a little pricy for pho but the food is delicious and worth it.
4/18/2022,20220418,4,4.5,"Ktown Pho is located on the corner of a street. The atmosphere is very casual and there's a small seating section inside. The staff was friendly and service was quick. The prices are slightly above average, but not outrageous. They do clarify that the prices have risen due to the current economic situation on their website. I ordered the Pork Belly Banh Mi ($9.50), which was good, but nothing special. The pork was on the thinner side and not super fatty, but still tasty. I also got the Filet Mignon Pho ($16.00) with extra steak ($3) and noodles ($1), which was quite a big portion, but still doable if you're hungry. The steak was tender and very good. Their broth is lighter than others that I've had in the past so I added more hoisin sauce to give it a bit more flavor. I also added their chili oil which was a nice touch! Definitely recommend eating here if you're craving some pho!"
4/24/2022,20220424,5,4.5,Pho was Fresh and delicious. Called my order in advance and was able to pick up on time.
4/25/2022,20220425,4,4.5,"There is something so comforting about finding a Vietnamese place when you're visiting from the midwest. I sat down waiting for a friend to meet me, and the owner came out and I greeted her in vietnamese and she was immediately excited to see a young person speak the language. It made me feel really safe and seen. The food was so good. We ordered the 4 season rolls, you get one of each, the shrimp and pork, grilled pork, net (pork sausage), and grilled beef rolls, cut in half. They are thick rolls, with a great amount of protein and veggies. The traditional pork and shrimp summer roll had a tiny, tightly rolled fried egg roll wrapper inside. It was such a surprise and a first for me. It came out with the 3 sauces traditionally eaten with the rolls (peanut sauce, fish sauce and the orange sauce for nem nuong). Totally recommend if you can't decide and want to try a little bit of everything. As an entree I ordered the bun bo hue. I am very picky about pho, so I never get it in a restaurant. I usually feel the same about bun bo hue but this one had oxtail on the menu and I had to try. I wish it was stewed longer, more fall of the bone, but it was still good! I added steamed pork roll (cha lua) and it was another dollar or 2 for that. Worth it because I love cha lua. Had a great experience, it was a quiet chill day. It was a little pricey but I sort of expected it for being in California."
4/25/2022,20220425,5,4.5,"Yeah actually fire. The service is amazing, the food is even better. The owners clearly care about their food and their customers. I think the beat pho we've had in LA."
5/8/2022,20220508,5,4.5,"Just what I was craving. Good pho, attentive service delicious. I had the filet minion pho. It was great."
5/23/2022,20220523,5,4.5,Absolutely delicious vegan pho!!! Ugh so good very flavorful broth best veggie pho I've had
5/27/2022,20220527,5,4.5,"If I'm in town, you know I'll be getting the bun bo hue at this joint. I come down to the La area probably every 2 wks, and out of allllll the pho places, THIS IS THE BEST. The broth is authentic, not the usual watered down pho at other places. You can tell they truly care about the food they make & serve to their customers. I always get the Bun Bo Hue and my fiancé gets their pho tai. The shrimp rolls are a must when you order noodles. It just makes me feel comfortable & happy after every meal."
5/30/2022,20220530,5,4.5,I will always love this place! Everything is so delicious and their customer service is always amazing!!! Their Thai ice tea is just one of the best ones we've ever had!
6/3/2022,20220603,5,4.5,"Their service and kindness is always excellent and very quick. Genuinely my favorite pho in L.A. Plus, perfect for hangovers"
