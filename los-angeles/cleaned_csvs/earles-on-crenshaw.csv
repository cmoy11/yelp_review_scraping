8/23/2015,20150823,5,5.0,"I have been using Earlez Grille to cater parties between 15 - 1500 people at my house and my childrens' schools for well more than a decade. They are my Go To Caterer for fun Events, no matter what the occasion. I have used them for Business Meetings, Bar Mitzvahs, Back To School BBQs, and -- believe it or not -- Wine Tastings. Earlez has that magic combination of the three essential things in a Perfect Caterer: (1) Delicious Food (and a Menu with enough variety to please Vegetarians as well as meat lovers); (2) Extremely reasonable (I would say ""inexpensive"" but then they might raise them) prices; and (3) Impeccable Service! It is a trinity of delight!Do not hesitate to have Earlez Grille cater your next Party or Event. They come out to set up, they look great and serve neatly, then when they are gone the next day, you cannot even tell they were there (well, except for that warm satisfied feeling in your belly from some incredibly tasty vittles!)."
1/20/2017,20170120,5,5.0,"Went to the Soft Opening, and I can say THEY ARE BACK. The Hot Dogs were as good as I remember. Service was excellent. I had a slight wait for my food and Earle gave me a free drink. It's great to see customer service like that in the community. Highly recommend! Pinks, Who?"
1/20/2017,20170120,3,4.33,"Happy to see Earlez back!!!! But no tamales- a little disappointed. The great thing was that Earle actually explained why, very nicely!I hope they will still have the old school coffee cake - my bad I forgot to ask Despite no tamales I will be back"
1/24/2017,20170124,5,4.5,"Turkey dog on point. Love the fries and the chili!! I get the chicken link, no bun butterfly...a beef chili bowl with pico de gallo pickles and jalapeño. Honey punch is legit.Loved this joint when it was a baby!! Now We doing it big!! Awesome service.Awesome people. Thanks earle!"
1/25/2017,20170125,5,4.6,Limited menu? No problem!! I'm just happy they are back on the map.. I've been craving a chicken link and their fat seasoned fries for wayyyyy to long and finally my wish came true!! I love the build your dog concept!! As for my chicken link? Yumminess to the 10th power!!!! Lol....Thank you Earle's for such great food and customer service. LOVE the new spot!!! ;))
1/28/2017,20170128,4,4.5,Came here because the vegan chili dog and it did not disappoint.  Hot dogs have been one of the things I missed when I quit eating meat. Nice to have some place local where I can get a good vegan one.  #GetVeganCheese
1/28/2017,20170128,5,4.57,"I love this family as I have known them since a child. Always delicious food coming from this place and even the catering is just perfect! I recommend the chili cheese fries, meat patties, playaz punch, and the beef dogs. Great to see Earles Grille back in the neighborhood!"
1/29/2017,20170129,5,4.62,Best in the west!!!! Good to have you back. Rembering when you started with a hot dog cart. The chicken link so bomb!! Excellent service and very clean!!!
2/1/2017,20170201,5,4.67,I wish I could give this place a TEN STAR RATING!!! I love this place!!!! Customer service by the employees and owners is FANTASTIC!! The chicken links are like nothing I've ever had!!! The vegan chili a WINNER!!! Do not forget to have the PLAYA PLAYA PUNCH!! Delicious!!
2/2/2017,20170202,5,4.7,"delicious! half of our group opted for vegan/vegetarian (we added cheese) and half of the group ate the beef chili dogs. we also got the chili fries (both beef and vegan) everyone was happy and the service was so friendly. everyone who works there is incredibly warm and mr. earle himself stopped by to chat and shared the story of his business with us. i'd not been here before it re-opened but, given the line i saw and the conversations i heard while i was there, i can tell that they've been missed. it's super difficult to find tasty vegan hot dog/chili dogs (and especially a place that offers both meat and veg options) but this place has selected some fantastic ingredients and the build your own hot dog method ensures that you get everything that you want on it. can't wait to explore the expanded menu!"
2/6/2017,20170206,4,4.64,"We are so happy to find a vegetarian/vegan offering near to Expo West. Thank you for re-opening Earle's. Chili dogs! Vegan or non....Currently the menu is simple and the hours are limited Tue - Sat, but the dogs are great for meat eaters and non-meat eaters alike. Give them a try."
2/7/2017,20170207,5,4.67,Hey this was my 1st time here and it was really good. I had the chili cheese dog with some chili cheese fries and let's not forget the drink players punch bomb!
2/7/2017,20170207,4,4.62,They are back in business! I've been patiently waiting for years. Unfortunately the menu is much smaller and so are the veggie dogs. Why did they shrink so much. The veggie chili is still amazing though. This place still hits the spot.
2/12/2017,20170212,4,4.57,"After closing down the location on Rodeo and Crenshaw a few years ago he has RETURNED ! !!! Currently they are serving a limited menu with plans to increase in the near future. On the limited menu, the chicken link with the vegan chilli and grilled veggies is AMAZING . However, I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting the return of the Salmon burger. Haven't been able to find one like it since they closed the previous restaurant."
2/14/2017,20170214,5,4.6,Earle's is back at it! Great food and a great family. I have been come here for over twenty years!
2/15/2017,20170215,3,4.5,"Cool place! First time there & I enjoyed it. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because there is no seating - you must stand & eat, and because I wish they had more options on their menu. They would definitely make more if they offered more.But the service was top notch & the place was sterile!! A definite recommend :)"
2/21/2017,20170221,5,4.53,"He's back........ It seems like they were gone for years but I finally got to satisfy my chili dog craving. Even though I spent more than I would have liked, great food is great food, you just pay. Welcome back Earlze, you were sorely missed. That link with chili cheese and New York onions was fire!!!"
2/23/2017,20170223,5,4.56,"Been goin here for years.. I stay in Oakland now, but still make it a point to pop in when in LA. Always good and they treat you like family. Would leave 6stars if they'd let me.."
3/3/2017,20170303,5,4.58,"I've been down with this business from day one and that's when there was just the cart!If you want a great dog, veggie burger and beyond I'd like to congratulate you on making the most magnificent choice and contribution to a South Los Angeles staple.This is what a small business and good eats are about with a natural east coast feel that is second to none with owners and staff that takes the taste of a famous region like LA serious enough to dedicate the time, effort and sweat equity into a menu that makes you want to come back for even more.I have lived on two continents, fivemetropolitan cities from the underground Seattle seafood cuisine on Pine Street, to the great Canadian steaks of Calgary, the pasta carbonara of Connecticut, to the Dominican dish of mangu in NYC's Washington Heights to the Cuban chuletas of MIA....from the San Gabriel Valley to Crenshaw this is a must try no matter where you have hailed your cabs to or from...Earle's and everything on the menu is literally worth the Uber or Lyft ride across town with friends and loved ones.You won't be disappointed and oh yeah tell the owner I sent you !"
3/4/2017,20170304,3,4.5,"Pros: their hotdogs are pretty good. Had the turkey dog with onions and cheese. SUPER YUM. Those onions were seasoned and good. Playas punch ( i think thats what its called) tasted like a good mix of like Kool aid and something elsebut who knows. It was a cute mix. And I would definitely try it again. Cons: I truly disliked the chili. We also had chili cheese fries and to me, the chili tasted like water. Like it honestly have no taste to me. I am just one person and everyone else likes it so maybe my taste buds are off. Not sure but no me gusta! I'm going to try the vegan chili next time. Overall: I liked this place. I liked the people. Oh, I did get peach cobbler. Haven't opened it yet. Sure it's good. Pero yo no se at the moment. I'll be back tho. Nice vibe. Good people"
3/4/2017,20170304,4,4.48,"Went there this evening. Had the punch and a dog. Super good. Love the location - stands out on the Shaw. Strategic. Great to see you back in the community. Much success. I had the chicken link with vegan chili, cheese, and grilled onions."
3/8/2017,20170308,5,4.5,"It's been a few years but Earle's is still the business!!! Great personalized service and great food. I ordered the Beef chilli cheese fries and and a turkey chilli cheese dog with ""NY"" onions and you know it was flight. Oh and of course a Playas Punch. There's a limited menu at the moment due to the new staff being trained and as time goes by they'll be adding more of the old items the regulars know and love. Carey said the hrs of operation will be changing by next month so be on the look out. If you haven't tried this spot it's definitely worth a try you can customize your dogs so don't be shy and they also have vegan options. Earle's is definitely a staple in the Crenshaw community I'm glad they're back. The Shaw is finna be lit!"
3/10/2017,20170310,5,4.52,"Had the vegan dog, with vegan chili, cheese, kraut and onions on wheat bun. Simply delicious. I couldn't tell that the vegan dog was vegetarian. I haven't tried any of the meat versions and I don't think I have to. The vegan chili or the onions made the chili mix taste a bit sweet, so I suggest adding some spice via jalapenos The honey punch was sweet and refreshing. I would suggest some healthier sides like zucchini fries, but it may not be needed. I will definitely go again."
3/12/2017,20170312,5,4.54,"Love the concept and the food! Kosher beef or Vegan dogs. Yes please!Went in with the kids. Ordered a kosher beef naked with a side of fries. Trust me the side of fries were huge! I get the spicy beef smothered in chili cheese. Talk about delicious and flavorful link and chili. Wife ordered the vegan dog with the vegan chili. She was amazed at how filling and flavorful her vegan dog was. Not bland nor mushy. It had a snap like a real dog. We all had small cups of the what we thought was strawberry lemonade or that's what it tasted like and absolutely loved it. A bit on the sweet side and we like that. The place is 5 star on the food, drink and service!"
3/13/2017,20170313,3,4.48,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I remember going to their old location a few times and loving everything I tried so I was very happy to see that they were back. I stopped by last Friday night and stood a few steps behind someone placing their order, Once they were done I waited to be called to the register but the young girl completely ignored me. I waited and looked around like @_@ I was going to walk out but finally a Hispanic girl with short hair and tattoos asked me if I was ready to order. She totally diffused my mood and took my order. I ordered a turkey chili cheese dog, chili cheese fries, vegan dog, vegan chili cheese fries and lemonade. I asked if they had vegan desserts and she gave me a sample of a delicious chocolate cake, One bite and I was sold. I was like yes girl, I'll take one! Sadly, they were only giving out samples of the cake not actually selling it. QUE??? I laughed it off and she was kind enough to give me a couple more samples and told me they are working on getting that cake on the menu soon. The playa punch was too sweet for me but my daughter loved it. When they are preparing your hot dog they call you over so you can tell them what toppings you want. My daughter really enjoyed the turkey dog ad chili cheese fries. My vegan dog was just okay, I wish they had vegan mayo as an option. My problem is with the vegan chili cheese fries, they use real cheese! DON""T call it Vegan if there is dairy in it!! I take my part of the blame in this because they do add a * and at the bottom of the menu it tells you that the * means real cheese but come on! don't call it vegan if it has cheese, call it vegetarian, their menu is misleading and I think they need to change it. Sadly I only ate two fries until I realized that they used real cheese, the rest of my fries went to waste which sucks because they ain't cheap either. The vibe here is very chill, everyone with the exception of the first cashier is very friendly and they play some good music while you wait. I really hope they add vegan cheese and mayo to their menu, if they do i'll be back for sure!"
3/13/2017,20170313,5,4.5,I work in the next building and I'm always here! I love the entire menu. So happy to have this place near my job.
3/15/2017,20170315,5,4.52,The food is awesome! The chicken link with chilli and cheese is my fav and the playa punch is delicious. It's a must to come check it out...
3/19/2017,20170319,5,4.54,"The vegan chili is a must and the staff are awesome, friendly and helpful. I will definitely return for another meal. I'm excited about the new location as well."
3/21/2017,20170321,5,4.55,"This is going to be a problem. I live half a mile away and will be stopping here frequently. Delicious chili cheese fries and spicy chili dog. Great, friendly, upbeat service. Ate inside listening to some great deep, soulful house tunes. It was drizzling outside and they had beautiful sunflower bouquets on each table outside. Left just all around feeling in a better mood -- and I wasn't even in a bad mood :)"
3/27/2017,20170327,5,4.57,"Tried them while they were at the vegan street fair yesterday. We had the vegan chili dog. It was sooooo good! Best vegan chili I've ever tried, even though it had beans. I live in the valley but definitely will make the drive to eat their food again!"
3/31/2017,20170331,5,4.58,Had Earle's today for the first time in a LONG TIME. Service was A-1!!! I've been craving fries for days and fulfilling that craving with the beef chili cheese fries made the week's long time WELL worth the wait! I see myself being a frequent customer in the future. & I LOVE that there's even the word VEGAN on Crenshaw in this neighborhood. Hats Off!
3/31/2017,20170331,5,4.59,"Had the chicken hot dog, multigrain bun with a side of the vegan chili and the broccoli salad. Omg! Yum!! Definitely worth checking out! I live in Glendale and I'm looking forward to going back to that side of town."
4/1/2017,20170401,5,4.61,"Sooooooooooooooooo happy Earle's is back, yippie!!!!!.......Now they have a Vegan menu which is awesome but still offer the good ole hot links and dogs they're famous for!!!! They've got a new look and I love it"
4/8/2017,20170408,5,4.62,"We came here on Saturday at 11AM. A lovely lady greeted us and their service is excellent! Restaurant itself is clean and they gave us some samples to try. Of course their foods were delicious and price is decent. I ordered a spicy beef link with kraut and chili fries. I believe their hotdog is better than Pink's, and will come back again for sure!"
4/20/2017,20170420,3,4.57,Had I gave a review the first time I visited I would've given 5's because the chicken link was oh so delicious. Today I decided to get a couple of cheesecake slices. I should've bought another chicken link instead of wasting $8.50 on two slices of cheesecake.
4/26/2017,20170426,5,4.58,"Pass by this place almost everyday but never saw it. Today was on yelp and found it and went to try. This place blew my mind to say the least. Now, I'm not a dog kind of person cause they are usually too salty and too artificial tasting but this place has won me over. Turkey dog with wheat bun?????? That's the sh***** right there. The fries are more like wedges.......huge!!!!! Staff is very friendly, place is very clean. A++++ I'm my books."
4/30/2017,20170430,5,4.59,"Earle's catered lunch at my work last week. Everyone was really excited to have them there. Such a fun and friendly staff! They had a great menu and even offered vegan options. We loved the vegan salad, pretty sweet and savory. Also tried the beef burger with grilled onions, Mac and cheese, beef hotdog with grilled onions and lemonade. I'm hoping to have them cater my backyard birthday."
5/11/2017,20170511,3,4.55,"My daughter brought this home in Monday, and I was disappointed. It was not the same test or flavor when it was on Crenshaw and Exposition. The chili was heavy and the chili Fritos was missing Fritos and cheese. Three stars is a bit generous it is closer to 2.5. Hopefully it will get better when the menu expands until then I will wait.To the person who responded to my post, it was the day you were open during this week; we were loyal and frequent customers at the previous location; however the food was just so so the other day. This is not to be mean just stating the truth as I see it."
5/26/2017,20170526,5,4.56,I went to take a picture of the chili cheese fries before they dug in...but I was too late! Everything was excellent! We also got a chili cheese dog and a jumbo turkey dog. Customer service was EXCELLENT! I love that they call you to the counter while they add the toppings. Can't wait to go back!
6/3/2017,20170603,4,4.55,"Happy to see Earlez back!!!! But no tamales- a little disappointed. The great thing was that Earle actually explained why, very nicely!I hope they will still have the old school coffee cake - my bad I forgot to ask Despite no tamales I will be backThey brought back the coffee cake!!!! It's so yummy and brings back the best memories! Thanks I love the way they prepare your hot dogs!! The attention to detail is great."
6/13/2017,20170613,5,4.56,AMAZING VEGAN DOGS!! My usual order is a vegan chili cheese dog and the cheese is so tasty. Customer service is outstanding feels like I'm at home. I also appreciate the free samples of the vegan salad every time I order. Love all the different fixings you can add on your order for free like sliced pickles salsa etc. Fries are also to die for nice big steak fries If you are a vegan foodie you have to visit!
6/15/2017,20170615,5,4.57,One of the best hot dogs I've had and Dwayne the server was very helpful and making my decisions and very friendly
6/28/2017,20170628,5,4.58,"I came here and found this restaurant to be very clean. The staff very nice and helpful after I told them it was my first time. After I told them my preference I went with the chicken link dog with the chilli. It was an excellent portion. The link perfectly spiced. I read on this site that there were some people disappointed with the chilli. However it is advertised as chili soup. I found it to be full of flavor. I also loved the playas punch, it was sweet but not too sweet. I as planning on picking up something for a friend from one of the other dining venues in the area, but was so impressed I placed a take out order, but this one with cheese.I had a overall wonderful experience and would recommend them."
6/30/2017,20170630,5,4.59,"Hello all, just tried the food here for the first time and it was delicious! Had the chicken link dog with everything on it including chili and cheese and to complement my main course I had chili cheese fries with pico de gallo Yes I did!   The menu is basic for now because they just opened this year but what they have currently is of good quality. The chili is lean not greasy at all, they also have a full self serve fountain drink set up with some excellent house made lemonade. The staff is extremely friendly and aren't cheap with portion size the atmosphere is up beat and the establishment is clean.  A great addition to a great community congratulations!"
7/3/2017,20170703,5,4.6,"Feels and taste like home with healthy options for all. Pros: Good location! visible from the street with easy parking for a quick pick up. Clean inside and out if you want relax and eat at the spot. Professional order takers and cooks on the grill to help 1st timers like me wade thru the many options. One stop for everyone, vegan, vegetarian or meat eater. My son had the Turkey dog, my wife and I both had the Vegan Link with vegan chili that was a solid 10 and I am not Vegan. The Chili fries to me back to my childhood and that was 10 minutes of heaven. Cons: There isn't any....Well I do have to wait until I am in LA again to eat at my new spot."
7/5/2017,20170705,5,4.61,"I had the vegan chili fries(with dairy cheese) and it was super delicious! Loved the chili. I want to go back and try it with vegan cheese, not sure why I didn't before! Also loved the special vegan broccoli salad. The vegan dog wasn't amazing itself but covering it in the toppings made it tasty and just having the option at a hot dog place is great. * My boyfriend liked the vegan chili and meat dog but was a little dissapointed in his veg dog."
7/7/2017,20170707,5,4.62,"Great chill place to grab a quick bite to eat. Great environment, friendly staff, amazing prices !!! Lots of space to sit down and eat. Place is very urban and vintage style."
7/8/2017,20170708,4,4.6,"I have to love and respect a business that sticks to being a original. I love the Playas Punch, I'm from Detroit so I can taste Kool Aide in my cup, and they definitely make it right! If you know what's up you mix the two and you have a keeper. The food is pretty good, and I have to say it doesn't taste like fast food, and the quality was quite fresh. The store was hot even with fans on which forced me to sit outside which was fine."
7/8/2017,20170708,5,4.61,Great beef hotdog special on Saturdays along with great prices. Catch up on a good read here too.
7/8/2017,20170708,4,4.6,"A great variety of hot dogs and burgers with great vegan options.They are clean, professiona, and fast."
7/11/2017,20170711,5,4.61,"Sorry Pink's, this is the best Hot Dog in Los Angeles. When I was told that Earle's relocated from their old digs on Expo I simply could not wait to get to the new place to enjoy the finest Dog in the city of angels. The community forward attitude, best in class service, and even the ""Playa's Punch"" (Kool-Aid) are all back in full glory. Even better - there is now ample parking. Want to know the secret to a great life? An all Beef Chili Dog and Chili Cheese Fries order from Earle's On Crenshaw along with a drink of your choosing. Thanks to the countless options in toppings, you can create a custom Dog of any sort plus they offer Vegan options for the ubiquitous Vegetarian in your posse. Earle's grills their Dogs until they rip upon your order and then slathers them in a loose and delectable Chili Sauce. I like mine with raw Red Onion, grated Cheddar Cheese, and Mustard on a toasted White Bun but - by all means - have yours your way. Each Dog is between $3.00 or $4.00 fully loaded. You cannot beat it. I like to keep the Chili rolling with the Chili Cheese Fries that features not one, but two scoops of that delicious Chili sandwiched between freshly fried, the seasoned French Fries. Again, the toppings are up to you although I prefer to keep things simple as the Chili needs no adornment in my opinion. Cost of admission? A wallet friendly $3.00. Best consumed on the available outside tables on a hot summer day. New York City has Papaya King, Chicago has Portillo's and Los Angeles has Earle's. This is truly a must-stop for anyone visiting Southern California. 5-stars the hard way."
7/13/2017,20170713,5,4.62,Omg is all i can say ....my 1 year old and friend came here yesterday and absolutely love it the cashiers were jus lovely great customer service skills the food omg i had a jumbo turkey dog sith chilli n cheese n my daughter one with cheese i have a very picky eater and she dances the whole time she ate now dnt get me started on the players punch man that was pure crack lol amazing oh and my friend had the vegan dog n vegan chilli cheese fries she was sook happy this was her first hot dog since becoming vegetarian so i give this place a perfect rating plz visit this place amazing im telling u
7/15/2017,20170715,5,4.62,If you're looking for a great hot dog or link and you prefer beef or chicken or even vegan this is the place for you. I had a spicy beef link that was very tasty very tasty. I got onions which they have cooked in some type of a tomato sauce very good slightly sweet. The place is very clean and welcoming.
7/22/2017,20170722,4,4.61,So glad Earl's is back. Just had a tasty turkey hot dog! My husband for a chicken dog and a turkey dog. We both like turkey over the chicken. And to complete our meal we shared an O'l School Coffee Cake. We'll be back for sure!
7/28/2017,20170728,3,4.58,This place is just okay and they can be quite slow. My 1st preference would b Pink's.
8/2/2017,20170802,5,4.59,"They have veggie/vegan options: cheese, hot dogs, chili, desserts. I had a haystack tonight w/ Fritos. Everything is tasty and the service is friendly/charismatic."
8/4/2017,20170804,5,4.6,Amazing Customer Service! Amazing Samples! Amazing Establishment with tasty food! Thank You!
8/5/2017,20170805,5,4.6,"Vegan chili is delicious and they have great customer service ! Love businesses like this, I will definitely be back."
8/7/2017,20170807,5,4.61,"Two meateaters and a vegan (me) walked into a hot dog restaurant and had a delicious experience!Earle's uses Tofurkey brand for their Vegan Link and Follow Your Heart brand for their cheese. Could I make that at home? Yes. But sometimes I wanna eat out with my meateater friends and the prices aren't outrageous. Plus for a $1 extra, they'll top it with Vegan Chili. Didn't get a chance to ask if it's homemade chili or a third-party brand but I was very happy with my lunch order! bit.ly/2uANzy4The Meateater BF ordered the Vegan Chili Cheese Fries because he's a good man who knows how to keep me happy! I'm supposed to cut back on eating potatoes. But I have no regrets! bit.ly/2uktRLuWe also got to sample the Vegan Salad made of broccoli, cranberries, bell peppers, and dressing. A bit on the sweet side. Very good! There's also a few Vegan Cakes for dessert.A sweet elderly woman checked in on us as we ate. I think she's one of the owners. I noticed she had friendly conversations with everyone that walked in. Even the staff was super welcoming. Good food, reasonable prices, vegan options, friendly service, clean restaurant, and easy parking. 5-stars!!!"
8/15/2017,20170815,5,4.62,"The vegan GF and I heard about this place from Vince V and we met up for lunch on a Saturday. It's a hot dog place, a little pricey, but it was tasty. I ordered a spicy beef link (I think it was around $5), although I somehow missed the blatant special of the day sign: their kosher beef dog for $2. Oh well, maybe next time.The vegan GF ordered vegan chili cheese fries (made with Follow Your Heart cheese) and a vegan dog. We were also given samples of their guacamole and vegan broccoli salad, which tasted like, well, a broccoli salad. It was tasty and served as a good appetizer while waiting for the food.They had our food ready in about 10 minutes. I devoured my dog pretty quickly....they cooked it perfectly. Split beef link grilled to perfection sandwiched in a bun that was warmed to the right temperature. I requested some mustard and relish to help enhance the flavor (grilled onions cost extra, I passed because I like my dogs simple). The service was very friendly. The owner came out to talk with us and chat with a few minutes...a very lovely woman. Big smile on her face all the time. Parking was abundant in the back of the shopping center Earle's is in. Seating on the inside is limited so if anything, that's the only downside of Earle's. But we were easily able to grab a counter top table to escape the heat, although later on it got busy so the seating could be an issue if you time it wrong.Would not hesitate about coming back."
8/15/2017,20170815,5,4.62,"Their vegan chiliAmazing! Add some vegan cheese and some chick fil A fries and you'll be full for half the day! And I honestly was passing chick fil A and thought of the idea, it wasn't on purpose or I would have ordered vegan chili cheese fries from here! Anywho, I'll be back to try the vegan dog!!!"
8/25/2017,20170825,5,4.63,The vegan chili fries with vegan cheese is legit!So good!I'm definitely gonna go back
8/26/2017,20170826,5,4.63,"I tried the vegan chili chesse fries. They were pretty great! It's so awesome they have varieties for everyone! Vegan is new to me but its just as good. All the flavors that you would expect in a regular hotdog..Pretty cool guys! So happy I found this spot. I will be back. Rotating to the left, behind the counter were some empanadas. The lady told me they're real yummy. So I tried the veggie one and it was so goood! I only ordered one, but I think next time I'll go for just one of those."
8/29/2017,20170829,4,4.62,Good vegan dog but I wish they had more vegan sauces to go with it. The peach cobbler was also yummy but served cold. They also have a vegan lemon cake that is very good. Attentive and quick service.

Way better than Pinks... Just saying. I love the Subway-style layout so you can add toppings to just-about anything. There's plenty of space, friendly staff and tons of free parking."

10/3/2017,20171003,1,4.64,"One of the owners got defensive and raised his voice, causing a scene because I INQUIRED about the pricing as on the vegan food. I politely asked because I am a local around the neighborhood. Liemert Park is my area. I congregate, represent, and organize events with these LOCAL-owned businesses at Liemert Park. We are vegan/plant-base people in this area. I came here to buy a vegan dog for a friend who is transitioning off meat because I know you guys use MANUFACTURED SOY meat(first of all). I don't eat SOY anymore. The hot dog came out to be 8$ for one hotdog! I'm sorry, but this is not a true black business! Black businesses create a way for healthy! Affordable! Food! The guy said ""oh this is the only place that does this! Its cheaper than anything around here!"" BULLSHIT! Vegan/vegarian food is all around Crenshaw! And it's healthy and affordable! Don't give me your petty ass excuses. He says "" we pay a lot for our vegan cheese!"" OKAY so why u don't pay a lot for some fucking gluten-free bread, some organic/vegan ketchup and mustard, some mayonnaise?! Your business can EASILY be out-done by ANYONE around here! Let's be fuckin real! This business does not the support the betterment of black society, this business runs on the principles of WHITE society, this business is in for its own gain! I will expose this business. You are disrespecting this neighborhood and the movement we, people are establishing. Fuck YOU Earl. You fucked me."
10/5/2017,20171005,5,4.65,"Met one of the owners, Dwayne Earl. What a personable guy! Enjoyed listening to how Earl's came to be on Crenshaw. So not only did I have bomb-ass food, but I left inspired.I had the vegan chili cheese dog (link) and fries on the side. The fries are steak fries and very hefty. I'm coming back to taste the rest of their tasty concoctions... dessert anyone?"
10/14/2017,20171014,5,4.65,"LOVE! I was driving down the street and the ""Vegan"" sign caught my eye so decided to give it a try...so good!! I ordered the vegan chili dog with cheese, onions & jalapeño--flavorful and delicious! Nice ambiance inside as well. I loved that they have interesting books set out for guests to read while waiting for their food or dining in. Great customer service, too! Thanks, Earle's, I'll definitely be back :)"
10/15/2017,20171015,5,4.65,So yummy! Really good hotdogs and chili fries. Also love all the options available. Best day to come is on a Tuesday cause they have a special!
10/20/2017,20171020,5,4.66,"Earle's is so good. I have been a few times and I like pretty much all their vegan options. You can get a vegan hot dog, or make it a vegan chili dog, or even make it a vegan chili cheese dog. They are there for you! They also have steak fries and, you guessed it, vegan cheese fries and vegan chili cheese fries! I don't like the spicy vegan link too much so I stick to the vegan hot dogs, and always add the vegan cheese and vegan chili and it never disappoints. Everyone who works there is so friendly and they even have some vegan desserts that they bring in from an outside place. Parking is easy too."

11/16/2017,20171116,5,4.68,"This is a local joint in the Crenshaw District which I live and I kept seeing that they had vegan options.I was utterly in disbelief that a chili cheese/hot dog joint could possibly have believable vegan options?! Well color me impressed they do and it's worth it when you're vegan and feeling like you want some grease.To be honest not everybody wants to chow down on a bowl full of green vegetables, sometimes I just want to get downright dirty and Earles does it for me!!They definitely handle things efficiently and the inside decor has an awesome diner feel!! Clean and kept as well with friendly faces."
11/18/2017,20171118,5,4.68,"So Earle's was old school. I remember going to Earle's back when I was so young I thought chili was disgusting. Now as a grown ass woman I know better. I was also excited that they had vegan options all though I admit I was trepidatious. I ordered the Vegan link with vegan chili and regular cheese (imma work in progress peeps). That.Shit.Was.Delicious...Maybe it's because I hadn't had a link in months. Maybe it's because I hadn't had chili in months. I don't know but either way it was so yums!! My parents had the regular beef chili and they loved it. There are some drawbacks. Their menu is not nearly as extensive as their old menu. I remember chili Mac and chili spaghetti. Chili burgers and chili tamal. None of that is on the menu any longer. Also they have 2 chili sizes small which seems to be about 8 ounces of freedom for $3. And the large which is about 12 ounces maybe for $4. The large is plenty enough for one person but if you are buying for a family you have to buy individually. What is nice is that they have all sorts of sides for free! Raw Onions, jalapeños, guacamole (WHAT?!?!!), mustard, ketchup all for free! It is clear Earle's has decided on focusing on a few items and doing it well. If that is the case they are succeeding!"

The chicken link wasn't good either. He said he couldn't take it back because it was a chicken link. Whenever you go to a Resturant it you don't like it, they will offer you something else or take it off you your bill. The owner wanted to give me a discount towards another hotdog. I had already spent $10 for a hot link and chips. So I politely through it in the trash and walked out.  Earle don't be so small. Think customer service."

It's cheap and cheerful but you'll love it."

This is the only chili I have found that rivals my homemade chili ; ) i added vegan mayo and mustard, ugh, SO good. I also had the vegan chili cheese, and they layered them so every bite was delicious! I really appreciate that. I have a feeling we will be coming back to this place quite often, even though we are 12 miles away."

If you want some authentic and delicious chili This is the place to go. Another great thing they have is the FREE selection of toppings to add to your dog!!! Good good food will be back soon. Free wifi too! Oh and cute little eating area outdoor seating as well! Can't beat it.
12/22/2017,20171222,5,4.64,"For my money, Earle's is the best hot dog in town. I was sad when the original location was sacrificed to the transit gods, snd am so glad the restaurant has reopend. The food is great as ever, and the owners are so personable as to come out and delight your children and engage you in conversation. Earle's is a casual dining experience."

12/25/2017,20171225,5,4.64,"Over 20 years ago, my sisters were living in L.A. going to school, when they went to this hot dog cart right in front of the Crenshaw mall. One day I was visiting, and they brought me there, and I have been going to Earlz ever since. I've been with Earl through three locations, and a one year hiatus. When they reopened, it was like the best gift a girl could have ever gotten. I live in the Bay Area, and everytime I come to L.A. I bring home at least 4-5 chili links. The quality of the dogs has not changed. I hear a lotta noise about Pinks. So I decided to go one day...lets just say, I've never been back. If you have never been, run don't walk. I PROMISE you will not be disappointed!"
12/26/2017,20171226,5,4.65,"I can't decide where to begin! So much good to say. Exploring vegan options and the vegan chilli and cheese fries - Lawd have mercy - with the new york style onions and jalepeno peppers!

I'm proud to say that I have follow the path of this spot from when it was just a hot dog stand. The hot dogs are superior, the chili is great, the NY onions set off the hot dog, the customer service is speculation, and if are really greedy get some of their bomb high school coffee cake. Great business with great people"
1/12/2018,20180112,5,4.65,Absolutely delicious. I drive from the westise all the way here because it's so delicious. The staff is so kind and I always get the vegan chili cheese fries and the vegan hot dog. My friend referred me to this place awhile ago and I've referred like three others who have gone and also love it.  It's nice bc I'm able to eat one of my favorite foods without worrying about it having animal or animal products in it!
1/13/2018,20180113,5,4.66,"I stopped in today for jumbo beef dog, and chili, (no bean) cheese Fritos. Food was hot, fresh, and very satisfying. I'll certainly be back on a once a month basis"

1/28/2018,20180128,5,4.67,"Happy to see that Earles brought on some more vegan options. I'm not crazy on how the burger is made, especially the bread choice. But, because of the price point I can't complain to much! Bumped you up to 5 just for taking the time to write back."
1/30/2018,20180130,5,4.68,"Besides what comes from my own kitchen, Earle's has absolutely THE BEST VEGAN BURGER IN L.A.!!!! Hands down!!!! Why is their vegan burger the best? 1. It's SOY FREE. 2. They use the Beyond Meat Brand vegan patty!!! 3. The prices are fair! 4. The fries are a good size, and perfectly seasoned to what you order! 5. They have a vast array of juices 6. The desserts such as the different flavored vegan cakes and cheesecakes are impressive! Besides the all of the virtues of the veggie burger, their hot dogs are said to be delicious, and include a turkey beef and vegan option! You can even choose between vegan chili and turkey chili!!!! Soy free vegan cheese and regular cheese as well! And just like Subway, you get to choose your own condiments for what you want on your burger or hot dog, so everything is custom made, and you get to watch the process because they grill and cook everything in front of you!!!Earle's even has an awesome selection of entrepreneurial books that you can look at while you are waiting for your food which is very intriguing.Stabley Schmidt is always nice and clean and you will find beautiful fresh flowers on each outside patio table and on the inside table areas as well. There's also a cute arcade type game at two people can play for $.50 which goes perfectly with the ambience.My only gripe is that they are not open on Mondays. I don't have too many places that I crave in Los Angeles but this one will definitely be one of the top six picks for me!"
1/31/2018,20180131,5,4.68,Tried the vegan chili for the first time and it was good. Added it to my turkey dog. Can't wait to bit it
1/31/2018,20180131,5,4.68,"The food is always delicious! You would not believe that some of the food items are VEGAN! My regular items are vegan hot dog and vegan chili cheese fries! I also get the chili peppers to add a little kick to my food. No matter whatever you order, you will not be disappointed. Enjoy!"
2/9/2018,20180209,5,4.69,"BEST VEGAN CHILI CHEESE FRIES!!!!!!!!! Must try even if you're not vegan. They also have vegan desserts. The staff is so wonderful, clean, and welcoming. I love how everyone takes their time with the customer, from the moment you order through pick up."
2/10/2018,20180210,5,4.69,Been coming here since they reopened at this location. Vegan burger is fire. Staff is great. Will be nice to see them as a staple once this complex fills out.
2/10/2018,20180210,4,4.68,"Came here and so glad we did the food was excellent! And the dessert was even better!!! I will suggest your cashiers to be a bit friendlier and patient as it was my first time here, I felt so rushed to order..."

2/15/2018,20180215,4,4.68,"I would skip the Fritos with chili it's overpriced for the .50 cent bag that they give you. However, I was extremely satisfied with the vegan chili cheese fries."
2/22/2018,20180222,4,4.67,"Food was good order what's served within a reasonable time. Also had no problem with the rude Mexican man serving the onions and cheese on my hotdog. Guess some people are naturally uninterested in serving someone when they are the one who applied for the job. Seriously though it was a good spot, had. Ordered a beef hot dog with everything on it. Side of fries and a Ginger drink. Ginger drink was decent fries were alright as well."
2/24/2018,20180224,5,4.68,I came here for their old school coffeecake. Their hotdogs are also so yummy. I recommend this place they also have vegan hotdogs.

3/2/2018,20180302,5,4.68,"Great service, I don't eat dogs but these are bomb. You could feel the love when you walk in the door. Inspiring leturature is all around to help reduce the chains if in country, while you eat. Perfect joint!"
3/3/2018,20180303,4,4.68,I try and support Earle's when I'm in the neighborhood but this is the 2nd time my Vegan Chili wasn't hot - I asked the girl before she put it on my Turkey Dog and she assured me it was hot this time - unfortunately I was disappointed again - I will be back but next time I will make her stir the chili first - otherwise the food is delicious
3/8/2018,20180308,5,4.68,"Love their vegan link with vegan chili cheese fries. Most decadent vegan meal ever. Staff is super friendly. Love the movie posters and movies playing on TVs, too. Love this place!"
3/13/2018,20180313,5,4.68,Great food! Great customer service. Always a pleasure to grab lunch at this place. I often see a local celebrity or too here also. They have a new Vegan Burger that is
3/16/2018,20180316,5,4.69,"Being vegan doesn't come easy when I am driving around areas that don't really cater to vegans. I often find myself putting things together here and there to have a complete meal. I had noticed this place but was hesitant, well, talk about regrets!! I had the vegan burger and it was yummy, I loved that there were many vegan add-ons including vegan mayo. Even better, I love the fact that I can come back and try another vegan item! Vegan link, vegan chili cheese fries, vegan empanada, even vegan dessert!! Let's just say my only regret is not coming to try it sooner! Be patient though, good food takes more than 5 mins to be prepared. Clean place, friendly staff, cool books, need I add more? Enjoy"
3/19/2018,20180319,5,4.69,"I'm ashamed to say I've been living in Los Angeles for 30 yrs and my first time at Earle's was just the other day and I must say I was excited. I normally get my chili cheese fries and chili dogs from Wienerschnitzel or Johnny Rockets so I walked in not sure of my expectations. Earle's was very clean and organized the food was so fresh and tasty! They even had Vegan chili which was tasty as well! Friendly staff and great service, fresh delicious food with reasonable pricing. That's a win win for us. This is our new go to spot for Chili Dogs and Fries!"
3/22/2018,20180322,5,4.69,"I have heard many great things about this place and I finally got the chance to check it out tonight! The employees were very nice and very helpful. They were able to guide me through the menu and made recommendations based on my likes. I opted to go for a turkey dog on a wheat bun. I added vegan chili, grilled onions, guacamole and pico de gallo. I loved that my hot dog was prepared in front of me and I was able to see the process. They made sure I was happy with the amount of sides and were very meticulous when preparing my food. My hot dog looked so good I did not want to even eat it! I will be coming here time and time again! It's so nice to see a thriving business serving the south central community."
3/23/2018,20180323,5,4.69,"I found out about Earle's on Instagram. A friend and I decided to try it out because the have both vegetarian and Omni options. I had the vegan link and veggie Jamaican patty. The link was covers with vegan chili, pickles and banana peppers. Really good. The link is a bit spicy I will got with the burger next time I visit. This place has amazing staff and quick service. It was clean and I always appreciate a clean spot to eat. That you Earle's."
3/23/2018,20180323,2,4.67,"This place is big with the Vegan crowd, which I am decidedly notThe lady running this place is very nice, but the hot dogs are not goodThere's a reason hot dogs aren't usually made out of turkey, it seemsThey have beef, maybe those are better, didn't get to try themBut skip the turkey dogs. I'll stick to Vienna BeefGood french fries though"
3/27/2018,20180327,4,4.67,"Okay probably one of the best hot dog places to go to in Los Angeles. For all those who like Pink's, Carney's, and one of my favorite Tommy's this place hands down beats them all! The quality of their products are great, from Turkey dogs, kosher dogs to hotlinks and even the veggie dogs are of quality product, they have two types of chillies a vegan chili and a regular chili the best part is you can build your own hot dog or hamburger you can load it up from just ketchup and mustard all the way through sauerkraut and grilled onions and guacamole. This is a place you must stop by. Before I forget the prices are very reasonable.I would say it's only 5 minutes south of the 10 freeway.A note to the owners and managers you guys have a great staff after my third Fort I'm coming there they remembered my name Bravo to you guys."
3/27/2018,20180327,5,4.67,Great Dogs with a Vegan option !!! Another jewel on Crenshaw next to the post office and the Infamous Taks coffee shop! Love this area!
3/30/2018,20180330,5,4.67,"Awesome food, great service with carefully appointed dogs to your every wish. Feed your meat and veggie eating crew and meet some new friends all in one place. Solid books to read too. I'll definitely be back. Stoked to see they carry beyond burgers too."
3/31/2018,20180331,5,4.68,This is my second time going here and I wasn't disappointed. I had the turkey hot dog the first time and second time I had kosher hot dog with chili and both were yummy. Also I took peach cobbler home and can't wait to enjoy it at home. The staff was very nice especially one of the girls I was coughing and she gave me water. Can't wait to come crack and Earles close to home.
4/4/2018,20180404,5,4.68,"Well I saw a piece on KTLA Morning News with Earle. We decided it was worth the trip to try it out, with a client in tow from Texas we went, we tried, we loved. The 2 of us ordered a spicy dog, an all beef dog, a turkey burger, a salmon burger, veggie chili fries, chili and yes 2 drinks.. Yes we are nuts.. We eat it all,, it was that good... The food was amazing, especially when you consider how reasonably priced it is. Our favorites were the spicy dog and the salmon burger. I have never had a better salmon burger and I eat them a lot. The staff is simply amazing here. After we finished we ended up talking to Earle's mom for at least 30 minutes. She reminded me of my granny and was one of the nicest people I have met in a long time... Crenshaw is not really part of what you call my hood as it were, but I will stop by every time I am a near there for another meal... actually drive a little out of way for it...I love the way this is truly a great family, serving great food, with great staff... Earle keep it up you are doing a great job"
4/5/2018,20180405,5,4.68,"The food here was OUTSTANDING. I got the vegan chili link fully loaded, and my girl got the turkey dog with vegan chili and cheese. We DESTROYED IT. Not to mention, they have a bunch of toppings to choose from! The bean pie was amazing as well for our dessert. We will definitely be back!"
4/6/2018,20180406,3,4.67,Quality hot dog spot with excellent staff and unique offerings. Definitely reminds me of the cheese and ketchup on everything culture I love in Chicago.
4/8/2018,20180408,5,4.67,DELICIOUS! FAST! HEALTHY-ISH!Came here a couple times and was impressed and satisfied! The beyond burger (well done) is the best veggi patty ive ever had! And the vegan chilli cheese fries will bless your soul!
4/9/2018,20180409,5,4.67,The Vegan chili is by far the best I've had. They also have the beyond burgers which are pretty amazing as well. The friendly staff makes each visit that much more enjoyable.
4/10/2018,20180410,5,4.68,"Love , love , love this place ! Loved them from day 1 as they've moved locations . I just need their grilled chicken breast sandwich back on the menu please ."
4/11/2018,20180411,5,4.68,I've eaten here 7days in a row and I can't get Enough of those beyond meat burgers. Vegan Desserts and the fast service
4/16/2018,20180416,2,4.66,"I tried this place for the first time and I don't know but the food was bland no flavor at all , my husband tried the turkey dog and could not taste the flavor , I tried the chili cheese fries and they were bland and the chili had a weird old pot taste ..I don't know if I'll be back here , truly disappointed .. ohh the punch was really good tho !!!"
4/17/2018,20180417,4,4.66,The turkey dog with vegan chili was very tasty.....can't wait to try the turkey burger next time!  :-)
4/19/2018,20180419,5,4.66,"I stopped here a couple of weeks ago on my way back home. Let me start with the service. The woman who took our order was so friendly and helpful. Since it was our first time there, she offered to let us sample the vegan chili. It was delicious. Get it. Doesn't matter if you get it on your hot dog or the fries. Get it on both; it's that good.Now for the food. They serve Fieldroast products, which I already enjoy so I knew I was going to like my food. I got the spicy frank, which wasn't really spicy. It tasted like chorizo, but it was still delicious. I topped it with some sauerkraut, pickles, and yellow peppers. My boyfriend got the same frank, but he topped his with the chili and so many other toppings that I forgot, haha. But he was really happy with it. We also shared some chili fries. Even though I was so full, I couldn't stop eating them. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for some good food in a chill environment. I wish I lived in the area because I would happily eat here often. We don't have many vegan options where I live."
4/20/2018,20180420,4,4.65,"They serve meat AND vegan options plus you can choose what you want on your hot dog on the spot, like Subway style."
4/21/2018,20180421,4,4.65,I finally made it to Earles on Crenshaw. Cool place. I almost got too comfy watching tv instead of ordering. Its definitely food fast and not fast food. A bit interesting on the toppings. Food isnt bad at all.
4/22/2018,20180422,5,4.65,"Earles's has ALWAYS been delicious! The food is amazing and the service even better. I have been eating their food for years, and the quality, flavor and customer experience has never changed. Everything on the menu is worth trying!! Especially their veggie burger. Yummm!"
4/24/2018,20180424,5,4.65,First time eating here... I got like 3 different types of hot dogs and chili cheese fries! Fresh and made right in front of you. FIRE!
4/27/2018,20180427,5,4.66,The Best veggie chili Burger in the world juicy flavor spices I've been a fan since 90's we especially love Carey he's family just left my daughters favorite spot she had everything on the menu
4/28/2018,20180428,4,4.65,"Hip hot dog shop. You pay and then add toppings to your hot dog. They have beef, turkey, and vegan links. I got the vegan for 5$ and it was tasty. 2 dollars to add vegan chili and 1.25 to add vegan cheese."
4/28/2018,20180428,5,4.65,"My friend was in town and wanted to try this spit from Postmates, but they had stopped taking delivery at that time so we decided to drive. I was skeptical, but she was a guest, so we went. We were greeted immediately upon arrival and all of our questions were answered. My friend had the vegan burger and chili cheese fries and I had a turkey burger and the beef chili cheese fries...YUMMY! My food was delicious and the service was excellent! Their prices are affordable, especially for the taste and quality of food! I'll definitely be back to try the vegan meal!"
5/4/2018,20180504,5,4.66,"I absolutely love Earle's! Hits the spot after a long day, i go there so often the employees memorized my name. They really treat costumers like a priority here, and it's such a refreshing environment. The food is AMAZING! I absolutely love the food, my friends and i call this our ""spot"". This is an excellent place, especially if you're looking for tasty vegan food. Also, they have decorated it so amazingly! The diversity of people, food, decor and overall hospitality here is OUTSTANDING. Really brings the community together. Highly recommend."
5/6/2018,20180506,5,4.66,Better than Pinks!! I had not been here since they re-opened and it was better than I remembered! I got the chili cheese dog with caramelized onions. It was so juicy and flavorful! The fries were nice and crispy too! I will probably be back at the end of the month.
5/10/2018,20180510,3,4.65,"I was excited about this place because they have vegan options. I got a vegan chili cheese dog and it was very underwhelming. In short, I make a better one at home. The vegan cheese is a slice not shredded cheese. And they just kinda stuck it on the side. The chili was pretty good but overall just disappointing. The fries were good even though they were kind of expensive. The best thing I got was the vegan lemon cake! Sooo good I would go back for that and that only."
5/17/2018,20180517,5,4.65,"Killer dogs, man...... Killer dogs.....I'm a sucker for a good hot dog. It is such an easy thing to make and and easier thing to screw up. Simple ingredients, simple recipe and, when you get it right, you just say, ""dang...killer dog, dude.""Aaron E. gave one of his very rare 5-stars for this place and I was able to cross it off my bookmark list this week. While I would knock off a mere half star for value, I find it hard to make a better basic dog. The place is in a pretty shady neighborhood but I never felt unsafe. Easy to find and easy to park. The place is bright and spotless, certainly a diamond on a rough street. The staff was very friendly. While not cheap, the food is excellent. I will go down in history as a huge Portillo's fan with their Chicago dog. Also love a bacon wrapped L.A. street dog. This place is more basic with a long list of toppings that you can select to create your own perfect combination. Dog One was a white bun, beef dog, chili, cheese, mustard, red onion. The chili was perfect. Not too saucy like Cupid's but delicious. The meat was scored and had a good char on the skin. Dog two was a wheat bun, beef dog, Pico de Gallo, yellow peppers, mustard, pickle spears. You only have like 20 toppings to choose from so create your own delicacy. The french fries were insane. Super fresh, very thick cut and cooked perfectly. No fountain drinks, only cans and bottles, which cut down on the value but the meal was fantastic. They have a huge selection of vegan options that a lot of reviewers were raving about but this carnivore loved the dogs."
5/22/2018,20180522,5,4.65,i'm in shock. i got vegan chili cheese fries and a kool aid and my life will never be the same. Great service too!!
5/26/2018,20180526,5,4.65,It's my second time here and I love this place! The vegan chili-cheese fries were so yummy and it's super clean here. The staff is friendly lol Will was calling my name (about 4 Times) lol idk if he was feeling my taking a selfie to post on Instagram but he smiled anyway. I recommend this gem on Crenshaw (my old stomping ground).
5/29/2018,20180529,1,4.63,THE OWNER TOOK A BITE OF MY FOOD GROSS He is the WORST restaurant owner ever ! I have been here so many times and I have always loved it because I'm vegan & I always buy his vegan chocolate cake ! But I bought three one day and I took a small bite of one and it was dry my friend took a small bite of hers and it was also dry so we tried the last one and it was dry too ! So I went back in to tell him that this batch was dry and if I could get a refund ! He TOLD His worker to get him a fork and he ate some of the cake I tried to return and had the nerve to tell me it's not NASTY ! I said how could you tell me how it taste I want my money back and he refused after I've been there I was a loyal customer for those expensive hot dogs ! And I paid $5 per cake ! I'm not cheap ! I wanted to cry because of how he treated me ! Me and my friends will never ever go back to earls mean place on Crenshaw !
6/3/2018,20180603,5,4.64,"Five stars, my friends and I come here every few weeks because it's the only place we know of with a vegatarian or vegan chilli option that taste just as good as the real thing.Whenever we come here we splurge and overeat. Great options for meat eaters and non meat eaters. The service is great, the food is made in front of you and you pick out the toppings."
6/5/2018,20180605,5,4.64,This place is bomb! And VEGAN FRIENDLY!! Everything was so good! Every VEGAN MUST TRY THIS! Best vegan hot link ever!! I don't miss them no more.
6/6/2018,20180606,5,4.64,Thank you for all that you do for our community! I have been patronizing Earle's since he had a cart on Crenshaw and I love his hot dogs! Thank you for bringing vegan dogs and chili and cheese to the community!
6/12/2018,20180612,5,4.64,"Y'all love this place. The service is great. There vegan options and non vegan options are equally as delicious. Whenever, we are in LA, my boyfriend and I make it a priority to stop by at least once's This family-owned restaurant is definitely a model for other!"
6/12/2018,20180612,5,4.64,Get their vegan link. Not their vegan dog. The 5 stars is for the vegan link. Their vegan dog is 3 stars but i dont want to average the stars out cuz im not a dik.
6/13/2018,20180613,5,4.65,"such a hidden gem! I've literally driven past earle's countless times! this spot is walking distance from my home and I can already tell it's going to be a favorite of mine. after stopping at the post office to pick up some stamps, I sat and my car and did a quick yelp search of nearby vegan joints and BOOM! In comes Earle's sto save the day!I ordered the vegan burger with vegan cheese, and an order of fries! Everything is fresh and DELICIOUS! I believe they use beyond meat for their burgers. So GOOD! I even bought a burger for my mom, who isn't vegan, and she LOVED it. We both really enjoyed our lunch. I highly recommend this place! I can't wait to come back to try the vegan dogs and links and that playa punch looks really good too."

6/16/2018,20180616,5,4.65,"I have been back several times since my last review and I wish I could give Earle's more stars. We live an hour away and will take the drive down just to get food. Like I'm doing now as I wait for them to open. (Don't judge me) Often times the customer service changes after time with businesses but I can honestly say the employees here NEVER (yes I yelled, lol) disappoint. I'm going to need Earle's to do a frequent flyer punch card. The Earle's addiction is real."
6/19/2018,20180619,5,4.65,"I've had one of the best hotdogs ever, and it was right here at Earle's. My best friend and I came in on a whim and wow was it the right choice. I got a normal beef hotdog with chili fries. But the loaded toppings at the end and the experience was amazing! Not only was the food good, but the experience was hands down the best. The owner came around and greeted us. She checked to make sure everything was okay and was super sweet. Everyone, it didn't matter if they were an employee or a customer, but everyone was super inviting. It was hands down one of the best food experiences I've ever had."
6/22/2018,20180622,5,4.65,"This place is sooo great if you want to have some chili and cheese and not feel terrible after!!! How you ask.!? Order from their vegan menu!!!

6/22/2018,20180622,5,4.66,"The turkey burger was well prepared and ultra big, you def pay for what you get here and it wasn't too long of a wait and their players punch was really fire mixed with lemonade and fruit punch .. i barely finished the burger but was so stuffed after !!"
6/24/2018,20180624,5,4.66,Great Vegan Hot Dogs and Chili. All of the toppings I miss from my childhood. Love this place!!!
6/25/2018,20180625,4,4.65,"I had their Jamaican beef patty!! It was really good and the beef was hot as in had a spicy taste to it! It would have been a 5/5 but the crust wasn't crunchy since it was under the heater for a while, but still very good to me!"
6/25/2018,20180625,5,4.66,"This is hot dog heaven. I tried the Chicken Hot Dog and they had the Beef Hot Dog on sale. The beef hot dog with chili is the way to go! I had them put some hot sauce on the chicken one and it was kicking hot! Fries were delish with seasoning salt. I doubled down on a sweet potato cheesecake but they were out and I was forced to have strawberry and a bite of the peach one. The inside is nice, the staff were very nice and helpful and worked quick. It was a tiny bit cramped but alright. The parking is medium, but the area around the place was nice and quiet. Went for a walk."
6/28/2018,20180628,5,4.66,"The salmon burger was really fresh tasting and cooked just right. I tried the vegan link but should've stuck to what I knew to be the best which is the chicken link. The vegan link was good but not what I wanted I guess. The chicken link of course was and still is the best in my book. Oh and the fries are excellently cooked, seasoned & a must have with your dog."
7/9/2018,20180709,5,4.66,"Booooomb af! So delicious and being vegan I crave old cravings of childhood foods. Damn as hell. And to the person with a college essay size complaint, you trippin. And how the hell is chili dry as you say??? Dry chili is a burger patty"
7/11/2018,20180711,5,4.66,"I really enjoyed my dogs from here.They offer a vegan dog and a vegan link. I only got the regular dog. I went full on with grilled onions, kraut, and mustard on one; chili beans vegan cheese and raw onions on the other! I was so happy with the flavor of the chili, I enjoyed the texture of the dog (i believe its field roast), and I really enjoyed how clean and friendly the establishment was.Parking was so easy, street parking, plenty of room. Cool arcade machine table loaded with my favorite Mrs. Pacman while ya wait.I would definitely come back. Nothing more American than a hot dog and a cool glass lemonade."
7/13/2018,20180713,5,4.66,"East Coast visits West. Very clean, nice ambiance and good eats. Vegan menu and nice music. When I visit Cali again, I will make sure that I try something else from the menu. I forgot to share our pics from our visit."
7/15/2018,20180715,4,4.66,I came on a Saturday around 12:30ish. This place was jumping. I got a vegan link and vegan fries. It was good but it was nothing special. I love the fact they have vegan options. The vegan link was slightly spicy but nothing crazy. I like that they cook the food in front of you that's a plus almost reminds you have a subway but for hot dogs.
7/16/2018,20180716,5,4.66,"I can't lie it's good! People need to listen behind the glass though when it comes to toppings, because this lady put the wrong thing on my dog twice and made it to go I never said I wanted to go because I wanted to stay and maybe have Cake! When Earle there it's ran better when he not I can tell it get real relax there! The guy that cooks and do topping for your dog is awesome he speaks louder and clear and make sure he nails your order perfectly!! - it be some beautiful woman that come there which why I always come to stay for a while! They love Beef jumbo!"
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.66,"..This place is hot dog heaven.A Sabrett dog with just the right bite. The chili is terrific....this place is the go to dog place in the mid city, excellent Jamaican meat and vegetable pies and excellent desserts too..conveniently located next to the Crenshaw Mall and the soon to open subway station..street parking and onsite parking available"
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.66,I've been coming to Earles since my fake If club days.We would rush out the club on Santa Monica off Highland before the lights would come on so we could one of the first to get or chilli cheese dogs from this cart that set up outside the club.We would always speak to the gentleman operating the cart because we loved his strong Brooklyn accent but with We even found out during the day his cart was open by the Baldwin hills area so now we are eating Earle during the day late night. After all these years we have watched the growth with their brick and mortarlocation their food is constantly WONDERFUL. I even tried my 1st veggie burger them and believe I'm no veggie person but that was even. If in the area you have to go and visit you won't be sorry and this is coming from patron of Earle's well over20 years‼
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.67,"Great people great food great place, we in this community have followed Earl since the hod dog cart in front of the club in the early 90's and he grew and keeps it consistent from the food to the service all the way to his mother go visit this place doubt you'll be disappointed."
7/19/2018,20180719,5,4.67,One of my original fav spot when I hit the city. I'm glad to see it's still #1 in my Cali Food book lol ~ The Best EVERYTHING! Even the Vegan Menu
7/25/2018,20180725,5,4.67,It's hard to find a good dedicated hot dog restaurant but earls is just that. Great customer service and plethora of topping you can get it's hard to not want to try new things and they cater to that would highly recommend
8/1/2018,20180801,5,4.67,"Went to Earle's on Crenshaw yesterday early evening, looking for something different in a chili dog while on the way to Downtown LA.Earle's is a gem! Not only did we try and really really like a vegan dog and vegan link, both with vegan chili, there was an unexpected treat, a bonus or sorts, I will reveal in a moment. Earle's offers numerous toppings, all the usuals, plus vegan cheese. Based on my experience, I'd bet their other offerings are just as tasty. The staff was knowledgeable, nice and professional in their demeanor. The shop was tidy and clean, tooIn the front left corner of the shop is a week-old little popup offering Earle's newest shop addition - VEGAN gelato, straight from a passionate master Italian gelato master whom we met, along with his lovely wife and smart, beautiful daughter, who acted as product and company spokesperson, and able demo person.YES! Vegan gelato. SOOOO rich and creamy no one would know (or think negatively) that it is water-based and all natural, yet still vegan. The name is Puro, Italian for Pure, and made from scratch by hand. Last night we sampled Strawberry, Coffee, Chocolate Chunk and Peanut Butter. And then . . . the master gelato maker surprised us with his just-made, fresh pistachio gelato, with pistachios and other ingredients shipped from home in Italy. Oh, my! How can it be so delicious, rich, creamy, and thoroughly delightful, yet vegan? Don't know, but it's for real. Why vegan gelato? The master maker explained it as follows. Classic gelato is dairy-based. Creating a vegan product which retains the rich and intense flavor profiles of the best, genuine Italian gelato he has crafted for 30 years would invite inclusion for consumers with lactose intolerance and other dietary restrictions usually associated with dairy-based products. Now everyone will be able to enjoy this luscious taste treat. Brilliantly simple concept, magically executed! Don't quote me, but I think I was told a scoop is only about 200 calories of plant-based goodness.I WILL be back for the dogs . . . and for the Puro Gelato. Spread the word. I predict that Puro Gelato is going to be HUGE! And Earle's is going to need a larger space. Find more Puro Vegan Gelato info at purovegangelato.com. They're just getting started!"
8/6/2018,20180806,5,4.67,This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. They have vegan options & also options with meat. I usually get the vegan chili cheese fries. They are so delicious. Ive also tried the vegan burger and I enjoyed that as well. The staff is always very friendly. A lady who I assume to be either one of the managers or the owners even comes out from the back to check and make sure the guests are are enjoying themselves.
8/13/2018,20180813,5,4.68,"Best Grub on Crenshaw. Burgers & Dogs , Fat fries are a regular & skinny fries on Fridays. Then she said get a vegan burger lol and now I'm eating beyond burgers all day like I'm a vegan 20g of protein and healthy plus very delicious check it out."
8/25/2018,20180825,5,4.68,"Before I start about why Earle's is so iconic, I'll dive into the menu. They recently added the Alaskan Burger (Salmon) into the menu, and it's my favorite. I was wondering whether the would bring it back, and on the day that I planned to ask the staff, boom! It was there. The have some solid vegan options too, like the Vegan Chili Cheese Fries, which will you up. Vegan Chili Cheese Fritos are perfect if you're craving the junk food flavor but wanna cut the junk. Playa Punch (literally gourmet Kool Aid) is still on the menu, although I haven't caved in and ordered it yet. The greatness of Earle's goes beyond the food on the menu. They've been an anchor of this Crenshaw district for @ least 15 years (thats how long I've been a customer). I've followed them from two previous locations. Earle's has served as an oasis in an area that has historically been a food desert."
9/1/2018,20180901,5,4.68,I was in the area so I mapped this location and it for sure didn't disappoint. I had vegan chili cheese fries and peach cobbler cheesecake and both were delicious. The staff was very nice. They have indoor and outdoor seating in a cozy location.
9/6/2018,20180906,5,4.68,Fireeeee! The best hot dogs in LA.. family owned still and the owners are there working and greeting you like family! I've loved this family & their food since the my we're a stand in the parking lot of the indoor swap meet on king blvd!! Over 30 years of great food!
9/9/2018,20180909,5,4.68,Vegan link and vegan chili fries (w/regular cheese) we're both on point. I thought I had tasted every version of a vegan dog. I was wrong. Earle's reigns supreme. Five stars a high five and a smile! No detailed description needed- just frickin' good!
9/11/2018,20180911,5,4.68,"Came across this place by surprise was awesome even got a spot to park right in front , there was a line but it went smoothly, service was great and selection as well caters to everyone"
9/26/2018,20180926,5,4.68,my sister is a big fan of this place she said the chili cheese fries were amazing i couldnt believe it!! i finally joined her to Earls ran into a small problem thanks to Nancy my first visit wasnt ruined..i loved their thick fries yum and lots of cheese extra yum.
10/10/2018,20181010,5,4.69,"Though I do not live nearby, I made a point of visiting again yesterday afternoon on the way to an event at USC.Well worth the experience AGAIN. My friend and I went with one of our favorites, the Vegan Link, with vegan cheese and vegan chili, and split a side of vegan chili fries. SOOOO good!To cap the experience, we had to have some excellent Puro Vegan Gelato, a must-have when visiting Earle's On Crenshaw.Once again, Puro Vegan Gelato not only did not disappoint, it was pure joy. We had both Coconut and Cantaloupe gelato. I was a bit unsure of the coconut. Not a big coconut fan, but the gelato was so smooth, creamy and with such a pure taste, even this was more than worthwhile. I am now a fan of something with the taste of coconut. Try it, even if, like me, you think you do not like coconut. This just might convince you otherwise.The Cantaloupe Gelato was smooth, creamy and with the distinct taste of, what else, real cantaloupe. So sumptuous. Puro Vegan Gelato is the perfect dessert at Earle's OR go to Earle's just for this best-of-the-best gelato that just happens to be vegan.On this visit, as is my habit, I spoke to other visitors, and I always like to direct others to the Puro Vegan Gelato, giving a bit of my experience AND the info that for ANYONE, this is superb gelato. The two visitors with whom I spoke both expressed the concern that milk products do not agree with their innards. What are the odds of that!I told them that THIS gelato has no dairy, so it is gut-friendly to everyone, with or without a milk sensitivity. Both patrons had a taste, loved it and ordered. My job was done, one patron at a time. Yes, do try Puro Vegan Gelato. Then do your duty to spread the word.I cannot imagine anyone not absolutely loving this pure taste, real and imported ingredients made by a genuine Italian gelato master into exquisite gelato WITH NO DAIRY. How does he do it?!?!?I shall return . . ."
10/15/2018,20181015,5,4.69,"One of the BEST hot dogs I have ever had in my life bro. Go here and get the vegan link with vegan chili, cheese, relish, avocado and pico de Gallo you won't regret it. Why can't they be my neighbors man. lol"
10/21/2018,20181021,5,4.69,"I had the ""Vegan chili fries with American cheese and jalapeños"" and damm it was very good, wayyy better than expected! I never really had chili cheese fries before, never been interested in them, but Wednesday was the day I decided to finally taste em and damm it didn't disappoint!!The salty fries, American cheese, and jalapeños were great!! Great first time having chili fries, and they were vegan, made me feel healthy eating! Very yummy!"
10/21/2018,20181021,5,4.69,"My brother and I liked their vegan chili cheese fries so much that we went back the following weekend to have them again! LOL At our first visit I had the beyond meat cheese burger with the vegan chili cheese fries (regular cheese) and my brother had the turkey vegan chili cheese (regular cheese) burger. We also had their lemonade which both of us diluted with water as it was on the sweeter side for our taste. We were so stuffed as they are very generous with their chili cheese fries portions and toppings, that we took dessert to go. We ordered the vegan chocolate cake and the vegan lemon delight cake. I preferred the lemon delight over the chocolate, but they're both delicious :) Our second weekend in a row, my brother had the chicken sausage vegan chili cheese dog, and I had the vegan chili cheese dog, again, with a side of vegan chili cheese fries and regular cheese for each of us. This time I tried their ginger beer and my brother got a soda. We had to rush home to meet up with family, so no dessert this time, but I def want to try their vegan ice cream the next time I go :) There is plenty of parking, indoor and outdoor seating and the staff was friendly and patient with me both times as I decided on additional toppings for my food. This place has def taken a place on my favorite vegan comfort food list that both my brother and I can agree on. AGAIN the vegan chili cheese fries are sooooo good, you won't even know the difference!"
10/21/2018,20181021,1,4.67,:( so yesterday I went to Taste of Soul yesterday and walked around for sometime after watching the group Blackstreet which I use to be an assistant for. I had purchased some food at another food vendor and then walked around trying to find a place to eat. Came across Earl's grill which I have patronized plenty of times despite some of the taste of their food. I saw a free table outside and knew that I could potentially be asked to move because I know I hadn't purchased anything from their establishment that day. So I am almost finished eating my food then this dude in all black came up to me. I couldn't really hear him because of the music but I was gathering that he was asking me the leave. Then I look to my right and this older lady started to back up his story. Now I am getting confused because I am starting to get up and leave but then she starts to grab my forearm and starts to dig her nails into my forearms. It was almost a little demonic because she explaining why I must leave the table almost like she had had this conversation with me before. I am in shock because she is literally digging her nails into my forearm. After she said all she had to say and after leaving her imprint on my arm she said I could stay. I just left walking away in shock. Did I look like a thug I had to question myself. Hmmm I have on real Gucci flip flops a real Gucci belt and I drive a benz...I felt disrespected. Not once did I disrespect the security guard nor the older lady which at this present time I still dont know who she is. I am a college graduate you could have definitely spoken to me without putting your hands on any part of my body.
10/22/2018,20181022,5,4.67,I drove all the way from Inland Empire Moreno Valley California to go to this restaurant this man's mother is just beautiful she's awesome and all the way around beautiful people great food family oriented there's not another place like it
11/3/2018,20181103,5,4.68,"Chicken link, no bun, cut up, ketchup, mustard, mayo, Pico de Gallo, guacamole's, chili, cheese and cooked onions + fries + Playa punch! AMAZING!!!!"
11/10/2018,20181110,5,4.68,"This jewel looks like a standard hot dog and burger place but it is way more than that. They have delicious dogs and links along with chicken sandwiches and burgers. They will top them with anything you want and as much as you want. To top it off they offer a full vegan menu too. Burger, dogs, links and chili. They have vegan cheese to top your sandwich and all of the toppings. You can even get vegan cookies for dessert! Even with great food the best part of this place is the beautiful lady who comes by to check on how things are and make certain you are enjoying your food. She is a treasure. Do yourself a favor and get to Crenshaw and enjoy the experience. You won't regret it."
11/12/2018,20181112,5,4.68,The Chili Cheese Fries are the best. Just picked up a few and guess what Earl? I'm you loyal customer going forward.
11/19/2018,20181119,5,4.68,"We had Earle's cater my baby shower and we are so glad we chose them! The food was amazing, all of the guests were so pleasantly surprised when they realized there was something for everyone. From vegan chilli and Mac n cheese to turkey burgers, spicy hot dogs, along with the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. The whole Earle's team is just amazing and they didn't stop from the moment they got there they were offering a helping hand with anything we needed and once everyone's food was served they went around making sure plates were cleared. They even helped me cut my cake and hand out slices to all the guests. A good cook is a clean cook and Earle's was no exception to this rule being sure to leave things as clean as they were when they got there. We will definitely be using them again for future events and highly recommend to use them for your parties or get togethers, as they were a true pleasure to work with."
11/21/2018,20181121,5,4.68,SOOOOOO Good!Not sure how I didnt come sooner! I got the chilli cheese dog and can I say I still crave it to this day.I came with coworkers and there was plenty of parking. It was also decently priced as well!They also have a vegan options.
12/11/2018,20181211,5,4.68,"Great hot dogs! Came here for lunch to try the chili dog. Got the spicy beef link, with chili and cheese. You can add a lot of toppings for free, so I added jalapenos, grilled onions and yellow peppers. Delicious."
12/20/2018,20181220,5,4.69,"Hi Nancy - I have been back several times since ""cold chili"" experience and all is well with the Chili!!  I am a lifetime customer so just keep up the friendly service and the chili hot - Merry Christmas Earle's"
12/22/2018,20181222,5,4.69,"The Best veggie chili Burger in the world juicy flavor spices in the world I've been a fan since 90's we especially love Carey he's family just left my daughters favorite spot she had everything on the menuLast night we had the best beef chili hot dogs it was prefect l just want 2 more I'm be back tonight, my daughter was concern about the travel time l ate half of it when l got home it was still wonderful it's that good l see later tonight Mr Carey Best Hot Dogs N LA!"
1/20/2019,20190120,4,4.68,"Fast , Friendly,and fresh . Great customer service. Not too pricey either . Nice vegan options with generous portions."
1/26/2019,20190126,3,4.68,The food here is delicious but the service is awful. When I attempted to complain the cashier just kept giving me excuses. Just a heads up if you want to go in here to order something that is already done like a cup of chili you have to wait for them to service everyone else that ordered more complicated things that actually need to be made!I waited over 20 minutes for chili that was already made. Like literally in a pot. I could have reached over myself and spooned it into the cup. Poor management. If they don't correct that you'll frequently have customers that are annoyed and not want to bother with visiting.
2/3/2019,20190203,5,4.68,The Best vegan chili I have ever had. The vegan chili fries w/regular cheese is by far the best. Nothing bad to say here keep up the good work.
2/15/2019,20190215,4,4.67,"Definitely a great local joint. Get in line, look up at Menu board, be greeted by friendly folks, take your broccoli salad and utensils and sit down. Listen for your name to be called(not overly loud like ramen joints) so you can tell the chef what you like on your chili fries and dog.So great for us Vegans (trying to do my part for the planet) and friends who aren't totally Vegan, to have a good comfort food meal. Hot dog on a soft bun w relish, chopped onions and mustard(ketchup and mustard at the table)... soooo good. Broccoli salad was chopped broccoli with sweetened dried cranberries and yellow bell peppers(with a sweet dressing that you can go light on because already pretty sweet w cranberries).Vegan chili fries: skinny fries, really good chili flavor.Only reason I would hesitate to return was all the disposable trash we generated because it is all polystyrene or other singe use material(2 forks, 1 polystyrene. 1 paperboard, 1 #7 clamshell). Will ask next time if we can bring our own containers! Earle?Bathrooms nice and big- nice ABC quote on bathroom wall. Easy parking on street at lunchtime on a Friday.These are good folks. Later met a good friend of Earle's at Kenneth Hahn park-he echoes that Earle is a good guy (he started with a hot dog cart!).Thanks for offering vegan options!"
2/23/2019,20190223,4,4.67,"I received a very friendly greeting, so service isn't horrible here. Opt for the vegan link instead of the hot dog even if you think you can't candle spicy because my vegan dog was a little underwhelming. Also prepare in advance what you want on your hot dog because there are A LOT of toppings to choose from. You don't want to mess up. Prepare for heartburn as well because this definitely ain't healthy vegan food. Lastly, people love the chili cheese fries, but I honestly think they were meh. The fries themselves weren't that great, so just get the chili and cheese on something else if you really want to try it (ironic because my server recommended I get the chili cheese fries instead of it as a topping on my hot dog). I also think the fries would have been better if the cheese had actually melted."
2/23/2019,20190223,5,4.67,The food here is delicious! Great for people with allergies or specific diets. I usually get the vegan burger with vegan chili cheese fries and the lemon vegan cake. The staff is incredibly friendly.
3/2/2019,20190302,1,4.66,This week was my gf and I first time coming to Earles and it's our last time! The customer service was horrible thanks to the cashier. Her name Nancy I believe. Before taking our order she was on her cellular phone which is very unprofessional. My gf asked what's the difference of the dogs( meat wise) on the menu or what she had a attitude like we ask her a difficult question. Then she started talking in Spanish to her coworker and cracked up with laughter. Seems like she didn't want to be bothered. So we decided to go next door to Orleans and York. We were very disappointed!
3/8/2019,20190308,5,4.66,"Yummy vegan options. Great service. Friendly, helpful staff. Love coming here for a quick piece of comfort. Thank you for having vegan food!!!"
3/15/2019,20190315,4,4.65,"Good local spot. Food comes quick and hot and lots of options. Vegan and regular options are available, vegetable add ons as well. All around good food, customer service, and atmosphere"
3/16/2019,20190316,5,4.66,"Dank hot dog spot, got free vegan peach cobbler sample w my meal!!!! Vegan dog w chili and cheese onion and pickles was my order and was delicious ! Only thing i wouldve changed is melted the cheese! Playa punch was great when watered down a little otherwise a bit too sweet for me but all in all great!"
3/17/2019,20190317,5,4.66,I first off love that all the dogs are no pork casing.. But they have excellent toppings and I love the steak fries.. chili is good both vegan and beef.. also amazing pasties.. peach cobbler and banana pudding and my personal favs.. oh and the lemonade is soo bomb and refreshing!!!!!!!
3/19/2019,20190319,5,4.66,OMG! I had vegan chili cheese fries and vegan link and it was sooooo good! So glad I found this place. Staff was so nice and polite! Please keep up the good customer service. I will definitely be back.
3/30/2019,20190330,1,4.64,"This place is HORRIBLE!!!! I ordered 3 chili cheese dogs. 2 turkey, one beef. The pic attached shows what I received. I ordered through Postmates. When I called them they said Postmates was responsible for my order looking like that. LIES!!! They are. My order was nothing more than a salmonella disaster. That little cup you see is the chili. I drove to Earl's and showed them my order that o was not happy with. They refused to refund my money and were very condescending with me. They had the audacity to tell me they don't see a problem with my order. I paid $24.23 for this mess. It did include a 1/2gallon of punch, but still isn't worth $24.23 (delivery was free) this is unacceptable. I need a refund!!!!!! I wouldn't give one star if that was an option."
4/2/2019,20190402,5,4.65,This is specifically regarding Raychell's service. 5 star consistently! She takes such pride in her work. Your food will is a work of art to her. She treats everyone with respect and will make your experience all the better for it. She's an asset to Earle's!
4/6/2019,20190406,4,4.64,"Spicy beef link with chili and cheese was bomb! A little pricey, but it was worth it. That chili was amazing. Will return."
4/6/2019,20190406,5,4.64,I've only had two things from here and they've been consistently good THE CHILI CHEESE DOG and the FRIES! oh yeah and that SWEET ASSED KOOLAID!!!
4/26/2019,20190426,5,4.65,"On the way back to ""OC"" after visiting friends in L.A. on ""4/20"" (*OK...insert pun here*), we passed by a local eatery with a sign reading: ""VEGAN."" Say no more...turn the car around & pull over!!!""Earle's On Crenshaw"" is a local family-owned business, & I'm so happy we stopped in. It just so happened that ""Earle's"" was hosting a car show & art exhibit that afternoon, (celebrating the late ""Nipsey Hussle""), showcasing local artist(s), & the famous murals on Crenshaw Boulevard. We not only enjoyed the food at this local eatery, but it was a bonus to see the festivities & especially view the really cool cars.A small eatery, but airy & absolutely spotless, ""Earle's"" is a long-time local favorite, & they cater many celebrity-client private parties (names of celebrities I will not mention here). Their menu features Beyond Meat patty burgers, turkey burgers, vegan & non-vegan hot dogs, vegan hot links, vegan & non-vegan chili cheese fries, & tempting home-style desserts. There's pretty much something for everyone, so both meat-eaters & non-meat-eaters alike can all unite here!  :)Loved the vegan chili cheese fries, & they are generous with the chili (2 layered scoops!). To my surprise, the vegan chili is actually almost as good as MY homemade vegan chili.....almost.... ;)  The vegan hot link was also delicious, & had a really good spicy kick. I only had a small nibble of the turkey burger, (for ""research purposes only""), but it seemed juicy & flavorful. All menu items are freshly prepared, & when they call your name to pick-up your food, you can customize each item with a wide variety of toppings to make your very own masterpiece. This is where I went wrong, as I was so hungry I told them to ""just give it to me"" & I wish I'd requested more toppings...  :(The ""Playas Punch"" was a little sweet for me, but still good. And...the name alone was enough to make me laugh & make it my own.LOVED this restaurant...you can tell that the owners love their customers, (regulars & new-comers alike), & put their heart-&-soul into their business...& into the local community.  Extra Special ""shout-out"" to ""Ms. Hildred,"" (Mom & Business Owner).  ""Ms. Hildred"" was so warm & welcoming, gave us a history of the restaurant, & introduced me to her son & grandson. It was so nice spending a part of the afternoon chatting with ""Ms. Hildred.""  Thank you for making us feel right ""at-home,"" ---- like family.To Ms. Hildred & the Earle family: Thanks for a great lunch, & I can't wait to return for more vegan treats & your yummy desserts!!! :)"
5/4/2019,20190504,5,4.65,"So this is a Crenshaw must try just as Philips barbq. Earles was the spot back when I was kid. Just realized they found another location. They came back better than ever. Their food was always great, but they invest in their in-store experience. Very happy to have a place with delicious options in this area beside fast food. Must try!"
5/6/2019,20190506,5,4.65,"Ate here for a late lunch one day while in the area. It was so good. I had a Beef hot dog that was cooked just right and had the perfect snap to it when you bit into it. Would highly recommend this restaurant. It was in a nice area and once your order comes up, you get called to the service area where you can select from so many different toppings for your hot dog. They also have a staple of chips and drinks as well as desserts on hand. Great place to stop."
5/7/2019,20190507,5,4.65,"Earls is a must stop if you're in the area! I actually had them for the first few times at Farmers Markets in Noho, but always stop by when near LAX. I fell in love with their vegan dogs with vegan cheese and vegan chili. Packed with flavor and goodness! Hands down the best vegan dog I've ever had! Their turkey dogs are A1 too, I had one on a daily special $1.49 for a turkey dog, unreal (the valley has been robbing me)! Be sure to check out the specials of the day!Also, The fries, the banana pudding & the fruit punch are hits as well. The owner and employees are so friendly and welcoming, such a great family/community spot. Go get a dog, be immersed in beautiful black culture!"
5/7/2019,20190507,5,4.65,Hot dogs and kung fu movies? Hell yes!
5/16/2019,20190516,5,4.65,"I just keep running into Earle everywhere and I love it. First time I had them they catered to USC, a week later they catered for my husbands job and OMG I am so glad they keep popping up everywhere because the vegan dogs are AMAZING!!! I never had a vegan dog with so much flavor!!! Their salad and macaroni was tasty and a perfect addition to the hot dogs. I will be visiting their establishment regularly!!"
5/18/2019,20190518,1,4.64,Terrible place for vegans! One small cup of vegan chilli is $7.49 and the cup is no bigger than a urine sample cup yet they want to over price vegan items on the menu. The vegan hamburger is $12 for the sandwich alone with vegan cheese is another $2/3. They use the Beyond Meat burger patties which is only $6 from Whole Foods for two patties & I will still have enough to buy the ingredients & a Kombucha for a drink for 12 bucks. All of their vegan items are overpriced with twice to triple the price than regular items on the menu. It's highway robbery and for vegans in the area go somewhere else and save your money.
5/28/2019,20190528,5,4.64,Had salmon burgers and pastrami for lunch. Excellent and worth making a drive to try
6/11/2019,20190611,5,4.64,"Earle's on Crenshaw in Los Angeles prepared one the best turkey dogs with the works I have ever tasted. The customer service was outstanding and everyone in line was treated like family. The place itself is not too small nor too big and quite clean. While the menu had a variety of vegetarian, vegan, and carnivore items on the menu. If you are ever in Los Angels Earle's on Crenshaw is a local hangout which provides a hotdogs lover's dream menu.For those not hotdogs fans there are plenty of other items on the menu. Granted this may not be the famous Pinks in L.A. The taste, the prices, and the customer service made this place unforgettable. This place welcomes groups and individuals alike. Feel free to order in or take out with friends or solo."
6/14/2019,20190614,5,4.64,Today marks my first time here and man/lady let me tell you... the reviews definitely add up to the hype! I ordered the vegan dog with vegan chili and vegan cheese with a side of fries. This place is a MUST try!!
6/23/2019,20190623,5,4.64,"Skinny Fry Friday!! A delight for vegetarians and carnivores alike. Super friendly, clean and fun casual. Local gem for sure."
6/23/2019,20190623,4,4.64,"Delicious, tasty date night. We had the turkey dogs. Great food, friendly staff. Coming back to try to the rest of the menu."
6/26/2019,20190626,5,4.64,OMGosh..... love this spot! The salmon burger is everything! The vegan chilli cheese fries are amazing! I'll definitely be back!!!
7/4/2019,20190704,5,4.64,"My Favorite Spot When I Come To LA, Been A Fan Fir Years, I'm Happy There Stable In A Great Location, I Love The Mother Of The Owner, Such A Sweetheart"
7/10/2019,20190710,4,4.64,"Really enjoyed the vegan chili! I didn't get a chance to try the deserts, but will definitely be back to try them in the near future. I do wish I got a bit more size wise (I think the chili was $8, but the cup was tiny), but other than that I had a great time visiting this place."
7/15/2019,20190715,5,4.64,The customer service is 10/10. The Salmon Burger is 10/10. I had such a great experience here and will definitely come back to support!
8/13/2019,20190813,5,4.64,Fire AF - vegan spicy link with regular cheese and vegan chili. Add jalapeños + ketchup + mustard + banana peppers on your vegan spicy link. I also got white bread. It's pretty fucking amazing. I also get the French fries.
8/17/2019,20190817,5,4.65,"Found Earl's by chance today. Good rates and the whole family was happy with their meals. We had Leimert burgers, Alaskan burger, & chili fries. Will definitively be back!"
8/21/2019,20190821,1,4.63,"Hello again! So since my very real, very honest review on my experience was removed...LETS ELABORATERemoved Content:Whoever is giving this place five stars CLEARLY never visited the ORIGINAL Earlzes. I'm utterly dissapointed!! They should have never let these people keep the name, because now it's being dragged through the mud. Like I stated earlier, I am used to going to the original Earlez that was down the street and absolute quality EVERYTIME. That's why the line was always literally out the door. I've been to the new Earles a couple times and every single time I remember why I haven't been in a while. The disappointment is REAL! The food isn't up to par AND it's overpriced! So I'm just OVER IT. Hence this review. So what's really good yelp?! Are you being paid to remove reviews now? Reviews on people's real experience about an establishment?!"
8/22/2019,20190822,4,4.63,"The vegan dogs are SO flavorful and left me satisfied. Trying to reduce my meat intake has introduced me to the world of delicious plant based alternatives. Their toppings were all a great addition to enhance the flavor. I recommend putting some pico de gallo on there! I also had their vegan chili fries and requested regular cheese and those were spectacular. Not sure if this is an option, but toasting the hot dog buns would have added a nice texture as well. My only concern is all the plastic and styrofoam being used! I also noticed that they were using plastic silverware for their toppings which could easily be swapped for metal silverware. TLDR; Food is great."
8/23/2019,20190823,2,4.62,Love their lemonade. The food is basic as well as extremely expensive. A field roast chipotle dog is about $9. A pack of field roast links which comes with four links cost $6.79. I understand their trying to make a living but come on now.
9/3/2019,20190903,5,4.62,"I was a burger lover before I became vegetarian, and this place helps satisfy the craving"
9/6/2019,20190906,5,4.62,"Why, oh why has no one hopped me to this superb eatery? And it's in my neighborhood. From the nice chef to the filling food, I don't know where to begin. First I had a chicken hot dog with vegan chili and of course the fries. Good God Almighty. This hot dog was so good I had to sit for a few minutes after eating it just to bask in all its greatness. If you are ever in need of a healthy alternative to fast food, give yourself life and stop by Earle's on Crenshaw."
9/13/2019,20190913,5,4.62,"Got just a bowl of Vegan Chili today to make me some homemade Nachos. Taste really good and fresh! I Like the place a lot, very clean and a friendly atmosphere! I will be back"
9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.62,Food was BOMB. I got the chili cheese fries and pastrami burger - both were delicious and at fair prices. Earle's also carries vegan options which is surprising but great. I recommend this place if you are in the L.A. area! I will definitely come back :)
9/23/2019,20190923,5,4.63,"Amazing workers! Amazing food ! There's so much love in this place, I'm not a vegan but I get the beyond meat burger it's soooo good. 10/10 recommend"
10/2/2019,20191002,3,4.62,"What can I say about the legendary Earle's On Crenshaw? Well, I wish I could say something a bit more positive, but unfortunately, my most recent experience there with the food wasn't a pleasant one. I invited a Client to eat there because it's right next door to my workplace, and because of its Vegan offerings. The service is exceptional and the woman (with the wonderful accent and demeanor) who appeared to be in charge has a warm and welcoming presence; she makes everyone feel at home.Earle's got the Vegan ""Beyond Burger."" The cheese-less patty can be yours for just $11.99, the highest price I've seen for it in the city so far. Or, you can get a scrawny little Vegan dog for $5.99. I don't do hot dogs, Vegan or not, and as a Vegan for over a decade, I'm really sensitive to being overcharged for Vegan offerings. Simply put, Earle's Vegan item are overpriced.I ordered a Vegan Jamaican patty. It wasn't cooked properly, and it didn't taste good at all. It was white and doughy, where it should've been browned and flaky--and, I won't even speculate on what it was filled with. Nothing good, I can say. Nothing good.My Client chose a turkey dog; it too was scrawny (far from filling its bun), and I suggested he feel free to order another if it wasn't filling enough. But he praised the taste and said he enjoyed it.Earle's will always do well. And when the Vegan gentrifiers flocking into the area discover it, I'm certain it'll thrive with much greater success. They won't bat an eye at paying $12 bucks for a Vegan burger, $3 bucks more for a slice of cheese atop it, plus $4 bucks more for accompanying fries at a glorified hot dog stand. Yep, Earle's will always do well."
10/10/2019,20191010,5,4.62,"I don't know what to say except incredible. the vegan chili cheese fries with jalapeño is my go-to. and everything else i've tried is perfect for those random backyard bbq cravings. the vegan dogs and burgers are great and I love that you can customize everything just the way you want it. i have nothing but love for the employees here. everyone is so friendly and happy to help you which makes the experience a 20 out of 10. this older lady (possibly the owner) put her hand on my shoulder and asked me how my food was and it was really heartwarming to know that even after you pay and walk away, someone cares that your enjoying yourself. not many places like that anymore. this is a real family of caring individuals who are just here to serve good food and have a great time!"
10/14/2019,20191014,5,4.62,"They came to my daughter's school for a special event last week, and I tried their meatless burger and sausages. Since I am gluten free, I really appreciated the fact that they didn't contain gluten.The taste was excellent, and both were equally satisfying. I was truly impressed and feel lucky that they are on my side of town!"
10/16/2019,20191016,5,4.62,"I HAVE NOTHING BUT GREAT THINGS TO SAY!!!Ever since they had the 'chili bowl' right there on Crenshaw and Expo, I've LOVED this place!!I've had GREAT customer service each time I've been (which is ALOT since I work in the area) I'm vegan (and have been for over 10 years), and I enjoy the fact that they offer options for me to choose from, that aren't just lettuce and bread like most places the owner DEFINITELY takes pride in his business and in his employees. BLACK OWNED BUSINESS!!!!!!!! That's always a plus! Everything on the menu is delicious (even though they got rid of the tamales) nothing bad to say. All great! I can't wait to see how much the business continues to grow over the years!"
11/11/2019,20191111,4,4.62,"Had the Spicy Beef Link with fries and fruit punch, it was exceptional. Awesome customer service. Highly recommended"
11/11/2019,20191111,4,4.62,"I haven't had a favorite hot dog place, since The Stand Westwood 10 years ago, but recently I finally stopped by and tried the conveniently located, Earle's and I was made so happy! So far, I've had turkey dogs, chili cheese fries and peach cobbler to go. I think they grill their turkey dogs so they have a little grill-smoky flavor. You can customize your dog with toppings. The chili is vegan, but I add regular cheddar. And I enjoyed the ugly-delicious-gooey peach cobbler. Both times I have gone, I took my food to-go, but the atmosphere inside is very friendly, relaxed, LA-loving and... now that I think about it, the movies that are playing in the background were both set in L.A. I think there's a theme! The staff is friendly, too: The cashier was appropriately chatty and I enjoy talking to the person working on my hot dog when it comes time to discuss toppings! This will be a regular place for me. Can't wait to try the turkey burger next!"
11/12/2019,20191112,5,4.62,"Tried this place this past weekend. Ima vegetarian and haven't had bomb chili cheese fries in 6 years, until I stepped into Earle's. Oh my god. They're so good! The chili is amazing. I even tried the vegan dog and it was so tasty!! The pink/punch lemonade was perfect !!!! So happy my dad lives down the street from here!!"
11/15/2019,20191115,5,4.62,Good as always I got my chili dog with relish and cooked onions. So me and my guy was ordering. And I like that the cook said ladies first. You don't get that much out here at other restaurants. I felt very please with that.
11/27/2019,20191127,5,4.62,"Been going to Earle's since it was a hot dog cart roaming around Santa Barbara Plaza. Those who grew up in Leimert Park will know what I mean! Lol I love Earle's food, family and restaurant experience. AND they've figured out how to make super yummy vegan burgers, vegan chili cheese fries, vegan links and dogs. Thank you Earle and Carey for getting it right every time. My daughter is now hooked and will grow up on your food now too ;)"
12/6/2019,20191206,5,4.62,The Vegan Chili Fries were so good! This is the kind of place I end up going to a couple days in a row.
12/12/2019,20191212,5,4.63,"I have had probably too many veggie burgers from so many different places. THIS ONE IS THE BEST. I don't know what they do to it but shoutout to them. The vegan hot link is really really good too, I used to get that all the time because you can get a burger anywhere but when i tried the burger it was a hame changer. Sometimes I get bothThey are all super friendly which is a plus. LOVE THIS PLACE"
12/22/2019,20191222,4,4.62,"Clean and good but pricey. I was hoping they grilled onions on the grill upon order but they don't. I was hoping for a charbroiled beef hamburger but they don't have beef patties. I ordered the turkey burger, it just wasn't what I wanted anyways I'm not a fan of beans in my chili cheese fries."
1/5/2020,20200105,5,4.62,Love love this place staff very nice greet you every time when you walk in. Price is very reasonable and the food is very fresh they have from vegan to kosher items please note it's not a kosher restaurant. The food is cook when ordered very fresh I recommend everything on the menu I've had at least everything two the three times one thing that is unique here is and I are they recommended try their Fritos and chili very unique and very tasty.Definitely worth the drive also note that they are closed on Sundays
2/7/2020,20200207,5,4.63,Dope spot can't get enough of this vegan dogg little pricey but hey can't really trip on quality lol. About to get my third vegan dogg this week! Lol
2/8/2020,20200208,1,4.61,"First time here ordered through the phone went and stood where the pick sign says online order stood there for about 5 minutes raychell took severe customers never acknowledged me.. an employee that literally just got in line ""AJ"" saw me waiting and again raychell just ignored me... literally you see me standing there be polite and acknowledge me.. you guys work here.. customer service is first.... get a grip AJ."
2/21/2020,20200221,5,4.61,"Hands down one of the best vegan hot dogs I've ever had. The playas punch was fantastic. I should've bought a half gallon. The staff was super friendly and helpful and everyone had a smile. I really appreciated when the cashier would tell the cook what food was just order so he could start prepping it and he always said ""thank you"" to her! Also I believe the owner brought her two year old granddaughter out from the back and she became bff's with my 4 year old. A really great establishment run by really great people."
2/22/2020,20200222,5,4.62,"This place is delicious. Shared a pastrami sandwich and a chili cheese dog with my wife. Food was fresh and did not feel greasy at all, considering what we ordered. Staff was courteous and even came out to ask how everything was and if we needed anything."
2/27/2020,20200227,5,4.62,"Been patronizing Earl's Grill since before I had money to buy food myself. My dad and I used to go here after track practice, when I was in middle school. Now, 15+ years later, they have a bigger location, and I drive over to grab my fat, stake fries, and vegan dogs. Now that they over beyond burgers, I'll be getting those too. Fresh food. Great service."
2/27/2020,20200227,5,4.62,"Lovely place to eat, very good food, great Vegan options, clean and cozy, out door seating. Definitely want to go back soon!"

3/3/2020,20200303,5,4.62,Love this place. Food is always amazing! Service is timely and doesn't take long. Definitely appreciate the attention to detail at this establishment.
3/11/2020,20200311,4,4.62,"I still absolutely love coming to Earles and stop by to eat here since it is the best vegan spot near my community. However i came by the other day and was upset at the fact that i paid extra for vegan chili cheese fries with regular cheese only to get a super small amount of cheese on the fries..kinda bummed me out since it's what i look the most forward to ever since they got rid of the guacamole option. Still love this spot though, and I'm sure it was an honest mistake, i just wish the guac came back at least for a dollar extra."
3/15/2020,20200315,5,4.62,"A business in the heart of the community. As a teacher, our school brought one of our students here on a field trip to inspire him to see how a successful Black-owned business looks like. The employees and the manager we talked to were very friendly and welcoming. The manager answered my student's questions and he walked away inspired to work harder in school. I like how there are vegetarian, vegan, and meat options all in one place. There are also vegan desserts! I tried the Alaska Burger- salmon on wheat bread, lettuce, tomato, red onion, melted cheese, jalapeño, and ketchup. Very delicious!"
3/21/2020,20200321,5,4.62,"Comfort food. With everything that's going on in the world right now, I know I can count on Earle's for a wholesome and hearty meal for my family. Half their menu is vegan so I know I can pick something up for my family that's delicious and cruelty free. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is literally ALWAYS friendly. When I come in, they ask me how I'm doing, how my family is doing, I'm not just a buck to them, I'm family, I matter, and that makes me feel comforted. I aways recommend Earle's to my friends and family. Especially if their looking for local vegan eats. Their vegan chili cheese fries HIT THE SPOT everytime and their vegan burgers are always on point. The bread is squishy and everything is just juicy and fresh and tasty. I love them, and I love that they offer healthy options for our community."

4/1/2020,20200401,2,4.6,I am okay with Restaurants who want to make smaller portions for the public but I'm not okay with overcharging for those small portions. The burger was the size of a mcdonalds little cheeseburger $ 14 with vegan cheese. Wow!!!

4/19/2020,20200419,5,4.59,Love this place. I only get the chili cheese fries but I like that they are fat fries. And the chili cheese fries are customizable. I have eaten a salmon burger and that was good as well. My boyfriend loves the players punch.
4/22/2020,20200422,5,4.6,"Earle's is my go-to chili-dog place when I get a craving! I'm a pescatarian so I get the vegan chili dog which comes generously hot, steaming, and overflowing! On days I don't feel like a bun, I get the chili bowl. They have a small high top counter to gobble down your food and are relatively quick (15 min max) so it's a quick and easy lunch. They are a local landmark and establishment! Never heard of them until I moved to Leimert Park - then everyone was saying I should checkout Earle's . Glad I finally did! I called and placed an order for pick-up for the COVID-19 shelter-in-place time, so feels good to support local businesses! Here's to many more years in business!"
4/25/2020,20200425,5,4.6,"Ordered takeout from this restaurant and oh my god... AMAZING. I ordered a turkey burger with a side of fries. Let me tell you, they give a generous serving of fries. Everything tasted great and they have a lot of vegan options too! I will definitely order from here again!"
4/26/2020,20200426,1,4.58,I loved this place and didn't mind paying for the food as the vegan fries r good. I will no longer go to this place as my friend paid for extra cheese I was not paying attention so I asked the server man if he could not forget the extra cheese n he went off on me n was very rude. I merely asked n he acted as if I demanded. So I will not go to a place where price n service don't match. It's an establishment so the workers should be more understanding n patient with diverse cultures.
4/29/2020,20200429,5,4.59,"Thank you Earle's on Crenshaw for donating dinner to the evening staff at S. Mark Taper Imaging. Your team was amazing, cheerful and professional. Thank you for recognizing our facility. Thank you to the young man who gave me the last of the Chilli. It was delicious. I will definitely stop by to order some food. Thanks again. Have a bless day."
4/30/2020,20200430,5,4.59,"The food was delicious!! I had a vegan link ( mustard, veg. Mayo, sweet grilled onions, and banana peppers) on a wheat bun, fries and vegan chill!! Bomb! The food was soo flavorful!! I loved every bite!"
5/15/2020,20200515,4,4.59,I've been meaning to come here and finally did! Should kick myself for not listening to my inner gut friggin' sooner! The vegan chili cheese dog with raw onions was good BUT the fries were beyond my wildest expectations. Vegan lemon cake was not too sweet with a one two punch out once the frosting hits your tongue. Staff was very friendly too. Will definitely be making a return visit.
5/25/2020,20200525,5,4.59,"Earle's On Crenshaw is such a great local spot! I've been living in the Mid City area for the last 5 years and this place always makes me feel welcome -- plus, the food is delicious! The Jumbo Turkey Dog with chili and cheese is my favorite. So tasty and filling, and on Tuesdays I think it runs as the special for $1.50! Can't beat that. Also, I love that this place carries The Puddery's AMAZING banana pudding. So you get fast, tasty, and affordable lunch and dessert all in one spot. Highly recommend!"
5/27/2020,20200527,4,4.58,Wish they delivered. Love the spicy beef sausage and hotdogs. The spicy sausage is really good with the grilled onions and ketchup and mustard. Fries are really good and even better with ranch. Would eat there more if it wasn't so far
5/27/2020,20200527,5,4.59,When I tell you this place is HIGHLY addictive. I am a avid meat eater but I had the vegan hot link ..... BABY!!! When I tell you no exaggeration it tasted like everything I been missing In life! Hats off to the chef cause amazing isn't even the word! Not to mention the playa punch. Great job really great job everything was amazing service was phenomenal I will be back soon
6/2/2020,20200602,5,4.59,"I get a craving for a classic chili cheese fries every now and then, but I don't necessarily want to go to a hole-in-the-wall, or spend $20 for gourmet fries that don't satisfy my craving.Wow, Earle's hits the spot! My beef chili cheese fries smelled exactly how I wanted them to and tasted even better than I imagined. My husband (not vegan) ordered the vegan hot link, and loved it so much that he was already planning the toppings for his next vegan hot link!Super easy to order, pick up was quick! They even caught the missing side of fries my husband ordered before we even left. That never happens anywhere else!I'm excited to explore more of their menu, I will definitely be back!"
6/2/2020,20200602,5,4.59,"I love Earle's sooo much!! Always has a friendly staff and the Earle family is amazing! Follow them on IG so you can keep up with their events like their famous car shows. Being vegan, it's hard to find great food that won't hurt your pocket, will taste amazing, and won't take so long--however, Earle's gives you all this and cares about you and their community. Be sure to grab a vegan cake with your order!"
6/3/2020,20200603,5,4.59,"Amazing, affordable hot dogs! I'm a sucker for a good hot dog and these are some of the best in Los Angeles. A local institution that I hope carries on for generations to come. Don't skip the banana peppers or NY cooked onions."
6/5/2020,20200605,5,4.59,"Really inexpensive bite for the amount of food you get! COVID19 compliant but I think my experience would have been even better if I called ahead to pickup instead of waiting in store. Today the service was very slow, there were 2 Jamaican patties missing from my order (which I ended up driving back to grab) but it was fine because they were accommodating and I had flexibility this afternoon anyway.If you like curry powder, the $3.50 chicken meat pie is a MUST. Pleasantly soft, palatable and not messy at all. The beef meat pie was also great!I also tried a scoop of the vegan chili ($2) and beef chili ($1), which comes in a small condiment container. The hot pastrami sandwich ($7.49) was filling and delicious!Overall, loved the food and owner Duane Earle's commitment to giving back to the community. They're feeding 150 elderly 3 days a week, which is crucial considering the impacts of COVID19. Indeed a classic, well-loved local LA gem."
6/5/2020,20200605,5,4.59,Earle's is delicious. You can't go wrong with anything that you order on their menu. I usually order the beef chili cheese fries. The vegan chili cheese fries with vegan cheese are delicious as well!
6/6/2020,20200606,5,4.59,"This place is one of the most inviting restaurants I've ever walked into. I have a lot of vegan friends, and they can come with me here; the vegan link is now a proclaimed STAPLE in their lives. Vegan chili cheese fries are also *chef's kiss*. I really don't know how they do it-- maybe it's all just made with love. During the pandemic, they're doing takeout, so make sure to support!!!"
6/6/2020,20200606,5,4.6,Great vegan chili cheese fries and dogs. Lots of options for meat and non-meat eaters. Very good Covid protocols in place. Order online for quick eating! The line was long on a Saturday night.
6/8/2020,20200608,5,4.6,Great vegan options and an added special for meatless Monday. The vegan link has added spice but not too overwhelming. They have lots of topping options. For the vegan chili cheese fries they offer vegan and non vegan cheese. The fries are enough for 2 so come hungry. For covid measures they have the line clearly marked for clear social distancing. Easy parking out front.
6/8/2020,20200608,5,4.6,Ive been visiting this establishment for almost 30 years now. I do NOT give 2nd chances with my food! Nuff sayd!!!
6/13/2020,20200613,5,4.6,Always satisfied with their food!! I usually stick with their vegan links and banana pudding. YUM!!!!
6/13/2020,20200613,5,4.6,"Man the food is sooooo good here! I've been ordering from them since being on Postmates the past few weeks, and the beef links are just that good. The peach cobbler was also equally as good, but please support this place. You won't regret it!"
6/17/2020,20200617,5,4.6,Great Cashier. Cooks hmm Can Use a little More Smiling.. Had the Veggie Link. Yummy yummy yummy.
6/27/2020,20200627,5,4.6,This place has the best pastrami burgers the meat is so lean and tender. You get a lot for the $6.99 all the trimmings. When I had surgery and couldn't drive or get up to cook I ordered it at least twice a week and for my family. To this day I still order. Try it worth it.
7/1/2020,20200701,1,4.59,"Earle's, please update your menu options on all of the delivery sites. What I ordered on Door dash is not what was delivered. When I showed up at Earle's to exchange my order I was told "" oh yeah we didn't update door dash with our new veggie dogs"". Please bring the old veggie dogs back, your new dogs are nasty, straight to the trash. Also thanks for the refund, oh I forgot you didn't offer a refund. That one star represents this one incident, it's really a 5 star establishment."
7/2/2020,20200702,5,4.59,"Could we give Earles Grill 10 stars? We've come here twice in three days smh. And we struggled to NOT come yesterday.What does that tell you?.I got the vegan chili chicken link w real cheese LOL. Never had a chicken link before and it was UNBELIEVABLE!! My vegetarian daughter got the vegan link, vegan chili w cheese.We both agreed that the vegan chili on both was some of the best chili we've EVER had, and I LOVE MEAT!!The chocolate cake and the players punch (ALWAYS a must) smacked SO HARD!!Yo TRY THIS!!"
7/8/2020,20200708,5,4.59,"I've been dying to find a tasty vegan hot dog and chili restaurant. When I saw noticed Earle's On Crenshaw, I decided to take my chances. So I tried their vegan dog with cheese and their vegan chili cheese with different FREE add-ons like vegan mayo, raw onions, sliced pickles, Ny onions, kraut, Pico de Gallo, etc. And I've been a customer since then. No matter if I'm ordering in person or online delivery, I'm always satisfied with their food. If you're ordering in-person, you can feel the establishments personality and Crenshaw pride. I guess that's an extra perk while ordering. Also, their is a ton of free parking in front and in the back. Takeaways: MUST TRY! They are a lot of options you can add to your hot dog, burger, fries, etc. You can buy shirts and a board game if you'd like. FREE PARKING!"
7/10/2020,20200710,5,4.6,their vegan chili cheese Fritos are to die for I LOVE this place & it is so worth the drive. the staff is so sweet & helpful every time I've gone.
7/12/2020,20200712,5,4.6,"This is a neighborHOOD gem! I haven't been to Earle's that much but have been considering making it a staple since they have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options. I treated myself to some vegan chili cheese fries and boy am I glad that I did!! The chili was definitely signature as it had a sweet flavor to it. I'm not typically a fan of a savory food that has a sweet flavor but this chili did it for me. With each bite I was wooed by flavor. The food was served hot and fresh and before receiving it, I was able to pick toppings to go on my vegan chili cheese fries!! Of course I picked more vegetables, banana peppers to be exact and that added an extra element of flavor to make the fries that much better. The customer service was fair, there was one person to take my order and money at the register and then a server asking me about what toppings I want. If you're vegan, vegetarian, or a meat eater, Earle's is for you!"
7/13/2020,20200713,5,4.6,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! The Vegan Burgers, the vegan chili cheese fries, the vegan link, the spicy vegan link is INSANE. Add grilled onions and THANK ME LATER. And bruh the beef Jamaican patties...lord. Now I'm hungry. I'm buying tomorrow"
7/24/2020,20200724,4,4.6,"Yo, for the late night or weekend craving Earle's does it. Whether you're in the mood for chili cheese fries layered to perfection or a juicy Leimert turkey burger or even a hot dog fixed exactly like you love! They also have Vegan options as well. Not to mention, ambiance! Earle's gives you that neighborhood feeling on Crenshaw. The kind where people open the door for each other or crack jokes while they quickly wait for their order.Only feedback I would give is on the drinks. I went for what I thought was an aqua Fresca or lemonade and it tasted like the powdered stuff. Maybe Kool-Aid? Not sure. They have options to dine outside. Plenty of bar stools and 3 tables on the side are available for seating. Stop by if your in the area or order to go! It was so good, the food was devoured before I could take a picture. Next time!"
7/26/2020,20200726,5,4.6,I do not eat pork and rarely eat beef so it is hard to find a good Turkey dog. Earle's has Turkey Vegan Chili Cheese Dogs which are AMAZING. Their Vegan Chili is the best I have ever had. And they have wheat buns!!! Yes GAWD!!Great customer service they take social distancing and MASK wearing seriously!!!!! Do not come to LA without trying this place. Beats Pinks any day.
7/27/2020,20200727,3,4.59,"Earle's showed up on my radar for some reason and I wanted to check it out. So, we made a slight detour on our way down and my friend who grew up in the DC area said Earle's was reminiscent of Ben's Chili Bowl. A local landmark that maybe had a lot of history and hype that is mostly nostalgia.There was a crowd out front but most of them were waiting for their orders. Their regular chili dog was their special for 2.50, down from their usual of 3.50. 3.50 is already good but for 2.50? Awesome. I just wanted to try the chili cheese dog but the meat patties they had looked too good to pass up and I saved a dollar anyway so I decided to splurge. The crowd makes sense-it's a pretty long wait and there were a few folks in the know who went to do errands or something and came back at the right time. The newbie that I was it seemed to be an inordinately long time for a chili cheese dog and a meat patty-especially considering how the staff were moving, and I was doing that calculus of 'he was two people ahead of me/she was right behind me so.' By the time my number was called I was pretty ecstatic. The hot dog was pretty simple but tasty-I hadn't had a good all beef kosher dog in a while and I forget how good they could be. My first impression was that the chili was ok-but it wasn't until after it was gone that I kept thinking how good it was. The meat patty? It's what you would expect-no surprises, tasty, solid.I think next time I'll order ahead because that wait time is too long for that chili dog."
7/27/2020,20200727,5,4.59,"I love coming here. The people are very friendly, especially the owners mom. The chili cheese fries are delicious, probably one of the best in town. Their hot links are also very good. I highly recommend this place."
7/27/2020,20200727,5,4.6,I ordered takeout and the food showed up fast and still piping hot. That's just the beginning of how great my experience was. Then came the food. The food was delicious! Really can't wait to check this place out in person and not just delivery.
8/24/2020,20200824,5,4.6,I ordered the vegan chili fries with vegan cheese and loved it! I loved that the fries were steak fries. I was so full from the chili cheese fries I couldn't even start on the vegan link (which is spicier than the vegan hot dog) so I packed it home to eat later. I ate it a few hours later and thought it was pretty tasty. I like that you can choose from quite a range of toppings to put on your burger or hot dog. It's really awesome they have a variety of vegan food and dessert.My friends ordered the regular chili cheese fries and they loved it.We went on a weeknight and there was plenty of free parking right in front. They have a long counter-type table in front of the place for people to sit outside and eat. We found some tables and chairs to the left of the restaurant in this little walkway and ate there.
8/25/2020,20200825,5,4.6,"I love earle's, had been driving by for years until I went vegan and happened to order from here on postmates and I've been hooked ever since. They have some really good food, wait can get a little crazy, I recommend you order ahead as they're usually pretty busy. Also black owned!!!"
9/4/2020,20200904,5,4.6,"This place is cool. Coming from north Los Angeles I stopped by with my fiancé and we got the vegan hot dog with chili and began link with chili. Bomb fries that came already seasoned and salt was just right, they have a vegan burger and vegan desserts. If I'm in LA again I'll stop by here again. Came here for the vegan stuff and was very satisfied !"
9/15/2020,20200915,5,4.6,"Quality spot , fast & friendly service. I recommend the salmon burger w vegan cheese, vegan chili cheese fries, and playas punch for those extra hungry days. You will be stuffed/have left overs either way."
9/25/2020,20200925,4,4.6,"Yes ma'am! Been a minute since my fine ass has come to Earle's. When I first ordered, I got their vegan chili fries and now that I'm back and new to the vegan lifestyle, they once again have come thru!! I got their 'Vegan Burger'(Impossible Burger) and 'Vegan Yellow Cake'! The burger!! Ahhhh!! too dam good! I honestly don't know what I was expecting since this is a meat-less buger, but was thoroughly impressed and enjoyed every minute of the wheat bread, lettuce, tomatoes, cooked onions, (vegan) cheese, and pickles! On initial bite I didn't like the cheese on the burger, at all. I actually almost gagged, but as I kept chewing all of the flavors came together and left me impressed. I felt like Ratatouille when his ass found out about the strawberry and cheese combination that blew his mind. This burger blew my mind!My granny also had a piece (which she lucky, cuz I hate sharing my food! haha) and even though she's not vegan herself she also really enjoyed it!The Yellow Cake on the other hand, ughh!So disappointed because I really thought I would like it, but nope. It's basically corn bread with chocolate and white frosting. This cake was not it. At all for me, but I'm still finna eat it off like a fat ass and put it in a milkshake with my vegan almond milk.If I'm ever feeling for some cake again I definitely want to try their Chocolate Vegan Cake and see if that option surpasses my standard on their cakes.My granny's order consist of 2 veggie patties and she really ate em up. She really liked em lil too much, kept moaning in my ear(haha). We'll definitely be back one day! Great customer service by a beautiful woman named Edith and off the chain food!"
10/1/2020,20201001,5,4.6,"I'm giving it 5 stars to what I was used to, these patties use to be so good! Then now it taste different maybe there's a new cook idk. All I know is now a days when I order online my patties be burnt that breaks my heart for reals cause I love them patties. Anyways that's why they getting this 5 stars because of what I'm use to."
10/1/2020,20201001,5,4.6,Food is amazing service is wonderful! I like how the staff ask if your vegan or no so they can recommend options what they like. My brothers favorite place when he come to my house to eat. Love this place will highly recommend if you haven't been there you have to go and eat the vegan chillie cheese fries and vegan link so good!
10/8/2020,20201008,4,4.6,"All of the food is great here. One Latina girl however is arrogant and non attentive. Next time I go, I will get her name. She is trash and should be fired"
10/14/2020,20201014,5,4.6,"I pass this place all the time I'm in the area,yet never stopped until today... I had the kosher beef dog w/ chili, heavy raw onions, cheese. This is by far THE BEST chili dog I've had. The bun is grilled slightly which gives a very light crisp / toast on the edges... the chili is very flavorful not too salty. When you lace it w/ raw onions and a swirl of mustard! Man on man...it was very good... I almost ordered one more but gluttony and I don't mix... they offer vegan dogs and burgers along w/ Alaskan salmon burgers...Ill surely return to sample those!"
10/21/2020,20201021,5,4.6,This place was perfect. The food is delicious and unique. Has so many options that make it easy for everyone to be able to enjoy their food. The employees are all doing their part and making sure to wear masks and gloves and are so sweet not mention very quick!
10/24/2020,20201024,5,4.6,Best hotdog hands down and don't forget the chili been eating here since I was a kid and they never let down or disappoint and make sure you try the lemonade too.
10/26/2020,20201026,5,4.6,"I've been wanting to try Earle's for the longest time, since I spotted them on Instagram. Well, glad to say I finally did and their food is absolutely delicious! I got the Turkey Burger ($7.99), the Kosher beef hot dog ($4.49), and lots of French fries! (Side $4.99). Super easy to do pickup and they keep the food warm until you arrive! Great experience, will order from here again!"
11/7/2020,20201107,5,4.6,"i've been impatiently waiting to try this place, and i'm so glad i finally did! i'm vegan but most of my friends aren't so it's nice to have a place we both want to eat! the food was amazing and i was so happy to have a gluten free bun option! i got a beyond burger on gf bun, with chili cheese fries! my brother, the omnivore, got an all beef dog. we were both so satisified, but on top of that my experience was just amazing, everyone was so sweet, even the regular customers! i'll definitely be bringing a lot of folks by"
11/19/2020,20201119,5,4.61,"Black owned! Love this place. The love the staff, love the owner and love the energy here! The food is amazing and it's food from the heart. I really love that place, they make you feel like you are home. They really care about the customers. They have every type of food anyone can eat, from seafood sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, fries and patties! The juices are good too. I love the fact that they have vegan options and beyond meat burgers. I get the vegan dog/link and vegan chili cheese fries. Talk about amazing. I go there so much that they remember me! If you haven't been you need to go, if you've been you need to go again!"
11/21/2020,20201121,5,4.61,Earle's is a safe eating environment for vegans and meat eaters alike. The food is quality and served quickly.
11/22/2020,20201122,5,4.61,"Delicious food so well done and spicy, not to mention very flavorful. I loved my vegan dog with chipotle, NY cooked onions, pickles, and relish. The chili cheese fries were incredible too!! I loved them so much. It was kind of like poutine and so tasty."
11/23/2020,20201123,5,4.61,"Earle's is a staple in the Crenshaw community. I've been coming to Earle's since they were located near Crenshaw and 43rd. When I walk in I'm always greeted with a smile and there's never a shortage of good energy. The vegan chili fries are my all time favorite. I've also had the salmon burger which was perfectly prepared - not over cooked/dry. There are no shortage of toppings and plenty of snacks to add on to your meal. If you are looking for a spot that has something for vegans, pescatarians, and carnivores they check all the boxes."
12/13/2020,20201213,5,4.61,"Earle's is a pillar of Crenshaw restaurants. I have to resist veering into their parking lot every time I'm cruising down the boulevard. Hot Dogs aren't complicated, but they take simple food and honor it by making them perfect. The jumbo kosher beef is the way to go with some sweet grilled onions and mustard. Their coffee cake is an homage to LAUSD's notorious schoolyard treat. I love the food and people here. Order to-go! The food stays warm and is packaged with care. Everything is delicious. It will make your day."
12/22/2020,20201222,1,4.6,Today I ordered from earl pastrami it was hard and cold and so little me for 18.00 will never order again worst ever
12/28/2020,20201228,5,4.6,"It's Meatless Monday, and you know where I'm eating lunch!!! I got the spicy vegan link, fat fries and the world famous Playa Punch. #meatlessmonday at #EarlesGrill on #crenshaw"
1/1/2021,20210101,5,4.6,"I absolutely loved their vegan options, it was so great that I went back the next day for round two. The apple pie was to die for!"
1/2/2021,20210102,5,4.6,"Bombness, all around Bombness First time trying out the vegan hotdogs and all I can a say again is Bombness definitely going back!"
1/4/2021,20210104,5,4.6,I have always loved a good hot dog. I have never had one as good as this one!! Tried it for the first time last week and had to have it again today! I will be a frequent customer! . Love the chili as well!
1/6/2021,20210106,5,4.61,"Come here every time I come to Crenshaw, love this place b/c I can have a delicious vegan or vegetarian meal with my meat eating friends!"
1/14/2021,20210114,5,4.61,"Earle's is the place to go when you're really hungry, want something simple - but absolutely cooked to perfection, and makes you feel cozy!First the service makes you feel like family, the smiles from the staff alone has made me a loyal customer.But let's talk about the good stuff, the food! Holy cow, how does a VEGAN hotdog (if I am trying to be ""healthy"" I get the vegan dog, otherwise all beef!) taste so good with a snap! All the fun toppings you can add, it's a comfort food dream. Also the fries, Earle's is the first place Ive been to in LA that knows the value of cutting the corners off the to-go containers so that the fries don't get mushy! Anyhow, here's my usual order: vegan or beef dog, fries, a side of chili (to dip the dog and the fries), TWO broccoli salads (to have one the next day) - btw, this is also my favorite item - the dressing is perfect, and a slice of the vegan cake (preference: the yellow cake with the chocolate frosting).All in all, Earle's on Crenshaw, I love you..."
1/15/2021,20210115,4,4.61,"I was craving chili over brown rice, but the Loft in Gardena won't have it on their menu until the Pandemic is over. I came here and bought a small bowl to see if I would like it. I'm very particular about the chili I eat, so a small bowl would suffice if it's worth it to come back. Mind you this place doesn't offer brown rice, but does offer vegetarian options. I bought a rice cooker, because many restaurants stopped offering brown rice because of the current pandemic. I was pleasantly surprised how good the chili was. The spices were unique and flavorful. I only had 2 minor gripes about the chili at Earle's on Crenshaw. 1) The beef was pretty scarce in my meat chili 2) The chili I got had no beans. I'm sure they had beans, but I didn't order properly. I would most definitely comeback and order a larger side of chili, because it was so flavorful."
1/18/2021,20210118,5,4.61,"I traveled to SoCal over the holidays to visit a family member and I found this place on Instagram. I have been vegan for nearly 3 years, so I have had my fair share of vegan food. This place is the truth! Best vegan chili I've ever had. I had the spicy vegan link with vegan chili and vegan chili cheese fries and the whole meal was fire! The staff was respectful and the place was clean. All of the staff had masks and gloves on and there were social distancing orders in place for customers doing pick up orders. I highly recommend this place."
1/22/2021,20210122,5,4.61,My favorite place since the hotdog cart days right outside the King Swapmeet on Marlton. They never disappoint!! I always get the chicken link but I'm learning to try other items on their menu i.e. the Jamaican patties are a hit! Today I ordered the spicy beef link for lunch with the NY Red onions and a sweet potato pie! A party in my mouth . A family owned business and their mom is a gem . #support blackowned businesses
1/24/2021,20210124,5,4.61,Great place in the Crenshaw district to eat good clean food ask for Will he will take care of you family owned is neck and neck with Pinks on melrose
1/26/2021,20210126,5,4.61,"I love this place SO MUCH! I'm so glad I stumbled upon such a fantastic place after a post office run! They have great fast quick service, good attitudes, and every Monday they allow different venders to sale their products and omg a totally NEW hidden gem with vegan options ! I was taking pictures like a tourist outside and the owner gifted me a gift card! I tried it immediately and the vegan chili cheese fries with vegan cheese was sooo absolutely delicious !"
1/26/2021,20210126,1,4.6,"This review has nothing to do with adjusting to COVID19 and is long overdue. I visited twice, maybe 3 times and each time the service was poor and I feel this restaurant is extremely over priced for the menu and the food was simply average. There isn't anything that would cause me to revisit and I haven't been back in a year. I think the community deserves better quality."
1/27/2021,20210127,5,4.6,"Favorite chili cheese dog, hands down!! I would eat this every day if I could! Great customer service, always timely, and consistent!"
1/31/2021,20210131,5,4.6,This place is great if you are looking for a satisfying vegan hot dog. I would have to say that their price and accessibility makes them worth the visit along with their vegan cheese that is difficult to produce at home. It should be comforting to know though that you can buy their vegan sausages at Safeway and replicate their hot dogs for half the cost if you are on a budget or trying to feed younger and pickier plant-based eaters. A HUGE perk about visiting them though is you can hopefully grab some delicious Mama Auntie's Vegan Goodies where the almond butter cookie and coffee ice cream are absolute fiya.
2/1/2021,20210201,5,4.6,Best vegan dog and hot link I've ever had.  Seriously.  And the chili is to die for.  The crew is upbeat.  Smiles abound. Great vibe. And better food.
2/2/2021,20210202,5,4.6,"Stopped by for a quick lunch pick up and was so happy I did! I had the vegan hot dog with a kick. So delicious! Their house vegan chipotle is to die for, and pairs well with their fries. I can't wait to come back and try the vegan chili!I ordered through GrubHub and my food was ready to go by the time I was there for pickup."
2/5/2021,20210205,2,4.6,So I finally got around to it. Been heading down there for quite some time. Boom I got to it and I didn't like the $7 banana pudding. The koolaid or whatever it was a yellow and red fluid mix... tasted oddly like flowers. And the all beef chili dog would have been better minus the chili/cheese and soggy grilled onions. The chili had a really sweet flavor and was a bit awkward tasting as well. However I was okay with the price of the chili dog just not the taste.
2/23/2021,20210223,1,4.59,"--I don't understand all the hoopla. The ""vegan chili"" is disgusting...it taste like vinegar and ketchup ....the peach cobbler was not up to par...(I don't know who likes overly soft crumbly crust---)"
2/24/2021,20210224,5,4.59,I came to get a covid test and got hungry while waiting in line... so I ordered while in line and I'm so glad I did! It was a bit spicy for me tbh but I regret nothing! Was my mouth in pain and kept salivating? Yes. Were my eyes watery cz I haven't eaten something spicy in so long? Yea. Will I go back for more? Definitely! They have parking at the back or street parking if you dare. They also have some pies and other hotdog options.
2/27/2021,20210227,5,4.59,Saw this place on the LA Chargers social media pages. Looked delicious so I had to drive down there from SFV to check them out. And boy was I not disappointed. The food was great!!! Definitely have found a new favorite spot. Don't be afraid to try this spot
3/7/2021,20210307,5,4.59,"Vegan dog with fries with ketchup, mustard and NY onions (I think that's what they call the onions). Any time I'm in the area, I stop at Earles and truthfully speaking, everything I've had is good. There's something for every palate here, even if you just want dessert. They have outdoor tent seating which is perfect because I think it's a bigger area than they have inside. I forgot to take a pic of my meal, but just know it was bomb."
3/30/2021,20210330,5,4.59,This restaurant is quickly becoming one of my favorites and is representing for Black businesses . Love the vibe and culture here. The customer service is wonderful and shout-outs to the cooks for being so personable and friendly. The chef today was super helpful with my order. ( Tall man with braids) - sorry didn't get your name but thanks so much for your hospitality! Keep up the great work!
4/4/2021,20210404,5,4.59,Great food and beautiful respectful customer service thank you to all the crew you gotta eat here...
4/5/2021,20210405,5,4.59,Earle's has always been amazing no matter where they were. The food is great the service they provide is great. They have a very neighborly feel when you go to their establishment. It's like getting food from a family member or your neighbor (minus that you have to pay but that's not a problem) my order has never been wrong and they've never forgotten anything. Used to go everyday before they had to move them I was devastated for awhile until they were back on Crenshaw and available again! I love them and their food!
4/7/2021,20210407,5,4.59,If in the mood for a chicken link or some chili fries this is the place. They also have vegan options. I visit here once or twice a month.
4/8/2021,20210408,3,4.59,Came into this place to compare it to Bay Area vegan restaurants & to support black owned business shout out to the culture. They have both meat & vegan options. 20 minute wait. I was told. Not in this case. My order was sitting there for a while before it was given to me. I finally get my order and I was missing an item. I told the lady I was missing an item & she asked me for the receipt because they LOST IT on their end. Luckily I'm not the type of person to throw away receipts or I would have been axx out. Fries were overly seasoned and over done & Classic burger was greasy. I'm gonna assume they had a bad day. If you know better you'll do better. Now y'all know. Spoke to the manager & she said she is working on training them & customer service is their #1priority. Definitely a win for the Bay at the end of the day.
4/13/2021,20210413,5,4.59,"First of all, Earle's has NEVER disappointed me. Everything on the menu is beyond delicious and I mean everything down to the toppings. I am a newly vegetarian and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy my favorite things here again but I was wrong. The vegan chili and the beyond meat burger are a gift from God. I don't understand how it isn't meat, it is BOMB! I am amazed and thrilled. Lastly, Will and Nancy always give superior customer service."
4/23/2021,20210423,2,4.58,"The owner's mother is incredibly rude. Always ordering people around with an aggressive, demanding tone. Today she told me I don't care when I tried to stand up for myself after she let a customer who came in after me pay first. It's a pain every time I go there because I know I have to deal with her."
4/25/2021,20210425,5,4.59,The vegan fries are excellent The grill carmelized onions are good on everything The chilli cheese dog is also good I would eat here everything is good.
4/29/2021,20210429,5,4.59,OMG..this place is awesome..friendly Service..great food..so happy they are still here.
4/29/2021,20210429,1,4.58,"The owner of the ""business "" called my friend a b**** because his employer wouldn't give me my receipt for the door dash order I was doing and then comes out behind her acting like he gonna physically touch her and to top it Nancy was the one who was being rude from the beginning when I whent to get the order . If I could give them 0 stars I would ."
5/7/2021,20210507,5,4.58,"The food is really good here. I love the setup and many different food choices you have when it comes to the toppings. I had the two spicy beef links which were spicy and good! The beef chili cheese fries were also good, the chili is amazing! If you want some good comfort food, you have to check this place out."
6/4/2021,20210604,3,4.57,"This place is okay. I Ordered vegan chili cheese fries. They were just okay. I'm trying to understand why the fries are so big. Chili cheese fries taste the best with skinny fries, this might be a short cut for the business. The veggie Jamaican pattie is okay too. I typically get patties from Crenshaw, off Florence (the lil Belizean spot). These don't have much of a flavor so that was a hit n miss. I would like to try the vegan dog with grilled onions, it looked yummyy in one of the reviews. Overall, the vegan fries and the vegan pattie are not to die for."
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.57,"Earle's gets a 5 star for a few reasons, first for being one of few cornerstone spots offering vegan and vegetarian options in this Black community. Also for the embedded history of the community and Black Businesses. They also use brown bag and boxes over Styrofoam and plastic packaging.. Finally, for comforting foods that are nostalgic, sustainable, and healthier choices. I grew up in South Central where Chili cheese fries and fritos were a staple! We ordered Earle's Vegan chili with real cheese (you can choose vegan cheese) It was so satisfying and comforting and a nice portion. My daughter and I shared. We also ordered a Vegan chili cheese Link and A vegan chili dog. Loved the spicy link and the vegan dog was not bad. For drinks we tried their Shirley Templw, I loved the refreshing sweet and tartness and felt quenched but my daughter felt it was too sweet. We ordered"
6/18/2021,20210618,5,4.58,"Great food. I have followed this restaurant from a catering cart, to the corner near the shoe warehouse to The Chili Factory and now next to the post office. The food is always good, service is friendly, and the facilities are clean. I miss the sweet pretty old lady with the short haircut. Prices have gone up significantly but Vegan food options always cost more. I suggested this place to my co-workers and they are all very impressed. Keep up the good work Family. When I choose Earle's, I never question if my food will be good or not, I know it'll be great. Who is Earle? Is it the cool cat with the Caribbean accent who labeled my meal an ""SS on Dubs?"" Or is it the suave mild mannered, soft spoken gentleman with the classic green truck?Love"
6/23/2021,20210623,4,4.57,"Let's be straight up; this place is a landmark. An icon. A local community hub. I get it. We get it. Y'all get it.But when the chili is bland, the buns are a bit stale, and everyone is ....not exactly warm...because of whatever reason, it is HARD to elevate to an all-4 star level. They do a lot of things right here, though;* Social distance and safety barrier * Menu selection with goodies like Playa Punch and Sweet Potato Pie* Outdoor, spacious seating* Vegan options are ....well....Also, I love the fact that Snoop Dogg and Barack Obama are well represented, but the movie playing during my visit was ""Soylent Green""Restaurant tip #473 - NEVER PLAY THE MOVIE SOYLENT GREEN IN A RESTAURANT!! Strongly recommend."
7/17/2021,20210717,3,4.57,"Do not order with a delivery service. My hotdog barley had anything on it, missing requested items, and disgusting. Looks like they put 1/2 tsp of each topping. Prior to ordering delivery I'd give Erale's 4.5 stars for their vegan chili and vegan hot dog. After this I'm done! Super upset about my hotdog."
7/18/2021,20210718,2,4.56,"I'll definitely stick to the vegan buger, that's more up my alley. The vegan link was SPICY! The food description don't lie, haha, but I didn't care for it. It tasted like vegan sausage and I haven't been a fan of it since Lazy Daisy In Beverly Hills. The vegan chili on top was good though! Chili is a dish I really enjoy, and liked a lot on this link. It's all in the beans. The onions on the other hand didn't do it for me, couldn't really taste the flavor. I only knew I was eating onions because I was making eye-contact with them. But, I did appreciate how the link wasn't soggy. I assumed they would have put the toppings in separate containers, but they piled it on instead for my delivery.  The Lemon Cake was good. I was too lazy to grab some oat milk with it, haha, but it's the right amount of sweetness. It could have had a BIT MORE frosting within the layers for a sweet tooth like me, but again, a pretty good vegan dessert.  I wanted the Vegan Peach Cobbler, but I didn't know that I can't have it through delivery. I clicked on 'Peach Cobbler' thinking that it would automatically be vegan since there wasn't a vegan option, but maybe as a note, I should have asked for it to be vegan. Still ate it though since I've never had peach cobbler, but I didn't like it. It was like a mushy cinnamon covered dessert that had really cold peaches buried within it. Definitely didn't finish this.  Kinda disappointed that I was looking forward to a meal I ended up not rocking with, but ya win some, ya lose some. I have other items on the Earl menu that I really like: The patties, vegan burger, and vegan chili fries. I'll definitely be back if in the area again. Maybe even with my gran, she really likes the patties :)"
8/14/2021,20210814,5,4.56,"You can't beat Earle's On Crenshaw for the ultimate neighborhood eatery experience. The vibe here is awesome. Locals eat here and Earle's family is always working somewhere in the restaurant. Everybody knows eachother and friendly hugs and greetings are the norm. The food at Earle's is terrific. This is diner fare with a vegan twist on many items. If you like meat, you can get that too. I usually get the Salmon Burger or the Turkey Dog, totally loaded. Yum! The regular burger is pretty amazing too. The chili cheese fries are delish! All items are dressed the way you want and the list of toppings is pretty huge. Wherever you are in LA, it's worth the trip to Crenshaw for good noshing at Earle's. If you see Mama Earle while you're there, be sure to tell her hello...actually, she may tell you hello first."
9/17/2021,20210917,5,4.57,"Gotta give this place some love. I placed a large phone order this afternoon and not only was my order immaculate, but the food was delicious. The playa's punch is bomb! If you're in the area, you have to check out Earle's."
10/7/2021,20211007,5,4.57,Best chili cheese fries in L.A. thank you ! Crispy delicious fries; chili that's amazing. Service was spectacular! Thank you!
11/11/2021,20211111,5,4.57,"Tried the chicken hot dog, turkey hot dog, and spicy beef link, and vegan chili cheese fries! My review is simple...order the spicy beef link!!! It's great and very filling, I enjoyed it  Good prices too."
11/19/2021,20211119,5,4.57,Gave up red meat a while back. Started looking for tasty alternatives and I took a chance at a vegan hot dog and liked it! They got the hooks in me when they offered vegan chili cheese Fritos. Now my standard for all orders is the vegan spicy link!Keep doing what you doing Earle!
12/11/2021,20211211,5,4.57,The owner here is the sweetest. They have vegan options which is amazing and the food was so delicious. I recommend the chili fries and a Chicago style dog (with all the toppings your heart desires). A classic spot that you have to visit when in the area!!!
12/29/2021,20211229,5,4.57,"Literally haven't finished my food and had to drop this review!! I been eyeing the menu for a while and decided to finally get a Turkey burger today. I ordered through Yelp on grub hub and first of all I loooove how customizable the menu is. I'm gluten free and dairy free and just over all picky so I was able to make my Turkey burger w/ vegan cheese on gluten free bun w/ only bbq sauce (don't laugh at my childish order okay) super easy without having to write a bunch of notes. The gluten free bun was sooooo good way better than any where else I've ever had one honestly. The vegan cheese was melts and delicious, the Patty was flavorful and cooked without being dry. My only complaint is not enough bbq sauce but I should have just asked for an extra side when I picked up my food honestly and it was still delicious and saucy. I will definitely be back for their chicken link and the vegan chili looks so good. Definitely recommend this black owned business and I'll be back with friends"
1/24/2022,20220124,5,4.57,Everything from the hot dogs to the salad are awesome here but surely don't sleep on the mixer possibilities in food. The vegetarian chili cheese pastrami fries knocked it out the park. Mouth watering to say the list bro :)
2/11/2022,20220211,5,4.57,"A classic in the neighborhood, this staple in the community literally started as a hot dog stand and grew into a pillar in the community. My brotha, music engineer DevRunLA who grew up in the area put me on to it and I haven't looked back since.From classic hot dogs and links to vegan options & hosting community events for the whole city, Earle's really does it all. The restaurant is still family owned and operated by some of the nicest people you'll meet in the city so don't miss out. Get the Playaz Punch if you really about that action! Thank me later, follow me now, stay eatin' bruh!"
2/26/2022,20220226,4,4.57,"Yeah, 4.5 stars.The food here is delicious, try a turkey burger with NY style onions on a whole-wheat bun, yum! The fries are fresh, hot, and generous, and if you buy a small container of chili to dip 'em in you're all set; it reminds me of Tommy's chili, and that ain't a bad thing. A lot of turkey burgers are as ""dry as the driven dust"", but not this one; it's perfectly cooked and really moist and tasty.Service is friendly and courteous and everything about this place is very cool. If they put cheese on their burgers that might get them that extra half star. Highly recommended and more than worth making the trip for; I also hear their salmon burgers are really good."
3/5/2022,20220305,4,4.57,"Earle's isn't open on Sundays so I ordered today instead.The Vegan Chili Cheese Fries, Veggie Patty, Coffee Cake, and Banana Pudding definitely did what it was supposed to!The fries were SOOO GOOD! Off the MF chain! The fries themselves were bland, but with the chili, cheese, and chopped onions, they took the cake. The toppings are what made the meal for me. The veggie patty was surprisingly good. I LOVE my patties yellow and crunchy, so on first glance they weren't doing it for me. The patty this white, grayish color, but the taste is pretty satisfying. I'm saving the rest for tomorrow.***None of these desserts are vegan***(The cakes are, but I didn't order any)The best part of Banana Pudding are the Nilla Wafers. Such a throwbackkk. I didn't eat much of the yellow custard, too sweet, but those 4 wafers were my favorite part.Lastly, the Coffee Cake. I haven't opened it yet, but I know Earle's ain't left me down. I'm too full to have dessert, but I'm very much looking forward to it. Almond Milk and Coffee Cake for the win!Good eats and a good weekend :)"
3/5/2022,20220305,5,4.57,"This is my local favorite! Good options for vegetarians and carnivores alike, good chili - both the meat and vegetarian versions are great! They have a selection of vegan cakes for dessert, as well as other dessert options. Pro tip: get the NY sweet cooked onions on your hotdog, veggie dog, or spicy beef link, and they are especially good on the chili cheese fries!"
3/14/2022,20220314,4,4.57,The food was good. The employees were friendly however they are not very helpful explaining the menu for first time visitors. But the menu is simple enough that it's not hard to pick something. I thought they had different combinations already put together for you to choose from but you have to create your own.
3/15/2022,20220315,5,4.57,"Delicious! Served with genuine love for the community and customer service with class. I enjoyed you from the hot dog truck on Marlton Avenue, by Kenny's shoe store and the swap meet, to Crenshaw in Leimert Park, to Jack's old spot across from the old probation office, until now. Thank you for the cool drinks of Playa's Punch, High School Coffee Cakes and other great food you gave to me and my daughters when I first started at the salon next door. Your chili cheese fries are heavenly and yo peach cobbler cheesecakes be SLAPPIN! God's continued blessings and prosperity!!!"
3/18/2022,20220318,5,4.57,"Love this place. My personal favorite is getting the beef chili fries with Vegan cheese and raw onions. All the links are good (beef, chicken, vegan). The staff is very accommodating. Would definitely recommend."
3/19/2022,20220319,5,4.57,Anyone rolling through Crenshaw needs to stop by Earle's on Crenshaw!!! They have meat and vegan options and that goes for dessert too. I had the pastrami sandwich with some chili cheese fries. My wife had the chicken link and a Frito pie. We also split a peach cobbler and pecan pie cheesecake. It was FIRE!!!
3/29/2022,20220329,4,4.57,Earle's food is really good! We always get the Jumbo Kosher Beef Frank. My brother in law ordered Chilli cheese fries topped with pastrami which was a bit different for me but none the less it was very delicious
4/7/2022,20220407,4,4.57,Very nice service and good food. French fries are steak cut and extra crispy which I like. Pastrami on wheat burger bun was tasty. And I had a Snapple. I wouldn't say it's a great value but the prices are commensurate with what's out there these days. There's outside seating.
4/11/2022,20220411,5,4.57,"Great customer service. Friendly owner. The space is nice. I only had dessert (banana pudding), and it was tasty and fresh. My friend ordered a chili dog which was big. It looked good so I will be back with an appetite.Parking was easy at 6pm on a Friday."
4/13/2022,20220413,5,4.57,"Today was my first time trying Earle's! It was absolutely amazing and tasty to say the least. I had the vegan chili cheese fries, the vegan dog (with ny style onions, chipotle mayo, sauerkraut, + hot peppers). I also ordered their chicken patty & their beef patty. Everything was so delicious and I couldn't have been happier to discover this awesome place. Can't wait to come back!"
4/23/2022,20220423,5,4.57,I love their chilli cheese fries and Leimert Park burger. There ny style onions tops everything off to taste even better. They also have vegan options.
4/30/2022,20220430,5,4.58,Had a vegan link with vegan cheese and vegan chili. It was so delicious. I like how they make their fries too as steak fries. They have a wide selection of toppings for your links and fries. So happy with the Vegan menu!
5/12/2022,20220512,5,4.58,Sooooo good! The best chili cheese fries awesome vegan link and affordable will be back
5/21/2022,20220521,5,4.58,"***Vegan chili cheese dog heaven!*** When we came to LA for the weekend, we made Earle's on Crenshaw our first stop because it's that good. This visit we met the owner, she is a lovely and gracious woman who really made the experience even better. All around phenomenal."
5/24/2022,20220524,5,4.58,"First time going there. My buddy had a Turkey sandwich. He said that he enjoyed it. I had the Vegan burger, with vegan cheese. I really enjoyed the food at Earle's on Crenshaw. I took a picture of the vegan burger..but it's gone now. I guess that I am going to go there again to complete this review."
5/29/2022,20220529,5,4.58,I remember when Earle's was just a stand. I drive from Long Beach to patronize these delectable chili dogs or fries.
6/3/2022,20220603,5,4.58,I would like to think I am a regular customer to this establishment and I never lose excitement when I return. My favorite part of patronizing this business is the love and support the owners have for other up and coming small black business who I also patronize while visiting. The Chili (whether beef or vegan) never disappoints and you can't go wrong with the Jamaican Patties!
6/5/2022,20220605,5,4.58,"I always appreciate a spot that can serve good ol' chili dogs, and still include the vegans! I ordered the vegan hot dog with vegan chili and vegan cheese. Topped with red onions and mustard, best vegan chili dog I have had in a long time. It's always good to just have something that reminds you of your childhood days. Thank you Earle's!"
6/7/2022,20220607,5,4.58,"I can't believe I waited this long to try this place. I've heard about it, but I didn't know it was going to be as good as it was. Their chili cheese fries, both the regular and vegan were so delicious. Even their kool-aid was delicious and perfectly sweet and refreshing. I got a turkey dog as well and it was good. I will definitely be back. I love the fact that it's also Black Owned. Thank you for your service."
6/8/2022,20220608,5,4.58,"I love Earle's Grill. I've been supporting them when they first started out with Hot Dog Carts. One was located on Marlton. I love their pastrami; I just wish they would put the pastrami on a French Roll or Sourdough Bread. I've also tried their Veggie Dogs, Turkey Dogs and the regular, Chili Fries and Playas Punch. If you are visiting Los Angeles, you must try Earle's Grill!"
