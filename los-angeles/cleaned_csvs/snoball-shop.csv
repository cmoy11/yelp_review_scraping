Now I zip by there at least twice, maybe three times a week. It's that good!New Orleans Snoballs are melt in your mouth delicious! Plus, there's no yucky aftertaste from the syrup which many other shaved ice vendors have. This place offers over 12 flavors to choose from. My favors are Tropical punch and Hawaiian.It's located on the corner of Slauson and Overhill."

5/26/2011,20110526,4,4.89,"I am a transplant from Louisiana and one of my favorite things when I go home is a snowball (totally different from shaved ice) When I saw this place I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I was giddy all day becuase I was able to indulge in one of my favorite yummy treats. I got the ice cream flavor snowball with extra cream (condensed milk) As I am writing this , I am craving another one now. Next time I will try the funnel cake."

7/6/2011,20110706,5,4.82,"This place really needs more reviews! There's so many flavors it takes me forever to figure out what I want. Snoballs are the perfect treat for a hot day and the line is usually out the door when it's super hot. I've never tried anything else besides the snoballs, but I've heard other things are good too."
7/10/2011,20110710,4,4.75,"Mmmmmm, good stuff.  Even just the plain ice is yummy..."
8/22/2011,20110822,5,4.77,"This place gets five stars from me, I absolutely love funnel cake and couldn't believe a place right up the street from me was selling them. You can smell the sweet aroma from the parking lot. They were so tasty,and the snoballs looked delicious as well, I have yet to try them. I never write reviews so this place is petty special for me to take the time out to write one"
9/11/2011,20110911,4,4.71,"I love their snowballs! Sooo yummy! They let you mix flavors and you can even add ice cream to it. My favorite combination is cherry and tigers blood. They usually use way too much syrup which I'm not a fan of. But it's perfect for the sugar craver :)The guys that work here are always friendly and efficient. Their tip jar is a always pretty empty so tip em.I'd give them 5 stars but I've been here several times when their ""snow"" or ice cream machines are broken. So either you can't get a snowball at all that trip or you can't have it New Orleans style.I've yet to try any of their other treats but they look and smell good. They've finally expanded their hours which makes me happy. Parking is never a problem."
12/13/2011,20111213,5,4.73,"Its already been said, once u have a snow ball a snow cone wont cut it, its amazing. very soft and just sweet. I have tried their funnel cake and it was out of this world. My only complaint, and i doubt it even counts is that they close early for me, 7. That's just us however since we want a snowball late at night sometimes XD"
1/7/2012,20120107,4,4.69,Staff very friendly and kind and cute. Got a small 3 buck snow which was so good. Sat outside on the bench and ate it! I will return
7/9/2012,20120709,5,4.71,This place is AWESOME!!!! I have been looking for a snowball stand for a while now. My family and I use to go all the time when i lived in Louisiana... Keep up the great work. wishing this place all the sucess in the world...
7/29/2012,20120729,5,4.72,"Awesome. Would be a great snowball stand even in New Orleans.It would make a killing close to the beach in Santa Monica / Venice, but it's definitely worth the drive."
8/13/2012,20120813,5,4.74,Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! The ice is so soft and the flavors are good and yummy! Great place and the young eye candy isnt so bad either!
8/25/2012,20120825,4,4.7,Love the New Orleans style snowballs. I was just wondering if this place was still open or not? I drove past there a little over a week ago and it was closed. My cousin told me that she also hasn't seen it open when she goes by. I wish people would get together their business hours!
10/2/2012,20121002,5,4.71,"I used to think the guys who bike around with their block of ice making raspados were delicious. Boy, I was wrong!Ever since I tried this place out, courtesy of my sister/fellow yelper Zochi F. I fell in love with this place!With this never-ending heatwave this place is a must if you want to cool off with soft shaved ice. It's not rough or chunks of ice like the street vendors in the hood. It's really delicate that will immediately melt. I usually get green apple, watermelon and cotton candy which satisfies my sweet tooth. They also have a ton of other flavors that a street vendor would never think of.Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
10/29/2012,20121029,5,4.73,"I absolutely LOVE this place. I hate that it's so far from my home but every time I'm near I make it a point to visit. On Sundays after church they are ALWAYS busy, but the quality of service and hard work of the young men to be pleasurable at all times makes it well worth it. I love the new Orleans style. OMG!!! If you have never been you MUST visit!"
11/10/2012,20121110,5,4.74,"SPECTACULAR SERVICE!I'm originally from the south (Texas to be exact), so little stands for Snow cones (AKA Snowballs) are on every other block. I am soooooo elated I found this place. It reminds me of home on a hot summer day.The fact that snow cone places are abundant back home $3.50 to $4 is reasonable for a large anything more would be considered outright crazy. Here it's $6. But hey, what can you do? Its the only place I know in LA that makes snow cones the RIGHT WAY! Soft soft soft ICE.The service here is GREAT!!!! Every single person that works here is always smiling and very friendly. I come here one to three times a week and I have never had a bad experience. They deserve tips. Sitting here writing this makes me want one now. If I lived one mile closer to this place I would probably come everyday. (Except for snow days, rain days and holidays........ well possibly holidays)."
12/7/2012,20121207,3,4.67,A-OK.They make shaved ice with flavored syrup. I don't think you can mess this one up. I did like that you can get froyo under your sugar ice. I guess I'd like it more if i liked eating pure sugar.
1/5/2013,20130105,5,4.68,"Great New Orleans style snoballs!!! Great gumbo!!!!!! Very tasty ice cream in the stuffed snoball.It's so nice to have a taste of home so close. Snoballs are really hard to find in LA.And the guy working the counter, Jason, was very friendly and professional.My only disappointment is they don't have chocolate syrup for the snoballs (or any cream flavors). This is a staple for stands in New Orleans and has always been my favorite. I'm hoping they work that out. In any case, the cinnamon is quite yummy."
1/24/2013,20130124,4,4.65,Really nice guys that run this place!!! :-) The menu is huge...I didn't know there were so many flavor choices for sno-cones or sno-balls.
3/15/2013,20130315,4,4.63,Great service and fabulous Sno Balls!!!!!!!Highly recommend this spot for a treat
7/4/2013,20130704,4,4.61,Venue : they are clean but small esp parking. Price : It's reasonable for the quality/tasteVarieties/Flavors : Great selection.. Can match up to 3 flavors. You can also add condensed milk or make it into the New orleans Style Sno Balls (with ice cream)Taste : awesome.. Must try!Will we go back? Definitely yes!
10/11/2013,20131011,4,4.59,"THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY The good thing: The Snoballs are just as I remember them to be; I'm a New Orleans native, born and raised. Snoballs are a highlight to my childhood. The prices are a bit higher than they are in New Orleans, I'm guessing because it's something different out here. A medium, in New Orleans would be $1.75, and $4.00 in LA. Which is no big deal, I still will visit often!The bad: The first time I came around, there was a guy working alone who seemed to be very professional and did an exceptional job with my order. Of course it's 'only' shaved ice and syrup. However, If the person making the Snoball isn't mindful of what they're doing the results can be dry and hard sections of flavorless ice. The shaved-ice needs to be drenched in the syrup to have it's best outcome, otherwise there's nothing to enjoy, just... Ice. I've been consuming Snoballs since age 4, I know when it's not made correctly. So... (before I make my official statement let me just say, it's not the prayoduct or location, but rather the individuals who were assigned to work this particular shift)I go in October 10th 2013 (3-5pm). The experience was much different from my initial visit; Extremely loud music playing by two guys chattering with their friends in the lot outside of the bldg (Music is blasting on what looked to be a surround sound speaker sitting on a top shelf) as if their Mother is out of town and the place is to themselves. Guy (Purple T-shirt) walks in as if im 'interrupting the flow' (ummm, you're at work'?) He asked what my order would be, I ordered. The other guy jets back out to the lot to 'hang out' eith whoever was in the black car parked in the parking lot. The guy that's making my order had 'ants in his pants' throughout the process so he could dart back to the parking lot where all the interest was at. When he handed the Snoball to me it was done a little too quick; it's a fast process but THIS was REALLY fast!. I left and realized 10 mins into eating that there's hardly any syrup in the cup; one part had none at all (just fluorescent white ice) I was PISSED OFF!!! I just paid $4 for a cup of dry ice. Mind you, I DO NOT LIVE CLOSE BY. I made my way over there with purpose, to get my favorite treat and THIS happends. I did my besy to NOT pre-judge the situation while walking in, but it was EXACTLY what I expected; Unprofessional and subpar, as soon as I heard the loud music and saw two young guys (mid 20's) darting in and out of the building I already knew what time it was. I did not go back and assert them because at this point I was HEATED. I knew by how they were conducting business it could possibly escalate into something completely unnecessary. So I continued home. I shpuld not have to to go back and complain about a cup with shaved ice and syrup that's so simple to make. Its not that difficult, it takes less than 3 minutes to hold a cup under a machine, collect the ice and drizzle syrup inbetween the ice until its done. How impossible could it be? I don't understand!!! The machine is doing all the work!!! All u have to do is dispense syrup from a bottle. I would be considered 'too harsh', 'cruel' or 'wrong' if I went back and addressed the issue even though my complaint was valid! They would've had attitudes, but im the one who's psychotic or confrontational had I gone back. Had they been less concerned with what was going on outside, my order couldve been completed the proper way. All I wanted was a medium snoball and only 1 basic flavor, that's it. Why must it be so difficult to walk-in, get a Snoball and leave? Dont come to work if youre not going to fall into form. If youre reading this, YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE (purple t-shirt, basketball shorts and flip flops)"
10/17/2013,20131017,4,4.57,"These snoballs were gooood.. Filled with flavor yet not too sweet. If there is only one guy working, it may take a while if there are others in front of you, however it was worth the wait."
10/21/2013,20131021,5,4.58,"Friendly staff, and a wonderful treat to have with our good LA weather. Also I like supporting family owned businesses."
11/3/2013,20131103,3,4.53,"New Orleans it ain't, coz I've had the best there :)But, since it's hard to drive 1500 miles to the Crescent City, these guys will have to do. Nice people running the place, lots of flavors and choices.Sugar rush, here we go ..."
11/20/2013,20131120,5,4.55,"Through natural selection (I promise I tried to control it) I wandered from one eatery to another (yeah yeah there's only 2, but this place carries Gumbo on Sundays so they qualify) in this tiny, overpopulated, corner of the Earth. Hey works for me less walking means less chance of quickly burn off any heart attack chances (did I type that?) I mean calories. Anyway - this place has some good a$$ simple syrupy type sno cones. And yes...you just read all of that to find out they're amazing. Sachi House and Simply Wholesome reviews coming one day. You know I've burned this little 3 corner food area up."
12/29/2013,20131229,4,4.53,"Probably the best shaved ice, snoball, whatever you want to call it I have found in LA. Fair price, good toppings, and its kind of got a fun little vibe, always lots of activity and people milling about. I dig it."
1/18/2014,20140118,5,4.54,"I really like this place. I've been here many times but I wish they closed much later. Would be a great dessert place after going out to dinner. I think sometimes they close at 6:00 pm. My nephew got ""Evvvvvverything"".. all the flavors and with Condensed Milk drizzled on top. I have to say it was really good.The owner is really nice as well. Great customer service. The staff here are also very patient. I'm was super happy to see that they added funnel cakes. Yay!Their soft serve ice cream cone is definitely more wholesome than McDonald's"
1/21/2014,20140121,5,4.56,So good! And they're my go to place for helping me get over hangovers! Especialy when there is gumbo available too! OMG! **air hug**
1/31/2014,20140131,5,4.57,First timers to Snoballs. We let Jason hook us up w/ custom concoctions. Amazing and yes add the ice-cream! This place is really special. Came across it while we were killing time and ended up killing a couple of medium Snoballs. No problem. We will be back for the large ones soon! Thanks Jason!
2/4/2014,20140204,5,4.58,"Delicious!!!! Funnel cake heaven with homemade soft serve ice cream and strawberries!!!! Yummilicious!!!! Could become my next obsession! The sno balls are sensational! It's flavored snow!!! Soooo many flavors to choose from, I must same them ALL!!! Courteous service, wonderful desserts! I can say no more!"
2/25/2014,20140225,5,4.59,"OMG AMAZEBALLSi love when i can get treats in my own backyard while supporting local mom and pop businessesthere are so many choices that i had to ""woo sah"" just to decide..... but i digress !!i purchased a small which was three dollars & the flavors i picked were : hurricane, pineapple & tropical punch . it was ssssooo good ; & it never got watery even down to the last sip it was sweet ! i loved the mix i made but as soon as i get another sunny day i plan on going back & putting together a different mixture so that i can taste a variety of flavors PLUS they have funnel cakes so i will DEFINITELY be back.customer service was AWESOME."
4/20/2014,20140420,5,4.6,"Being from L.A I've passed this place a trillion times . I finally sucked it up and decided to try . That was the BEST decision I EVER made !!! I usually go to Get Shaved Ice but there is no competition when it comes to this place and their funnel cakes ! They offer a variety of flavors , funnel cakes with all the fixings , homemade ice cream and gumbo ! Sometimes the line is long , but I promise you it is worth the wait . Don't be afraid to drop a tip in the jar because the two handsome men work hard to get those orders up and running . Long story short .... This place is AMAZING, and you MUST give it a try ! U will not be disappointed !"
5/8/2014,20140508,5,4.61,"Amazeballs, literally! I crave this place. The menu is ridiculous, serving sizes are impressive, and the server was cool too. Mmm, too far away but gotta go back soon!"
5/17/2014,20140517,5,4.62,"Went to get snow ice yesterday but they had ran out of ice.. that must mean business was booming. The young employee came outside and ensured me that if I return tomorrow there will be ice. Well I did. Today we bought the yummiest flavored ice. . This was the most tastiest shaved ice in the world. The ice was so fine that it melted in my mouth. They had a lot of flavors to choose from. I got the pineapple, mango, watermelon flavor. The best ever!!!!!I will return.. This place exceeded my expectations"
5/30/2014,20140530,4,4.6,"Finally got my funnel cake fix. Taste was excellent, can't beat a fresh from the stove funnel cake. Got sugar & strawberries to top off the funnel cake. Friendly guys with great service. One of them actually got my trash out of the way seeing how i was looking for a trash bin even though he was on the phone."
6/3/2014,20140603,5,4.61,I found this amazing place because of my amazing friend. She mentioned it briefly and I said let's go right now! All the staff was nice here. It had a super good vibe.Only bummer is they have NOTHING sugar free!!!!  I don't think I will be coming here often because of it. The sugar content is so high. Although it was a nice treat and super refreshing I hope they can offer sugar free options for the diabetics out there.
6/12/2014,20140612,5,4.62,I can't believe this place has been around for 8 years and I've never seen it. They have the most amazing coconut shaved ice!!!!
6/15/2014,20140615,2,4.57,"I have had real Sno Balls from NOLA... this just doesn't cut it... Too much Syrup in the Sno Balls so it sometimes take away from the ice... just cold Syrup.. but I guess if you have never Had a real one.. you will say... ""Ahh Man this is the Shizzzzzz""The Homemade Ice Cream well...................... I miss Quick and Split"
6/17/2014,20140617,4,4.55,"I really like the concept and flavor of this phone booth size store producing big flavor that's delicious! I have drove by this place hundreds of times and have seen a line around the corner several times, and what I know about LA people is that will not enjoy a line unless it's worth it. So, I wanted to stop in after 2 years and see what they hype is about and I was blown away how something like shaved ice could be heavenly! Moreover, they have a huge flavor list and you can choose 3 floors to add. Furthermore, I picked tropical punch, bubblegum, and watermelon. Finally, I will be back a lot as it warms up outside! Keep up the great work!"
7/12/2014,20140712,3,4.52,"New Orleans Snoballs is 3.5-star proof that Ice Dreams do come true in the Bayou ... thanks to fluffy & light Shaved Ice with sweeter-than-sweet Syrups and Old-fashioned Soft Serve. This isn't an old-school Sno-Cone or Hawaiian Shave Ice. It's Nawlins-style Shave Ice with Vanilla Ice Cream in the middle ($0.75 extra).With over 40 flavors of syrups available, good luck choosing just three for your own Icesterpiece. The line was long, so, I had plenty of time to mix 'n match flavors in my mind before settling on a Medium ($4) Blue Raspberry, Dreamsicle, and Mardis Gras King Cake. My biggest advice is to ask the Ice Masters behind the counter to go light on the syrup because it was soooo syrupy and sweet. I quickly dug down to the Vanilla Ice Cream and let the flavors mingle. Of course, the perfect Snoball (or Snowball) should be 72.2% Shaved Ice, 15.2% Soft Serve Ice Cream, and 12.4% Flavored-Syrup, of which 4.2% is Fruity.In addition, to Snoballs, Funnel Cakes are available for $6 with optional Ice Cream or Strawberries add-ons for a $1 extra. I got a 3-star regular Funnel Cake generously-dusted with Powdered Sugar. I know, I know ... I didn't need all those extra calories and sugar.

8/12/2014,20140812,4,4.53,"I decided to try this place simply because I missed the fair and was craving funnel cake. Boy am I glad I that did!! the funnel cake was perfect. It was fresh out of the oil but not oily , crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and because it was so fresh the powder sugar began to make a sort of icing! I will most definitely be returning."

11/16/2014,20141116,4,4.51,"They have tons of flavors. They call it snow balls, I call it raspados. Totally hit the spot. They also have funnel cakes and for some reason they also sell gumbo, odd but I'll try it out next time im there.There's plenty of parking with a couple other restaurants in that plaza. They're open everyday, which is great."

11/16/2014,20141116,5,4.51,Grew a quick obsession with this place....there's a ridiculous amount of selections and not only is everyone working there kind but they are really helpful. Highly recommend adding ice cream to the middle of your shaved ice. I've been told that condensed milk also makes the experience great. I'll never look at shaved ice the same again.

11/19/2014,20141119,4,4.51,"The snoballs here are really tasty. I always get Root Beer, Vanilla, homemade ice cream, AND condensed milk. My coworkers and I finally tried this place during the extreme heat this past summer, and we've been hooked ever since. I like supporting family-owned businesses, and any place that gives young people in the community an opportunity to work."
1/15/2015,20150115,4,4.5,"Good sno cones. You can pick from 4 sizes and mix 3 flavors of your choice. They have 30+ flavors so choose wisely. You can also get the sno cone New Orleans style with ice cream on the bottom. A sweet tooths delight. They also have funnel cakes for $6. You can get a slew of toppings like cinnamon sugar, powdered sugar, chocolate, caramel, whipped cream for free or premium toppings like ice cream or strawberries for $1 extra. They also serve gumbo from Thursday to Sunday and its not made with pork so that's great to me. I'll try it someday because of that fact. Go to place for nice cheap and tasty dessert if it's hot, you're in the area or don't want to go to an amusement park or East LA for a funnel cake. Enjoy."
1/22/2015,20150122,4,4.49,"I have passed by this place frequently and didn't think they sold funnel cakes. As a dessert fiend I knew I had to try their funnel cake. My close friend lives nearby so we made our way to Snoballs.The employee there was on a personal phone call during our entire ordering process. He didn't get off the phone until more customers came in after us. I found that a bit unprofessional. Besides that hiccup,everything else was great. For $8 we got a funnel cake with all the fixings. A way better deal compared to carnivals and amusement parks. The funnel cake was so rich. The strawberries tasted fresh. I'm glad I shared the funnel because it was filling. Since funnel cakes are so heavy it's not a dessert I would eat frequently but whenever I'm ever in the mood for one I will venture to Snoballs for it."
2/7/2015,20150207,5,4.5,"Gotta love snow balls! They have the best flavors here, when my little sister comes down for the weekend this is our first stop."
2/12/2015,20150212,5,4.51,I have to say their funnel cakes are just simply the best. I have to give 5 stars for quality and price. I haven't tried their snow cones yet. I will probably only stick to the funnel because the portion is generous and it's shareable.
3/14/2015,20150314,5,4.51,"By far, the best funnel cake I have ever tasted! I intended to capture a picture of my funnel cake topped with vanilla soft serve, but... It's all gone! It was amazing! Eat dinner before dessert; life is not promised."
4/2/2015,20150402,5,4.52,"I am a Fan, yes I love this place, my love affair began when they first opened and served soft serve Yogurt, however I still go there even tho they don't serve Yogurt, they now serve soft serve ice cream and that works for me as well.The employees are nice and friendly and they give ample portions of ice cream and shaved ice with lots of syrup, more than any other place I have been.During the cold weather the lines are not as long, however a it gets hot prepare Yo Self for a line, not a real serious line, however there is usually a wait.There's a lot of good things to say about this place, however the Down side is that it is located on Slauson which is a Crazy Busy Street and parking is a bit of an issue, they have a parking lot but it is shared with Orleans and York, Wings N Greens and Sir Charles or George Cleaners.A lot going on for all of those busy businesses and parking on Slauson is very limited.This is LA and there are tons of people so you wait where ever you go, so you kinda get used to waiting on everything, every where.Not a problem if you want it!For me it's worth the wait!"
5/3/2015,20150503,3,4.5,"More of a 3.5 star review.Great funnel cakes (wish they had fresh strawberries though).Good, but overpriced gumbo due to the little meat and fish and mostly rice and broth I received. Still, I will definitely come back when I am in the mood for a funnel cake and don't want to go all the way to a theme park to have one."
6/1/2015,20150601,5,4.51,"First time here n loving it I've only tried the funnel cake, but looking forward to returning to try something new, or just for a delicious funnel cake. Don't forget to add ice cream for a dollar more. I highly recommend this place"
6/25/2015,20150625,3,4.49,"The snoball was good, but the customer service was horrible. When I was in there the guy that was working the register seemed to be having a really bad day. First he didn't acknowledge anyone that was in there until he completed what he was doing. When he did come to the register he ask if he could take our order. Not hello, hi, welcome or anything to that nature. This was my first visit and probably my last, due to his lack of customer service. If this is read, I was in on June 24, 2015 in the evening. Maybe this will help with speaking to him about his service skills."
7/3/2015,20150703,5,4.49,I this place.. My family has been customers since they've opened.. Tigers Blood with Ice Cream in the middle is my fav
7/6/2015,20150706,5,4.5,"We sought this place out on our way home from a long weekend simply because they have the flavor my husband wanted (spearmint). This is a small business with great options. They make them New Orleans style if you want too (with a scoop of vanilla ice cream)!We each had a snoball with varying flavors. My son had bubblegum and my daughter had strawberry. The shaved ice is shaved fine and it's almost smooth. I decided to get fuzzy navel made New Orleans style and it was delicious. Their homemade vanilla ice cream they put in it was spot on. My husband got the spearmint made New Orleans style and had his summer quest to find this flavor satisfied!They had other items on the menu besides snoballs like funnel cakes with lots of topping options, vanilla frozen yogurt oh and you could add sweetened condensed milk to the top of your snoball too!It was delicious and we knew it was a good find when there was a line of locals out the door!"
7/6/2015,20150706,5,4.51,"I have been on a mission. A mission with the same intensity as a pregnant woman. I needed a spearmint flavored shaved ice/sno-ball. I looked far and wide, first in my town, Bakersfield. No luck. Then, I decided to scour Yelp before our vacation to Legoland. I found nothing near Carlsbad, Oceanside, or Orange County. I found a place in Los Angeles, but after calling that day, I found out they no longer had that flavor (the pic I saw on Yelp was 2 years old). Then, I found another place, New Orleans Snoballs. After calling and confirming, they did, for sure, HAVE MY FLAVOR. When we arrived there was a long line, on a rather cool July day. That was a good sign in my eyes.They offer many flavors of snoballs/shaved ice. The ice was very fine, which I love. They were also very generous with the flavor. They also have an add on, called New Orleans Style, where they add a scoop of soft serve ice cream to your snowball. I was curious, so I tried it. It was great. You can choose to have this ice cream on the bottom, in the middle, or on top. I chose the middle. It did not melt and was a great addition to the snoball. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes snoballs/shaved ice. If that's not your style, you can also get a cone of vanilla soft serve or a funnel cake."
7/9/2015,20150709,5,4.51,"Wasn't expecting it to be so delicious!! You have never had a snow cone until you had one there The favors were great...sour apple, sour cherry, and blue raspberry ummmm mmmm"
7/31/2015,20150731,5,4.52,yum! my personal favorite it blue raspberry and sour apple. tastes like the blue-green Fun Dip :)
8/3/2015,20150803,5,4.52,"The only thing that I've ever - ever had from this place are the snowballs (some call the shaved ice - but I don't know the difference). Although my friends tell me that all I'm doing is sucking down sugar water...I don't care, they are so good! Besides - I think I can work off that sugar faster than I can a scoop of gelato or ice cream.I'm a traditionalist - I don't want ice cream - yogurt - or anything else with my snowball. Just give me the oh so sweet flavors (I typically go with orange, grape, and black cherry)....I told you I was a traditionalist. I've seen their ads for gumbo, ice cream and funnel cakes - but I'm sticking to what I know. Gumbo at a Snowball store...nah.....I've never tasted a funnel cake from anyone...no appeal to me, but I will stick to what looks and tastes good. Hmmmmm, I wonder if they're open now. Gotta Run - Just in Case I Can Get a Quick Snowball Fix!!!"
8/4/2015,20150804,5,4.53,"OOOMMMMGGGGGEEEEEE! This place is AMAZING!! A nice treat on a hot day in L.A. (that rhymes lol) I had a medium with strawberry, blue raspberry and tigers blood. The first taste melted in my mouth. I swear my mouth was purple the rest of the day LOL! They have a variety of flavors and sizes to choose from! They also have elephant ears and you can have ice cream on top. I will definitely be back when I am in L.A."
8/12/2015,20150812,5,4.53,Omg!!! This place is beyond awesome!!! I love love love it!! My coworker got me hooked on this place. It so delicious! The ice just melts in our mouth! Make sure to add ice cream and condensed milk to it order!
8/15/2015,20150815,5,4.54,"Being from Nawlins, I do appreciate a good snow ball with condensed milk. This is the place. Lines are always too long, but worth the wait. So good."
9/6/2015,20150906,5,4.54,First time having a New Orleans style Sno Ball and it did not disappoint one bit. I had the watermelon sno ball and any thirst and heat I felt was zapped away in an instant. This is literally a few feet from York Orleans. The young staffers are friendly and helpful when it comes to getting you the right sno ball. Felt like being at the Big Easy.
10/4/2015,20151004,1,4.51,"I've been driving past this place for years but the parking is so horrible I never tired it. Finally got in on an empty weekday and I wish I could say it was worth the wait. First the place was not clean. There was debris on the counter and the floor. Second, the man behind the counter was mid text when I walked in and didn't acknowledge me forms few moments. The other woman behind the counter seemed gimpy too. I got a slushy which was 95% syrup. It was inedible and I ended up tossing it after two scoops. I wish I could make New Orleans Snowballs happen but it just ain't gonna happen."
11/11/2015,20151111,4,4.5,Good place for snowcones. You get a good deal for $3- up to 3 flavors and for $1 extra you can get icecream or condensed milk. They also sell funnel cakes- I will be going back sometime soon to get one.
12/2/2015,20151202,5,4.51,Man this place is amazing. I like the cotton candy snocone. Not to mention the funnel cake with Ice cream. Someone pray for me I can't afford to eat that many carbs.
12/10/2015,20151210,5,4.51,"Snoballs and Funnel Cakes are Awesome!!! Kiwi and Pina Colada, N.O. Style is the best."
12/14/2015,20151214,4,4.51,"Love this place great funnel cakes and they aren't skimpy well cooked great taste...Believe me I have tasted some bad funnel cakes. This place Is amongst the best I have tasted. The snowballs are great many different flavors so can't go wrong. Customer service is usually pretty good, makes it an even better experience."
12/22/2015,20151222,5,4.51,Found this place while on the way to a Galaxy game and we were happy we made the stop. The parking can be a bit of a pain but the dessert is worth it. Service was great also as they were packed and still provided service with a smile.
1/9/2016,20160109,5,4.52,went with my family and gotten the funnel cake it was amazing no matter if it chocolate strawberry or cinnamon this place is pretty awesome. i would recommend this place to try out for your self. also the guy pretty nice and awesome too.
3/6/2016,20160306,5,4.52,"Literally can go here every few days!!Yummy, yummy!! Alot of flavors to choose from and I have tried quite a few! Ice cream is delicious too:)"
3/24/2016,20160324,3,4.51,"This review is based on the service and not the product. The shop is clean, open and decorated with a New Orleans theme. Definitely a young vibe about it..There were 2 workers behind the counter and they had the music blasting, so the manager was away or these kids owned the spot. Right away the delicious aroma of funnel cake draws you in. BUT the service was lacking. Got 2 small shaved ice cups, which consisted of 3 flavors/ice cream & condensed milk. My boyfriend got his in like 3 minutes, but i waited almost 15 mins for mine. I watched them make at least 2 other cups..but there was nobody else there but us! Are you guys making your own treats while i stand here watching you lip sing my favorite 112 song?"

5/27/2016,20160527,5,4.5,Great funnel cakes with out the theme park price nor lines.. They have many toppings and everything is fresh made to the order!!!

5/31/2016,20160531,5,4.51,"I love the funnel cakes. They remind me of the ones I used to get a Magic Mountain, only closer and better. If you are eating there or stay close by, get the ice cream on top. The combination of hot and cold is like a party in your mouth. The snowballs are also good. I like to get peach, pineapple, and kiwi. Not only does it taste good but it looks pretty too. Im here almost every week. A must try."

6/20/2016,20160620,4,4.5,Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. Everything was amazing. I got a funnel cake to share with my boyfriend and we each got a sno cone. The funnel cake was superb and freshly made. The only complaint is the parking. It's a tiny lot with about 5 other businesses and the parking isn't sufficient for all the people coming. But other than that you all should come and try this place :)
7/23/2016,20160723,5,4.5,"Great way to beat the heat! If you grew up loving cream soda, the Root Beer and Vanilla Snoball will take you back to childhood. Great service, yummy flavors!"
8/1/2016,20160801,4,4.5,"Love this place! The young people who work there are awesome! I would have given them 5 stars, but this is the second time that I ordered shaved ice WITH ice cream, and it wasn't in the cup!!! Could have gone back, but didn't know until I got home and to the bottom of the cup."
8/3/2016,20160803,5,4.5,"If you're from one of the three hills you know about this amazing place! The lines can be a bit cray but the product you get in return makes it worth your while. They have one of the largest array of snow cone flavors I've ever laid eyes on before, and this place is the only place I've ever been to where they will add ice cream as well as condensed milk to your cone. We started coming here years ago when they first opened and I'm so happy to see that their still open when I make my trips back home. Totally come check it out :)"
8/14/2016,20160814,5,4.51,"Delicious. A must have. You must try the Snowball New Orlean Style which includes homemade ice cream with your option of the ice cream being placed on the bottom, middle or top. Don't forget to add the Condense milk."
8/21/2016,20160821,5,4.51,"Yummy good and so addictive. Passed by this place for years, finally tried it. Snoballs are the bomb."
9/1/2016,20160901,5,4.52,"This is a cute spot off Slauson and Overhill Dr. Very friendly staff, made us feel welcomed. We had several questions about the menu and flavors. We didn't get his name but he was very helpful and stopped me from making the wrong flavor choice combination. I ordered the New Orleans style snoball, which is vanilla ice cream topped with 3 flavors of a snoballs. It was amazing! I definitely recommend it. Next time I'll get a funnel cake."
9/3/2016,20160903,3,4.5,"A small independent shop offering ice cream, funnel cakes, and snoballs that can be topped with up to three flavors. Had the bahama mama, margarita, and strawberry daiquiri syrups. Ordered the ""New Orleans"" style snoball. The red syrups used over powered the dessert but the vanilla ice cream in the center was a nice contrast.  Would try the funnel cake if I returned."
9/14/2016,20160914,5,4.51,"Snoballs.... it's not shaved iced or snow cones. It's better!!! Located right on the corner and set up as a walk in joint. I used to live down the street and loved coming here. The portion size is huge and there are so many flavors to choose from. You can also add condensed milk on the top to give it some extra sweetness!!! They also have funnel cakes, which I have yet to try but if I'm ever in the neighborhood I will be sure to stop by!This place is perfect if you aren't in the mood for paletas and want something for those hot California days!"
9/23/2016,20160923,5,4.51,My fave spot in LA. They really know how to make a Sno cone!
9/29/2016,20160929,5,4.52,This place has Awesome funnel cakes and snowballs that comes in like 50 flavors!! The ice cream that comes on tip is outrageously good. Like where else in LA can you find that?! Recommend you try the snowball with milk that takes you to a totally new flavor level. Its a very convienent location and i come here at least one a month!!
10/9/2016,20161009,2,4.5,"I LOVE this place!! When I'm craving sweets this is my go to unfortunately after what I saw today I may have to re-evaluate my life on this one. I'm kinda OCD when it comes to sanitation. Please keep it clean, the first thing Im looking for when I'm buying food out is , are they clean ? No reason why this place should be a mess like that. And how are you handling money with the same gloves used to make people's funnel cakes and snoballs??!! That's f*cking disgusting!! Only one guy had on gloves there were 2 guys working . The other guy didn't have any gloves on while preparing people's snoballs/ funnel cakes . In the middle of making a snoball cup he took his shirt and wiped his nose and face from sweat ((OMG GROSS )) and went back to making the snoball without washing his hands . That's how businesses get sued . Tighten up on your sanitation. I'm sooooooo disgusted. Idc how many times you have to wash your hands customers appreciate cleanliness. I damn sure wouldn't appreciate your sweat in my cup! And customer service is a major key to business you all could be more professional and enthusiastic."
10/10/2016,20161010,5,4.5,Yummmmm. I went yesterday for the first time. The two guys working were extremely nice & they moved fast. I got vanilla with condensed milk. I was hoping it taste like the ones you get from the elote man & it taste better. I will definitely be back.
10/25/2016,20161025,5,4.5,This is a nice small place they move very quickly and it's right every single time. They almost. Ever make mistakes and this place is great anytime of year.
11/22/2016,20161122,4,4.5,"I always see this spot on the corner of Slauson and Overhill Dr, and always wondered what they sell. So today after I came out of school, I decided to stop by. It's a small shop, but they sell funnel cakes, shaved ice (with many flavors), & old fashioned ice cream. I got a strawberry with lemon lime shaved ice (the medium for $4) and it was a pretty decent size for the prize. It was delicious, I also tried the old fashioned ice cream and that was amazing! The staff was nice as well. The only reason I gave it a four star is because of parking, parking is somewhat small and tight but when it's not packed it's perfect to stop by and get yourself some sweet shaved ice or funnel cakes."
1/29/2017,20170129,3,4.49,"The product is delicious! Can't complain about that. Everything I've tried is good. However, the staff working there is no bueno. Usually they're rude and seems like they don't want to attend you. Last time I went, it seems like the Packers fan was trying to dissuade me from buying a funnel cake. He was like ""it's gonna take a long time"" as if he really didn't want to make it. Are you serious, man? I'm only ordering one! I made him make it and it was delicious! I recommend the funnel cake! But, like I said, customer service is terrible here. Wish the owner would be more selective about who he hires. Otherwise, great place!"
2/8/2017,20170208,5,4.49,"I love Snoballs, I prefer it over ice cream or frozen yogurt. The prices are good and the actual snoball is good as well. This place can definitely get crowded in the on hot days but I've never had to wait long."
3/11/2017,20170311,5,4.5,"Located in the same parking lot as Orleans and York, you would think they would probably serve beignets or something, but no, they serve funnel cake and snow balls, and they are absolutely delicious. My girlfriend craves them often, so we indulge occasionally. If you've never tried it don't hesitate, they are legit."
3/15/2017,20170315,5,4.5,"Snowballs done right! Slushy syrupy goodness all the way through! Get it New Orleans style (with ice cream) for a lip-smacking treat. First time here and I have to say this was the absolute BEST snowball I've ever had! I got mine with ice cream in the middle (you can choose top, bottom, or middle) and since I love all things cherry, I got Black Cherry, Sour Cherry, and Cherry. It was MESSY and perfectly sweet and tart down to the last slurp. They take a while making the snowballs, but the smell of warm, fresh funnel cake made the wait worthwhile as I sat there, sooo tempted to get one, but I try not to mess with those.  Cool little spot with endless flavors. You can choose 3 flavors or get them all (I think that would be a little intense). Glad I finally tried this place after years of driving past it! Can't wait to return."
4/16/2017,20170416,5,4.5,I'm from New Orleans and this is the closest you're gonna get to a real New Orleans snoball in Los Angeles. Get it with condensed milk on top to be legit. I just wish y'all had chocolate snowballs! That's my favorite and it's a New Orleans tradition... please add chocolate!!!
5/6/2017,20170506,4,4.5,One of my favorite spots for a cooling sugar rush! I love to try new snowballs New Orleans style (always) and the funnel cook is delicious too. Parking lot is dense and difficult /annoying to navigate but I have found that they are ALOT less crowded on the weekday (summer is a different ballgame). The place is super tiny and there is generally a wait but the product is worth it. I love that they are so successful so I'm always willing to wait. Black-owned is a super plus! Try it out and throw some condensed milk on that ice.
7/14/2017,20170714,4,4.5,"Nice spot to grab a cold snow cone on a hot day! The parking lot is small and hard to maneuver in so I parked on the street and walked over. Very basic establishment, a menu to order and a small bench in the corner to enjoy your cone. They have a nice selection of syrups. 4 different sizes and I find them to be a bit expensive for shaved ice, but I guess they need to make money some how. Someone in front of me grabbed a funnel cake and it smelled amazing, I will have to get one of those next time. Overall it's a nice cold treat on a hot day just wish it was slightly cheaper."
8/5/2017,20170805,5,4.5,This place is awesome! Snow cones and funnel cakes are on point! It's super affordable. Saved us a trip to knotts. The vibe is way cool. Employees have great energy. The music is great too. Mom and pop feel.
8/10/2017,20170810,5,4.5,What a treat!! On a warm day nothing is better than New Orleans Snoballs. The unique syrup flavors are over the top literally as well as deliciously. The hotter it gets outside the longer the line gets. But don't worry its worth the wait!
8/14/2017,20170814,5,4.51,Family owned business with authentic New Orleans style sno-balls! Prices are good for a nice treat and customer service is dope. The people always seem to be happy with their jobs. Must try. Oh and I heard the funnel cakes are bomb.
8/30/2017,20170830,5,4.51,very different! i enjoy the shaved ice over ice cream w/ assorted flavors for the shaved ice. they also have funnel cake... i died and gone to heaven!
9/6/2017,20170906,4,4.51,"The funnel cakes are great, but the staff is young and they are sometimes inattentive."
9/16/2017,20170916,5,4.51,"#EatHereOrNot#EATHEREI love this place. Let me say that again... I love this place!. I've been going here for almost 10 years now since they opened up. There weren't many shaved ice places in LA and this was the only one I could find at the time. Since it's local and not far I'll gladly go here whenever I need a sugar rush or want a snowball. They also make their snowballs in New Orleans style which means there will be a scoop of ice cream within your shaved ice. They also have the option of having condensed milk at it - which taste like ice cream but it's not.They have well over 20+ flavors for your shaved ice and you can at three for free included with any size the water (small, medium, large). The staff is always friendly and accommodating and there's a TV inside it's usually playing the most popular sports game. In the last few years they also introduced funnel cakes to their menu. Ultimately, this is both a grown-up and a kids heaven for ice cream at funnel cake desserts. I will gladly continue to come here as long as they are open :)#EatHereOrNot#EATHERE"
10/14/2017,20171014,5,4.51,Hands down one of the finest and authentic sno-ball places I've ever been too. I really like the variety is the flavors and the customer service. I literally drive 30-40 mins to buy one of their sno-balls and introduce it to anyone who's will to try it. One of my favorite places in Los Angeles.
10/22/2017,20171022,5,4.52,"I love a good iced dessert! The small with the 3 flavors allowed was great and more than big enough for me! I had banana, sour cherry (legitemitly had a sour tinge) and pear. We already want to go back and we just ate here yesterday! Friendly service and happy customers waiting and eating."
10/27/2017,20171027,2,4.5,"Good product, terrible customer service and employees. They could all benefit from some training. I get that this is a neighborhood staple but still...treat the customers with some respect. The way the employees speak and behave is absolutely ridiculous. The foul language, inappropriate jokes in the presence of the elderly and children? Unacceptable. Line out the door and playing around behind the counter, while talking mess about customers. WE CAN SEE AND HEAR YOU! It's clear they don't take pride in their job or themselves. I've never heard anyone say please or thank you, and they're always yelling at the customers. no customer service skills whatsoever. I know the people in the surrounding neighborhoods need jobs so I'm all for supporting community businesses, but they need to hire employees that value the business and it's customers. All business should be held to certain standards and SnoBalls misses the mark."

Only thing that's slightly close to this by my house is Rita's and it def is nothing close to this , so when I do go out there I live to go there :) lol . However , the customer service I experienced was very poor. Seems like the people that work there have preferences when it comes to customers and is a little too friendly and personal . One of the instagram famous chicks walked in there with her sidekick and they just completely started acting different and asked them what what they wanted out loud in front of dozens of people like me lol who were in line patiently waiting while they did not prioritize anything and continued to act like groupies. Not cool .... and if you guys have to show out that much for a bunch of d list people that walk in there , who can't give you 4-6 dollars for a snowball ...... re evaluate that life , business , and your friends lol they should pay top dollar for the snowey....."

They are always friendly, they remember a face if they see you again and treat you well. Not bad prices either. The snoball icees hit the spot! My favorite flavors are cotton candy, watermelon and blue raspberry :) Ohhhhh the funnel cakes are good too!!"

By the look on their faces I could tell they were ready to clean up and close for the day. Nevertheless there were a couple of ppl waiting for their order when we walked inside. The girl that took our order really lacked good customer service today. Little to no eye contact, low voice volume and seemed mentally distracted. I want to blame it on it being late in the day/ or close to the end of business hours. Anyway we waited about 7 or 8 minutes and our orders came out. I was satisfied with my funnel cake , no complaints there and the price is fair. Parking sucks , this business shares a small parking lot with 3 other businesses. So it becomes a hassle getting in and out , especially since it is on a really busy street. Haven't had a sno ball yet from here"

5/19/2018,20180519,5,4.42,GO!Omg! The New Orleans style snow ball is sooo good. I'm eating it as I type this review. The custard and the flavors - try the praline is more than worth my drive from Long Beach. Today there was only one guy working and it was packed. He was churning the orders out - much respect to him. The funnel cakes seem to be really popular here as well. But I'm not going there - I have hips to answer to.N.O. Snowball Co. blows Rita's out the water - my NJ & Philly peeps you know what I mean.There snowballs are like a wahdah ice.Thanks fellow yelpers for another great recommendation!Stay chill...

6/19/2018,20180619,5,4.45,This place is ohsogood!!!!! I usually come here after a long hike and or just when I want a sweet and savory snack. It's perfect for hot days and cold. They have so many flavors your taste buds will definitely love you. They also have funnel cakes can you say yummy!
7/1/2018,20180701,5,4.45,I love bringing my children to snowballs. We have been coming here for years. The autosphere is really nice and friendly. I highly recommend snowballs to everyone.
7/6/2018,20180706,5,4.45,nice people good vibes! been going here for sometime.. love them! and their items are soooo yummy!
7/8/2018,20180708,3,4.44,"I just visited this place for the first time, although the line was fast it was a 20 minute wait for two sno balls. They need to come up with a better system to get drinks out. They give numbers to those waiting for funnel cakes but not for drinks. You have to wait for your drink to be called. Also they should think about putting another ice shaver in on hot summer days when it's 100 degrees outside."
7/19/2018,20180719,5,4.45,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! It gets so crowded in the summer but well worth the wait. They offer so many flavors and ways to mix it up. With soft serve ice cream & funnel cake that's better than six flags you can't go wrong unless they run out in this heat!!!
7/20/2018,20180720,5,4.45,"BE A KID AGAIN!!!!This is the PERFECT thing to have on a hot day!! Took me back to being 7 years old getting a sno-cone...BUT WAAAAAY BETTER BECAUSE IT IS SHAVED ICE. It was my first time there and the girl making mine could see and feel my excitement, which made her happy. This is as close as you can come to an authentic New Orleans daiquiri experience without the alcohol."
7/21/2018,20180721,1,4.43,"i would never go back there again. they made me feel very uncomfortable! one of the guys that work there was bothering me....i had on some new jordans that came out that same day and the guy was like ""those been came out i got those like two weeks ago""....im like okkaayy.....mind u i was minding my own business waiting! he said a few other things and all the other workers were laughing. they were super unprofessional! i waited a long time for a funnel cake while i was being insulted! never again will they get my little change!"
8/17/2018,20180817,3,4.42,"Hot AF out about a week ago and we were working across the street from this blink-and-you'll-miss-it spot on Slauson. Some of the co-workers were coming back with colorful treats and we knew we had to get on over there ourselves. Next day at 11a, we walked on over and were the only ones in the place besides one guy. I had the small cherry and pear flavor, while a friend had raspberry with ice cream. Don't be deceived; the small was exactly what we needed and gave you more than you would think. I will say the 'red' flavors will leave your mouth guilty with color. Later in the day, the same friend returned and tried the 'wedding cake' flavor, which was basically colorless cherry so if you want to avoid that obvious color mouth-assuming you like cherry-go with this one. Downfall is the lines can become super-long, along with your wait time (a second employee was on according to friend on their 2nd visit) but it will be worth the wait."
8/29/2018,20180829,5,4.43,DELICIOUS FLAVORS. it's a small place. Dont expect to sit around. Just expect to enjoy your purchase. It will be amaazinnnggg
9/19/2018,20180919,5,4.43,"This place is absolutely fantastic, my best friend suggested that I come here when I visited her and I'm hooked. I had a snowball one week it was amazing, the ice was like snow and the flavors were super yummy and juicy(not watery like some places) The following week I returned and got another snowball and a funnel cake (I know I'm greedy) Let me tell you it was worth every calorie!!!! The funnel cake is freshly made I h whipped cream and strawberries and it was delicious!!!! The service is also great the front runners acknowledge your presence when you walk in, take your order while in line so the line goes pretty fast!!!! Anytime I return to Los Angeles I will definitely be making a stop there. Keep up the great work guys!!!"
9/24/2018,20180924,2,4.41,"Lose the little eye rolling girls! Horrible attitudes while US the customers have to wait damn near 45minutes.And another thing, if you guys close at 7 don't be taking funnel cake orders past 6:30 then complaining about making the orders ... ain't nobody got time fa that."
10/12/2018,20181012,4,4.41,"Great shaved ice, and the variety of flavors is amazing. Limited sitting area so this spot is more of a to go place. They sell Funnel cakes which I did not try but they looked great."
12/26/2018,20181226,5,4.42,"We walk here frequently to get either just the shaved ice or my fave, banana & coconut with ice cream in the middle, my daughters and I love this place! When my family visits, they always want to go here and we sometimes splurge and get the delicious funnel cake. Lines may be long but we don't mind waiting. The young men who work here are always friendly, courteous, and fast!"
1/27/2019,20190127,3,4.41,"Still a cool place to stop for a sweet treat, but whomever owns this place needs to stop being cheap and get more help for the young man who is ALWAYS there. Today there was a line outside of the door and it was just him. This is not the first time this has happened, either. This places makes hella good money because it's rarely empty. Hire another p/t employee or something."
3/16/2019,20190316,2,4.39,"35 minutes for 2 snow cones.it's good if you have time to waste and no where to go..But honestly can u mess up a sno-cone Cleary the owner doesn't care, line out the door...one person on a Saturday afternoon....lol ..foolish how businesses are operated now."
3/17/2019,20190317,1,4.37,"No stars. This place was filthy.

The place was dirty inside and out..see pics"
3/18/2019,20190318,1,4.35,Dirty unswept sticky floors. Staff mumbles to customers. Staff talks about inappropriate things in front of customers. Loud rap music

Although I'm not usually a huge fan of shaved ice this place reaally hit the spot.. and apparently is super authentic to real New Orleans shaved ice!This place itself is like a large food stand, with jugs of brightly colored flavored syrup lining the edges of the ceiling. You'll see those flavors reflected on the menu- there are all sorts of shaved ice flavors that I never thought possible- egg custard, Mardi Gras cake, pear, strawberry cheesecake, etc. they also just sell soft serve and funnel cakes. I'm more of a creamy and rich dessert person so I tried the small shaved ice with egg custard syrup and Mardi Gras cake syrup and got it New Orleans style (stuffed with soft serve) AND condensed milk. LolGod it was sooo good. The flavors actually worked quite well together and my ice was delicious with the soft serve. The condensed milk might have been a bit extra, but I still liked it. :) Will def be back if I'm in the area!"
5/3/2019,20190503,5,4.37,Best funnel cake ever!!!!!! I got the regular one which has strawberries and whip cream but that was 10x more better than the ones I get in Dallas lol fast service too! I was only there for about 5 min
5/19/2019,20190519,5,4.37,"LOVE! Coming from New Orleans I usually stay away from any Cali business that's Louisiana, New Orleans, Cajun, creole or Mardi Gras themed as I have been heavily disappointed. But oh what a joy and treat that awaited me at this snowball shop. The ice is perfection and it melts in your mouth and their choices of flavors made me feel like I was at a neighborhood snowball stand in New Orleans during a hot summer day. I'm glad I found this spot and I've been back at least 5 times within a two week span (coming from studio city to the Slauson area )."
5/27/2019,20190527,5,4.37,"Love love love this place, sometimes when it's packed it can take a while to receive items but only because it's one person working but always always love coming here when I'm in the area so I never mindThe shaved ice New Orleans style is so yummy"

But it probably had something to do with them grooving to their music. So many options and such a warm atmosphere.

8/25/2019,20190825,3,4.39,Great snowballs! But yesterday I was there with my 5 year old grandson waiting in a long line with only one female making snowballs while two men hung out both inside and outside. One guy was going in and out getting a brown bag from the inside and pouring it into a cup (alcohol??) on the premises. The other guy and the female got into some sort of disagreement and the guy went over picked up a handful of ice and smashed it in the females face. She angrily started screaming that her eyelashes were going to come off then she threw the cone shaper at the guy sitting in the lobby area and yelled some unpleasantries. Just sad for the unprofessional behavior and disrespect of women and customers.
8/25/2019,20190825,3,4.39,Loved the Snoballs but was highly upset when we couldn't order funnel cake thanks to a call out smh employees must learn to stick together this caused for the guy to have to serve a long line of customers which made the wait longer and after while ppl started to leave. We were there over 40mins just for slushy lord knows the man couldn't make any funnel cake on his own but hopefully the next time we stop by there's more than one worker

You would think by the 4th ""huh"" someone would turn the music down. Quite ridiculous. Their grade is posted as an ""A"" which is surprising given nobody wears a hair net. Dude shaving ice is constantly wiping his beard with no gloves on preparing your dessert. Quite unsanitary, sticky floors, and did I say the wait is too long? It's shaved ice, for God's sake!"

Dude shaving ice is constantly wiping his beard with no gloves on preparing your dessert. Quite unsanitary, sticky floors, and did I say the wait is too long? It's shaved ice, for God's sake!"
9/22/2019,20190922,2,4.34,"I figured since I didn't get a funnel cake at the fair that I could just get one from my community! I was Sadly mistaken, first I noticed filth and how unkept this place looked, then I noticed a couple flies but still I felt like the food will be great, but No! My funnel cake was Disgusting with all those topping. Honestly my actual funnel cake taste like it was made in Old unchanged Oil and the Ice cream taste spoiled. I won't be back"
9/23/2019,20190923,5,4.35,"One word.... AMAZING!!! I am so used to going all the way to Magic Mountain to get a decent funnel cake but this one right here... perfection. Get the funnel cake with cinnamon sugar, caramel, and ice cream."

12/5/2019,20191205,1,4.33,"My friend and I came and we were not even acknowledged, even though I walked up to the register. The guy also bent over to use his phone. Right! His dirty phone, without gloves or washing his hands. This is both unsanitary and unprofessional."
12/28/2019,20191228,5,4.34,"Its awesome the staff is always nice , pleasantly goofy & my Snowball is always good"

Warm feeling and mouth watering flavors rush through on your first mouth full. The place is hard to miss its right on the South/East corner of Slauson and Overhill. When ever I feel that funnel cake craving this is where it's at."

2/17/2020,20200217,1,4.31,"Here for snoball for thr holiday break. The line is out the door- so business is flourishing. Unfortunately, they do not have enough staff to respond to their demand. There is one guy talking the momey and simultaneously making the food. This is a health code violation and very unsanitary. His brother is there on the phone and sitting on the freezer where I presume food is being store. This on top of loud music turned me off. Do better! We are all we got."
5/20/2020,20200520,1,4.3,"Terrible customer service. I came in with my sister which apparently the owner knows, but doesn't negate the lack of customer service. Its unprofessional to not greet customers. ITs unprofessional to use slang towards customers whoo don't know you. What really made me turn around and leave was when my sister asked me what I wanted and I said 'I don't know' he tried to be cute and say 'you better know than'. Excuse me? I don't know you. And I don't understand why u the customer have to put up with unprofessional behavior. On top of the fact that their employee is outside in booty shorts talkin to her boyfriend on the phone. This place Is a joke. Glad I saved my money. Trash!"
5/22/2020,20200522,5,4.3,Love love loveeeeeeee i feel like family when i come in and it's always worth it ! My favorite is yes the snoball and ice cream so worth the drive since i don't live in the city !
5/31/2020,20200531,5,4.3,"The best snow balls in LA. Lines be a little long but, it's so worth the wait. Can't recall the guy that's there all the time but he has a really great personality, always smiling and has the best attitude !"
5/31/2020,20200531,1,4.29,Horrible service. Would not serve me and a group of friends at 5:36pm because they closed at 6 due to this curfew. It takes 1 minute to melt ice and put flavoring inside. I have been a loyal customer for many years and I am in an uproar about this situation. Jason yelled at us and cursed us in front of my daughter who wanted snoballs badly. I would not recommend this place and I will not be back!
6/1/2020,20200601,5,4.29,"By far, the best ice cream west of the 110 and south of the 10!!I'm aware New Orleans Snoballs is known for their snoballs but their ice cream is just as good (or better). If you lived in LA in the 80s, you've heard of Quick N' Split. Their ice cream was legendary and I swear Snoball tastes just as good. The line can get pretty long but it's worth the wait. Remember, ""Good things come to those who wait"".  The staff is always upbeat and friendly which makes the wait a little easier. Try it out, along with a funnel cake. Yummy"
6/5/2020,20200605,1,4.28,"Horrible Customer Service. The guy is on the phone making the shaved iced, while another Is lollygagging. If you plan on coming here; just know it's a HANGOUT SPOT. You have to wait a HOUR, no joke, 30-60 minutes for a shaved ice. There were 3 people in front of me, the line was not wrapped around the corner. They are slow and unprofessional, only used to come here to a support black business but not to this deficit. They need to hire new people, if they want to keep their clientele."
6/6/2020,20200606,1,4.26,I went into this place on 6/6/20 and the employees have horrible attitudes! I would've gave zero stars if I could have! I hadn't been here in years! The last time I was here the employees were much nicer! It's sad that while trying to support businesses in our community you are subjected to such bad attitudes!
6/15/2020,20200615,1,4.25,"I am SnoBall right now, and the 2 employees said they ran out of ice cream and oil to make the funnel cake! They close in 45 minutes, they just don't want to make anything, they are lazy employees! I will never return here! I literally saw about 15 customers leave"
6/17/2020,20200617,5,4.25,"The best funnel cake on the westside. Fast service and excellent customer service. We will definitely return in the future. Not only is the funnel cake delicious, I enjoyed some soft vanilla ice cream on the side. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are more than plentiful."
6/21/2020,20200621,5,4.25,"On a little corner on Slauson, is what I call The Vegan Square ... you might know it as New Orleans Square. These sno balls take me back to cooling down in Nola's hot humid summer. They have the PERFECT amount of fluffiness to be a true sno ball. Yes, you might need to be patient, but the line is all worth it! Bring the munchies! #aVeganAndHer"
6/21/2020,20200621,5,4.26,Came here for the first time and loved everything we tried. It was busy but the line moved really quick. The staff was working hard & fast taking care of everything. It was clean and well managed w/ stickers on the ground for social distancing. No seats inside but benches outside.
7/8/2020,20200708,4,4.25,I came on July 7th and purchased a Snowball and Funnel Cake. Everything was delicious! The only downside was customer service...there really was none. Would go again because it was delicious!
7/20/2020,20200720,5,4.26,Best spot ever. The sno balls are so soft and fluffy. This place will NEVER disappoint
8/16/2020,20200816,5,4.26,Had a long line but the gentleman behind the counter was so nice that he made it worth the wait. The staff is super friendly. The snocones were YUMMY!
8/19/2020,20200819,5,4.26,FINALLY MADE IT!!! It feel so good not having to go to a theme park for a real funnel cake with all the fixings. It was fresh and so delicious ! Customer service was on point and professional. The employee was working by himself and he handled it well! Def will be going
8/24/2020,20200824,5,4.27,Love this place!!! I go every time I ride out to the city! I love to see the younger generation working and being professional. Always a great experience when I come and the funnel cakes are amazing!
8/25/2020,20200825,1,4.25,"My boyfriend and I came her today and ""Tried"" to order their pink lemonade, strawberry and mango slushes and a strawberry cheesecake funnel cake. We waited for an hour and the man that took our order only gave us one slushy and told my boyfriend that he only charged him for one item when we specifically gave him three items that we wanted. It was really a waste of our time and a drive because we live in the east side of LA. Poor customer services, wouldn't come here again honestly."
8/27/2020,20200827,5,4.26,"The best sno cones!! Stuffed is the way to go. In Louisiana there is a sno cone stand on every corner and they are all delicious but not as good as this place. Not into sno cones, try the funnel cakes they are amazing. Plain is my favorite but they have strawberry, chocolate or whipped cream you can add as well. While the treats are wonderful the staff is even better. They can have a line around the building and you will still always receive service with a smile. You cannot tip when you use a credit card so make sure you bring a couple of bucks for the staff.... or hey owners maybe you can fix this and allow us to tip! The employees certainly earn it!"
9/9/2020,20200909,5,4.26,"Delightful! You can't go wrong here especially on a very hot day in Southern California. The prices are very reasonable and there are several flavors to select from and you can mix flavors. I selected Pina Colada and Pink Lemonade, both were good but I especially liked the Pink Lemonade. It's so soft and lush its like pillows of silky ice. Most of all, I do not like really sweet drinks, which is what I was expecting, it was not too sweet but its sweet enough that when the ice begins to melt it still tasty and refreshing. I will be coming more often."
9/14/2020,20200914,1,4.25,I gave them a star because even though the snowballs and their funnel cake was good the place is dirty inside and out 1 person working no help for cleaning messes he was doing it all they need to hire at least 2 people to help out the wait was at least 30 to 35 minutes before we can order
12/2/2020,20201202,4,4.24,"As a first timer, this is a great spot for a nice sweet treat. I would say if you want to support black-owned businesses & want a delicious sweet treat, this is the place to be! I got a small ($3.50) & honestly could have shared it with my boyfriend. I got strawberry & tropical punch (pretty standard & safe flavors). Originally I wanted pineapple too but they ran out of the syrup. If you like sweets but don't want too much, I'd recommend telling them light on the syrup. With the normal amount I had, it was majorly sweet & ended up drinking it using the straw a lot. The overall snow is really soft & easy to eat. It lost a star because of the cleanliness. It could be a bit better in the back area where the syrups are shelved. Other than that, we enjoyed the cup & would come back if we're in the area. Recommend!"
2/5/2021,20210205,5,4.25,"Best snow cones in LA. The flavor selection is perfect. If there is a flavor worth having, they have it. And unlike other shaved ice places in LA, the syrups they use actually taste good and not watered down. Don't waste time going to other places, it's as good as it looks in the pictures and you'll be glad you came."
4/26/2021,20210426,5,4.25,Amazing snowball AND funnel cakes. The ice isn't choppy and hard to melt like snow cones. The funnel cakes are always made fresh and taste fresh. I'll continue to drive 30 minutes just for this!
5/19/2021,20210519,5,4.25,Passed this place for years and one day we decided to stop and try it. The funnel cake is really good and freshly made and the sno-cones are very flavorful.
6/9/2021,20210609,2,4.24,Visited for the first time on Memorial Day great experience! Came back yesterday I can't say the same. My mom and I ordered 2 snowballs and a funnel cake I specifically said I wanted mine New Orleans style with the ice cream in the middle and still received just shaved ice. Then when we tell the cashier she says she never charged us for the ice cream when I specifically asked for it. So I'm holding the incorrect order in my hand for about 8 mins it starts melting and they charge us for the ice cream and put it on top of the melting shaved ice creating more of a mess instead of making me a whole new one the way I ordered it in the first place. Should be no excuses because they weren't even busy at the time.
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.25,Ordered a medium nectar and condensed milk Sno Ball. And it was amazing. I've had the same exact flavors and sno ball in New Orleans and let me tell you this is very similar. The flavors work so well together. Very rich and fruity at the same time. And goes really nice on a hot summer day. Highly recommend to others
7/3/2021,20210703,4,4.25,"I love this neat touch of new orleans..located in front of orleans and york,this place pumps out dozen of handcrafted orders per day from a huge variety of topings..definitely a must try spot"
8/3/2021,20210803,2,4.24,It's a hot summer day and they have only one person making snowballs and she's moving slow as a turtle. Several families in including ours left the line after waiting too long. One poor little boy cried because he was looking forward to having his icee. I hated to see it.
9/13/2021,20210913,1,4.22,They told me that Taking orders at the Moment but They took other people order it was a lady with hazel eyes she was rude and she was still taking people order never took mine
10/20/2021,20211020,1,4.21,"Ok, so this pains me but it needs to be said.. I have been going to this place for years and I send others. My daughter and I used to look forward to have a snowball every Sunday. The quality was good , the service was helpful and the prices were reasonable. I'm not sure what happened but after a couple years of living out of state one of my first cravings of home was one of these snowballs . To my disappointment everything has changed.. Not only has the price skyrocketed the quality plummeted. I paid 7 dollars for a cup of ice with a tsp of ice milk and syrup. The cost was 6.50 . I handed the young lady a 10 and she handed me 3 back saying (as she was closing the register and shrugging ""I don't have the 50 cents"" as she went to the next customer.. Mind you, this young woman made no attempt to ask me if it was ok or if I had the correct change.. she just jacked me for 50cent. If she does that all day to people that just say whatever can u imagine her tip jar... I'm not pressed for 50 cent but that's not a good look!! I won't go back. It may not matter to them but it matters to me!! Peace to all"
12/15/2021,20211215,5,4.21,"Excellent treats for the whole family. great staff, friendly service. clean and tidy. The snowballs were amazing and they have so many choices to choose from. I personally like them with ice cream in the center."
1/9/2022,20220109,1,4.2,"The guy behind the counter is horrendous: mask always under his chin, nasty attitude with that ""what da f^%* do you want"" glare, doesn't wear gloves, hands you your purchase sloppy, and slow for no reason. I KEEP COMING AND WALKING AWAY!! I've been in there 2 times before and he was complaining once loudly about having to work because someone didn't show up for work. I watched him take it out on his customer. Always rude, never smiles. I've decided to stop trying to patronize. Owner:Get rid of this dude. HeHas an attitude that screams cook at Denny's!!"
3/17/2022,20220317,3,4.2,"I love this place and have been coming here for years. I always get my snowball New Orleans style. But this time I was a little disappointed. After a about 6 to 8 sips from a medium, I was all out of flavoring. It was the 2 girls this time but usually I've always gone when the guys are there. They seem to be a bit more generous on the flavoring. Hadn't been here since pre pandemic and was really looking forward to it."
3/22/2022,20220322,5,4.2,Yummy!!! Had the polar express with and orange flavor bomb together:) perfect summer treat
4/8/2022,20220408,4,4.2,"It was 98 degrees in LA today. Without the heat warning, this spot was on my Yelp and todo list. I lost count of the flavors but you definitely will get your fill with any of the four possible size options. I opted for black cherry, daiquiri and polar punch. So good! Smooth, flavorful and refrePositioned on a corner lot right off of Slauson within a strip mall type prepare for a bit of a wait. Overall, we enjoyed our delicious snack right there and then headed to Leimert Park for some shopping."
