Mannn...!FYI, the owner is a celebrity pastry chef. She's been featured in Voyage LA.  If your looking for a professional pastry spot with a homemade taste, look no further!"

They've all been beautifully decorated, with just perfect cake to match. I am a huge fan! I'll keep making the trip from Pasadena, they are that good."
7/20/2018,5 star rating,I purchased 6 different flavors of cupcakes for my mom's surprise 88th birthday. We had over 100 guest. Hunnnnneeee when I tell you the guest were trying to get the ones who couldn't eat sweets to pick out a cupcake for them to have extra....it was a mad house. I had to hide some for the guest of honor...my mom. I am so thankful that I was referred to Jamilla. HER unique flavors of cupcakes far outweighed having 1 measly cake any day!.

7/5/2018,5 star rating,Sugah rush bar is out of this world. Her cupcakes are super moist and the flavors are divine. I ordered a variety pack of cupcakes and they didn't disappoint. A few weeks back I ordered cake pops for a graduation party.  I sent her the colors and she came up with a beautiful design. I would highly recommend this bakery for all your desert needs.
6/8/2018,5 star rating,"When it comes to cupcakes Sugah Rush Bar is in a class by itself!!! A dessert of this caliber comes around once in a lifetime and I'm so fortunate to have experienced these delightful treats. This establishment covers all the bases from selection to presentation.. First off you can choose from an assortment of flavors so I naturally selected some of my personal favorites like carrot cake and strawberry just to name a few. When I saw them and their packaging they looked to fancy to eat but of course that wouldn't stop me from sampling the proverbial forbidden fruit. I take a bite out of the carrot cake and I'm immediately blown away, I can practically imagine the chef mixing the ingredients and painstakingly crafting this succulent treat to perfection. The carrot cake was utter bliss I've never tasted something so moist and flavorful in all my life it practically melted in my mouth and it was topped off with cream cheese frosting ""what more can you ask for""? The Strawberry was the same way, simply exquisite in every sense of the word. Basically, there are no words to describe how delectable these desserts are you simply have to experience these life changing treats for yourself!!!"
