5/21/2022,5 star rating,"Oh My GOODNESS!  I was at EEEEEATSCON in Santa Monica at the Barker Hanger this afternoon when I saw this LONG line to something called Happy Ice! My friend told me she had to have some as it was DELICIOUS.  I was stuffed and did not want to eat anything else.  Since she drove I had to stand in line with her.  She also wanted to see if the owner was there as she's been trying to get in contact with him to see if they'd come to the City of Santa Monica's JUNETEENTH Celebration, on June 18th!  As my friend and her 10 year old son discussed what they were gonna have, I still wasn't gonna get anything.   As I watched the people in front of me eyes roll back in their heads as they dig in with their first bites, I was like okay maybe I'll get a small one.  Now I had to choose three flavors......choices!  I chose Watermelon/ Strawberry/ Mango. Let me tell you that the small isn't SMALL!  It's a pretty decent size serving.  I dug in and oh yeah my body started doing the happy dance.  This flavored frozen desert was DELICIOUS!  I was savoring EVERY bite.....As people were looking at me contemplating if they should get in the long line.  I told them don't sleep on this HEAVENLY HAPPY TREAT!  I told them the line moves quickly and it will be worth the wait!I hope they are coming to the Juneteenth celebration!  I can't wait to have some more!"
5/9/2022,5 star rating,"Happy Ice has the most delicious and original dessert/ice cream in Los Angeles. I got the Happy Ice Time Bomb - it's vegan ice cream and shaved ice or something like that. It's really refreshing and not super sweet. I heard there is a secret sauce for its delicious flavors. If you are on Melrose Ave, you have to stop in. The prices are reasonable, about $7 per cup - well worth it. Lemeir Mitchell's owner is a good guy and all about excellent customer satisfaction - being happy - putting smiles on faces. Lastly, I love the colors; it's bright and welcoming. It definitely deserves five stars. Enjoy peace/loveBe A Proud American"
4/17/2022,5 star rating,Absolutely love the inside of the store it's picture perfect and colorful. The girl at the window was super bubbly and very helpful when asked about flavors. The service was fast & easy. The happy ice is sizes are more then enough. My family and I got the regular which was beyond filling and the flavors we got were DELICIOUS. Highly recommend and it's black owned which we love.
6/1/2022,5 star rating,Awhhhh what a lovely dessert place. I randomly came across this place and I'm really happy I did! For $6/bowl there is a hefty amount of this... sorbet? Soft serve? Shave ice? I'm not even sure what this count as lol. It's almost like a soft but shaved icey kind of popsicle if you could imagine that kind of texture. I got the Founder which tasted like one of those rocket pops i reallyyyy liked it. My partner got the summertime and his was superrrr great too. I highly highly recommend giving this place a visit!
4/22/2022,5 star rating,"It's not often I'm on this side of town but it was time for my hair to be trimmed. I've visited the Happy Ice tuck in Compton before but never the actual store. Since I was already on Melrose I decided to walk over.  It was so cute and inviting, I got a regular time machine imagine a big stick popsicle in a cup  . Service was good and fast, there is about 2-3 small tables inside  where you could ""dine in"" per say but at the time of my visit they were occupied. I left Happy  as I strolled down Melrose scoping out new brunch spots I'd like to try and sight seeing with my cup of delicious Happy Ice."
6/13/2022,4 star rating,"A great refreshing treat on a hot day! The flavor combinations are great and surprisingly it is quite filling. Unless you are starving a regular size is plenty. Tried most of the flavors, cherry, mango, pineapple, lemon, blueberry and they are all great and pair well together. There is not really any seating so prepare to stand outside or walk with your treat."
6/1/2022,5 star rating,I treat my pregnant self to a delicious cup once a month when getting my nails done on melrose ! The staff is always happy and helpful because I always try to try a new flavor . KeepUp the great work
1/22/2022,5 star rating,"My kid singing "" happy ice happy ice "" the ENTIRE BIKE RIDE TO HAPPY ICE! Very annoying but she KNEW something I didn't. Philly water ice I've always wanted to try from watching parking wars on TV and hearing about it! Never did I imagine as we pulled up to the store front, that it would be my lucky day! People waiting outside for the place to open, yes ITS THAT POPULAR! Friendly staff, delicious water ice! Much needed in that particular stuffy too packed full of people neighborhood. Just so happened to catch them Sunday at smorgasbord and the lineWas long. Brought a friend to their booth and made her buy one! The owner, my guy! Sooooo so friendly ! Thank you Lemeir for even wanting her opinion as judging by the line we all know your water ice ROCKS!!"
1/18/2022,5 star rating,"I am HOOOOKED!!!The ""ice cream"" is so yummy & the staff members are so friendly. We visited the stand at a DTLA weekend food festival event and they were the best ones there!!Can't wait to try their original locations & more flavors! So gooood!!!"
4/1/2022,5 star rating,They are presently in a food truck located in front of Avon's Market at Hacienda & Merced in West Covina. They have the best flavor combos. If you see my review today I highly recommend you try them out
3/10/2022,5 star rating,Great price for the serving size! Bright indoor seating area large enough for 5 people with some table tops outside. There's also a cool mural on the corner of happy ice that is certain to spark joy!
11/30/2021,5 star rating,"I am HOOKED on Happy Ice. I love their cherry and pineapple flavor. Actually, all the flavors are great! It's soft, sweet, refreshing and perfect for any time. Don't wait when it's hot. Happy Ice can be enjoyed at allllll times. I sound like a commercial selling their shaved ice, but it really IS good. It won't disappoint. Try it now! Prices are super reasonable, street parking is available, and the staff is SO kind! Support Black Owned!"
6/1/2022,5 star rating,So much better than I expected. Not your average shaved ice. At all. I just wish their website updated the truck locations! Though I'm probably saving a lot of money by not knowing.
5/20/2022,5 star rating,Absolutely delicious  and not too sugary. Mos def a Mommy dream for my 6 children dental health. My family is from Philly so this water ice didn't disappoint. Bringing my cousins when they get in town for these bomb flavors. Stay Blessed
8/9/2021,4 star rating,"Finally got to try Happy Ice... I was late to the game even though I had known about it for a while. We were around the Burbank area when we spotted the Happy Ice truck. They were out of most flavors by the time we got there. We went with 2 Time Machines (cherry, mango, pineapple) in medium. $5 each.It was good. Not as hard as an italian ice but more firm than a sorbet. You definitely have to eat it with a spoon. The spoon they provide is a color changing one. The flavors were good and distinct. They werent just colors to be colors. You could tell the flavors apart. I liked the cherry and pineapple more. The mango flavor wasnt as sweet as I'd like. It was a nice refreshing icy dessert treat. It wasnt as light as i thought. It kind of spoiled my appetite for dinner as we had it around 6pm. The medium was plenty for me. We hope to try the other flavors next time that were sold out. Strawberry and blueberry sound good. Service was friendly enough. We were the 2nd to last customers. Then they closed up the truck and left. They do take credit card payments."
9/18/2021,5 star rating,"Happy Ice is FABULOUS! They were parked outside of Ontario Mills mall, and let me tell you, their marketing person is a genius. The big, bright colored truck caught my eye right away. I didn't even want a treat but I had to have it!I LOVE shaved ice. If you've had Bahama Bucks I would compare the texture. Their flavors are bright and delicious. Very fruity and packed with flavor. The staff is very upbeat and fun! They totally match the vibe of their truck! Definitely give them a try, it's super fun for the kids too!"
7/23/2021,5 star rating,"If dessert in general doesn't make you happy, well you must be a soulless, mindless zombie wandering this planet. BUT there's one place that may be able to redeem you - Happy Ice. Oh a throwback to the elementary school days when Buongusto would bring its trailer for Italian ice to campus during lunch and after school. If I'm not mistaken, they closed down years ago and no longer have their ""trucks"" or trailers roaming around. But in recent years, there have been a number of shaved ice and ice-dessert shops and trucks popping up, mostly Hawai'ian style shaved ice, which, unless you're in Hawai'i, just don't meet the same mark as on the islands.Bring in Happy Ice, the popular shaved ice truck making its rounds through Los Angeles and Southern California. You are instantly met with some of the best hospitality and service from any place around. The joyful, fun, cheering staff interacting with anyone and everyone, simply spreading what their name entails - happiness!I went with what was popular but also the recommended for first timers - the Rainbow Rocket, a combination of every flavor on hand in one large cup! For about $6, you get a good size cup and I kid you not, the best shaved ice there is. This is just like the Italian shaved ice I remember as a kid, except, and sad to say, it isn't filled with all the food dyes and colors and artificial flavors (sad because as a kid that's what we were stuck with from the other trucks!).The menu is labeled as dairy free, fat free, and vegan, which is astounding and so hard to believe because although all the absence of those don't delineate from good food, it's amazing how this shaved ice is still so delicous!The ice is cold, fresh and refreshing, and the flavors are so real and delicious, you get hit with a little sweet, a little tart, some sour some light, between the watermelon and pineapple and coconut and lemon and everything!Happy Ice is a must when you're around it!"
8/29/2021,4 star rating,Came across their truck while stopping by Stonestown Mall and saw that they had a big crowd and how can you not give a place a try if it has a big crowd? We bother got their Rainbow Rocket and it was a great treat on a sunny day! We definitely should've just shared one because it was a pretty big serving but it was actually pretty good. Heard from another customer while we were in line explaining how it's like a 7 Eleven's slushee but 10x better which after trying it out I couldn't have explained it better. It wasn't like shaved ice but it wasn't like ice cream either it's that middle of the two!
9/14/2021,5 star rating,"Yama Hama, someone slap my mama!Happy Ice is my happy place and I visited it twice in two days.  It's flavorful, the colors are bright, the ice is soft and it makes me so happy.  The lines can be a bit long some days, but it's well worth it."
9/3/2021,3 star rating,There was a food truck in San Francisco Stonestown and there was a huge crowd around it. My friend and I thought it was ice cream so we went over since it was a sunny day. Once we were upfront we were confused if it was ice cream or shaved ice Overhead someone say it's a 7-11 Icee but 10x better and I can't agree any more than that. If you like a thicker Icee this is your place. It's not creamy like ice cream but not ice like shaved ice. It's an interesting in between.Wasn't really my thing. Don't see the appeal to it. Definitely should order 1 for 2 people. My friend and I only ate like half of it.
5/17/2022,1 star rating,"I love Happy Ice so much that i decided to get it for my daughters first Birthday. I'm totally disappointed in the service I've received when trying to order your buggy service! I started planning her party with plenty of time, on 04/21 I called for a quote accepted and signed the quote I was given. At that time the employee I was working with explained that they're getting a new system on 05/01 so he will call me after 05/01 to finalize my party buggy. As of 05/16 never received a call. I called the company and was quoted almost $500 more than originally, unfortunately the rep explained he cannot honor the original rate I was quoted even after reviewing the documents that were sent and signed! Totally disappointed!"
2/21/2022,5 star rating,This place is a hidden gem. The texture and flavor is like nothing else. they have physical store in melrose and food trucks all around town. Review of Happy Ice - youtube.com/watch?v=29vR…
6/9/2021,4 star rating,"Cute and colorful spot on Melrose with trendy shaved ice desserts. My friend and I both did the option to pick 3 flavors. I did Cherry, Mango, and Blueberry. My favorite one was the Blueberry, but I'd still recommend getting a mix of flavors to try a few and it looks fun ;) I thought the price was a little steep especially because the serving size was really big and I couldn't finish it. We got the smallest option they had too. Wish they had a smaller one that was cheaper."
5/18/2022,5 star rating,Actually SO GOOD. Portions are huge - you can definitely split it with another person (or get your own :)). I don't know how they make shaved ice so smooth (no chunky ice pieces or anything). The colors add to the fun of the whole experience.
12/8/2021,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. Great spot to go for a easy refreshing dessert. Amazing flavors and always friendly service. My son can't get enough of this place.. lowkey I'm the one always bringing it up to him. We would go all the time when they only had the food truck but loving the location now on Melrose. Keep it going!!
6/10/2022,1 star rating,"Went all around the plaza it said it was located and never found it, even went around the block a few times to see if I had missed it and nope. Nothing. If I could give 0 stars I would"
6/2/2021,5 star rating,"Definitely a place I would recommend! It's a fun ice cream spot that is thinly shaved ice cream with some amazing flavor combinations. I ordered rainbow rocket because it featured ALL the flavors so why not indulge right? I absolutely loved it! Reminded me of a big stick popsicle but in slushier form and with a ton of more flavor. As of now, they only allow one party to come in and order at a time, lucky for us there wasn't too many people so we got in & out pretty quick."
5/27/2022,5 star rating,Super yummy! Especially on a hot day where the cool icecream was perfect and not too creamy
6/26/2021,5 star rating,"How cute is this place? The shop name speaks for itself, for I was instantly sold with all the cute decor inside and the fun colors everywhere. It has tons of flavors and even color changing spoons based on the temperature! Come stop by for a refreshing treat:) --- Medium Rainbow Rocket ($5) // What a treat! The flavors brought me right back to my childhood, carnivals, and ice cream trucks. The texture was smooth and super refreshing and I'd definitely come back for this!"
12/21/2021,5 star rating,So good. Got the rainbow flavored. Definitely lives up to the hype. Next time will definitely try the soft serve with it but just the ice is really good too.
12/8/2021,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. Great spot to go for a easy refreshing dessert. Amazing flavors and always friendly service.

11/26/2021,5 star rating,"I received the watermelon and green apple slush. It was good, however I do agree with the reviews stating it's more watery than you would think it would be. Although this all comes down to one's preference if you like your things sweet or watered down, overall cashier was so kind and welcoming."
11/21/2021,5 star rating,OK. So right off the bat- 8 of my friends and I drove from Torrance to this place and it was SO. WORTH. IT. 1. The employees were all so polite and kind. Had such friendly personalities and it just felt welcoming and fun.2. The treats were just all delicious 3. Their soft served will question how it's not dairy and will make you want entire cup of just that stuff. 4. We were super loud in the store and the employees couldn't hear people trying to order and they handled us with so much kindness and we happily went outside knowing we were too loud but I appreciated how kind they were about us. I would happily come back there and I recommend it to anyone
11/7/2021,5 star rating,"My 12 year old spotted Happy Ice after a haircut in the area, it is now his treat of choice. Service is is friendly, ice is good and we're all happy:)"
11/7/2021,5 star rating,Delicious shaved ice! I loved the time machine mix it was perfect and the large container is so adorable!
10/13/2021,5 star rating,We love happy ice!! Beautiful delicious and the staff are SO friendly. We got Hawaiian ice rainbow with soft serve and tropical.
10/4/2021,4 star rating,"Ok, so I have to update my review. I've given Happy Ice some more visits now that it has the store front.After my recent visits, I have to say there are some better flavors. I really like the strawberry lemon and blueberry favors- they are not overpowering like the cherry one that really turned me off the first time and threw off the overall flavor in my opinion. They also have vanilla soft serve that you can add on top, making this somewhat of a gelati type of treat. I'm not sure what the soft serve is made from- it doesn't taste like typical soft serve, it's more fluffy and has a different flavor. It's good but different.I would recommend the smallest size for one adult. It's enough even though it looks small. The next biggest is a lot of ice, and I've always had trouble finishing the whole thing by myself. It may be a great size to share, or if you want a lot of ice. The staff are always friendly and quick, so 5 stars for them! The only reason I give 4 stars is because the flavors are still slightly syrupy tasting, but it's probably a matter of trying different flavors and seeing what you like. I would recommend checking it out!"
12/2/2019,3 star rating,"I was so excited to try this after seeing the Yelp reviews. However, the treat didn't live up to its hype in my opinion.I want to love Happy Ice, I really do. It definitely would be nice to have a frozen ice place around that is spectacular.The ice comes in several flavors. It isn't mentioned on the menu anywhere that I saw, but if you get one flavor, you can mix it with up to 3 for the same price. The Rainbow Rocket flavor includes all flavors but you can ask them to leave some out if you don't want them included.The ice was certainly not bland- it was actually very flavorful; so flavorful in fact that it tasted like the super sugary syrup flavors that are very fake tasting. The cherry tastes like medicine cherry. The only flavor I would maybe get if I ever go again was the strawberry. The consistency seemed smooth, but not as smooth as the reviews made it sound like it was. It was in between hard flavored ice and a slurpy, closer to a slurpy. It had some hard ice chunks in it though.My partner was also not impressed. We were both excited to try it, but were not enthusiastic to keep eating our happy ice treats after a few bites.There is a place with gelatis and Italian ice that's not near this, but in town, that is much better. The reviews don't do it justice. I was hoping this place was like it, but it just doesn't compare. Overall thoughts on Happy Ice: overrated but good if you are in the mood for frozen ice and this is the only place close by"
9/23/2021,4 star rating,"I was finally able to taste Happy Ice after going to two places the truck said they'd be and weren't (hence the review is short a star). I decided to just go to the physical location on Melrose and I'm glad that I did. I got the time machine with Strawberry instead of Cherry because they were out of Cherry (and apologized for the inconvenience). The customer service was really good and I appreciated that especially after running out gas and wasting time with the trucks. To me, the time machine tasted like the old school missile popsicle from the Ice Cream when you were little."
1/25/2022,5 star rating,"soooo  my favorite flavor is the strawberry lemon lush, but honestly you can't go wrong with anything from happy ice! their location is super convenient but also you can find their truck out and about in convenient areas as well! it's vegan but taste incredibly, you would never guess that it's vegan at all! I love it because it's very old-school East Coast Italian ice so it doesn't melt quickly and is incredibly delicious!"
2/20/2022,1 star rating,"I love going to this place until today. I always get a large and they usually pack it. This is what I get today. For $8.00, no longer worth the drive and hassle finding parking just to get this stingy serving."
2/7/2022,5 star rating,I usually don't care for shaved ice but this is by far the best I've tasted. We visited the food truck a few weeks ago and I'm already looking forward to taking my daughter for another treat. Highly addictive
7/2/2021,5 star rating,"Such a nice thing on a steamy day in Burbank. We love supporting black/POC owned businesses especially during a pandemic, it makes it so easy when the food is THAT GOOD. There was a little bit of a wait but there was only one person working the truck, our order still got to us pretty quickly considering that it was a big order. So worth it! So yummy and refreshing and perfect for summer. Can't wait to try all the flavors."
6/17/2021,5 star rating,"perfect for any day of the week! you're in la, it's now summer, definitely make your way to happy ice! absolutely worth the hype. it is vegan friendly :) i tend to go with rainbow rocket, as it is a combination of all the flavors they offer, but, you really can't go wrong with any choice. this will keep you cool on a hot day yet also pairs nicely as a dessert for any cold day! make a trip out of it, it is located on melrose so there are plenty of shops to visit! parking is fairly easy, just make sure you read the signs or parking meters and you'll be good.go to happy ice and you will be back for more!"
7/10/2021,5 star rating,"Love this place!!! I've been wanting to try it out for a while and it was well worth the wait!! I'm not sure who loved it more though... me or my toddler. We ordered the Rainbow Rocket, and it was super yummy and the perfect treat for a summer day. The staff is great! Not only did we get a big friendly welcome that put big smiles on our faces (practically unheard of in LA), but we love that they are still wearing masks and enforcing social distancing with only one party inside at a time. I can't wait to return!"
2/10/2022,5 star rating,"In terms of an ice shop, this place does it right. Not too many flavors where the choice is overwhelming but still plenty of options to mix and match! You can select three different flavors and blend them together. Mine was incredibly flavorful and left me wanting more. I ordered strawberry, mango and pineapple. The prices are cheap and with either size you'll get more than enough ice for your money."
4/28/2021,3 star rating,"Before I start the review let me just say that the parking and getting the ice itself is a hassle. This shop is located on melrose a very busy street. When you order the ice cream you have to order inside and then wait outside for them to bring it out. Keep in mind it's going to be a wait. Unless you're lucky and happen to go when it's empty. Now with that being said, on to the actual product. Maybe I over hyped this in my head because of the Instagram videos but this failed to live up to my expectations. I ordered a mix of their sour ice flavors and cherry with the soft serve. The sour flavors such as the lemon and green apple were delicious the texture of the ice was soft and cold. But the cherry flavor tasted like a mix of cough syrup and food coloring. The soft serve was vegan, something I wasn't expecting not good but not entirely bad. More like you keep trying to eat it to see if you like like it. Overall definitely not the best place I've been to but not the worst."
3/31/2022,5 star rating,Wanted to grab a quick treat and decided to race up to Happy Ice before they closed. They had pre-made servings in the freezer ready to go and we were in and out within 5 minutes. The whole family loved it and my son declared it better than ice cream so I'm sure we will be coming back soon!
11/6/2020,5 star rating,"HAPPY ICE, HAPPY LIFE So happy that @happyice made it to Arizona & crossing my fingers that one day they open a spot in Az.  For now check them out in California! Make sure you try all of there amazing creation of flavors /combinations! Pictured are the ""All-Star"" ,""Rainbow Rocket"" & ""Time Machine"". Take a bite of these treats & you'll be in love & wanting more  . All Star & Time Machine are a must try!My Personal Favorite was definitely the All Star! It tastes just like a ""BombPop!"" The Time Machine definitely tasted like a ""Big Stick"" from the ice cream man! . If you can't decide which flavor definitely try the Rainbow Rocket!"
5/24/2021,3 star rating,"Melrose busy street, no parking since I was there on a weekend I had to wait a while I believe it could be faster but definitely employees take time to give you a good service. The first thing employee asked if we were there for first time so I found out that they sing a sing for the first time costumers. The ice is good, flavors are ok if I am in the area I will buy it again but nothing special not memorable. Was little disappointed because they have high reviews and I drove long way just to try it."
10/11/2020,5 star rating,"New favorite dessert place!! I got the medium rainbow rocket with soft serve, and it was more than what I'd ever imagined. The amalgamation of flavors was splendid, and I was able to make out the different flavors. The soft serve was also creamy and delectable. Very impressive how everything is vegan!! (and gluten free) The vibe inside the store is super fun and cheery, similar to that of Howlin Rays! Love the positive energies. Indeed HAPPY ice. This dessert is inspired by water ice, an iconic dessert from Philly. I'm super glad the owner decided to bring and share a piece of his childhood to Los Angeles! Thank you!The wait wasn't too bad, especially since there was a good amount of people. They bring your order for you on a tray, while you wait outside (only one party is allowed inside at a time to order). I was a bit thrown off and did not like it when they brought out my order with another party's order on the same tray. The other party got their order first and weren't wearing their masks properly (they took off their masks randomly in line and also didn't cover their noses). I don't want other people breathing on my food!!"
3/27/2021,2 star rating,"Came to visit the Happy Ice truck in Van Nuys... the ice cream was delicious although the guest experience wasn't the best! We were not greeted and the employee ""girl"" never made us seem welcome. We drove from Anaheim, CA! The experience was not the best or what I would expect from a food service truck."
9/13/2020,5 star rating,"The hype is real and it most def made me happy! This is seriously the best and most beautiful shaved ice out there. It tastes creamy and rich without being ice cream.It's such a fun treat, not overly heavy nor sweet. It was truly just right, straight Goldilocks ish right there.They have a food truck you can grabs the goods at, so check out their website to see where it's going to be. Get on that!"
9/22/2020,5 star rating,"It's all in the name of the shop - happy ice!Refreshing and tasty stop, especially if you're not looking for anything too heavy or filling. And if you are, there's always the option to add soft serve on top ;) Very reasonably priced as well. And has any one mentioned, it looks FANTASTIC!But the best part in my opinion? The happy service! I loved the spirit and attitude the employees had the moment I walked through the door, while taking my order, and after I left a tip! Support your local, Black-owned businesses, friends."
9/13/2020,5 star rating,"It's in the name. Happy Ice! Their truck and the ice are so eye-catching! We found Happy Ice on IG and decided to stop by, and we were not disappointed. They have so many delicious flavors. You can select 3 flavors, or you can have them all! We ordered Rainbow Rocket, which includes allllll the flavors and is gorgeoussss. Even with rainbow rocket, you can taste the individual flavors. The top scoop is more blended, but when you get deeper in the cup, there are sections of individual flavors. A large to share between 2 people was the perfect size. The ice is so smooth and not too sweet. You can even include a scoop of ice cream if you want a little more. They also give you color-changing spoons!!! Delicious, beautiful, well-priced, friendly service. They also support social distancing and require the use of masks. Just go already!"
5/20/2022,5 star rating,"I ordered the Happy Ice cooler for  a birthday party thinking it was going to be super hot that day and that it would go well with the other desserts. Talk about a hit!  Everyone was raving about the taste, look, flavors. I would totally recommend having a Happy Ice addition to any summer party. And, I popped the leftovers in my freezer and they totally stayed perfect!"
9/12/2020,5 star rating,"This is a review from #NOT4$ale626Not sure which one I got, but I tasted the rainbow! I haven't had this type of treat in a while... and I'm hooked! Loved how it wasn't too sweet, but there was still great flavor. It was reminiscent looking at my changing tongue color. Not only that, but the ice wasn't too solid so it easily melted in your mouth.Super awesome treat :) love love love!"
8/24/2020,5 star rating,"I am so happy I came across Happy Ice on Instagram. This place is perfect for kids, hot days or if you craving something cold and sweet! We tried the rainbow rocket & time machine (my fav!) both were delish. They have ""most popular"" but you can definitely customize your own with a variety of favors. Sizes and prizes are very reasonable S, M, L $4 $5 $6 Honestly a large can feed two people, but why not GO BIG! The staff is nice and very helpful! My son had so much fun interacting with them. During these covid times we need kind people, and they sure offer that with great customer service! Owner is from Philly and this is their trade! Thanks for bring it to LA! Store front has a fun design, also check out their wall art. Get there a little early. We arrived 30 min before opening, first in line! But once we ordered we noticed the line slowly wrapping around the building, don't worry it goes by fast!"
8/1/2021,4 star rating,"I came here on a Wednesday night. We celebrated my BFF's birthday with dessert at Happy Ice. I've had Happy Ice at least 5 times before at their food truck pop ups. They're Dairy Free, Fat Free, Nut Free, and Vegan Friendly. I've tried their Rainbow Rocket, All Star, and Time Machine. You can create your own order too but only up to three choices of the flavors. My favorite would have to be the All Star (Cherry Bomb, Blueberry Blast, and Lucky Lemon). The combo of flavors for Rainbow Rocket and Time Machine were good but not my favorite tastes in 1. It's frustrating how they have their soft serve advertised in almost every Instagram post, but they rarely have it on their trucks. I've been to their truck at least 5 times and no soft serve. Finally dropped by their HQ on Melrose and got their Vanilla soft serve with my All Star. My BFF created her own flavors and had the soft serve. The Vanilla Soft Serve is Oat Milk based. It tasted like birthday cake frosting but more rich and dense in flavor. The employees were super nice and friendly. This location has two small tables inside and some seating outside. People were coming and going . Line went by fast. If you're having a party, you can buy their Coolers that are priced/made for 30/40/50 people. I'm not sure if you need it delivered how they're going to do it or if they do it. You need to call and ask. I'll definitely be back for the soft serve. It tastes so good!"
9/20/2020,4 star rating,"I have been following Happy Ice on Instagram for a very long time because I really wanted to try their vegan friendly flavored ice and soft serve. The pictures they post looked amazing and the desserts always look so pretty. They happened to pop up with one of their food trucks in Long Beach during my time there. If you have any questions on instagram, in my experience, they do not respond to you at all. I have reached out to them several times. You would have to ask them right then and there if you get a chance to visit their food truck. The names to their mixtures are very creative. The one I got was called Time Machine which I believe had cherry, mango, and pineapple. The one I got my girlfriend was the Rainbow Rocket which had a mixture of all their flavors. Unfortunately, they had issues with their credit card device they said their soft serve machine was not working. They did not bother announcing it to everyone nor post it on their social media. People had to go up to order and then find out it was cash only. It was frustrating to some customers because a lot of us do not carry cash anymore. Overall, the person who took my order was really nice and patient. I thought both of what we ordered were good. Wish I got the chance to try their soft serve though. Hopefully they will go on tour again because they cancelled going to a location near me due to poor air quality."
8/16/2020,5 star rating,"Afraid that the lines would be crazy long over the weekend, I went on a Monday right before closing.  The strategy worked, only one party ahead of me.  A medium ($5) is plenty for one person, and you can choose up to 3 flavors (options are medium or large).  I went for the Rainbow, absolutely stunning looking & delicious.  You can taste so many fruits.  The texture is less icy and more ice creamy.  It made me HAPPY.  I thought it would be a one- and-done thing, but I plan to go back to try other flavors.  The staff is welcoming.  Street parking is usually bad in the area, but I lucked out with a spot in the next block.  Just be patient and go during off hours."
7/18/2020,5 star rating,"First time at this business.  Heard about it thru a friend.   Looked it up on the gram. Visited during Covid19 no less.   A bit of a wait outside the building.   Loved the color changing spoons. Price: S $4, M $5, L $6Employees were nice and helpful. Nice and flavorful. Would definitely return again."
8/14/2020,4 star rating,"I've been here twice now, and I am most definitely a fan. Saw Happy Ice suggested on a list of cool treats for the summer and I figured going on a weekday afternoon would mean being able to get in and out. I got my quarant-teammate to come along and saw that Happy Ice had a small line out front. When we made it inside, the staff asked if we were first timers or happy campers and when we said it was our first time they made a pretty big cheer, and then I was told that I could pick up to three flavors. I ended up getting a mix of Strawberry Lemon/Pineapple/Sour Apple. On the way out I was given 'Happy Bucks' collect 7 and get a free one! After a short wait outside the ice came and it was sweet, fruity and light with a really smooth texture. The flavors came out in a mix with streaks of individual flavors throughout. I could taste the flavors one by one, which were all great-but that Sour Apple was tart and sweet, BUT the mixed portions created a combination of all three that was also its own unique thing.The second visit was just as friendly, except they didn't have any Happy Bucks to give out."
2/12/2022,5 star rating,"My wife and I are from Philly and moved to LA in summer 2020. But, summer 2021 is when we found this place with the nice colors! Went inside and it's ""water ice."" I said, ""water ice?!! The owner is from Philly, right?!!"" The cashier: ""yes!"" Ahhh, a fellow Philadelphia-turned Angeleno is refreshing, but not as refreshing as the delicious water ice! We got the vegan ice cream on top, which is a game changer. Listen, whether you're from Philly or LA, Chicago or Santiago, DR, go to Happy Ice! You won't regret it!"
1/11/2021,5 star rating,Happy period should be my review.  This company lives up to its name.  My family and I were able to experience the happiness on a Saturday night here in our town West Covina.  There was a line but that was expected.  Ordering was pretty clear cut.  Reasonable prices as well medium is 5 bucks and large is 6.  My wife and I shared a time machine.  Let me tell you I was taken back in time when I tasted this flavor. Suddenly I'm back in elementary school buying a big stick for 25 cents after school.  Man that's what this time machine taste like!  It was really good!  The flavors make your taste buds happy.  I'll try this place out again for sure when in the area or I'll just take a drive to the brick and mortar in LA.  Have a happy day!
7/3/2020,5 star rating,"Love love love! The staff is friendly and they get VERY excited for new customers! They have a little saying when you're new and then introduce how it works as far as ordering, which flavors are left and the sizing. Today they were out of Pineapple and Watermelon. My 5 year old got cherry and lemon - refreshing combo & delicious! She loved it! My 7 year old got strawberry/banana and blueberry - perfect combo for my picky eater! I got mango, strawberry & lemon - wow amazing, so light, not over sweet and perfect for a hot summer day! Totally worth the hour drive to get here! Plenty of parking in front and side street. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back for more!"
9/23/2021,4 star rating,"I was finally able to taste Happy Ice after going to two places the truck said they'd be and weren't (hence the review is short a star). I decided to just go to the physical location on Melrose and I'm glad that I did. I got the time machine with Strawberry instead of Cherry because they were out of Cherry (and apologized for the inconvenience). The customer service was really good and I appreciated that especially after running out gas and wasting time with the trucks. To me, the time machine tasted like the old school missile popsicle from the Ice Cream when you were little."
1/18/2021,5 star rating,"Such great customer service and with my group of 5 they didn't take long to get in and out. I tried the rainbow flavor and it was the perfect choice for a first timer. I got to try each of the flavors and now I know when I return, I can make my own mix that's suits me.The consistency was like a frozen yogurt type of taste. It doesn't even taste like ice. My mind is blown!Cheers to a happy Monday filled w Happy Ice"

6/27/2020,5 star rating,"Happy Ice is a wonderful establishment that I hope continues to expand and grow in SoCal!Parking: at their main retail store there's street parking and meter parking available. Plenty of options there.Store: as of now, only one group is allowed inside due to covid restrictions. They've got stickers on the ground outside to show you where to stand while you wait outside which is very convenient.Customer service: amazing. Hands down why this place makes me want to come back again. Everyone is super friendly and approachable for questions!Quality: so great! Their spoons even change with temperature which is so cool and a nice touch. We had the rainbow combination ice and it was delicious. Overall: located in the heart of LA, happy ice is a top notch business. They've got one retail store and two mobile trucks and I look forward to seeing this place grow and expand!"

2/13/2021,4 star rating,"So I saw this place on another social media app, and always said I wanted to try it because the colors of their displayed ""Happy Ice"" was so vibrant.  I also passed it a few times but never stopped to try it until the other day. Cute little establishment, with a very polite girl behind the counter that excitedly walked me through my options on the menu. The storefront is very small, so there was a limit to the amount of people allowed in.I decided that the liklihood of me trying this place again would be slim, since I'm not big on ice cream, but after tasting the rainbow goodness that arrived in my cup, I may have to change my mind. Advice: cherry is a very overpowering flavor so if that really is not your thing, steer clear of that flavor.  The rest of the flavors mixed very well, and almost reminded me of old skool big sticks. Will likely return for a frosty summertime treat..."
6/24/2021,4 star rating,"My son had the rainbow rocket, he said it was really good, it's not as sweet as other places which is great! Pretty ok service, it's already premade, sitting in the freezer behind them."
6/13/2021,3 star rating,Strange experience. Waited 30 minutes. Menus were updated to show a few flavors sold out. Get to the front. Actually ALL but TWO flavors sold out so those are yours only two options. Fine. But at least tell the people waiting in line. I order the only two flavors and have them add soft serve on top. Soft serve runs out in the middle of the pour. So I got shorted in my order and the clerk even acknowledged it but I was STILL charged full price. Whole thing seemed like they were just trying to move their last bit of inventory for the night. I feel hustled and the people behind me probably got it worse.
6/28/2021,5 star rating,"So tasty! Super great customer service and quick! The flavors tasted super fresh and just the right amount of sweetness! Highly recommend the pineapple, mango, and cherry combination!"

8/14/2021,4 star rating,"So far my two favorite flavors are the mango madness, and the lucky lemon; I wanted to try all of the flavors but they didn't have the sour apple flavor as stated on their menu. I've tried 7 looking forward to trying the 8th (sour apple). BTW it was a food truck set up @ fashion valley."
2/12/2021,5 star rating,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!  I learned about Happy Ice from Instagram.  And I just so happened to be heading to LA for Labor Day weekend 2020 so I made sure to add a stop to my itinerary.  As most of us Southern CA residents know, September and October can be our warmest and most humid months.  That weekend it was in the 90's with east coast like humidity.  That did not stop me and my kiddos from waiting in line.  The line was slightly wrapped around the building when we got there but moved quickly.  The staff was very friendly and answered our questions...EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE....which is not the norm in SCAL.  Happy Ice was so worth the wait and reasonably priced.  We were lucky to be able to visit the retail store location but we also had the opportunity to go to one of their pop up food truck locations in San Diego, CA (more specifically Chula Vista) which is where we live.BOTH VISITS WERE A PERFECT 10!!!  Thank you Happy Ice!!"
6/20/2021,5 star rating,Was perfect!! Tasted refreshing after a hot day! The truck was in San Bernardino and it was very clean! The customer service was excellent! The flavors are great as well!
9/20/2020,5 star rating,This spot is crackin! In the heart of Melrose. The branding is dope. The fun rainbow colors is loud! The flavors are vegan! The service on point! I was very impressed with Happy Ice. It's so good in this current California heat. Nice and refreshing. I really enjoyed it. If you've never had water ice. It's a better version of shaved ice to me. It's pretty popular out east. Since we can't fly out there right now. Happy Ice is the perfect place to try it outRecommendation: Rainbow rocket
10/11/2020,1 star rating,"I was so excited to try this place but unfortunately, the terrible service made it so I couldn't. I walked up to the truck and there was no line, but a few people waiting for their orders. The two workers were making/scooping their orders, so I didn't mind that they never really paid me any mind and waited for a few minutes. After a few minutes, they were still prepping the orders, and the workers made eye contact with me multiple times, whispered to each other, without saying anything to me. About 10 minutes later, a group of people walk up and stand 2 feet to the left of me. The SECOND they arrive, the woman in the truck says, ""I'll be with you in one second!"" In a minute, she looks to me, then looks to them and calls them over and takes their order. Like I said, I really wanted to try this place, but there was clearly some reason all the employees were not taking my order, so I just left. I'm sure the water ice is good (I wouldn't know) but the customer service is awful."
11/29/2020,4 star rating,Finally got the chance to try the rainbow rocket and the flavors were literally INSANELY good !! The mix of all of the flavors complimented each other perfectly and gives the option to try several of their flavors at once. The only con to their ice I would say is the several thick ice chunks throughout the cup. Other philly ice brands out there have perfected this method to keep the ice chunks to a minimum but unfortunately this wasn't the case for my 2 cups of rainbow rocket.
8/21/2021,5 star rating,"My husband and I really enjoyed all the flavors and we can't stop thinking about this colorful place. We are from Santa Clarita and we hope to see more of your business expand to new locations throughout Los Angeles so we can enjoy more of your amazing flavors in the future.

10/19/2020,5 star rating,"A little taste of Philly in LA! Water ice was one of my favorite treats when visiting Chicago, NYC, and Philadelphia. I was hard-pressed to find any as good in Los Angeles or any at all for that matter. We're definitely more of a frozen yogurt town. Imagine my delight when this charming store graced my Instagram feed over the infamous summer of '20. It is pure perfection! There are flavor combinations to induce nostalgia in fellow 90's kids and plenty of make-your-own combinations to satisfy multiple tastes. The texture and temperature is spot on! I can't say enough about how delicious and satisfying their concoctions are. Even on a cold day, you'll find yourself experiencing immense pleasure. Don't skip it!"
8/16/2020,5 star rating,Best water ice on the west coast! So satisfying and refreshing no matter the temperature outside but it sure hits the spot when the sun is shining. The Time Traveler tasted just like the old 'Big Sticks' us 90's kids grew up on. Worth the wait!!! Hoping they open a shop in LBC soon.

9/19/2020,5 star rating,"I caught the last stop of the Happiness tour in Northridge, CA yesterday. Their customer service is excellent. When I said I was a first time customer everyone on the truck cheered and welcomed me. You could tell that everyone had a smile on their face, even behind their masks. They've mastered a blend of the smooth creamy consistency of ice cream with a light and refreshing icy finish. It's absolutely incredible. Enjoy flavors like strawberry lemon lush or blueberry blast. Or if you're feeling adventurous try their favorite combinations and add soft serve on top. There's something for everyone. I think this might be my new addiction because it was so delicious and I want to taste the other flavors,"
9/19/2020,3 star rating,"My family and I went to the Ontario, CA location on their tour today. We drove an hour because it's the closest location to us. We get there, proceeded to order and I was told that I couldn't use my card and they only take cash. I was bummed, but I understood. We left to get cash and came back. They took our order and we waited. As I'm waiting, I see that other customers were able to pay by card. Hmmmmm....I was just told they don't take card and to my dismay I see other customers paying by card. Anyway...I was going to order more for another family member, but they closed before 7pm even if they're supposed to be ""open"" 12-7p. Other customers were turned away too. Mind you, there's no official statement of policy that they stop taking orders before closing time? False advertisement. Even if it was their policy, have the decency to call out last order or place a sign visible enough to customers. It's just bad customer service. The one taking the orders just looked like she couldn't be bothered with anyone. ""It's the terrible customer service for me"".This was my family's first time trying this treat and we were soooo excited to try this. Now the Happy Ice itself was delicious and like none other ..BUT the customer service wasn't as sweet. The location was sketchy too btw. It was just a disappointing experience. I was about to leave a great tip before I left (even though I had the ""card"" issue), but they closed early. Oh well...."

There's no shaved ice place that's comparable to Happy Ice. The texture, the flavors (Rainbow Rocket is my favorite) everything is on point! The prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly. There's usually a line out the door even when it's scorching hot and there's no shade. My only complaint is that they should put canopy tents or something to create shade in the line area."

7/17/2020,5 star rating,"Happy Ice has apparently been super popular for quite a while, serving Philadelphia-style ice treats out of its roving trucks. Great news for folks in this area: they now have a bricks and mortar shop at 7324 Melrose!They have several fruity flavors to choose from at any time - think mango, cherry, watermelon, and others. Since I'm bad with commitment, I opted to try all of them at once via the ""world famous rainbow rocket,"" which is an colorfully and instaworthy psychedelic swirl. So many flavors bombarding the senses at once! A touch of ice cream added extra yummyness to the whole equation. The staffers here were super sweet and perky. It's like there are literally rainbows pouring out of this venue. And it's Black owned and operated! The world could sure use more places like this. Thanks Yelpers for yet another awesome find!"

If it gets too backed up there should be a last call for orders rule stating no more orders 30 mins before the closing time it's unprofessional for a business especially the lack of customer service! Sadly we had to settle with sonic slushies since my daughters hopes were crushed thanks ""happy"" ice‍"

11/26/2021,5 star rating,"I received the watermelon and green apple slush. It was good, however I do agree with the reviews stating it's more watery than you would think it would be. Although this all comes down to one's preference if you like your things sweet or watered down, overall cashier was so kind and welcoming."
8/23/2021,1 star rating,Saw the Happy Ice truck at Fashion Valley mall. After seeing people walk around with It I looked at the Happt Ice instagram and everyone else raving over Happy Ice so I was super super excited to try. I waited an hour in line and I was so sure it was worth it. Ended up so so disappointed... The flavoring is bad and I can taste dye more than the actual flavor. It is super artificial and not refreshing or good at all. It gave me a stomachache the rest of the day and I couldn't get the dye taste out of my mouth. The appearance of Happy Ice is more appealing than the taste and quality.
7/1/2020,4 star rating,"I loveeeee supporting black owned businesses!! Happy ice is a refreshing spot in a very high profile area. Been twice now, once when the line was insane and once when I could walk right on in. Idk what to tell you on how to avoid the line... but even at its worst it moves pretty darn quickly and it's a nice way to spend time w/ the homies. I think the best part is the soft serve topping. It's super creamy and not too sweet and it adds a lil 'umph' to the experience. All in all good ice flavors, just wish they were more flavorful. Being from the south where things are usually OD on sugar I expected it to be much sweeter than it is. Kind of like Italian/shaved ice from years of yore when you liked when your mouth turned purple. It's def a place I'd bring out of town guests whenever out of town guests are possible again. And will def electric slide on through again just to support one day soon. :)Oh! And don't forget your ice bucks! Collect 7 and you get future free happiness."

8/2/2020,5 star rating,"When happy ice can stop by Long Beach, I go there when I can. I was impressed by the ice cream when I saw them at the OC nightfare but with the summer coming in hot, there is where I go for my ice cream for a Sunday, if not the only ice cream I have in a week. I love their All Star flavor and I have yet to try it with soft serve. All of the staff are fun, energetic, and friendly."
8/14/2020,5 star rating,"There was a line outside since this place is kind of small. We were greeted with awesome energy from the employees and that made me even more excited to get this. We ordered 1 medium strawberry banana pineapple ice with a soft serve on top and 1 blueberry blast with watermelon lush ice. The soft serve tasted so good, I wanted to order it by itself on the side. Our ices were nice and flavor filled. The medium is their smallest size but we were both unable to finish them so it's possible for a medium to be shared with 2 people."

8/2/2020,5 star rating,"Finally made it to Happy Ice! Been planning to get here since I saw them on Fox news 11. Arrived around 3:00 p.m. on a Saturday and the line was around 25 deep.  Even though it was really hot and not much shade at all, we decided to stay especially have to be saw people walking by with their order looking so delicious.  The line moves pretty slow and we were in line for about 45 minutes. I believe most of that is due to the social distancing measures they have in place where only one customer is allowed in the store at a time, or two (or more) if you're together. The place is decorated with bright colors that just make you feel happy. Good choice of flavors. Staff very friendly and moving as fast as they could. Not sure if it would help to speed things up if they had an order taker on the outside going down the line, you know like they do at Chick-fil-A and other places. Anyhow it was so Worth The Wait!!!!! The flavor and texture were perfect!  It was so much better than a slushie or a snow cone. I'm so glad that I ordered the large because I was able to save some for the next day.  I will surely be back. I hope he can soon  expand his operation to the valley."

I honestly thought it was going to taste like a sugar bomb but it was just right. Good texture and richness from the soft serve. Small was big enough to share between two adults. Friendly staff and cool colorful decor.
7/8/2020,5 star rating,"This place is brand new and it already fits right into the neighborhood. Melrose Ave desperately needed more dessert spots, especially one that caters to vegans and those with common food allergies. Happy Ice is beyond just great iced based dessert. It's an incredible influence that last long after the positive customer service from when you order your treat and the savory moments when you finish it. If the soft serve option is available, it is worth the extra charge. The soft serve by itself will have you rethink your love for milk based ice cream for the rest of your life . Welcome to the neighborhood! Thanks for keeping us happy thru difficult times :)"

7/17/2020,5 star rating,"Amazing ice! I have been wanting to try it for a while, but I am never in the area where the truck parks. The new location allowed me to try it for the first time. The line was not bad we had 5 people ahead of us. It did not move fast so have patience, but keep in mind the location is small so most of the waiting will be outside. Parking is street parking which tends to be horrible on Melrose. We did not have a problem parking because of Covid most stores are still closed.  The employees were welcoming and excited. We ordered the rainbow ice and lemon ice. Cons: The line moves super slow for ice. Pros: delicious and great customer service. Well worth it!"
12/7/2020,5 star rating,"Can't say enough great things about this place! There's usually a line but there's a reason for that, and it's worth it! The line moves pretty fast too so you won't wait too long and the prices are very reasonable. They get you in and out quickly and everyone working there always seems to be happy working there. There's lots of flavor options so there's something for everyone! I believe there's only street parking so it can be a little difficult to find on the weekends but I've always been able to find a spot. JUST GO HERE!"
7/28/2021,1 star rating,"I was interested in getting a Happy Ice Cooler for a group, so I filled out the inquiry form on their website. The form says ""Our Catering and Events Team will contact you within 48 hours"" and my event was in 24 hours, so I wasn't even sure they'd be able to accommodate my short-notice request. A few days later I received an invoice in my email. This invoice was the first communication I received from the company -- no one from the Catering and Events Team ever contacted me. I replied to the invoice email saying that I'd submitted an inquiry but never placed an order, and got no response from the company. I have now received several follow-up email invoices. I had been looking forward to placing an order here for a group, but after this experience I will avoid doing business with them."
7/7/2021,1 star rating,"I love happy ice but through doordash I have been receiving horrible customer service . I tried to place an order through door dash twice in the row , both days it took them more then an hour to confirm my order which lead to door dash having to cancel my order and refund me . I tried calling the establishment too see what's the hold up was with my order , NO ANSWER, doordash couldn't even get in touch with them which was even more sad and unprofessional."
12/21/2021,5 star rating,So good. Got the rainbow flavored. Definitely lives up to the hype. Next time will definitely try the soft serve with it but just the ice is really good too.
7/15/2021,5 star rating,Delicious!  The medium size was perfect for my girls. We've followed Happy Ice for a year and were so excited to be in their neighborhood to try it. The staff was super friendly and helpful too.
10/12/2020,5 star rating,"LOVE LOVE LOVE Happy Ice. I've never had anything that tastes like happy ice. The ice has a texture of ice-cream/sorbet but gives you snow cone vibes; super unique. Also egg & dairy free so Vegan friendly! You can chose up to 3 flavors, or chose one of their specialty flavor combos like my favorite ""rainbow rocket""   which is all their flavors in one magical scoop. Along with their store fronts they have happy ice trucks! Check their Instagram @happyice to see where they will be each week!"
8/1/2021,5 star rating,Simply delicious!! My favorite flavors are the tropical flavors but each one is superb!! My wife and I visit this place frequently! It's definitely a must try for any LA foodie
4/2/2021,5 star rating,"Okay so this place has been on my LA eats bucket list for a while now and let me tell you it truly lived up to the expectations!! Not only were the water ice treats super instagrammable, but they were so delicious! It was kind of like a slushee... but a little firmer and without that weird carbonation effect that slushees always give off. To top it all off  (literally) there was their VEGAN soft serve. Holy WOW! It was some of the best soft serve (vegan or not) that I have ever had. Honestly I'd go back just for a cup of that alone! It's made with oat milk so it's a little grey looking, but as Lumière once said, ""try the grey stuff, it's delicious!"" Every flavor and texture about the treat as a whole blended together so seamlessly. Knowing that this place is a mere 10 minutes away from me is gonna be a serious problem for my diet The only minor downside to my visit was that I asked the cashier if I could get the medium size (they only have medium or large) put into a large cup since I knew they fill the cups past the rim and I would be driving back home so I wanted to make sure it didn't melt and end up making a mess in the car. The cashier informed me that even though I would be getting the amount of the medium size in the cup, I would need to pay for a large and that she was only going to fill the large up ""halfway."" Just seemed kinda silly to me to have to pay extra while receiving less product... Anyways, the taste alone is enough for me to go back, but maybe I'll just bring a large cup from home to dump it into instead next time."
10/3/2020,5 star rating,"I've been seeing this place alllll over my feed on Instagram and finally gave in! Everything about this place is awesome. They have premade options or you can make your own where you can choose from all sorts of flavors! It's inexpensive and great quality. My favorite was the strawberry, watermelon and cherry combo I put together, I got a large and let me tell you it was LARGE. I almost couldn't finish it because there was so much. The place itself is nice and clean, and they maintain proper social distancing. Overall this place is wonderful from the staff to the ice cream itself. The only rough part was the parking, other than that it's a must try!"
9/8/2020,5 star rating,"There are so many options,flavors.We tried a cherry and a strawberry lemon.Both were loaded with flavors.There is one called the rocket with a bit of everything..but we chose to keep the flavors simple and distinct..your call but however you choose uou csnt go wrong..perfect for these incredibly warm nights..be prepared for a wait as only one peron/couple at a time"
9/29/2020,5 star rating,Nicest people!Very nice size portions. Highly recommend. If you don't eat that much I recommend sharing ;)
10/12/2020,5 star rating,OK so I've never had an official brain freeze in my life let me tell you after eating this is pretty safe to say you could call me Mr. freeze but this is all worth it amazing
8/27/2020,5 star rating,I'm from Philadelphia home of water ice and believe me this is the real deal!!!! Not too sweet like syrup just perfect! I had the lemon which is white like it should be and cherry!!!! Yummy I'm going back ‍... the lines get long but really quick
11/14/2020,5 star rating,Absolutely love their ice cream every time we visit LA we make sure to stop before going home. Great customer service as well
6/27/2020,5 star rating,"This place is amazing !!! Despite the long line, they managed to keep the line moving and it was about 30min only  the energy once you get inside  love it !!!We will definitely be returning when we're back in town (we just moved and drove all the way from Montclair) thank you !!!"
9/14/2018,5 star rating,"Considering how often my boyfriend drags me to Melrose, I'm surprised neither have us have noticed this truck before.An amazing treat on one of LA's sweltering summer days. We shared a large (proved to be too large) for $6 and chose to get all the flavors (aptly named Rainbow Rocket). A satisfying texture that melts in your mouth immediately and leaves your tongue all different colors. My favorite flavors were the mango and pineapple. Next time I'd probably get less flavors. Can't wait for my next trip!"
8/25/2018,5 star rating,"Hidden GEM of desserts in LA!  A serious must try.  It's absolutely perfect for being located on Melrose Ave in the hub of LA's insta-spots.  This treat makes a great addition to any fun photo .Happy Ice is a hard-to-miss tie dyed truck located on Melrose and Fuller Ave. Check their Facebook or Instagram page before you head out to make sure they're open! They cater so there's a chance they may not be at their home location. $4 for a small, $5 for a medium, and $6 for a large. Each size comes with 3 different flavors and it's $0.50 for any additional flavors. They also serve stuffed pretzels!Their 'ice': if quality sorbet and shaved ice had a baby, you would get Happy Ice. It's SO smooth/creamy, I literally asked if there was any dairy in it to discover that they're Vegan friendly! I opted for a medium ice with strawberry/lemon, pineapple, and mango flavor. It looked like a piece of art and tasted just as good!  The lady that worked there let us try samples beforehand as well. SO good, this is my new go-to place to take out-of-towners :) the cherry on top of it all? The spoon changes colors when it touches the cold ice!! I saved mine to take home so I can enjoy other treats with it. Definitely go here, you won't regret it!"
9/11/2020,5 star rating,"Very good ice, not a fan of this vegan ice cream as it tastes heavily processed. I had the mango flavor but I think could get up to three flavors in one ice. If is super soft and taste really great . Definitely nice treat on Melrose. I'd like to ask if could add regular ice cream or condensed milk as topping"
8/1/2020,5 star rating,"Love their aesthetic, very fun colors! I get as much enjoyment looking at the shaved ice as I do eating it.Big thumbs up for the crew that works here, who are always super friendly, and for the dope merch that they sell in the store."
7/1/2020,5 star rating,"Awww Melrose....how I've missed the smell of incense & bunch of wierdos everywhere!!! It was nice to be back even just for half an hour to try the Best Ice Ever!!! Its so good you'll want to go back the next day!!! I'm sure any flavor you get is delicious-we tried the combination - Rainbow Rocket (no ice cream to keep it vegan)!!! There are also two other locations - sounds like a Summer Mission to go to those too!!! I scream, you scream, we all scream for HAPPY ICE!!!"
8/23/2020,5 star rating,"The water ice here is so tasty! I got the cotton candy, pineapple, and strawberry lemonade. It was so refreshing. The staff was also really friendly. I will definitely be back!"
3/31/2021,5 star rating,"Obsessed with Happy Ice! The ice is super good and the soft serve is even better! ALWAYS order your ice with soft serve! I've been to the melrose shop and to the truck in the Inglewood area and have had nice service each time. Love Happy Ice, will continue to be back for more!!"
6/25/2020,4 star rating,"Very cool theme, BLACK OWNED   and delicious flavors!! I thought it was very tasty stuff! I just like icecream better than ice, besides that it's a SOLID place for a sweet tree at! Definitely give it a shot!"
8/26/2020,5 star rating,"DELICIOUS AND WELL PRICEDDD. Treat yourself in this hot weather. Everyone is friendly as well. Love that. The location can be a bit dodgy depending on when you go - and by location I mean the main one on Melrose Avenue. Still, it's worth going. Will try one of their truck locations next!!"
11/27/2020,5 star rating,Me and my little family loved the Happy I've service and desert! The concept and creativity is out of this world. We will be back.
11/2/2020,5 star rating,"Just recently I went to go visit their pop up locations and I am already thinking of when I will be going back. I choose to create my own flavor instead of choosing from the three of their original flavors that they already had. Since I was able to pick up to 3 flavors, I went with watermelon, cherry and sour apple. Beware, the cherry stains your lips but it is worth it. It was not a long wait and staff was very friendly as well. I paid $5 for this regular serving but they do have a larger cup. The flavors were very bold but very yummy as well. Definitely coming back here!!"
10/7/2020,5 star rating,I love HAPPY ICE! I am a Vegas Local and happened to run into their truck when I was over in California. They came to Vegas on a tour and I went both days just to have some HAPPY ICE! Their flavors are immaculate!!!! I always tell everyone about them! You can't go wrong with whatever flavor you pick. It's super smooth. 10/10
9/26/2020,5 star rating,"You have to try this to understand what 'water ice' is.  It's like creamy ice cream, shaved ice, slurpee and gelato all rolled into one.  Loved our first experience!! Will definitely be returning."
5/10/2021,5 star rating,"Woah! I wanted a little dessert and oh my gosh am I glad that desire kicked in at that time. I stopped here and was so pleased! First off, the flavors available for the ice were just amazing. The taste was to die for. I would love to try all of them. But what was an unexpected surprise was the soft serve add on. This was literally the best vanilla soft serve I've ever had. You have to order with this add on to see for yourself. With a large only $6 the pricing is beyond reasonable. I will be back many times. Another great thing is that it's a black owned business. Didn't know but glad to hear. What a great addition to Melrose Avenue. Come check out a visually appealing storefront that will lift your mood before the friendly stand has a chance to. You will be back"
8/3/2020,5 star rating,It was bomb tasted just how I pictured heard about this place earlier today drove from Long Beach to Melrose to get some ... must try place
3/19/2021,5 star rating,"Love!! Perfect treat on a hot day. Sweet, soft ice. The texture is amazing. We have gone back a few times, parking situation in the area is a bit crazy, but it's LA so what do you expect? It's worth it though because it's so delicious and the staff is friendly."
8/7/2020,5 star rating,"Five stars WELL EARNED!I learned about Happy Ice first in an email from Infatuation LA. It is a Black-owned water ice business that started as a food truck and now has its own brick-and-mortar on Melrose. Gotta love the trendy vibes inside!No lie, the first time I had Happy Ice, I went twice in three days. I can't even exaggerate how good it is. It's fruity and refreshing, without being too filling or heavy. I love the Cherry, Blueberry, and Mango flavors and can't wait to try Pineapple (it was out when we went)! The combos of everything are tasty together!I want to say that you should definitely go here, but there's already always a line outside so if you don't, that's okay too. More for me!"
4/27/2021,4 star rating,Every time i visit LA im sure to stop by happy ice! The employees are always really nice and their flavors are just amazing! The only reason i would give it a 4 star is because every time i visit the mobile trucks they never have soft serve to put in top :(
9/10/2021,3 star rating,"This place is super cute inside and the girls were very friendly. I've been so looking forward to trying happy ice. They were out of cherry which was one of the flavors I wanted. The flavor of the ice was good but unfortunately the consistency was not. There were clumps of ice throughout my treat. Overall, I've had water ice better than this, regarding consistency. Maybe it was an off day, who knows. If I'm in town again I'll give them another try."
12/23/2020,5 star rating,"Yum! Anything vegan, watermelon and cherry gets my five bucks! They had a bunch of great flavor options. Think gourmet slurpee meets shave ice. Great logo too!"
9/6/2020,4 star rating,"Today I got the opportunity to visit the Happy Ice food truck that came to the inland empire. This place is amazing. The ""ice cream"" isn't really ice cream...more like a mix between shaved ice, ice cream and a slushy. Omg so yummy. I got a medium strawberry lush, watermelon lush and sour green apple lush. This stuff is honestly refreshing!!! Only downside is that they charge you 2 dollars for a cup of ice water which sucks considering today in San Bernardino, it was 118 degrees and they parked on asphalt which easily made it 10 degrees hotter and there was no shade covering. The line was long which definitely points to the fact that this place is really yummy. Just wish they would have given out water or at least sold water bottles and not solo cups full of water. Overall rating 8/10."
12/1/2020,5 star rating,"Happy Ice is like a trip back to childhood. It's so good. Such a delight on a hot day. My kids and I both enjoy it. I love that it's vegan and that they have so many great fruity flavors. They used to just have trucks, but they have store front location as well now. I'm so happy to see this business thriving!"
9/13/2020,5 star rating,"It's in the name. Happy Ice! Their truck and the ice are so eye-catching! We found Happy Ice on IG and decided to stop by, and we were not disappointed. They have so many delicious flavors. You can select 3 flavors, or you can have them all! We ordered Rainbow Rocket, which includes allllll the flavors and is gorgeoussss. Even with rainbow rocket, you can taste the individual flavors. The top scoop is more blended, but when you get deeper in the cup, there are sections of individual flavors. A large to share between 2 people was the perfect size. The ice is so smooth and not too sweet. You can even include a scoop of ice cream if you want a little more. They also give you color-changing spoons!!! Delicious, beautiful, well-priced, friendly service. They also support social distancing and require the use of masks. Just go already!"
9/13/2020,5 star rating,This place was so good and worth the wait!!! Also the ladies and gentlemen behind the counter were so nice!! Will be coming back :)

Loved how it wasn't too sweet, but there was still great flavor. It was reminiscent looking at my changing tongue color. Not only that, but the ice wasn't too solid so it easily melted in your mouth.Super awesome treat :) love love love!"

7/26/2020,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try Happy Ice since it blew up on social media! I'm so happy for their success and the opening of this brick and mortar location!I went on Saturday night around 6:30. There was a line, but it moved fast. Everyone was masked up and social distancing which was great! We waited a around 15 minutes. When we got inside, the staff was so lively and friendly! They asked if we were first-timers or ""happy campers"" and they did a little chant when we said it was our first time! So fun!The prices are very reasonable and the sizes are filling! You get to choose which flavors you want to mix or you can choose some of their popular flavor combos. I love that they have sour apple, so I got that with lemon and watermelon! It was delicious. It was super flavorful and refreshing. And it's such a plus that it's all vegan! I can't wait to come back."
2/5/2021,5 star rating,Oh my god I love Happy Ice it's so delicious & the times I've been there the workers are always polite.
8/1/2021,5 star rating,"I don't even know how to describe this. I haven't had anything like it before. It's so delicious, smooth and yummy. You just have to try it. They do some sort of singing or chanting when you leave a tip. They could probably cut that. That's just me though - I'm not into that stuff. Hahaha. I highly recommend this place."
7/7/2020,5 star rating,"I'm giving it 5 stars because it's simply amazing! I tried many all the flavors because of its combos & it's by far the best I had! On top of that , it's SUPER LOCAL !! I enjoyed having to drive 5 mins from my house to get the best ice cream in town. Try all the flavors ! You will not regret it (:"

You know how hard it is to find something for both of our pallets that is actually good! Okay well we went to their food truck in Compton and the staff is very friendly, took our first bite and I was so convinced my boyfriend was going to dump me and marry that Happy ice because he is obsessed! It's soo good and you can play with the flavors. I highly recommend you catch them on their soCal tour!"
9/15/2020,3 star rating,"The ice was good, and honestly tasted exactly like the ice cream you get from the ice cream man, with bubble gum eyes; spot on... but I can not fathom why, after ordering, it takes 30 minutes to scope flavored ice into a small cup."
8/10/2021,5 star rating,The shaved ice here is so good. The texture is so good and it feels so refreshing especially on a hit summer day. It is really good. I recommend the mango and blue raspberry.

9/10/2021,2 star rating,"I am only giving a two star because of customer service our company had a event for our caregivers in the park, when I arrived I started talking to our staff, caregivers and clients that came to the event, about an half hour into the event I decided to approach the cart for some tasty ice cream, I was met with such rudness from the server an  overweight young black woman I am only describing her this way as there was no name badge, anyways instead of her greeting me with professionalism and happiness she immediately asked me if I was part of the event, I said YES , she didnt ask anyone else when they approach the cart if they were part of the event, I am only upset because she saw me socializing with the people who were part of the event.  As a black woman I felt like she signaling me out, this is what I abhor about black business they seem to always treat there own people with rudness. I will never patriotize this business or recommend it.  You need to hire professional and friendly people since ice cream is something that makes people happy."
4/2/2021,2 star rating,"the ice cream was good not gonna lie!!! BUT THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. I went to the truck on Victory Blvd. in Burbank and waited more than 30 mins in uncertainty. The workers were apparently on break (understandable) BUT they did not even think of putting up a sign or anything to let the customers know that they would be back. It looked like an unattended truck and several people were unsure about whether or not they were open. ALSO, the workers were EXTREMELY rude. Some people knocked on the truck to make sure they were open and nobody responded, but when they did open back up, the cashier made a seemingly defensive comment, asking the customer if they had knocked. It was awkward and they were just concerned customers. Please don't delete this and PLEASE address this with your employees because i rlly loved the ice cream lol."
7/22/2020,5 star rating,"This place is fantastic! Heard about it somewhere on Facebook and had to check it out. The flavors really stand out, even when mixed together. I really enjoyed how the ice kept its consistency and didn't turn into a dripping mess. The cherry on top was the color changing spoon."
11/28/2020,4 star rating,"We went during the heatwave in LA where the temperature was nearing 120 degrees. There was a long line and some wait, which was fine. There's a cute mural on the corner of the building and I saw a lot of people take pictures there. The shaved ice was awesome, though it did melt pretty quickly in the heat. Definitely have given the two of us brain freeze while trying to eat it fast before it became melted slushy! It probably lasts longer in regular weather/temperature. It had more juice/syrup than other shaved ice I've tried in the past. Definitely more flavor and color. Also have to remember that you will have colored tongue after eating this! It was fun outing and fun treat."
8/10/2020,1 star rating,Was just in there and about to order when I look over and the guy serving ice cream is only wearing his mask on his mouth. Not covering his nose. Breathing out his nose all over the ice cream. We had to leave. You guys should be way more serious about your protocols and enforcing it with your employees. People are dying.
6/28/2020,5 star rating,"This place is so cute! The shop is really clean and the employees are really nice. If you give them a tip they do a little chant (so, tip them!) Everything on the menu is delicious and looks exactly like the photos you see on Instagram. Definitely make some time to stop by here"
4/9/2021,5 star rating,"Why did I just now hear about Happy Ice and how have I gone this long living life without it?  Thankfully, my life is now complete.Okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's not too far off.The kids and I took the drive to Melrose from the Valley early on a Friday afternoon, so there wasn't too much traffic.  Parking was also pretty easy on Fuller - just be sure to read the parking signs so as not to get a ticket.  We walked in and were greeted by the two employees who asked if this was our first time here, and when we said that it was, they let out a cheer-type-thing (hard to describe while typing) but it was evident that they'd be a welcoming place to new-comers.  And while it was a little difficult to hear the cashier from behind his face-mask and also through the music, we got the basic gist of how it worked.  For the 3 of us, we split a medium time machine (cherry, mango & pineapple) and a medium rainbow rocket (combination of all flavors) and added the soft serve to the rainbow.  The time machine was terrific - especially the mango - which tasted like I was chewing on the real thing.  The rainbow rocket was exceptional - either when tasting the flavors individually or taking them all in one bite.  And the soft serve was amazing... knowing that it was made from oat milk was that much more impressive that it was a vegan dish.  When a tip was left in the jar for the employees, they had another fun cheer (how many of these do they have?) and we were on our way.  We ate on the sidewalk (no seating due to COVID right now) and were pleasantly surprised by the color-changing spoons.  The kids are storing them in our freezer right now, to bring out at some point in the future.So, in conclusion, the customer service was great, the pricing was reasonable and the food was delicious.  The only negative is the drive, but with a product like this, they'll be growing in no time.Thank you, Happy Ice!"
9/3/2019,1 star rating,"I love the ice I really do! The flavors are so amazing and it's just an all around tasty treat! Why the one star you ask? On more than one occasion I have shown up at the posted time on Instagram which is usually 1pm-8pm and either the truck is no where to be found or the truck is sitting there an hour after it's supposed to be open with the doors closed an a line of people confused as to why they aren't open. That's fine, I get it things happen and there are delays but have some common decency and respect for the people who support your product and post an update on social media and let us know you're running behind or that there is a delay but no, you choose to stay silent so I refuse to waste anymore of my time and visit other shaved ice vendors such as Brian's shaved Ice, Rita's, Get shaved, Mango tango. Great product, terrible customer focus."

5/28/2021,2 star rating,"Came from out of town to visit this place. The cashier with pixie cut was less than pleasant. Water ice was subpar, the soft serve was really good. Could find a better water ice at your local supermarket."
9/15/2019,5 star rating,"I remember when they first opened, I was on Melrose and the nice lady at the front gave me a free sample. It was delicious. Now, two years later, boy have they GROWN! Multiple trucks, multiple locations in one day, private parties... you name it.In the hot dry summer of LA, happy ice is the perfectly refreshing, sweet but not too sweet, light dessert that is sure to brighten your day and cool off your body.Color changing spoons too!Pro tip: they are almost always at the vegan fair on Bakman in Noho on Sundays. Suggestion: Can you guys get sour spray? A lot of Hawaiian ice trucks have it, it gives a nice sour kick to any icy desserts (;Love it!"
10/3/2020,5 star rating,They corrected their mistake! And we're so nice and efficient about it! Thank you to Lemiere who was very responsive on Instagram and gave us a complimentary cooler of more than enough ice cream!
7/26/2020,2 star rating,"I ordered a buggy for my daughters birthday and they were a no call/ no show. Which is unfortunate because my daughter was really looking forward to having them there and no one from management has reached out to me, my boyfriend had to call to even get through to someone. We were told they simply forgot! Among other things, I booked two weeks in advance to make sure they had time to prepare for the event and that just worked in the total opposite way. They forgot they booked my party at all. Super disappointed"
10/28/2020,5 star rating,So addicting. The staff is amazing. The happy ice tastes amazing and are very cool looking. Was there daily during the heat waves. Definitely recommend adding this place to your bucket list!
9/28/2020,4 star rating,"Yummy! First time here with my kids! Worth the wait, generous portions too.  The staff was friendly and they sing a tune if they get a tip!"
6/2/2021,5 star rating,This place deserves all the stars! There are italian ices and then there is Happy Ice! OMG the best you will ever have in your life! The flavors and price are excellent. So happy I found this place!
9/17/2020,5 star rating,All I can say is wow! This place is amazing! It was my first time going here and they made me feel very comfortable and the staff was very personable and funny. They suggested their favorite ice cream and had amazing customer service. The line was a little long but went by very fast and they took the necessary steps during covid restrictions. Definitely recommend stopping here while shopping on melrose.
8/7/2020,5 star rating,I went for the first time today and there was a long line but the line moves very fast. I loved the good vibes from the employees they were very fun and energetic. It was pretty warm out so this was nice to have while walking melrose. I would definitely recommend!
9/30/2020,5 star rating,For being %100 vegan. It's really really good. Friendly helpful service. I would come back Forsure
11/12/2020,5 star rating,"i tried happy ice for the first time yesterday afternoon. i had to wait a while to order. i got the time machine in the medium size. it was really refreshing, and you can really taste each flavor! it's pretty sweet, but overall i enjoyed it."
5/11/2021,4 star rating,"This place has some great and very creative sorbet flavors! Employees were also nice, and even though you do have to wait in line before ordering, it took less than expected. However, I recommend that they label their sorbet cups when we pick them up since some orders can look similar to others in color, especially if you're ordering several or more. Also, the sorbets were a little too sweet, so I think cutting down on the sugar would also be good. That being said, it's a place that I'd visit again!"
9/3/2020,5 star rating,"I'm from Philly and knows what an Italian Ice is supposed to taste like, this establishment is the ""Real Deal""!!!!"
3/21/2021,5 star rating,This spot is a new favorite. They have the most flavorful ices I have ever had and each is so pretty!! I am so glad they have the permanent store front on Melrose. A weekend treat for us most weekends now!!
9/5/2019,5 star rating,"I discovered this place at a food truck festival in north hollywood and I'm glad I did. The truck is so colorful so that's what got my attention. I only get the blue raspberry one because it's my favorite flavor but everyone gets the rainbow one. The texture is sooooo creamy!!! It surprised me. After trying it for the first time, I had it 3 more times in the same month!"
10/9/2020,5 star rating,"Wow, where do I start. The line although long (worth it) was lively. The hipsters had great conversations going and the vibe was chill. The ice cream was sweet and the ice was exciting. Bursting with flavor.   I can't wait to go back!!"
8/28/2020,5 star rating,Amazing flavors and it wasn't too busy but there's a constant line.  If even not in the area you should try it was totally worth the drive and wait.
8/2/2020,5 star rating,"When happy ice can stop by Long Beach, I go there when I can. I was impressed by the ice cream when I saw them at the OC nightfare but with the summer coming in hot, there is where I go for my ice cream for a Sunday, if not the only ice cream I have in a week. I love their All Star flavor and I have yet to try it with soft serve. All of the staff are fun, energetic, and friendly."
8/1/2020,5 star rating,This ice cream was so damn good that I finished my cup in like 5 minutes. Very nice staff and very attentive to safety social distancing protocols. Very efficient and quick to get your order that it was almost instantaneously!! I would definitely recommend and would go back!!!
8/1/2020,5 star rating,"Love their aesthetic, very fun colors! I get as much enjoyment looking at the shaved ice as I do eating it.Big thumbs up for the crew that works here, who are always super friendly, and for the dope merch that they sell in the store."
7/29/2020,1 star rating,"Drive across town to come here. Got here at 7:45 they close at 8, and said they close the line at 7:40.  I'll never drive anywhere like this again. Please state you close the line.  We drove from Huntington Beach"
7/27/2020,5 star rating,"Did not see a way to review the truck that's in Compton, so I'll do it here. Me and the fam went and enjoyed it alit. The people working the truck were very nice and energetic, I saw the guy on channel 7 news about his truck being stolen and told my family let's give them some support. And not disappointed. The flavors are awesome and the presentation is addictive alone. Very bright colors. I see me and my family supporting for a very long time. Going to pay a visit to Melrose just to see what the shop looks like also."
7/26/2020,4 star rating,"My only complaint is the wait! But after spending around and hour and a half in line and then waiting for my order (combined time), I was kinda stunned to find myself feeling that it was worth it lol! Went with the large rainbow rocket with soft serve because if you wait that long, why the heck not?!! Got one for my mom too who had to wait in the car the whole time, probably thinking I abandoned her! But we were both really satisfied! After following on SM for the last couple of months, I'm thrilled they came down to PCH & 2nd today because we got to try it. I hate waiting in long lines. But I might just do it again for this! This is a unique treat, delivers on flavor and quality. And 2 hours after I got in line, I was indeed, Happy! Plus, I love that I get to support a small, locally owned, black business. All their staff was wearing masks and a socially distant line was encouraged (tho some still have a hard time with the concept of stand on the dot.) Now come just a little further south to the OC already!"
7/26/2020,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try Happy Ice since it blew up on social media! I'm so happy for their success and the opening of this brick and mortar location!I went on Saturday night around 6:30. There was a line, but it moved fast. Everyone was masked up and social distancing which was great! We waited a around 15 minutes. When we got inside, the staff was so lively and friendly! They asked if we were first-timers or ""happy campers"" and they did a little chant when we said it was our first time! So fun!The prices are very reasonable and the sizes are filling! You get to choose which flavors you want to mix or you can choose some of their popular flavor combos. I love that they have sour apple, so I got that with lemon and watermelon! It was delicious. It was super flavorful and refreshing. And it's such a plus that it's all vegan! I can't wait to come back."
7/22/2020,5 star rating,"This place is fantastic! Heard about it somewhere on Facebook and had to check it out. The flavors really stand out, even when mixed together. I really enjoyed how the ice kept its consistency and didn't turn into a dripping mess. The cherry on top was the color changing spoon."
7/20/2020,5 star rating,Sooo delicious and so pretty to look at as well! Friendly service and great prices. Will definitely recommend to friends and family!
7/20/2020,5 star rating,I finally made it here and it is now our new go to for a nice cold treat ! It's like a rainbow of flavors in your mouth !!! The spoons even turn colors ! What a delight !!! The workers seem really happy and they literally announce if your a repeat or first timer ! They have cute stickers on the sidewalk to encourage six feet distance ! Just go check it out and support small businesses!!!
7/19/2020,5 star rating,"Bless this wonderful new business, as its rightfully so, the best and most welcome new establishment on Melrose. Ordered the time machine + ice cream and I never looked back. - Great service- Delicious ice, and ice cream- It's cute and fun- support a small amazing businessDefinitely coming back!"
7/19/2020,5 star rating,That cotton candy flavor was SOOO good!!! Went to the Melrose location . The line wasn't too bad. I was in and out in 20 minutes. WELL worth it!!!
7/18/2020,5 star rating,"First time at this business.  Heard about it thru a friend.   Looked it up on the gram. Visited during Covid19 no less.   A bit of a wait outside the building.   Loved the color changing spoons. Price: S $4, M $5, L $6Employees were nice and helpful. Nice and flavorful. Would definitely return again."
7/17/2020,5 star rating,"Happy Ice has apparently been super popular for quite a while, serving Philadelphia-style ice treats out of its roving trucks. Great news for folks in this area: they now have a bricks and mortar shop at 7324 Melrose!They have several fruity flavors to choose from at any time - think mango, cherry, watermelon, and others. Since I'm bad with commitment, I opted to try all of them at once via the ""world famous rainbow rocket,"" which is an colorfully and instaworthy psychedelic swirl. So many flavors bombarding the senses at once! A touch of ice cream added extra yummyness to the whole equation. The staffers here were super sweet and perky. It's like there are literally rainbows pouring out of this venue. And it's Black owned and operated! The world could sure use more places like this. Thanks Yelpers for yet another awesome find!"
7/17/2020,5 star rating,"Amazing ice! I have been wanting to try it for a while, but I am never in the area where the truck parks. The new location allowed me to try it for the first time. The line was not bad we had 5 people ahead of us. It did not move fast so have patience, but keep in mind the location is small so most of the waiting will be outside. Parking is street parking which tends to be horrible on Melrose. We did not have a problem parking because of Covid most stores are still closed.  The employees were welcoming and excited. We ordered the rainbow ice and lemon ice. Cons: The line moves super slow for ice. Pros: delicious and great customer service. Well worth it!"
7/13/2020,2 star rating,"I went to the Melrose shop at 7:50pm but was turned away by the employee who was outside overseeing the line of customers, so I unfortunately didn't get to try their ices. They don't close until 8pm, so you'd think they'd allow everyone who lined up before 8pm to place an order, but that's apparently not their policy. The line wasn't very long to begin with, so they could have been more accommodating. Since I was turned away, I ended up going to a nearby ice cream shop and spent $15, which could have been spent at Happy Ice. Next time, I'll make sure to show up at least 20-30 minutes before they close to avoid being turned away."
7/13/2020,5 star rating,Happy Ice We saw it advertised on TV absolutely delicious little bit of a line though if you have to wait but definitely worth the wait especially on a hot day I highly recommend it  enjoy
7/12/2020,5 star rating,"Visited the pop up on 2nd and PCH today, worth the wait for a yummy treat and superb service! The crew really looked like they were having fun...love that!"
7/12/2020,4 star rating,Fun experience. Long line but worth the wait. I had the rainbow rocket off the menu but you can create your own flavor experience. Refreshing dessert. Order a large which was too much for a conservative eater

Just wow ... so so so good that we had some at noon and then drove back the same day from the other side of Los Angeles, took us 40 mins, got here at 7:30 and they close at 8, stood in line and then someone came out and pointed to the person in front of us and said ""she's our last one tonight ..."" there were only 2 more people in back of us and it was 7:42 ... so it was a huge let down BUT it's just so good, my boyfriend is from Philly and so are the owners and this place is magical ... but it turns you into an Italian ice junkie who Yelps about the fact they got told no 20 mins before they close ... my point is, it's great but know that they close way earlier than 8pm ..."

I drove 1.5 hours to try it and it was worth it. Thank you."
7/5/2020,5 star rating,This place is THE BEST. So glad they finally have a permanent location on Melrose after becoming a fan of their truck that use to park there. The texture of this stuff can't be beat - it's smooth and creamy and super refreshing. The prices are fair. The flavors are delicious. The staff is friendly. It's a fun happy vibe and I love everything about it.
3/7/2020,1 star rating,Today I tried them for the first time the first couple of spoons fulls was good until I found a piece of hair in my happy ice couldn't finish eating it because of the hair not sure how they prepare the ice cream but they need to wear hair nets around food not a happy customer at all money wasted
7/12/2019,5 star rating,BOMB ASS ICE CREAM  Hits different in this hot ass Summer lol  Try to go before 8 though.
11/29/2018,4 star rating,"Really tasty stuff to have on a hot day in LA, which is like all the time it seems. Texture for most flavors is excellent. Smooth and snow-like. My only complaint is that it's a little bit too sweet for my taste personally. But still pretty damn good. I got cherry, mango, and melon. Really good combo. Didn't care for the lemon too much as the consistency was not smooth, but rather more like ice. If they managed to somehow swirl in some vanilla soft serve with the sherbet, then they'd take my money like...1) All day2) Everyday3) Every which wayWho said you can't have your cake and eat it too?"
9/25/2019,5 star rating,"At Happy Ice food truck on Manchester and Western in Ralph's parking lot. Had the medium cup of Rainbow, it's a combination of all the flavors. Well, worth the drive. I came from South Gate."

1/1/2021,3 star rating,The water based ice cream is really good except for the vegan one. I am a big fan of vegan Ice cream but this vegan ice-cream is really bad. The customer service wasn't great either. Hopefully next time they're nice.

6/11/2018,2 star rating,"My husband and I were finally able to get out of the house without our newborn so we decided to come here after seeing happy ice on social media (Instagram) countless times. We love cold desserts so we made our way to the truck. Which is about an hour away from us. We come up and there seems to be a line? Or idk what it was but there was a crowd of people and we stood there for about 15minutes. Nobody acknowledged us. So we kind of stood there looking clueless that whole time. Turns out it wasn't a line just people hanging out in front of the business. The woman taking orders I guess took it into her own hands to deal with something going on in the truck instead of acknowledging others orders. We let two other couples go ahead of us to see if they had any luck getting their order taken. They had to wait about 8 min on top of what we had been waiting already. We heard the woman finally ask ""What did you want?""Immediately I was thinking how rude. But they didn't seem to have a problem with how she was speaking to them or maybe they just wanted their ice already. I was really thinking of stepping out of line. But we finally get asked "" are you ready to order?""Being as it's our first time here I only knew what I seen on pictures. So I told my husband to order first. She didn't ask us if we had any questions. She was more focused on what was happening in the truck or on her notepad. At one point she was rolling up plastic ware. So I just said "" can we have the one with all of the flavors"" Since it wasn't advertised on the board. She said ""yup that'll be (whatever the price was)""I look at my husband like I'm done. I'm ready to walk away and say screw the flavored ice . Nothing is worth being rudely spoken too.  We get our ice. My husband loves his. I thought it was way too sweet. Definitely is hyped up just because the colors of it. Basically customer service needs to be worked on immensely. It could have been rated 4 stars at most if we were spoken too with kindness. I don't know maybe we just went on a bad day. We won't be returning though."
10/7/2019,5 star rating,I tried it for the first time at the crawfish festival in Long Beach. So damn delicious! The perfect treat for a hot summer day as well. I forgot to post my review when I tried it.......but today I was reminded to do so because I saw the happy ice truck (color....so you can't miss it) driving on the 405 freeway headed towards the valley. :)
10/22/2020,5 star rating,"This is for their mobile location on Manchester and St. Andrews. Great team in the food truck who knows how shaved ice is supposed to be served. It is refreshing to see this business in the hood (and the others near Ralph's market). So long as you come through, this business will be supported. Prime location with more people looking and ready to try. Trust, it's good."
7/24/2018,5 star rating,"You guys come up to Lancaster, Ca for our Monday night truck nights. I can't begin to tell you guys how amazing the rainbow one is. I wanted to go back and get another large but it was close to closing time. Thank you so much for coming up here. I'm totally coming back and enjoying more!"
8/21/2020,1 star rating,"So I'm only giving one star not because of the ice, because I didn't have a chance to try it yet, but it was more so the experience. I live not too far and decided before I start work I'm going to stop by and grab some delicious ice. I arrived like at 10:50ish to try and get there early in case of a line. The line was already about 20-30 people deep and on their Instagram post it said they would be there from 11am to 7pm at the Downey Stonewood Center. Its not the biggest deal in the world, and I understand things come up, but it would've been nice if they were all set up and ready to go at 11am. But as I was driving up the truck was barely pulling up right before 11am and was setting up while everyone was standing in line. Just a friendly suggestion. Maybe if they started and opened up on time I would've had a chance to try to for the first, or maybe not because of the line, who knows. But I was excited to try and will just wait for their next stop!"
5/5/2018,5 star rating,Finally a place to get real water ice when you not in philly! It's like a piece of home on a food truck. Maaannnnn they even have cheese pretzels. Every cheat day will involve a water ice. Great great great job.
8/30/2020,5 star rating,"Decided to visit after hearing raving reviews about the place and I can definitely say that the hype was worth it! Ordered a large Rainbow Rocket (proved to be way too big and my eyes were bigger than my stomach-- next time I'll be ordering a smaller size) but it was so good! I'm typically not one to mix all flavours together when it comes to shaved ice or ice cream but decided to try it anyways-- I'm glad I did! Amazing shaved ice and customer service, will definitely be visiting again!"
7/9/2018,5 star rating,"We tried happy ice at the Monday Bites food trucks at the Lancaster city park. By far the best thing there. Great service, really nice crew with free samples. Amazingly creamy, flavorful  ice. Try the a rainbow flavor, so good."

6/2/2019,5 star rating,Literally so good!! So fresh and I don't even like deserts or ice cream but this was more of like a slushee/Italian ice thing it was so good. The rainbow flavor is highly recommended. Very nice and fast seeing as how I had somewhere to be. Very happy 10 stars if I could!
6/30/2019,5 star rating,Tried this amazing ice for the first time today. I had the Watermelon Lush and Mango Madness flavors. They were on point and Ashley has great customer service
8/6/2020,5 star rating,Definitely worth the line! Totally inexpensive and love that we're supporting a small business :)
7/23/2018,5 star rating,"Happy ice is the one! They have the most fruity mouth watering flavors like mango, watermelon, and pineapple to name a few.  I think the price is really reasonable too considering the size of a large (big enough for 2 to share).  It's not your usual Italian ice that's for sure.  It has almost a creamy consistency to it but I don't think there is any cream added.  It's very soft and easy to spoon unlike some other shaved ice that you need an ice pick or chisel to get into.  Something they claim is that every bite has flavor even down to the bottom.  I put it to the test and I have to admit that i didn't get a single ""ice only"" bite. Flavor throughout!  On a hot day think of happy ice to quench the heat. I highly recommend."
5/5/2019,5 star rating,"1st time having Happy Ice. WOW. They had a stand in Old Town San Diego.   Super smooth and flavorful, hardly melted and kept consistent flavor to the end. Had Mango with Lemon and daughter had the rainbow rocket.  So good."

9/7/2019,5 star rating,This is by far the best shaved iced I have had in a very long time. The flavors are vibrant. I love the fact they are consistent. From cups with the logo to the yellow napkins down to the the colored spoons. I love it!! I will.follow where they go! Visited them at the night market to the corner of Manchester and Western
9/7/2019,5 star rating,Been waiting to run into this truck and I finally did !! My boyfriend got rainbow rocket and I got a pineapple potion with cherry bomb. It was so good! Highly recommend to anyone that is looking for an alternative option to ice cream. I'm lactose intolerant so I've been on the lookout for a place like this. 10/10 recommend soooo good !!!
9/6/2020,5 star rating,Always consistent with good service never fails. The very few bad reviews they have are jus people looking for something to be wrong. Must try it!!!
11/12/2019,5 star rating,I absolutely loved my happy ice. It was my first time trying it so I got the rainbow. Really good ice and the cheapest price. I recommend
8/3/2020,5 star rating,This was the PERFECT dessert on a hot day in the city. They are following COVID codes and everything is clean. The rainbow ice with all the flavors was delicious but make sure to get less flavors if you really want to be able to taste them

(Sad, but true, but i love it)The people who own and work at the Happy Ice truck are awesome as well. Sherron, Danielle, and Julia are literally THE BEST!

9/15/2018,5 star rating,"Stopped by Happy Ice after a long day of extreme bird scootering. After our very long day of extreme bird scootering we were pleasantly approached by Julia (who is very beautiful) and asked if we wanted a free sample. ""Of course!"" I said as my mouth drooled with the smell of ice in my nostrils. I then proceeded to eat my free sample with delight. Eat here. I love you Julia."
5/19/2018,5 star rating,"I've always passed by the Happy Ice truck in Melrose very often and I have always wanted to try it out. Shoutout to the ACE Family for hyping this place because I can finally relate as to why they get their water ice here. Hands down the best water ice I have ever tried in my entire life. Love, love, the wide variety of flavors. Not to mentioned, the service is amazing! I'm sorry. I don't know the two ladies names but they are benevolently so kind and filled with great vibes. I will definitely take my boyfriend and my girls over here."
6/18/2019,1 star rating,"Drove to Happy ice for an hour at 6pm when it said they're open till 7 and they were no where to be found, so unprofessional if you're going to close the truck early and leave at least change your times online so people don't get the wrong impression!"
9/12/2018,5 star rating,Not only is the ice packed with great flavor the people and the environment that was developed around this truck is what makes it unique. Me and my girlfriend have been here multiple times to cool off with these hot times during the summer. If your looking for the best ice in LA look no further! Thanks guys for bringing this ice to LA.

9/22/2018,5 star rating,Happy ice is the best because the ice is very smooth and colorful. There is so many good flavors and if you cannot decided on which flavor you want there is free samples. The prices start a good value. The employees are hard workers. I enjoy coming here because the employees are very nice and that puts a smile on my face. I love the taste of the rainbow and you can also create your own cup of flavors.

5/4/2018,5 star rating,"HAPPY ICE is indeed the best Italian ice in this city. It's family oriented and they have the best customer service any food truck business can offer. It's honestly as good as it gets, scoop by scoop they serve the best product in Los Angeles. So proud to call them my family. #HappyIce #PhillytoLA #Melrose.."
4/26/2018,5 star rating,"Happy Ice LA is the best thing to come to Los Angeles from Philly since Kobe Bryant was drafted to the Lakers or The Fresh Prince to Bel-Air. So many flavors, soft pretzels, cheese pretzels and pizza pretzels... your choice. Still waiting on those wholesale orders so I can stack my freezer. Perfect treat for the family on those sunny LA days. Already filled up my 2nd loyalty card. Going for my 3rd."
3/31/2019,5 star rating,"Was super good, like a slushie but with soft snow instead of crushed ice and really good fruit flavors. Guys working there were fast and friendly too! Great treat looking around the hot Poway street fair."
4/17/2018,5 star rating,Super good!!!! The texture of shave ice but still keeping the ice cream flavor texture as well! Every bite taste with a bit of shaved but also creamy from the ice cream! Delicious for a lil cold snack. Especially for summer days here I the valley!

10/6/2017,4 star rating,"When I first saw this food truck, my boyfriend and I thought they were icy's infused with marijuana only because of the way the truck is designed. They did say it coming in the near future! Fingers crossed, never had anything like that before. But anyway the icy's were delicious! many flavors to choose from and you can mix ANYTHING you want!! literally!!!! They were so nice, had our picture taken and posted on their IG. Will defiantly be visiting again when I go back to LA."
9/16/2017,5 star rating,Nice owners! We got happy ice yesterday night and we felt in love with the business owners and ice! They are very hospitable and great people. From Philly to Los Angeles they will bring this amazing ice treat to the LA native. Check out there IG page @happyicela

5/9/2018,5 star rating,"Let me start off by saying that the most exciting part about me traveling up to the Fairfax/Melrose area is to visit the Happy Ice Truck!! Though I'm not able to go as much as I'd like to, because it's usually a bit far from me, I'd go allll the time if I could. However - they DID come to my college a few times when requested, which was super cool of them. I've been coming to these guys a few months after they started. They are super humble and cool people. The ice is amazing!! So many flavors to choose from. Definitely refreshing on a warm, sunny LA day. Your visit to Happy Ice will sure make you happy!! Make sure to get one of the pizza pretzels too - my favorite is Buffalo Chicken. Sooooo yummy!!!!!! shout out to you guys at happy ice!! keep working hard and thanks for the awesomeness. i'll keep on coming back!!"

3/31/2018,5 star rating,My favorite snack :) luckily I live really close to melrose so it's always really easy to find. Great prices and awesome staff !! :)
12/29/2017,5 star rating,Great flavor unlike most shaved ice these do not become watered down as you enjoy. Ice cream like flavors with an icee consistency. My kids loved the fun flavors & color changing spoons! I enjoyed mine with a boba type straw (my own) much easier to enjoy that way driving.
9/13/2017,5 star rating,I was coming out of round two when they stopped me for some samples. The flavors were riveting! Amazing people! Amazing experience! Great service! Loved it!
