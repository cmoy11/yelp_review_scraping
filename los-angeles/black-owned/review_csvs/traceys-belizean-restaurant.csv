3/12/2022,5 star rating,"Tracey's is on Western just south of Exposition is a nondescript joint with a knack for creating delicious Belizean cuisine. Everyone is really friendly and eager to explain the food here. Unfortunately, the dining room isn't open yet, and the aromas on the drive home make you want to pull over and dive in. Stew Chicken: The dark meat chicken is slowly cooked in a brown stew of spices, including annatto seed, allspice, cinnamon, and clove. The spices provide a deep peppery flavor. A Creole meal isn't complete without  beans, rice, and potato salad. The stew beans are cooked until the big red kidney beans have an almost mashed consistency and are a bit peppery. The white rice is a bit al dente, which is a nice textural contrast to the soft beans. The potato salad is packed with flavor consisting of baby potatoes, carrots, vinegar, mayo, and black pepper. There are also a couple of plantains. The extra stew gravy overflows into the beans and rice, boosting flavor wherever it flows. Parking: You need to turn off the main streets and park in the neighborhood. Dining Area: The tables are currently closed off, but I was told that they may reopen this weekend."
6/12/2022,5 star rating,"This is my parents spot for authentic Belizean food and I honestly can't argue.  The food is delicious I typically have the stew chicken (white meat) but I tried the Oxtails today and got my dad his usual Stew chicken. I love that they have you check the plate before leaving! This a a big thing for me, you can voice your concerns on the spot if you had any I appreciate that.  The Oxtails is a must do from now on I loved it just the right amount of seasoning and spice not overly spicy, they could trim the fat a little more but nothing to complain about still delicious.  My only complaint would be usually on Sundays there is no desserts left besides Jam rolls and bun lol listen I want bread pudding, tart and meringue pie! Other than that the gentleman that help me has awesome customer service I was quite impressed! Tracey's isn't  near me but I try my best to make it as often as I can, it's worth it."

6/16/2017,5 star rating,"Getting off from work and i craved some rice and beans. Called in my order and as i walk in it was ready to go. I love eating at this place. Been coming here for many years. Great service, the guys are always very helpful. Highly recommend! Must also try coming for breakfast. Im in LOVE WITH the liver, omg my dad would make it and i hated it. One day my mom got a plate and told me it was beef, and later on i come to find out it was liver, go juicy and tender. Will be coming back for that crab soup. Ohh and now they got fresh beef and chicken patties AWESOME! Gotta try em."
8/10/2021,5 star rating,"If you want oxtail/stew chicken I suggest coming between 12pm-2:30pm otherwise you might be out of luck. YES ITS THAT GOOD. Regardless of the line/lack of parking/short window of opportunity to get food I'm ALWAYS gonna come back. The food is delicious and consistent. I think it's funny that people are saying the employees are rude, they're not rude at all they just deliver fast and quality service without the extra frills, which I can appreciate. Simple menu, you walk up, order, and they go back and grab your food immediately. I actually think the employees are really nice and obviously work very hard from open to close."
4/29/2022,5 star rating,Love traceys.  So authentic and go in the morn when the have the Johnny cakes!  Love their chicken too!
9/28/2021,5 star rating,"The food is deceptively simple and delicious. Plantains, oxtail, beans and rice, potato salad. So good."
2/24/2022,2 star rating,Food good but they stingy asf with that stew chicken i caught on to what they do they grab a chicken breast and break it all down like its a lot. Nope it dont be. Ever blue and i mean every blue moon u might get a nice hefty plate
6/17/2021,2 star rating,"I will never go here again.. I felt like I was bothering the guy at the counter.. No hello, Welcome anything.. When he finally realized I was there. He stood up and said Yeah.. I asked do you have Oxtail.. Yeah... Then..Is that all you want? Went in the back came back put my food on the counter. At first I didn't think he was even going to give me a bag.. The last thing out of his mouth was 20.00.. No Thank you.. Just nothing.. I said Thank you.. Still nothing.. Just handed me my food.. I should've just left and went somewhere else.. Customer service makes or breaks a business.. I try to support Black Business but they'll never see another dollar of mine.."
5/30/2021,2 star rating,Food is good but horrible customer service. I waited at least 10 minutes before I was able to order. Multiple employee came to the front and greeted me or asked if I needed anything. Don't expect to be treated as if they appreciate your business.
6/29/2021,1 star rating,"Got the oxtail plate and was really disappointed , Pretty much just paid 20 dollars for beans and rice and barely any meat. Also the guy working there was so rude and just said 20$ no hello welcome or thank you ."
3/28/2020,4 star rating,"One of the best ways to get to the heart of a culture is through it's cuisine. This is the type of food that literally puts you to sleep after eating it because it's so good and fulfilling. I've tried all the Belizean restaurants in LA and by far this little gem is the best one. So why the 4 Stars? Cons-Customer service is a huge part of making your business thriving. They do not take phone orders, wait what? Yes, it's true. I know that food should be held at 140 degrees but we call because we want to reserve our food, they run out of food after a certain time. I don't mind waiting for my food to cook, I just want to ensure that you have my order. There's no designated parking structure. Parking is available on the street which is always full on the weekends. Pros: I've tried all the Belizean restaurants in LA and by far this little gem is the best one. The food is Authentic Belizean cuisine. It's fully prepared by the owner Tracy herself. She's an awesome Chef. The signature Belizean dish is: Mixed Rice & Beans with Stew Chicken, Potato salad made with Heinz Salad cream and fried ripe plantains. Very delicious. The flavor is in the rice & beans . Tracy's makes it just right. Oxtail w/Rice & Bean cabbage salad & fried plantains very delicious. Well seasoned oxtails every time.Chicken tamales Belizean style delicious as well.Prices are a little steep but, which Caribbean style food isn't. When I'm LA, I always stop by and take their delicious food home for the family."
10/19/2015,4 star rating,My family and I have been coming here  for over 10 years. Best food EVER! Belizean Food ROCKS!
8/16/2021,5 star rating,"I can't wait to visit LA again, I ate at so many places while visiting for 4th of July weekend with my fiancee, but this place stands out compare to the other restaurants we went to. We will definitely be stopping by again soon. Their customer service was top notch, and their food was so tasty, every bites left me wanting more."
6/17/2021,5 star rating,Delicious stew beef and coconut tarts. Highly recommended. The portions are also massive. One plate is definitely enough for two.
12/20/2019,4 star rating,Enjoyed my oxtails entree dish with potatoes salad. Yummy...tried the beef stew from my sister's dish and it was good too. Didn't have a chance to order the chicken because it was not ready and I had an event to attend to....
2/4/2018,5 star rating,"Writing this while in a food coma so I apologize for any errors This was my second time having Belizean food. The first time was an amazing home cooked meal. Eating here today, I got the same down home/home cooked vibes. I had the chicken meal with rice & beans, potato salad, cabbage, and plantains. Everything was delicious. The potato salad was probably the best I've ever had--not too vinegary, chunky, or sweet & the cabbage was super fresh. The chicken literally fell off the bone and was seasoned well. There's enough juice left over, so you can dip your chicken or soak your rice in it (which, by the way, is really tasty and they give you so much of it). I ate around 11:30-12 and will likely be fully til tomorrow. I still have quite a bit of rice and beans left over that I can't wait to finish."
8/25/2021,5 star rating,"The line is always out the door and I see why!!! The food is definitely delicious and worth the wait! I order stew chicken with rice and beans, cabbage salad and a bun on the side. Next time I visit I'm gonna try the oxtails"
6/12/2021,3 star rating,"The fish was super delicious, but the rice and beans had no coconut flavor whatsoever. You would expect with a $53 order the guy will give you some sauce with it, but he did not. One time he accepted a credit card the next time he said they only take debit (make up your mind). Chicken was ok."
3/20/2019,5 star rating,Very good food !Hubby and i both had the chicken stew with the beans/ rice.One with cabbage one with potato salad.Cabbage was amazing- potato salad was good too - different than any we ever had.Rest of the food was excellent. We even had the lemon cake.
8/2/2020,4 star rating,"Food was hot and good!!! The oxtails were full of flavor, the red beans and rice were a little dry but I try not to complain about the little things...not a long wait of course because there was no inside dining. The man at the counter was very personable and had a great attitude!"
5/27/2021,5 star rating,I cried a little just now because I am pregnant and too damn huge & exhausted to go pick up and my boy friend leaves work too late to stop by. I wish they could deliver!!! the food is ALWAYS amazing and delicious.
4/11/2021,5 star rating,Great traditional Belizian food. Staff is always friendly and food is great. Fast service for to go food. Small inside dinning.
3/7/2016,5 star rating,"Food is amazing and right to the point. Came here to order lunch to go. Got the stew chicken with mixed rice and beans and cabbage. You can opt for either potato salad or cabage. In lieu of mixed rice and beans, you can get rice and beans. As far as meat goes, you can opt for oxtail instead of chicken. Whatever your heart desires.The portions are huge and you will definitely be full after eating anything from Tracey's. The chicken is soft, tender and juicy. The rice and cabbage are a great pairing. It's cash only, so make a visit to the ATM beforehand- it's worth it."
5/13/2016,5 star rating,"It's in a rough looking let of la but don't be frightened! The waiter is awesome. Very friendly. They don't give you men yes. There is only one at the counter, so make sure you take a look at it before you sit down. I ordered the stew chicken, rice and beans, potatoe salad and platanos. Man!! I've never had belizean food before but this stuff is on point! The rice and beans are bomb! Lottie salad had perfect flavor and the chicken was so soft it fell off the bone! Mmmm!! Very juicy! I also got a Jamaican ginger beer. It's was very gingery. Not like our regular ginger ale. Glad I tried it though. This place gives really good portions too! I wanted a fry jack but that's only in the mornings they said. Guess I will have to be back again one day for it!"
9/19/2019,5 star rating,The ox tail dish is a go to! Very homemade food flavor and they provide great service
1/30/2021,5 star rating,"Best food in LA. eat here every week. worth the wait I recommend the fish, stewed beans and rice, potato salad is , stewed chicken, stewed beef is , oxtails are also incredible. and the cake. can't forget the yellow cake"
3/9/2020,5 star rating,"If you have never tried Belizan food this is the place. I walked in lost and left found. I got an Oxtail platter and asked what else I should try. Before the counter could answer, a guy paying told them to put extra Gravy on my rice. Damned if I don't owe this guy a beer for that, best decision I didn't make. When it was time to pay and I wanted  some extra pastries..this chick had my back. The place felt like eating at your in law's abuela's house for the first time and finding out  she cooks bomb.Love this place, 10/10 and if you don't think it's the best I will fight you."
5/13/2020,5 star rating,"I have been enjoying Daisy's food since 1982. When I was pregnant she sat me down and taught me the basics.  I have never been able to duplicate her amazing flavor, however.  It is a staple at all of our family get-togethers.  Her food is better than any I had while in Belize."
5/13/2020,2 star rating,"Never had a problem with them until today. Customer service is horrible. They made a mistake on an order. Instead of admitting they were wrong or misheard, he argued. The things he was saying didn't make any sense. He did more arguing than listening. But on a positive note, their food is good when it's available. They do sell out fast especially on Saturdays. Please make sure to check your order before leaving. Because who orders a vegetarian oxtail gravy dinner? ‍"
1/4/2017,5 star rating,"Tracey's Belizean is a hidden, unassuming gem in south central LA. The food is hot, delicious, fresh-to-order and authentic. All the dishes are incredibly reasonably priced given the quality and portions. Staff is very nice and chill. I HIGHLY recommend the oxtail, mmmmmmmmmmm.Note that it is cash only."
3/16/2019,4 star rating,"Food is amazing, customer service needs workThat's why I'm giving a 4 star.This spot has the best Belizean food"
2/29/2020,4 star rating,"Great food... Period, spices, seasoning and especially the fry jacks... mouth watering."
8/2/2018,1 star rating,"Horrible, horrible customer service! Every single time I preorder food I never get it. I called to place an order 35 minutes prior to arrival and when I got there, they did not have my order. Told me they didn't have time to make it. Why have it on the menu if it's an inconvenience for you to make? Also this is not the first incident, they did the same thing while I was pregnant. They claim they don't make panades during the week and tell me to come back on the weekend, get there on the weekend and tell me to come back during the week. The worst customer service ever! And to see I've been a loyal customer for years. I will never recommend this place anymore or go back!"
4/29/2020,5 star rating,"Awesome spot to buy some food when in a rush. Their service is quick, pricing is convenient, Best belizean food I've tried that isn't made from my home. For years I've been hooked. Tracy's is one of the best at what they do, in addition, my family and friends most definitely would attest to this. Had a Belizean breakfast felt like a mini vacay. Everything on the menu is good. Great Food & Service!"
4/24/2020,5 star rating,"This is the a best Belizean food I've ever tasted! Whom ever made the food today was amazing and should continue! I love this place And Eat it about twice a week if anyone has never tried Belizean food,I highly recommend this place"
9/25/2019,5 star rating,"Love this place been coming here for quite some time now I recommend every one to get the stew chicken, rice and beans with extra gravy. Can never go wrong with the oxtail plate and amazing Bollo (Belizean Tamales)."
9/12/2018,4 star rating,"This was a referral.  I don't live in LA, was passing through.  I am not Belizean or even Caribbean, but I am a fan of Caribbean cuisine.  I got the fish plate. It was fried red snapper, served with rice & peas and plantains.  With the entree I had a choice of potato salad or cabbage salad. I got the cabbage salad.  The food was very good.  The rice & beans and plantains were perfectly prepared.  The fish was about 8-12 oz of protein, a pretty generous portion, was well seasoned although a little on the dry side.It was a really hot day, the restaurant had a fan which helped, but no air conditioning. The staff was friendly and attentive.  It was clean, had a TV and was a generally pleasant environment.  Just a warning, not every entree is available every day.  I was hoping to get the pig tail entree, but it wasn't on the menu that day.Overall, the experience was enjoyable. It's clearly not shooting for a formal fine dining clientele, but the food was well executed and the environment felt comfortable.  I plan to go there again."
12/28/2015,3 star rating,"Sigh.... I said I would never go back... But I did. They are so close to my sisters house in the neighborhood where I grew up. The reason I said that I would never go back is because they never have anything, or they run out fast. Their inventory list really needs to improve, but I don't think this will ever change for Tracy's. I have been going to this restaurant since I was a little kid with my parents. The food is my comfort and reminds me of the way I used to eat before I became an adult. I try not to eat a lot of fast food especially when I'm visiting California. So on a Wednesday morning I go in and I order red snapper, beans, and fry Jack and black tea..... But as usual .... No Snappa! Ugh!! Tracy! It's 10am for Christ sake! So I had to have chicken in its place. It was delicious as usual but you know how you have your tastebuds ready for something and you get disappointed? Why?!!! All I'm saying is don't go in to Tracy's expecting to have your belly ready for something because there is a 50/50 chance that they not have it. BUT!! The food is good!"
12/19/2019,5 star rating,Amazing food! Drove from the Inland Empire and it was worth it. Food tastes wonderfully homemade and you can't get enough. Seasoning and portion size is on point for the price! Great customer service too; man at the counter serves your food with a smile. Will definitely be coming back with guests!
7/28/2018,5 star rating,BEANS AND RICE. The best I've ever had. That is all. I prefer their beans and rice compared to Joan's and sisters down the street. Can't wait to try their meat pies and oxtail!
6/2/2018,3 star rating,"My first time eating Belizean food. This restaurant is a tiny family-run operation off busy Western Ave and Exposition Blvd just a couple minutes walk from the Expo Line station on that intersection.I had the chicken meal, and it was a generous serving for the amount I paid. The rice, beans, and potato salad were very tasty (and I don't even like potato salad - I think I prefer the Caribbean way!) and the chicken was well-marinated and easy to eat.However, I wanted the oxtail but they were all sold out by the time I came (around 5pm). They were also completely out of appetizers. I ended up becoming their last customer, as they decided to close right after I finished my meal (They close at 7:30).I would come back but I would come back earlier in the day.I do not recommend coming for dinner. I recommend coming earlier in the day when they have their complete menu available, and to not run the risk of them being closed if they run out of food (which according to other reviews I've seen has happened before)."
10/20/2018,5 star rating,This was my favorite spot growing up! I frequented this place a lot in the 90'sIt's been a while since I've visited. I've called in an order for pickup and can't wait to get home to taste those oxtails
10/20/2017,5 star rating,"Was getting my car serviced and didn't want to cross the street to eat donuts. I saw this place on Yelp, walked in, and just wanted to eat all of it. Since it was breakfast, they didn't have the full menu. The woman in the front was wonderfully patient with me, with that amused this-girl-doesn't-know-anything-about-Belizean-food look. Real questions I asked her: ""What's fried jack? What's hash fish?"" Not only did she answer them verbally, she walked to the back, and brought some back out for me to see it. I ordered that hash fish, and timidly asked if there might be plantains (dinner item). She said sorry, not yet. Well, when the plate came out there were plantains on it! She said she had to make me some since it was clearly my first time there. This is one of those places that build a community around it. I waited by the counter to pay, and saw someone wiping off all the windows and mirrors. I make eye contact with him, he says, ""I don't work here, you gotta wait."" What? This guy just comes in and cleans stuff for them? Turns out he makes the hot sauce they use, but still. And some of the other folks waiting around for their food, they chat it up with that woman in the front (the owner? Is she Tracey? Too shy to ask). The food was good, the small shop vibe was good, the people were good, I'm pretty sure every 5,000 miles when my car needs a tune up, I'll be back here eating."
1/4/2016,5 star rating,I have to say the food here is amazing.I cannot describe it just know your palette will thank you tens times over for this. My only gripe is the parking .  The parking is not fun.The juicy chicken gets my highest recommendation.
8/3/2020,5 star rating,Food is very real not fake tamales very good I will be back when every I wan real authentic belizean food
7/31/2015,5 star rating,"Yesterday, Tracey's hosted the Belize Special Olympics Team!! I can't stress enough how incredible the customers service was. The team were looking for a real Belizean home cooked meal, so my mom and I took them here. We been coming here for over 10 plus year and we don't live in the area. The team said it tasted just like there moms cooking back home in Belize. The three gentlemen that were there cooking, serving and cleaning for us were beyond fantastic. At the end of our meal, they wanted to take pictures with the team and the whole group. The team had a great time and they were extremely happy.Thank you for having us, we'll be back ;)"
6/27/2015,5 star rating,"This place is absolutely amazing. I came here 5 years ago frequently and I really enjoyed their stew chicken, rice & beans, plantains and potato salad. Its really delicious and I am always pleased to come here and get the taste of Belizean food. Every time I pass by they always have a line. Definitely a place to try out and fall in love with. I will be back shortly."

1/25/2018,5 star rating,Great home cooked style Belizean food. Not in the greatest corner of LA but they have Great service. The people running the place are class acts. They are very hospitable and greet you with a smile and appreciation. The Stew Chicken was great. The Stew beans were the best. The plantains were made perfectly. Would definitely come back and definitely recommend it.
6/29/2020,5 star rating,"absolutely delicious. i got the whole fried red snapper with rice and beans and it was a whole culinary experience. please try it out if you're considering it, support local businesses!!!"
9/30/2017,5 star rating,"Oh my Tracey's. Just make sure to check your plate before you leave. I've recently been twice in a month where I didn't get any plantain!!! Best dish has to be the oxtail, rice and beans and potatoe salad. With a drink this will run you about 16.00 bucks (a little pricey but hey I don't want to make it myself). Call in the order ahead of time if you can, otherwise they do their best to get you in and out quick. Seating inside is available. Avoid coming later into the evening as certain menu items run out."
12/8/2016,5 star rating,"This is my boy's pot. Mr. Ferrel. Young and talented man. Bomb food, such amazing hospitality and love which makes me question if we brothers from Belizean the same mothers. One day baby we going to the blue hole in Belize and get lit like this food yall be making! AAAAAAAAA+++++++"

7/19/2019,1 star rating,We accidentally ended here we meant to go to another restaurant but there pictures of their food doesnt match what they offer. Yelp said the where open but they had the doors locked and the staff just looked at us as the sat there.
1/27/2019,4 star rating,"Such a nice family owned business. The people there are respectful, the food is good, and the service is quick. You should go early though because they do tend to run out of certain things. Their prices are pretty decent too."

12/16/2015,4 star rating,The food is always fresh and good.the potato salad could use more peas and carrots. I also enjoy the fact that once food is done it's done. Always fresh abs tasty. Had the rice and bean with chicken and oxtails. You won't be disappointed.
6/27/2018,5 star rating,What more can I say best belizean food on western hands down they never disappoint been a happy customer for years
2/10/2018,2 star rating,"Good customer service. Got the oxtail plate with plantains, and potato salad. Oxtails had good flavor. Rice and peas wouldve been good but I asked for a side of gravy she refused, but offered to put it extra on the rice... seems like she added extra grease so that turned out to be not so good. Plantains were dried and not sweet at all. Potato salad was just ok. Coconut tarts were pretty good. Prolly won't be back."
5/15/2018,4 star rating,My favorite Belizean restaurant. It's so flavorful and the oxtails are so tender. I can't wait until they expand and maybe cater for events.
5/23/2018,5 star rating,"I love Tracey's. Whenever I need to taste that Belizean flavor and my Mom is not in the mood to cook, I come here to get my fix! It's a wonderful 2nd. Nom nom nom nom nom!! Xoxoxo. Love you guys!"
9/20/2018,4 star rating,One of my all around favorite restaurants in los Angeles.. Small but nice little family restaurant.. Friendly service and excellent food from home. Love them people.
8/20/2018,5 star rating,Straight up hit the spot more like hits your soul to its core. No words can describe the flavorful taste of home cooking meal. Definitely always coming back here. 1st timers I recommend eating-in. God bless this place.
7/31/2017,5 star rating,"I'm African, and at the same time a bloody Pan African so that makes me a self proclaimed ambassador of Latin America, and the Caribbean. The thing is about West African, Caribbean, and some Latin Food is you can put them beside each other and won't be able to tell the difference. Therefore I figure it was only right to experience some belizean food. I can say this place this place delivers. You have to get here early though because sometimes the dishes are so in demand that they go pretty quick. With that being Said I was left with the Fish plantain and beans dish. I must say the red snapper was fried to perfection. The plantain was of course sweet and not too soft. The beans and rice were also prepared with care. i was quite content with the pineapple ginger drink they offered too. The staff is real chill and very good. They are always on the go because it seems their food is always in demand.  The desert is just as varied. I was very happy to stumble upon some cassava pudding which topped the delicious fish meal I ate. I now frequent this place, due to the its homemade feel, and the fact that in eating in los angeles I really find less is more."
7/23/2017,4 star rating,Tried their beef rice and beans and it was delicious. Beef patties were good too. The only issue is parking as others have mentioned.
7/7/2017,5 star rating,The best neighborhood spot in South Los Angeles. The chicken and stew beef is what I always order. The food is alway fresh and the staff is always friendly. If your looking a great neighborhood Belizean restaurant  this is the place to go.
7/1/2017,4 star rating,Had the stew chicken and oxtails dinner. Everything was very yummy. The service was friendly and the restaurant is clean. Will be going back again.
5/27/2017,2 star rating,"Every time I go here, they run out of food or they're not serving something because it's the weekend. They'll start off with with ""Hi! We don't have anymore..."". The people are nice, they just run out of food a lot. It's probably best to call in to see if they have what you want than to battle for parking and then come to realize it was a waste of time."

4/7/2017,5 star rating,"Tamales!  Yes, they have bones inside, for those unfamiliar but there was plenty of meat -- tender, flavorful and so good.  Enjoyed the beans, eggs, and fry jack breakfast, too.  The service (the owner's niece) was nice, helpful, quick.  The booths are decent, other patrons friendly.  No one mentioned the coffee in their reviews so I was surprised-- really good, too!"
4/4/2017,5 star rating,"Hands down, the best authentic, belizean cuisine. My favorite dish would have to be everything! From the fried fish with rice and beans to the crab soup someone really blessed the hands that create these amazing meals!"
3/25/2017,5 star rating,"Seriously if yelp had more then 5 stars, Tracey's deserves it!! The best food ever!! There's something about they're stew beef that makes you come back again and again... if you find yourself on western make sure to come through!"
10/30/2012,4 star rating,"I'm coming here for 10 years. It is consistently great. I got there at 12:30.  Lunch is supposed to start at noon. I ordered stew beef and stew chicken dinners for later.  Sucks that the white meat wasn't done yet, so I settlement on the dark meat plate which consists of a leg, thigh and a weird bony back piece. Absent the wired meatless piece of bone, it was so very good!!!  If I lived closer, I'd definitely eat here more often.  It's authentic. It's flavorful. It's just like the home cooked Belizean meals I've had at friends houses that are from Belize."

5/27/2017,2 star rating,"Every time I go here, they run out of food or they're not serving something because it's the weekend. They'll start off with with ""Hi! We don't have anymore..."". The people are nice, they just run out of food a lot. It's probably best to call in to see if they have what you want than to battle for parking and then come to realize it was a waste of time."
7/23/2017,4 star rating,Tried their beef rice and beans and it was delicious. Beef patties were good too. The only issue is parking as others have mentioned.

6/19/2016,4 star rating,I am giving only four stars due to the fact that the portions are a little small on the meat side. However the food was delicious I've never had rice and beans that were so moist and season the ox tails were to die for. I also had the coconut tart that as well was pretty good I am planning to return to this restaurant to order and try other food. Friendly folks also very respectful establishment.
6/9/2016,5 star rating,Hands down the Best Belizean food in L.A. and I've had them all! Order early because they actually run out of food.
10/17/2016,5 star rating,"My hands down favorite restaurant in L.A. All I can say is the food is incredibly tasty, unique, affordable,  filling and undoubtedly worth your time!"

12/7/2015,5 star rating,Diamond in the rough. Simple real food.  Fry Jacks and Beans are the truth. Oxtail stew. Plaintains. Mint green booths. Bringing style to Western.  Learn about it.
11/11/2013,5 star rating,"My mom and I wanted good Belizean food today and we were on a mission!  We heard of another place that we originally wanted to try but womp womp wommmmp  It was closed on Mondays.  I died a lil inside, I really did. Turned to yelp and found Tracey's and headed there.  Not disappointed at all.  I got the chicken, rice with stew beans, potato salad and fried plantain.  It was amazing.  Oh and the Jamaican Pineapple soda gave me life, so yummy!  We took panades, tamales, and bun to-go. The woman that helped us was very nice and everything was soooo good.  We'll definitely go back."
10/3/2013,5 star rating,"I've been coming here for years and it is always delicious. I only ever get oxtails or stewed chicken. Delicious. It comes with a GOOD amount of chicken, potato salad and LOTS of beans and rice. Advice : ask for extra gravy over the rice and beans."
6/15/2016,5 star rating,Omg this is the best Belizean restaurant in LA Good service and they food is just delicious
5/29/2016,3 star rating,First time @ this place staff was very nice had the fish beans and rice will definitely go back soon
10/28/2018,5 star rating,I didn't even finish my plate I was sooo full definitely a place to go when you want a home cooked meal
12/15/2013,4 star rating,"First time trying food from Belize and it was amazing. I got the rice with beans served with beef, potato salad, and plantains. The beef was full of flavor juicy and tender. Seasoned to perfection and paired perfectly with the rice and beans."
2/13/2016,5 star rating,About to get my grub on  I haven't had Belizean food since I've been on my diet (and that's been hard) anyways the rice and beans and stew chicken is the most popular plate here. I'm getting oxtail with white rice and stew beans  might as well go hard on cheat day
6/9/2015,5 star rating,"I love this place! Everything taste good, lol literally. I really like their breakfast food, I usually get fry jack, beans and chicken, or sometimes I get the fried fish. Great customer service w/ very friendly associates. For lunch/dinner I usually get the stew chicken, rice and beans with potato salad but sometimes I get the white rice and stew beans instead of the mixed rice and beans. The oxtail is tender and delicious, and the beef is juicy and full of flavor. I honestly love all the food here. Also they have a lot of great sweets, like bun, tarts, lemon pie, bread pudding etc, I could go on forever! But definitely the go to spot in LA for great authentic Belizean food! :)"
4/27/2016,1 star rating,"Don't be fooled. This place is horrible based on the service alone. We left after almost 10 mins with no service. We drove an hour and fifteen minutes to come here. We walk in, place was dusty and empty. We sat ourselves, 5 tables in the restaurant, no menus, table settings, etc. After about 2 min a gentleman walked out the back exiting and yelled to the back that there was people in the front. The lady from the back yelled, to take a seat which we had done based off the size, emptiness and lack of host. After about 3 mins another gentlemen came from the back and spoke but didn't come from around the counter or offer us any menus, water, silverware etc. No one acknowledged us as customers although we were the only people in the food place. We waited about another 4 mins or so which were long and awkward and walked out. They didn't even know were left. We had no menus, silver, etc. Just a room with empty tables. Seriously, the reviews are biased in my opinion. This place is a complete disappointment. I woudlnt go back if it was free. I tried to give it a chance regardless of the dusty tables and lack of service. Enter at your own risk."
3/12/2017,1 star rating,I used to love Tracys. I went there probably at least once a week. That is until I found a ROACH in my Food!!!!! The food is good but just make sure you check your food for ROACHES!
7/31/2017,5 star rating,"I'm African, and at the same time a bloody Pan African so that makes me a self proclaimed ambassador of Latin America, and the Caribbean. The thing is about West African, Caribbean, and some Latin Food is you can put them beside each other and won't be able to tell the difference. Therefore I figure it was only right to experience some belizean food. I can say this place this place delivers. You have to get here early though because sometimes the dishes are so in demand that they go pretty quick. With that being Said I was left with the Fish plantain and beans dish. I must say the red snapper was fried to perfection. The plantain was of course sweet and not too soft. The beans and rice were also prepared with care. i was quite content with the pineapple ginger drink they offered too. The staff is real chill and very good. They are always on the go because it seems their food is always in demand.  The desert is just as varied. I was very happy to stumble upon some cassava pudding which topped the delicious fish meal I ate. I now frequent this place, due to the its homemade feel, and the fact that in eating in los angeles I really find less is more."
4/19/2018,5 star rating,"The food is bomb, get there before the late afternoon.. they run out of certain things toward the end of the day. I'm always craving the stew chicken or ox tails with potato salad, rice and beans.... the best."
2/7/2018,5 star rating,"Good place for the first time experience.. will going back for their plate, big portion that you can share. Tamales have good amount of meat. Very nice"
1/19/2009,5 star rating,"If you've read my past reviews and followed my quest to find the best oxtail stew in town, then you'll understand where I'm coming from. As of January 2009, this hole-in-the-wall restaurant serves the best oxtail stew in LA... This is confirmed by popular demand of the masses which cause this little restaurant to sell out on oxtail stew before 3pm.It's such a special spot because they only carry certain things each day... a brilliant business model. Their daily goal is to sell out on all items they're serving and they're cash only. Once they've sold out on everything then they close their shop. How brilliant is that? They'd never have to worry about throwing away unsold food or paying high credit card transaction fees. And they're in high demand enough that they're not worried about turning away their fans when things sell out. Its popularity is shaped through word of mouth. And most people know already that if you don't get there early you might not even make it for leftovers.The people who go there are just as loyal as their stomachs. Within the first 5 minutes I was there already a couple of frequenters made suggestions from the menu. They speak of the food as if they live and breathe the food. And the staff were so friendly and willing to take the time to explain to me what each dish is made out of. They even gave me some free samples to taste.If you're about to head here you might want to have about $20 in cash. I highly recommend the oxtail stew, the garnaches and the tamales. I also tried their Jamaican Kola Champagne (which tastes like creamed soda with a twist) that was so refreshing in the 80 degree heat in south central. I will have to come back another time for their breakfast specials. To be continued..."

2/20/2011,1 star rating,"My cousins and I were in the mood for Belizean food but we didn't want to bother our Gramma with making us panades. So we figured the time for her to go to the store and get all the ingredients and make the panades would be the same amount of time for us to travel from Orange County to LA. My aunt and dad said this place was better than Joans & Sister so my cousins and I decided to give it a try. When we got there the girl behind the counter was really rude. I'm not sure if it's because I don't speak creole or because I was slightly dressed up, but her attitude needed to be in check. Apparently to our surprise they dont serve panades on weekends (we went on a Saturday). Since they didnt have what we wanted, there really was no other reason for us to stay. We ended up at Joans & Sisters getting a dozen panades for $10. Because we weren't able to actually eat at the restaurant I can't really rate the food. The one star is for the rude serious, wish I could give no stars at all. Joans & Sisters and Ella's are always filled with the nice workers."
4/28/2016,4 star rating,I had dinner tonight and I would like to say my food was perfectly tasted but it t took me to wait my food about 45 minutes and it was carry out also. My plate had a very nice and tasty potato salad wit rice and beans on side plus main entree was chicken perfectly cooked and tasty. Very good place around this area.
7/7/2017,5 star rating,The best neighborhood spot in South Los Angeles. The chicken and stew beef is what I always order. The food is alway fresh and the staff is always friendly. If your looking a great neighborhood Belizean restaurant  this is the place to go.
12/7/2014,5 star rating,Me and my family have been going to Tracey for Quite some times  now and when ever I or my family go to LA to visit friends or to buy Belizean food supplies or  celebration or we pass by( coming from the Sfv) we usually stop to grab  some good home Belizean meal from Tracey.The food good and I have never had a issue with their service.  The rice and bean and stew beef is delicious. If I wasn't paying for a meal I would be ask for seconds ;) .
11/16/2017,4 star rating,"Stew chicken, rice and peas with a side of potato salad is all I eat when I order from Tracey. Usually hits the spot when I have a taste for some for rice and peas."
2/1/2015,5 star rating,"Super awesome first visit for me this beautiful Sunday afternoon.  Customer service is refreshingly pleasant. The oxtails, rice & beans , ginger beer and bread pudding tantalize the tastebuds! Pure heaven. This will definitely be a regular stop for me."
3/2/2012,4 star rating,I love Tracey's i have been wanting it for such a long time! i finally got it the service was awsome. The neighborhood is not that bad as long as you know where you are. The stew chicken was bomb!! the potato salad..eh not so much..for one it was warm like my food for two there was NO peas!!! the rice and beans are great not the best but pretty damn good lol...all and all i give them a 9/10 as far as belizean resturants go but nothing is ever better than some authentic belizean food from home lol
12/7/2016,5 star rating,Saw the positive reviews and decided to have lunch here today. Wow the stew beef plate with rice and potatoes was fantastic. Great flavor & quality; I have bookmarked and will definitely return.
8/11/2010,5 star rating,My parents were patrons of Tracey's restaurant long before I was born.  I have been a consistent customer for the last 23 years.  Their food is my version of a Thanksgiving dinner.  I have been trying to recreate some of her recipes but no luck.  Everyone should stop in and try the stewed beef and rice and beans plate. They only accept cash.
12/17/2011,3 star rating,"Cash only.  Street parking.  In a rough neighborhood.  Not knowing anything about Belizean food I thought it was ok.  We ordered oxtail, stewed beef, stewed chicken, and chicken tamale.  Chicken tamale is spicy and the weird thing is that they actually put the entire piece of chicken- bone and all inside the tamale!  Regardless, it was still good.  I really enjoyed the rice.  Each plate comes with rice (dirty rice?), potato salad, plantain, and the entree.  I guess it's reasonably priced considering the time and effort needed to prepare the meat.  Tamale was $3 which is expensive. I have to think twice before coming back because it's in such a bad neighborhood."
2/3/2014,4 star rating,"Love this place the rice and beans are the best in the business, try the oxtails you can't go wrong and for dessert the jam roll. I've been going to Tracys since the doors opened"
4/4/2017,5 star rating,"Hands down, the best authentic, belizean cuisine. My favorite dish would have to be everything! From the fried fish with rice and beans to the crab soup someone really blessed the hands that create these amazing meals!"
9/11/2012,5 star rating,"Tracey's is the best restaurant to get Belizean food, I've tried others and none of them compare. You can't go wrong with the rice and beans with stew chicken plate. The crab soup is to die for, but it can be a little too spicy for my taste sometimes. And their tamales are delicious.Whenever I'm in LA Tracey's is on my list of places to go. Get there early though because they only make enough food for that day and they run out fast."
10/2/2013,4 star rating,"Good Belizean food with good home-style service. I switched over from Joan and Sisters to Tracy's after my last few chicken dinners (rice and beans, stew chicken, pot salad) where tasteless. Tracy's hasn't disappointed me on taste yet. To be fair the only down side is the parking. There are other businesses on that street so there isn't always a space available. That's no different from most of the other Belizeans spots in L.A. tho."
5/10/2014,2 star rating,"I really don't know what the hype is about this place. The service is super slow, they only have about half what's on the menu and the food is ok. I've had much better Caribbean food in this area. We has the oxtail and the crab soup. Ok for both. But the rice was terrible. The white rice for the soup was dry and the rice and beans that came with the oxtail tasted burned. They gave me the food to go when I ordered to dine in. It took forever to get it and for the soup they gave me a fork. When I asked for a spoon they said you don't get one with take out orders, when I told them I was dining in they gave me a teaspoon. I saw several belizean restaurants nearby so there are other options out there will not come back to this one. Too bad it's family owned. I like to support those business."
2/5/2017,5 star rating,I visited this restaurant twice this weekend on both occasions the service was great the food was great I would definitely recommend this place.
5/14/2014,4 star rating,"It was our first time trying Belizean Food. I agree with the reviews the food is very flavorful, the stewed chicken was falling off the bone, so good! And the beef was so yummy I got the rice with beans, which my bf liked a lot better than the white rice and beans. The fried banana was so good. The staff was very helpful, and super sweet. Def. try their Inca Cola. The restaurant is not in the nicest part of town, so if you're expecting a high class place, you might want to skip. My bf and I love hole in the wall restaurants we often find the best food in places that you'd least expect. Give them a try, they are super!"
7/23/2013,4 star rating,"I had the stew chicken and beans with plantains and rice, as well as the yummy champagne soda (coconut, non-alcoholic) on Sunday at lunch time.  Coconut tart to go for dessert later in the afternoon.  The food was tasty, especially with the homemade onion sauce and the service was friendly and helpful.  Good reggae tunes playing. Interesting part of town, but I felt very safe and comfortable here as a lone stranger.  First time I've had Belizean food, so I can't speak to the authenticity, but I enjoyed it and would certainly come back if I was in the area."
6/3/2012,5 star rating,"I'm always looking for some down home cooked Belizean food and with my family so spread out over Southern Calif it's truly hard to get the best Belizean home cook meal, until I came across Tracey's!! This is the best ever, it's so close to my Unc Glenn's homestyle belizean food and i love the fact that they have the famous Marie Sharps hot sauce tooooo!! You can't find a better place in town unless ya family is making this from scratch for ya at home."
7/16/2011,4 star rating,"I have been to Tracey's about 3 times and each time I am very happy with how friendly the staff is there. They have the best belizean food in LA, I travel all the way from LB just to get me a plate of oxtail stew, rice/beans. plantains, and potato salad with the pineapple soda....It's sooo good it reminds me of my Unc Glenn home cooked belizean food, Love this place!!!"
6/6/2016,5 star rating,I drive all the way from San Diego to get good belizean food and I love coming to this restaurant. I always get amazing food and great customer service from Floyd and Brian.
1/31/2015,4 star rating,My goodness my goodness where do I begin. The picky and selective eater and me would not let me ever try Belizean food. A friend of mine suggested that we go grab lunch here. I was very skeptical. The area the parking is a little bit of a mess. Once you walk inside it has a cool little laid-back atmosphere but staff which was the girlfriend a son at the time I visited and miss Tracy were so nice and the food was pretty good. I actually ate it all. They were very patient with me I changed my order like 3 times and then decided on the first thing they recommended.  Very good and will be back!
5/11/2016,5 star rating,"I got no complaints about this place other than the food is really,really GOOD. I will definitely let my friends and family know about Tracy's Belizean Food.."
1/31/2013,5 star rating,Absolutely the best Belizean restaurant!!!! I live for the fry jack and beans on a nice Saturday morning :)The stew chicken and rice and beans are on point. I seriously recommend
1/21/2018,3 star rating,the food is good the customer service is great my only minus would be the amount of Ox Tails you get for the price and also the fact that they often get the order wrong
3/24/2015,1 star rating,"THe food is ok, but I can't take this place. They are always running out of something. Then they won't tell you that they ran out sometimes. If you order one thing they'll give you what they have left or whatever they want. I ordered a stew bean, rice and chicken plate with counch flitters and when I got home I realized they gave me oxtails and varna he's. They said they ran out of chicken when I called them."
12/12/2013,5 star rating,"Love this place! My honey is from Belize, and every time we are in LA, this is our first stop. Fry fish is my fave! Potato pound for dessert for my man, every time."
3/30/2012,4 star rating,"I love Tracey's. It is the best tasting Belizean restaurant that nearly every Belizean knows about. Outside of my family's cooking not a lot of my friends have experienced Belizean cuisine and I love introducing people to my culture, however, unless you live in the LA area it's hard to find a decent Belizean restaurant. This one is my go to. Tracey's runs out of food early so get there before 2 or call and ask what they have left. The service in here is not usually the service with a smile you get at pelican or Nel & Jon, but I guess if you're the best then it doesn't matter."
3/12/2012,4 star rating,"If your from belize you shouldnt care too much about customer service. ALL the Belizean restaurants in this area have jacked up service, so over look that. Traceys has the best well rounded menu than all the other belizean restaurants in the area. you won't be disappointed with anything you order. I just go with the stew chicken, gets the job done and their conch fritters are amazing."
11/21/2012,4 star rating,"Man, I love this place. I just had the rice and beans, stew chicken, plantains, and potato salad. My dad had the ox tail for meat and everything else I had. He ate the whole plate of food. This is one of our favorite Belizean places to get food from."
10/2/2011,5 star rating,"Chicken with rice and peas! After visiting Belize in 2003, I fell in love with wonderful Caribbean cuisine and the warmness of the culture.  Tracy's has been around for a long time and it never, ever disappoints. The chicken is always moist and stewed to perfection! They give you a generous helping of rice and beans and some potato salad on the side. And of course, you must douse the  infamous carrot-based Marie Sharps hot sauce on everything,  The chef is super nice and friendly making everyone that comes into the restaurant feel welcome.  If you are a true foodie and aim to seek out and explore authentic cuisine, Tracy's is the treat you are looking for!"
11/2/2013,5 star rating,Food is delicious.  Had the stewed beef with beans and fry jacks.  Great portion sizes. Food was seasoned and tasty. Place has the feel of a small family restaurant.  Tastes like home cooked meals. Will be coming back.
2/19/2014,5 star rating,"Their food is the absolute BEST!!  From the stewed chicken to the oxtails, to the Panades with the onion sauce.  Perfect rice and beans!!! and potato salad.  Everything seasoned to perfection.  Don't forget to get you buns as well!!!"
3/30/2010,5 star rating,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! They are known for the best Belizean food in town! If you have not tried it, you won't go wrong with their Stew Chicken plate. It comes with rice and beans, potato salad and plantains! Sigh... I can taste it now!!! If you want to be a little bit more adventurous, try their Oax Tail plate!!! They also have Kola Champagne (Jamaican Soda), Creme Soda, Pineapple... DELICIOUS!!!!"

8/25/2010,5 star rating,"DELICIOSO! This place has the best food. I have been there several times. I love their stew chicken w/ rice beans, potatoe salad & plantains! I drive 40 mins to get there but its so worth it. It really is addicting once you try it. LOVE IT! and the portions are great!"
11/13/2011,4 star rating,"I love Tracey's Belizean cuisine. I've been familiar with Belizean cuisine for the past two years . From what I've had there-I truly enjoy it. I like there tamales filled with very tender dark meat filled with cooked mixed vegetables (peas, carrots,green beans,peppers). They have great rice and beans and potato salad. The stew chicken is a big portion . The gravy is delicious , so make sure you get extra for the chicken breast because it may be a little dry if you don't. They also have Ox-tail (which I've never tried). I love the fish pandas with hot sauce or the onion sauce! delicious ! They are fried maza filled with canned fish. t's a great lunch or dinner spot. I would NOT recommend eating there. It is a take out place for sure and in a bad area close to Inglewood. I would also call ahead before going to pick up your food :-). Authentic belizean food! I live with Belizeans and they love it! SO I assume it's pretty authentic . Street parking also"
