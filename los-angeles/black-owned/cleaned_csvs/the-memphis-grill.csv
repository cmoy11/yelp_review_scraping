4/23/2020,20200423,5,5.0,"Everything we had was really good. The pulled pork was juicy, the chicken fell of the bone, the sauce was sweet and spicy and the garlic mashed potatoes were fantastic. I am so happy to have a new good place within walking distance to my house."
4/27/2020,20200427,4,4.5,"It's a real BBQ. I ordered the 2 types of meat and 2 sides combo which was 21 dollars all in. I had the pulled pork and the chicken. They were already out of the brisket when I got there at 1:15 pm.  For my sides, collard greens and mac and cheese.I ordered everything with BBQ sauce on the side since I wanted to taste the meat. It took a while for the food to come out even though I was really the only customer.Portion sizes were on the small side.BBQ was fine. Good, but not incredible. Certainly better than anything else in the area. BBQ sauces were both good.Both sides were excellent. You get a third of a cup of each. The cornbread was sweet.All in all, a decent meal."
5/14/2020,20200514,5,4.67,"Finally! Good Bar-B-Que you don't have to drive to West Adams to get. Memphis Grill has been on my radar for a while now and I was so happy to see they finally opened.The staff here is so friendly and welcoming it made waiting for my to go order a pleasure. I ordered a half rack with two sides: mac & cheese and collard greens, and for dessert sweet potato whoppee pie. Let me tell you everything was fresh and lip smacking good.The greens were perfectly seasoned and not vinegary which sometimes happens at BBQ spots in LA. You can really taste the natural flavor of the collards which was nice. There were also bits of meat in the greens like they do down south. The mac & cheese is made with five different types of cheeses and you can tell they did not skimp because it was cheesy and buttery. I even enjoyed the sweet potato whoppee pie which had a nicely flavored cream cheese middle.The main event were the baby back ribs. Let me tell you these had to be the meatiest baby backs I've every had. Tender, succulent and flavorful. My order came with 5 ribs; you get a choice of Memphis dry rub or wet with BBQ sauce. I got sauce which came with two small containers of extra sauce one hot and the other mild or medium. I poured some of the hot sauce on top of the sauce already on the ribs and it was a perfect marriage of spicy goodness. Note: the hot bbq sauce wasn't set your mouth on fire hot. You could still enjoy the flavor of the meat and sauce. All-in-all Memphis Grill was everything I hoped it would be and is definitely a welcomed addition to the neighborhood. It's less than a block from from In & Out. For a few dollars more go get yourself a real, hearty meal."
5/23/2020,20200523,5,4.75,"I love this place and the people working there.The food is awesome.I had the brisket with mashed potatoes, collard greens.So delicious.You must try them out. You won't be sorry."
5/23/2020,20200523,4,4.6,"Great ribs and an obvious passion for bbq, is a great combination! So glad this new spot opened up near me. So far I've tried the pork ribs and mac n cheese. Both of which my family and I really enjoyed. I'm looking forward to trying their pulled pork and smoked chicken! Also one of the few places that offer Sweet Tea :-)Easy pick up, friendly faces and delicious food."
5/23/2020,20200523,2,4.17,"I decided to try this spot after seeing a friend post about it on Instagram. I trekked from downtown LA to NOHO excited for a new BBQ restaurant in LA. I phones ahead to place my order. The customer service over the phone was great. I ordered 1/2 rack of ribs, potato salad, candied yams with a 1/2 pound side of brisket. I arrived 30 mins later and as promised my order was ready and packed perfectly. I paid via Cashapp -- I love contactless payment options and $42 later I was headed home to enjoy, so I thought.Now, the food. The ribs were underwhelming, I got them dry with sauce on the side. Upon first bite, I notices that the smoke flavor was minimal and the meat was gray, which signaled to me that the ribs were likely boiled or steamed prior to smoking. There was no discernible smoke ring. For me this is a no-no, especially at $17 for a half rack -- no shortcuts. The brisket was marginally better, the flavor was good, texture a bit weird. Whole Foods' smoked brisket is much better and cheaper. The candied yams are their specialty-- unfortunately they were cloyingly sweet which meant I couldn't eat more than a half teaspoon. The flavor is good but way too sweet. My plan is to bake a sweet potato and use theirs as seasoning. The corn muffin was dry, tastes of flour and not pleasant at all. The start of the meal was the potato salad. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and there was a good balance of tart, sweet, creamy and herbaceous. However, 4 ounces of any side is a joke especially for $4 -$5. I really wanted to love this place. I've been to Memphis several times and this spot would last 15 minutes in Memphis. I don't mind paying for good food but this meal was completely overpriced at $42, if it were $27, this would be a 3-star review. I hope they can adjust."
5/23/2020,20200523,5,4.29,"I've had the pleasure of having takeout from The Memphis Grill twice now and let me tell you - it is delicious! I've had BBQ from local favorite spots in Clarksdale, Mississippi, Birmingham, Alabama, and Durham, North Carolina. This BBQ is at least as good as anything I've had in the south. So far I've had the brisket, pulled pork, chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, candied yams, garlic mashed potatoes, and collard greens. I'm looking forward to the baby back ribs for next time."
5/23/2020,20200523,5,4.38,"I moved from Kansas City a little over two years ago and have been on the hunt for good BBQ in the Valley ever since. I've retired a few places, but The Memphis Grill is my new go-to when I get a craving. I tried the brisket, pulled pork and ribs, all of which were great. However, the brisket was some of the best I've ever had. The sandwich was stacked nice and tall, and the side of macaroni was out of this world! The coleslaw is worth mentioning as well! I recommend this place to anyone anytime the topic of BBQ joints comes up."
5/30/2020,20200530,2,4.11,"Extremely overpriced for what you get. Incredibly small portions and my chicken was extremely dry. Very nice people who run the place, but it's just not affordable for us. $40 for two people is pretty pricey for takeout. Wish we could give it a better review. We were so looking forward to their opening."
6/2/2020,20200602,3,4.0,"My wife and I shared the 3-meat meal (brisket, pulled pork, tri tip) with collard greens and canned yams as the sides. We also got a small side of coleslaw. The total was $31.00. We had no issues about the food whatsoever, everything was delicious! And the service was very friendly. But I'll agree with other reviewers here that the portions are small. I could eat the entire 4 oz. coleslaw in 4 large bites. At $4, that's $1 per bite - gourmet sweets price range. The sides that come with the meal are also the 4 oz. size and the meat portions are underwhelming. Luckily we requested extra BBQ sauce (the spicy is excellent) and used it on other suitable meats at home to finish the meal. And we both are slim by the way. But if you don't care about portions, then you should enjoy this place."
6/6/2020,20200606,5,4.09,"Incredible food! Large serving sizes and everything is made to order. The chicken was juicy, the hot link was just the right amount of spicy and the candied yams melted in my mouth. I couldn't recommend this place more and will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu!"
6/6/2020,20200606,5,4.17,"OMG!! The best food I have had in a long time. The couple that owns this new bbq place in North Hollywood are so nice and the food is out of this world. We had the tri tip,baby back ribs, and the chicken. For our sides we chose garlic mashed potatoes and the Mac and cheese and it came with corn bread. I have picky eaters in my house and every one was happy and full. We have leftovers for tomorrow too!! If you looking to help support local small business and you like great food , you gotta check them out. Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu."
6/9/2020,20200609,5,4.23,Some really great barbecue! The trip tip was excellent and their sauce is v tasty. The sweet tea was the best I've had this side of the Mississippi. An amazing couple putting in hard work and passion to get people fed!
6/9/2020,20200609,5,4.29,This place is amazing!! Ordered one of the group sized meals and everything was just incredible. Great price for the quality too. We'd been looking for a great BBQ joint in the neighborhood - so happy this one is so close.
6/9/2020,20200609,5,4.33,Amazing BBQ! The owners are clearly super passionate about the food they make and it shows. My roommates and I ordered takeout and we all agreed that it was some of the best BBQ we've ever had. The tri-tip was so juicy and the flavor was off the charts! Excellent service. Phenomenal food made with love. We will definitely be coming back!
6/12/2020,20200612,5,4.38,"Two words:1. Black owned2. Fire!!So happy to have found this gem in my neighborhood. I called before they were open (I didn't know) but they took my order anyway. As soon as I walked to get my order, they knew who I was and was very sweet to me. Food is delicious. Def recommend. Please support!!"
6/14/2020,20200614,5,4.41,"I've been looking for the best BBQ in the Valley, I found a really promising spot in Van Nuys and didn't think I'd find anything that'll top that place. Like everyone else I have been waiting on The Memphis Grill to open up but no fault of theirs just about every restaurant was closed so to the current state we are in with the whole Corona Virus, anyway when I found out they opened I knew I had to make my way over to this new place in North Hollywood, after three days of trying to place an order I finally got through. Now I had no idea the menu was limited when I first called which again is no fault of theirs, it just shows how many people have been going to this spot, so although I have been here a couple of times, the photo I'm posting was from my first trip, I ordered bbq chicken with mashed potatoes and potato salad, it also came with a piece of corn bread, the whole plate was amazing, that's about all I can say about that, I'm giving this my highest recommendation on BBQ spots in the entire city of L.A. Chef Manu was maning the food, the couple times I've gone he would glance up and say ""welcome"" or ""hello"" than right back to prepping the food and I loved that, that man is on a mission to make sure every plate he was making had his full attention. So again I recommend anyone and everyone to check this spot out."
6/22/2020,20200622,5,4.44,Amazing BBQ. Worth every penny. Highly recommend if you're in the valley and looking for your new BBQ spot. Ribs and brisket are to die for.
6/22/2020,20200622,5,4.47,"We ordered beef ribs for father's day for 9 people.  We opted for racks of the ribs. They were perfectly seasoned and cooked. The meat was tender and, unlike big beef ribs, was not fatty nor greasy. Call ahead and make sure Manu has them. We also ordered Mac n cheese, coleslaw  candied yams, and the corn muffins - all of which were perfection. I recommend larges of all sides because the large isn't that big - each is good only for 3 ppl. I'm so happy to have found Memphis Grill and look forward to trying the chicken, brisket and tri tip. My advice would be to place your order in advance instead of walking in - they get busy. So glad to have a real barbecue place in valley where food is not greasy or heavy."
6/23/2020,20200623,5,4.5,"The food is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, the barbecue is excellent. Make sure to place your order really early in the day, we called in our order at 4:30pm and they told us it would be ready at 8:30pm. They were a little overwhelmed with Father's Day and ran out of a few things. But they were so kind and gracious and apologetic, and the food was EXCELLENT"
6/23/2020,20200623,5,4.52,"Me and the Wife went to this place called the Memphis Grill in North Hollywood, on Fathers Day.This Is a Black owned Place.We both ordered 1 half Rack of Ribs, ,Wife ordered: Collard Greens Yams ,Hot link. I ordered: Beef Brisket, with a Hot link,Memphis 5 Mac and Cheese ,,Candied Yams. They had for Desert calked Whoopie Pie- it was like a Cinnamon test, with filling in the middle(was really delicious!) Me and thecWife really enjoyed the food, it was like Down home Southern Style Meal, We recommend this place, and will be going back again!"
6/28/2020,20200628,5,4.55,By far the best food experience I've had since the onset of covid. The pork and brisket were tender and flavorful and these folks were so kind and generousAll in all wonderful food served by wonderful people!! Cant recommend highly enoughEDIT: I JUST FOUND THE SIDE OF DRIPPINGS THEY GAVE ME FOR THE BRISKET 10 stars out of 5
6/28/2020,20200628,5,4.57,"A friend recommended this place to me and I loved it! My brisket was so tender, and the pulled pork was delicious. I loved their sauce. Because they're a new business and getting settled during this crazy time, I recommend calling your order in as it may take a little while to get ready (they'll text when it's ready) but it's well worth it. I'll be back soon!"
7/4/2020,20200704,1,4.42,horrible service. No business. When you walk up to order they are only honoring pre orders from previous days? So basically your not a restaurant? No walk up orders? Skip. Run away. Dont waste your time.
7/10/2020,20200710,5,4.44,Long wait so worth it brisket to die for collar greens so good just like grandma's everything melts in your mouth
7/12/2020,20200712,5,4.46,"This place is a little hard to find, but is worth the effort. The meat is so tender when it comes out of the smoker. There are many kinds of BBQ, but I think they do Memphis style right.The variety on the menu complements each other. Make sure to get your order in early, because a line will form fast and they may sell out. The best sign of quality food is that it takes time to make. It is an investment that is worth it. Their safety measures are also very appropriate. I look forward to returning."
7/16/2020,20200716,5,4.48,The Memphis Grill is a very special place. Their bbq is just unparalleled in the Valley and the service is incredible. Every time I go to pick up food the love and attention to detail is so clear! These guys started in the middle of a pandemic and are just killing it. The brisket is INCREDIBLE but don't sleep on the hot links! You've got a lifelong customer in me
7/16/2020,20200716,5,4.5,We tried this place and absolutely loved it! The owners are lovely and are doing everything just the two of them since they opened during the pandemic. We will be coming back for sure.
7/17/2020,20200717,5,4.52,"I can tell many of these reviews don't follow The Memphis Grill on social media. If you did, you'd read the daily updates about their quality ingredients, the immediate updates regarding unforeseen technical issues, and the passion and dedication to provide a quality experience.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich Memphis style with potato salad and mac n cheese on the side, half a rack of bbq ribs with cornbread. The sandwich was delicious! I added some sauce that I ordered on the side and it was like the cherry on top! The coleslaw (which I don't normally ever eat) was soo good!!!! I will be ordering this again once I work my way around the menu, I plan on trying everything on their menu. The ribs were delicious! Smoked and crisp, they slid off the bone after a few bites and were juicy which I love!!!!!! Can't have no dry ribs. The potato salad was also delicious! I don't know what the secret ingredients are, must be love! A lot of places just cook their food like nothing. This is all made to order from a dedicated family. The mac n cheese was okay, better than most places I'd say. For everything I ordered, including a coke, $40 was not bad! You have to understand this restaurant is pick up only due to the current circumstance. Otherwise, we'd be in there dining in. It's about time north hollywood got some delicious bbq! The customer service was great, I love the warm welcome and the assistance from placing my first order. My husband was more than happy as well! We'll be supporting this business and vouch for them!"
7/17/2020,20200717,5,4.53,"Absolutely amazing bbq. The meat is juicy, tender, and has just the right amount of caramelization. The brisket is moist, the tri tip is like butter, and the pulled pork barely even needs bbq sauce (though the sauce is also excellent). The candied yams did not skimp on the molasses flavor and the mac and cheese is everything you want from a bbq place. Make sure you get the iced tea, it has an earl grey flavor to it!Be patient on the phone lines since it's just the two of them, and make sure you keep an eye on their hours of operation via their instagram."
7/17/2020,20200717,5,4.55,"YUM!!! Finally had a chance to swing by yesterday. The smell when you walk up is incredible and the taste did not disappoint. I had the Tri Tip sandwich and potato salad, but also tried some of my significant others meal (brisket, hot link, Mac & cheese). And I grabbed the last Whoopi Pie (OMG so good). Definitely recommend if you are looking for some good BBQ!!"
7/18/2020,20200718,5,4.56,This is the best BBQ we have had in LA. Highly recommend! The ribs were fall off the bone perfection! We will be back for sure!
7/22/2020,20200722,5,4.58,Love this spot' Rum by the sweetest couple. The bbq is outstanding. I could eat there everyday.  They opened during a really tough time and are doing great. You can tell that bbq is a passion for them
7/26/2020,20200726,5,4.59,"SO GOOD! Worth the wait. Luckily we live close by and can wait from home. I recommend calling in your order. The operation is small but through the service and the food you can tell that great care is taken for everything.We called in around 12:30 and were told the next available pickup was 1:30. We ordered tri-tip, pulled pork, a rack of ribs and Mac and cheese. We were told that ribs would t be ready until 3:30 so we decided to eat part of order for lunch, run some errands and grab the ribs for dinner. We had a delicious day.If you're not lucky enough to live close by be prepared and be flexible. They were very good about managing our expectations for wait time. It seems like meat comes out in small batches so it's possible the thing you want may not be available until later.Food was excellent! Meat was tender and flavorful. The ribs were my favorite. You can tell that they take great pride in the food they make here. It's high quality and well worth the wait. We'll be back!"
7/26/2020,20200726,5,4.6,"After seeing so many rave reviews about this place on a few different social media sites, I decided to give it a try last night, just under an hour before closing. Of course, being a good BBQ place, they were out of a couple things that close to closing time, but still, what I got did not disappoint! The brisket and the tri-tip were both super tender and the BBQ sauce is a perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and tangy. Mac and cheese was good, as were collard greens (I find that a lot of places make them really salty, but these were perfectly seasoned). I will definitely be back to try the ribs and the candied yams, which is what they were out of last night. Super friendly staff, too."
8/1/2020,20200801,5,4.61,"The BBQ is delicious at The Memphis Grill. Meats melt in your mouth. Family favorites: baby back ribs (mouth watering!), tri tip, brisket. Sides favs: yams, Mac n Cheese and coleslaw. I'm not sure who has better yams my grandma or Memphis Grill. This is the best BBQ in North Hollywood and SFV! Perfection."
8/3/2020,20200803,5,4.62,"My new favorite bbq spot in town!!!! This husband and wife team are not only personable, sweet, and friendly they really know their barbeque/smoked foods!!!! Been ordering for pick up once a week and going through the menu. Can't wait to keep going and trying more. The baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, tri-tip, yumyum heaven! The sides are great - omg, the baked beans are delish! Thank you guys for being open during this pandemic!!!! Happy to keep supporting you."
8/7/2020,20200807,4,4.61,"Very good flavors! I had tri tip, pulled pork, mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, and Lemonade. I bbq a lot at home and for events, and I can tell everything was home made. The only thing I would say is the pulled pork was mushy. It had good flavor, but the consistency was off. Other than that, everything was great!"
8/8/2020,20200808,3,4.56,"Really delicious and people are super friendly! Only problem is they tell you your food is ready, you show up to get it, they say it'll be 5 more minutes and you're waiting another 30min-1hr. Because it's not reliable, I won't be returning- this is the 2nd time I've experienced this here. But if you're willing to wait, the food is truly great!"
8/9/2020,20200809,5,4.58,"Happened to drive by The Memphis Grill earlier today. Decided to look it up on Yelp and BBQ sounded good for dinner. Took a look at the menu and went to their Instagram page. Low and behold it's LA Black Restaurant week, and The Memphis Grill is black owned, who opened on 04/20/2020. Due to Covid-19 placed a pick up order via phone. The gal that answered the phone was so pleasant. She immediately let me know what meats and sides were available for the day. She also mentioned that they only accept cash, or zelle at this time. Placed my order for the 3 meats and 2 sides plate. TriTip, Brisket and Pulled pork, with Mac and cheese and yams, which also included a corn bread muffin. I was told due to the number of orders it would take 45 minutes for my order to be ready. No problem. Arrived 45 minutes later and my food was ready. I was greeted by the gal that answered the phone and the owner. They were both so pleasant. The food was packed and the container Saran wrapped to prevent leakage! I whole heartedly appreciate this because i can't tell you how many times I've had spillage in the bag.Now onto the food. Immediately opened the box in the car. The food smelled divine! The taste epic. The pulled pork was moist and flavorful. My favorite was the Brisket. Melt in your mouth! Perfect ratio of meat to fat. Even the TriTip was delicious! The sides did not disappoint.I saw earlier posts that complained about the portions. I thought the portions were plentiful! I have left overs for a second meal. I will be back! Thank you for the delicious food, hospitality and the love you put into your work! You've got a customer in me! A"
8/10/2020,20200810,5,4.59,"I'm pretty picky about my BBQ; my family is southern, and I'm used to the best. They do it well here. Come for the ribs, stay for the sweet potato whoopie pies and really great customer service."
8/12/2020,20200812,5,4.6,"Support a small business and while at it get yourself some bomb bbq! I've tried the pulled pork sandwich and it was soo good, wish I wouldve gotten the 1/2lb instead. The coleslaw tasted fresh and the beans had a nice smokey flavor to them. To avoid waiting I called ahead to place my order and they were super friendly."
8/15/2020,20200815,5,4.6,"BBQ heaven.The brisket is beyond tender, the ribs are perfectly done, and all the side dishes have been top notch.We called ahead with a big order. Got our questions answered, our order placed, and when I arrived later that evening, everything was ready to go.They're taking good safety precautions as well, so I may have a new favorite spot for takeout. Next time gonna try one of their pulled pork sandwiches...Follow them on IG for their latest updates, and get. yourself. over. here."
8/16/2020,20200816,5,4.61,"We ordered 3 meals for pick up. It was all amazing! We have ordered there before and will certainly be back. The pulled pork, pork loin, brisket, hot links, ribs, mashed potatoes, smoked beans, Cole slaw will all be on our regular-order list for next time very soon!!!"
8/19/2020,20200819,5,4.62,"Oh my word, this is IT, y'all! The owners are SO nice and friendly and you feel so welcomed and taste the love in every bite of their food.I've only had their tri-tip and their pulled pork (those are my faves‍ what can I say) We got the sandwiches memphis style (you must do it, their homemade slaw is so delicious and I DON'T EVEN LIKE SLAW!!! But this one is incredible! I can't imagine it without it. The meat has so much flavor and is so tender and delicious. I swear I think about it at least once a day. I've tried the hot and the regular bbq sauces and I have to say the regular wins for me, hands down. I'm no stranger to spice but I like the sweeter flavor of the regular one. The yams though...you guys, when I say these yams are out of this world, I mean it. I thought my moms candied yams were hands down the best of the best but these blow them out of the water (sorry, mom). They've got this little orange kick that I am in love with. My only wish was that the side order of em was a bit bigger!Their collard greens were good but nothing better than what I've had before. Same verdict for the mac n cheese. For me, it's the smoked beans and the yams allllllll the way. Their whoopie pies are to dieeeee for!!! Oh my god I could eat so many of these, they're incredible. Same with the Tres Leche cake. They only have that some days so if it's there definitely try it!!I love this spot and I'm so happy their here. Looking forward to coming here for years to come and sharing their food with as many people as I can."
8/23/2020,20200823,5,4.63,"So as you can see in the picture, we grubbed! But I had to stop in the middle of the meal to make sure I had a picture before it was gone. The chicken was crazy moist. Brisket had a solid rub on it and the pulled pork was perfect. The show stopper was the beef shirt ribs. We got lucky. It was fresh out the smoker. Wish I could've tried the sweet potato whoopie pie. We will back and support your local business, ESPECIALLY if you like bbq."
8/28/2020,20200828,5,4.64,"Excellent food & service. The half chicken was suuuper juicy and the sides, just WOW! I had the mac, yams, coleslaw and for dessert grabbed a whoopie pie & tres leches. Sides are where most places will miss and these sides are LEGIT. I'll be back!"
8/28/2020,20200828,5,4.65,"Ribs are soft & juicy, it comes right off the bone. Mash potato & Mac & corn muffin were delicious as well."
8/30/2020,20200830,5,4.65,"Finally, we have a BBQ place in Noho that is worth going to. Until now, all of the local BBQ restaurants here weren't worth the price. We tried them today and were very pleasantly surprised. We tried the smoked brisket, chicken and pulled pork which were all excellent.  The meat comes just smoked so you can add your desired amount of their very tasty BBQ sauce. When the chicken is ordered, they ask if you want it dry or basted with sauce. We got it basted which was a great choice. Their sides were good, too!  The coleslaw was great, creamy, chunky and slightly sweet with small slices of apple mixed in. The beans were smoky, meaty and delicious. Their mac & cheese is excellent and obviously homemade. Meals also include some tasty corn bread - one muffin is good but two would be better. Next time we will add a few extra muffins to our order.We are looking forward to trying more of their menu items such as ""Southern Sausage"", hot links and pastrami. (I make my own smoked tri-tip so I probably won't try theirs but it should be good, too. The meats we tried would make great sandwiches which we will try in the very near future."
9/7/2020,20200907,5,4.66,"Legit BBQ comes to NoHo! The ribs and the tri-tip are my personal favorites, but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. The sides are also top notch (specifically the Greens.) It's a great business to support as the entire operation is propped up by two folks, so you'll need to make sure you put in your order with some decent advance (I had dinner there Friday, called in at 4:30 to get dinner by 7, but they'll talk you through how long stuff should take over Instagram.) But the wait is more than worth it, as you will end up taking home a feast that'll leave your mouth watering for more."
9/12/2020,20200912,5,4.67,"This place is phenomenal, and i'm a vegetarian!! The family ordered a large dinner this evening and I stuck to the sides, and I was NOT disappointed. Their mac-n-cheese is heavenly, and the potato salad had me going back for seconds. Don't even get me started on the Sweet Potato Whoopies!!! 10/10 would recommend!"
9/12/2020,20200912,5,4.67,"First time here. Straight up the best BBQ I've ever had. We ordered chicken-baby back ribs (Memphis style)-Tri-tip ! I'm not a fan of baked beans but the beans that they make are phenomenal. I don't know what kind of meat they put in them but the flavors are amazing. We ordered greens which were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. The Mac -n-cheese was delish. Cornbread was individually wrapped and kept fresh. The potato salad was the best I've ever had. These people know what's up! I ate until I was ready to burst. On a whim I ordered Sweet potato Whoopi's with maple cream filling. They were SO freakin good! I was bummed that they sold out of brisket and candied yams. If you call ahead of time, they will hold some for you. The food is made fresh the meat comes to you right out of the smoker. The prices are very reasonable. The owners are such nice people. They genuinely appreciate your business and are sure to make sure that you know it. We'll be back - earlier next time!"
9/18/2020,20200918,5,4.68,Amazing smoked meats and side dishes! Love the quality of it all... delicious! I had ribs and tri tip...both moist and tasty! Candied yams and smoked beans delightful. Going back this weekend for the brisket...can't wait!
10/7/2020,20201007,1,4.61,"The ribs were not only dry but really tough meat. The collard greens were soaked in water like a soup. The cornbread muffins tasted like it was mixed with a vanilla cupcake batter which made it taste way too sweet. This was my first time there. I was trying to support Black owned businesses, but it seemed the white female owner didn't care to reciprocate the care for a black female customer! I had phoned my order in for pick up and was told my order would be ready in 45 minutes so I was right on time. But when I got there I had to wait an additional 45 minutes!!!! I was hungry and was getting hangry waiting but just hung in my car playing games on my phone while I waited and watched as other (white) guests came and left and I was stuck waiting. When she finally brought my food out she gave me a half-assed apology that wasn't even an apology. I spent $45 with tip for a meal for 1 person, the least she could have done was offer me a credit for another visit. You can't pay by credit card so I had to set up Cash App or pay with PayPal which wasn't connecting in there. It was all a pain in the butt! The food wasn't worth the wait nor the cost."
10/11/2020,20201011,2,4.56,"Drove a good 50 min to try this place. Was so excited after reading all the reviews and seeing the KTLA special on it being a black owned business so wanted to show some support. Unfortunately, after ordering and waiting outside I observed the woman working the register transition to the food preparation area and remove her mask as she was closing the food boxes and double checking the orders. Ended up not taking my food as talking over the food boxes with no mask didn't make it so appealing anymore. Man I really wanted to try this place!!"
10/16/2020,20201016,5,4.57,"Hands down delicious! Homemade, authentic, and my entire family is very happy when this is dinner!Brisket is top notch!"
10/31/2020,20201031,5,4.58,"Oh man what can I say?! Where to even begin this place is amazing. First time trying it and my husband and I were like ""wow!!!"" We both agree, it's one of the best we have had. The brisket, hot links and bbq chicken are extremely succulent, tasty and delicious (next time i will be trying the ribs!). The sides- ohhhhhhh boy... you can tell they are made with love, from scratch!!! SO freaking good. You will not be disappointed. We can't wait to go back. Recommend calling in and placing your order at least 30-45 minutes before you want to eat it. Plus the lady who took our order, was the sweetest, most attentive person! For dessert get the cake with the cranberries and pecans (sorry don't know the name)- you will NOT be disappointed. It is moist, rich and has just the right amount of sweetness. I'm drooling as I write this"
11/5/2020,20201105,5,4.59,"I stumbled on this place in search of BBQ and tired of what I had already known of in the valley. This place opened in April/2020 and somehow went under my radar. I walked up and ordered at the door while the owners/chefs were 6ft back behind the counters (really nice and personable in there, family owned). I ordered the 3 meat + 2 side combo. I had the tri-tip, pulled pork, and brisket. The tri-tip was the absolute best I have ever had in my life. Melt in your mouth delicious, I could've eaten a full pound. Pulled pork was great. The brisket is easily the best in the valley. On the side I had the beans, the mash, and mac n cheese. All BOMB. The beans were exceptional. The only bummer was I thought my meal came with a piece of corn bread and when I got home w my food it wasn't in there. If I knew it didn't come w my meal I would've got a piece anyways and based on the quality of everything else I really wish I had. Next visit I'm getting the ribs and some cornbread. Can't wait."

11/7/2020,20201107,5,4.6,"Lemme tell you, this place is straight FIRE! I saw a quick segment on KTLA about this new BBQ spot around the Area. I was stoked to try it because it was so close. I ordered a whole smoked chicken , their sweet potato, their garlic mashed potatoes, collard greens, & corn bread. Honestly, I ordered pretty much everything they had available. It was all absolutely amazing! Juicy smoked chicken, awesome awesome awesome.. you have to try it for yourself. Next time I go I want to order the beef ribs & hot links. I can't wait to go back!"
11/11/2020,20201111,5,4.61,"Great food and service. I got the 1/4 lb brisket sandwich Memphis-style with a side of potato salad. The brisket is tender and delicious, the side is flavourful, and the BBQ sauce has the right amount of kick and is not too sweet. The staff are also very friendly and welcoming!"
11/12/2020,20201112,5,4.61,"I went back tonight after Venessa, the owner, reached out and promised extra corn bread next time. She didn't disappoint. The cornbread is fantastic. Instead of pulled pork, this time I had the chicken, and WOW. Fantastic. And yes, the second time everything is just as amazing as the first. This is my exclusive bbq spot from now on."

The meat was tender and juicy! *chef's kiss.. our sides were Mac and cheese, potato salad and baked beans. All the sides were just so delicious. They also came with a cornbread and bbq sauce on the side. I love the little cornbread muffin. It tasted like real corn and the bbq sauce was delicious as well. It had a unique taste compared to store bought but I'm not too sure if they make it themselves. Again all freakin delicious. I also got a sweet tea, as soon as I took my first sip I died and went to sweet tea heaven!! Can you guys please sell it by the gallon!! Please ignore all these nonsense reviews about how it's small servings and so expensive. It's seriously the same amount of food you get at a corporate restaurant and the same price! Only difference here is that all their food has a homemade taste because they legit make it all from scratch themselves. We will definitely be back again. We ordered there and food didn't take long,but we were the only ones there. Next time I will definitely order ahead just in case there's a line. The pics are what I ordered, tri tip, pulled pork, baked beans, Mac and cheese and sweet tea...my hubby started eating before I could take a picture lol!Update: Got a confirmation that they do in fact make their BBQ sauce from scratch as well!...It was very delicious so that just adds another gold star to this wonderful restaurant. And lastly I almost forgot to post about this mini whoopie pie dessert we got! Delicious!!! The bread part was so soft, moist and flavorful and the filling had just the perfect sweetness to it. Everything was just so delicious I can't stop raving about this place."

They don't have indoor or outdoor dining, just take out. Everything we ordered was beyond amazing! We ordered dry rub ribs, 1/4 chicken and tri-tip. The sides were coleslaw and garlic mashed potatoes. I can't wait to try some of the other sides next time.Please, go there, help support a small business. You won't regret it!"

I rudely called 5 minutes before they closed and they were so kind to tell me what they had left for the day and would be so happy to pack up for me.- The wrapping alone was incredible - no leaks or messy meals.- The brisket sandwich, on a glossy burger (brioche?) bun and with tons of bbq on the side, was sooooo good. Tender and juicy meat, delicious and generous amounts of bbq and fluffy bun.- I also enjoyed my side of potato salad very much because it wasn't sweet. * I believe it's cash / PayPal only? Or maybe because I called in my order so late."

We got a whole chicken, half order of brisket, Mac & cheese, mash potatoes, yams, corn bread and some whoopie pies. First, the chicken was so flavorful and moist. I usually don't eat beef or pork but after opening up the box I had to try the brisket. It was so tender and melts in your mouth. The sides were all delicious as well as was the corn bread. Their BBQ sauce was perfect. We got some whoopie pies for dessert and they were the perfect finish to a great dinner. We will definitely be back!"

When my bf called Memphis Grill, they were open but were only doing pre-ordered meals. They offered to call us back once it got later in the day to see if they had enough food after fulfilling the pre-ordered meals. Thankfully, they called us about an hour later and said that we could place an order. We ordered beef ribs, tri tip, brisket, plus macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. Everything tasted deliciously homemade, but our favorites were the Mac and cheese and brisket. I specifically remember telling my bf that I could eat an entire tray of it. We will definitely be coming back in the very near future. Not only did they have excellent service by accommodating us on a major holiday, but it just might be one of the best barbecue spots in the Valley. Side note: look them up on Google for an accurate menu, not their website."

The coleslaw is fresh, not mushy, even if you don't like coleslaw you should try it. I visited when they had only been open for a month or two during COVID. I called my order in and they called me back promptly. The first time I ordered I was on the road so by the time I reached them it was ready. Very kind and hospitable. My go to BBQ spot now."

1/16/2021,20210116,5,4.69,"INCREDIBLE. First off I am very picky about my BBQ. I lived in Memphis for 8 years and I've had some incredible BBQ. I've tried a few spots in LA and none of them quite lived up to my expectations. I was looking around for some BBQ online and this place popped up so I thought I would give it a try. First off, the customer service was great - I called ahead and the food was on time. The ribs were so tender and cooked just right with amazing BBQ sauce. They don't over-sauce their ribs like some places do but they give extra BBQ on the side for those who like to drench their ribs. The brisket was flavorful and fatty - just how it should be. Brisket isn't easy to make and they nailed it.Okay now the sides. So far in LA I've found some decent BBQ places that had poor sides so I had no expectations for the sides. However these were so incredible they could have been a meal by themselves. We got the mac and cheese which tasted fresh and homemade with real cheese. Also we got potato salad which was amazing as well. Not the over mayo sweet stuff you normally get, but real potato salad with dill. It's still creamy but was the perfect balance of flavors. Needless to say we were blown away and we will definitely be coming back."
1/27/2021,20210127,4,4.68,Here to support our black community! We found the place in an Instagram post and ended up here. We loved it and reminded us of some BBQ we had in Texas! Maybe it was late in the day but I'd loved it if my brisket had more juice haha. We did a YouTube video MUKBANG on it. Search up meecheer if you'd like to it live
2/19/2021,20210219,5,4.69,"I had the best damn beef ribs of my life!First off, everything (yes I mean everything) is made from scratch with high quality ingredients and a heaping spoon full of love for sure.It's evident from the first bite that Chef pours his heart and soul into everything he touches. Flavor is clearly a priority here, and now verging on obsession as it's our 3rd time visiting in less than a week just so we could try more things on their growing menu. So far, the brisket was perfect blend of smokey tender and juicy, the pork loin is incredible. The hot links are tender, moist, and best of all Hot (unlike some others I've found). I can't stop the cravings for the greens and potato salad. It is definitely worth a visit to experience some of the best BBQ around."
2/19/2021,20210219,5,4.69,"I'm originally from Texas, and very picky about my BBQ. Since moving to Cali 12 years ago, everywhere I've tried BBQ in California has been severely lacking. The flavor is just not there. Feeling sad mid-pandemic, and wanting BBQ comfort food, I tried The Memphis Grill since they were close to me. I was AMAZED! They are by far the best BBQ I've had in California, and rival the mom and pop places I grew up eating. Their food is REEEEALLY good. I've tried the brisket and ribs, chicken, and it's all been excellent. Their whoopee pies are amazing! They really really care about quality, and it shows. They actually know now to BBQ."

Ribs were perfection, chicken was huge and juicy, tri tip was done just beautifully, hot links just the right amount of spicy, pulled pork sandwich ""Memphis style"" was for me but I had to share it was so good! And of course the Mac n cheese, potato salad, greens, and mashed potatoes (yes we tried almost everything on the menu!!). Cookies, pies, and mousse, too! Definitely going to be a go-to for us from now on. Big bonus was the super friendly customer service and the clear pride and joy they take in making amazing food"
2/25/2021,20210225,5,4.7,"As someone who grew up eating Memphis BBQ, I can honestly say this is the REAL DEAL! The food is incredible, the staff is super friendly, and the service is great. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
3/25/2021,20210325,5,4.7,DELICIOUS!!! Try the beans; you'll be amazed!This is our new go-to place for monthly take out. Wonderful service. Easy to pay by PayPal during Covid.Thank you for remaining open. Looking forward to continuing to support your business regularly.
3/27/2021,20210327,5,4.71,Please go here :-) The food is made with love. The duo that run it couldn't be nicer. Everything is wrapped up and packed with care. And it's delicious. And the bbq sauce is killer!!
4/1/2021,20210401,5,4.71,Dry rub Memphis ribs that smother your fingers with goodness. The BBQ here nails it and you can taste the homemade love in the sides! Simply beautiful and I will be coming back again. Great folks running it!!!
4/18/2021,20210418,5,4.71,"Best BBQ in the valley! We love getting takeout from Memphis Grill. The brisket is melt in your mouth tender, the chicken is fantastic, and the sides are all excellent, especially the mac and cheese. The owners are very friendly and run the business in a very professional manner, especially with respect to Covid safety protocols. My only complaint would be the sides are a bit expensive for the portion size, but I understand everything at this restaurant is made from scratch and they don't cut corners on freshness. Definitely recommended!"
4/29/2021,20210429,5,4.72,Very Good Locally Homemade Barbecue. The side dishes are also Really Good. Finger Licking Good! I'll definitely make a return visit.Clint Thetford
5/16/2021,20210516,4,4.71,"Memphis Grill has been on my to try list for sometime so I am glad I got the chance to try this place a few weeks ago after my hiking. The staff is friendly and will help you out, especially if it's your first time here. It took me a few minutes to figure out what to get but ended up getting the brisket sandwich, it comes with a slaw. The brisket was well made and the slaw was the right balance of tangy, sweet, and creamy. I definitely plan on coming back and trying other things on their menu.Heads up, they don't take credit card but do take digital payments like Pay Pal and Cash App."
5/23/2021,20210523,3,4.69,"Pros: loved that this place is black owned. They get 5stars just for that. Also, the staff were very friendly and helpful. I'm really indecisive and everything on the menu sounded great so the lady at the front door helped me figure out what I wanted and was just kind and welcoming. The portion sizes are huge and definitely worth the price. I ordered the 2 meat plate. I got 1 hot link and chicken breast. It came with 2 sides so I got potato salad and Mac n cheese. I also got a Memphis style dessert but I can't remember the name but it had cream in the middle of 2 what seemed like cake. Cons: the food was just not good at all. I feel like I wasted money because I only ate the hot link. Which was delicious. The flavor just didn't do it for me. The Mac n cheese was bland and so was the potato salad. The chicken seemed over cooked but I'm not sure because I ate a small piece and unfortunately threw the rest away. Also, the dessert was wayyyyyy to sweet. Could barely finish that either. I wanted to like this place so bad because it's close to where I live and black owned. I may go back to try the ribs but i don't know."
6/6/2021,20210606,5,4.69,"Wow. The team at Memphis grill loves their craft. You can tell the minute you bite into any of their BBQ meats. I used to live right near their shop and saw their banner when they were still building out their spot and looked them up on Instagram and eagerly awaited their opening. It's hard to find a really good BBQ spot so i was very excited to have one so close to home. I ended up moving out to sylmar so it's taken me forever to come try them out but this past weekend we were going to be back in good old NoHo so I placed my order and by 12:30pm I was at their restaurant ready to pick up my BBQ. We ordered some baby back ribs, brisket, tri tip, hot link and some Mac n cheese, potato salad, and cole slaw. Everything was super tasty tender melt in your mouth amazing. Give them a try and it'll become your go-to bbq joint. I know it's become mine. Thank you Memphis Grill appreciate your love and dedication you put into your food!"
7/17/2021,20210717,5,4.7,I went there with two friends and we each ordered something different to taste. Our meals were delicious and our sides were excellent. We would definitely go back again. The lady who took our order was so nice and helpful. This place is a bbq delight.
8/7/2021,20210807,5,4.7,"I cannot get enough of this place. This place single-handedly convinced me that Memphis style is my all-time favorite barbecue. I always want to venture to the other items in their menu, but their tri-tip and Mac n cheese are just impossible to get past. Their tri-tip just swims in its own juices. The mac n cheese is the most flavorful. Their SAUCES. THEIR SAUCES. Get both mild and hot to try them both. They won't disappoint. These people won't disappoint. Don't forget it's cash or cash app only. So worth it, I walked a block in the heat just to grab the cash."
8/9/2021,20210809,4,4.69,"OMG! This place is the bomb! went looking online for BBQ different than what I've usually been having in the valley and was prepared to go over the hill or to LBC. This place popped up. Had a half rack and my friend had a Brisket sandwich. Got home and unpacked the 100% pampered packed food and I can tell you not a work was said other than yum or similar. Great to have a real good BBQ place in the east valley. Call ahead and you can pick up quickly, expect a wait if you walk up cause of the food pampering."
8/28/2021,20210828,5,4.7,Bomb bbq!!! I wanted to order some good bbq for my nephews birthday and after researching thru Yelp I found Memphis Grill and they did not disappoint. My family and I loved everything especially the brisket. Thank you Memphis Grill for awesome food we will definitely be back!!
8/29/2021,20210829,5,4.7,"Took a shot with The Memphis Grill, and I'm glad to say that we did. They provided bbq for a birthday party I had this past weekend. Everything we ordered was amazing, from the baby back ribs, brisket and bbq chicken. Each was prepared from scratch, and is easily some of the best bbq I've ever had. We also ordered the Mac and cheese (EVERYONE loved it), yams () and corn bread muffins ( ). They provided extra bbq sauce, hot and regular ( by extra I mean an obscene amount, which was definitely a good thing). The service was very friendly and helpful. If you're in the Valley, give these guys a shot. You won't be disappointed."
9/4/2021,20210904,5,4.7,Customer service by the owners wife was amazing. It was very hot and she had many orders but she was very nice and patient with everything. Customer service amazing and the food matched. Well packaged great homemade sides which is rare. Great smoked flavor meat. Customer service on an excellent scale is rare now days with food to match is even more rare.
9/8/2021,20210908,5,4.71,"Ok. I thought I already reviewed, and came back to update, but can't find my review. This is definitely the best barbecue I've had in LA. and I used to work at a great bbq restaurant and ate there all the time. Just crazy delicious. I think I've eaten everything but the hot links now, and it is all fantastic. The owners are delightful and really helpful. I've now hosted two backyard bbqs with Memphis as the star, and everyone has been ecstatic about the food, including people who have had the best BBQ in Tenn. Kansas and Texas. One of those people said the other night, ""This is what I want my last meal on earth to be"". I agree!"
9/12/2021,20210912,5,4.71,Memphis grill has HANDS DOWN the best BBQ in so cal! TWO WORDS: THEIR. BRISKET.Do yourself a favor and experience a taste bud revolution.
9/15/2021,20210915,2,4.68,"Customer service was great very friendly people !!! Only giving 2 stars because something was off from the ribs tonight . It had a spoiled smell , not sure if they were sitting out all night or what ( they had to smell them before they seasoned them ) . Thought it was just me but my hubby said the same thing after taking one bite . My first and last time . Hopefully no one gets sick"
10/3/2021,20211003,5,4.69,"First few bites & it took my taste buds out LA & to the south .... So freak'n good !!! Customer service was absolutely perfect.

Definitely for the sweet loverzzz*sweet tea & lemonade... was so refreshing Great experience I'll be back with friends, family & neighbors... thank goodness I live two blocks away :)"
10/13/2021,20211013,5,4.69,"First time trying this place tonight. It's AMAZING. Ordered over the phone and I'm so glad that I did. I've found other BBQ places in the area lackluster ~ The Memphis grill did not disappoint. The staff was so kind and made recommendations over the phone. The brisket is juicy, falls apart, and melts in your mouth. The tri tip is smokey, tender, and juicy. Cornbread muffin - get extra. Trust me. Yams - super duper sweet. Tasty with the meats. Beans are for the meat lovers. Lots of bbq flavor. Mashed potatoes - garlicky and smooth. Mac - YUM!! Uber comforting. Chocolate chip cookie - tastes like it just came out of the oven. Honestly, this is my new go to BBQ joint. If you're still trying to decide if you want it... give it a shot! Heads up - use cash to buy. They only do cash or paypal currently! (This place is worth stopping at the ATM for on the way. ) Can't wait to eat my leftovers and can't wait to come again!"
10/16/2021,20211016,5,4.69,"The food is consistently delicious and high quality, the customer service is always friendly and responsive and it's a beautiful thing to be able to have top quality bbq while also supporting local business owners of color. Highly recommend The Memphis Grill!"
10/24/2021,20211024,5,4.69,"I can't say enough about the bbq here. From the hot links, brisket and the ribs with that nice caramelization, glistening from their tasty bbq sauce. Oh the sides...I LOVE their coleslaw, beans and garlic mashed potatoes. The cornbread (like a muffin) is delicious with just the right texture, though too sweet for me. Overall, I think The Memphis Grill beat out the bbq spots in LA...and I've tried many of them. Much love to the chef (who is from Memphis, TN and know how to grill & cook. Great customer service to the lady at the front, who is welcoming. I am so GLAD to have a true bbq spot, that is SO GOOD in NoHo!"
11/10/2021,20211110,5,4.7,Whoa! What a gem! I stumbled across The Memphis Grill when a friend moved into the neighborhood and we were looking for somewhere to order from. My mind is blown and I will definitely be back.
12/18/2021,20211218,5,4.7,"Succulent, specific, and awesome. Amazing and unique flavors. Highly, highly recommended."
12/23/2021,20211223,5,4.7,"Can say so much!!! My partner and I always bug them, the all white meat chicken is perfectly cooked and the owners are so sweet and humble. I get Mac n cheese& potato salad as the sides and it never misses!! 10/10"
1/16/2022,20220116,5,4.71,"I had a great experience here earlier this week! I placed my order via Instagram, and I was pleasantly surprised by how quick they responded and the fact that food was a flat rate. No extra fees, just the price the menu says.Currently they are taking cash, cashapp, and zelle I believe.It's a husband and wife duo that are running this shop, and they both were very kind.I ordered the pulled pork with collard greens, baked beans. I got a side of the medium mac and cheese. I really loved my plate; the pork with bbq sauce was off the chain. I wasn't too much of a fan of the greens, but I'm extremely picky so that's no one's fault. The beans and mac were great, different that your typical spots, but in a good way!I will definitely be back to try more items, the cornbread, and definitely the Memphis style pulled pork sandwich!"
1/17/2022,20220117,5,4.71,"We were in the mood for BBQ for a family dinner and stumbled upon this hole in the wall. It was amaaaazing! The whole family loved it. The brisket was some of the best I've ever had, hot links were great, and the sides were really fresh and tasty. The woman on the phone was also really nice and helpful and made some great suggestions. So glad I found this restaurant! Will definitely order again and again!"
1/19/2022,20220119,5,4.71,"My husband and I tried their food for the first time today. Best BBQ in the San Fernando Valley! The meat was tender, the sauce was awesome and all the sides were EXCELLENT. The owners are so nice. So happy we found our new spot!"
1/23/2022,20220123,5,4.71,Best bbq I've had in LA. It's an unassuming place. Call before you go as they may be out of something you want. Everything is excellent. I hope they start bottling that bbq sauce. I would definitely buy it. We bbq a lot. I have a rack that is almost gone. But cooking ribs all night is a given at a low temp. That sauce is killer! Please bottle it. Great sides too although I don't eat beans.
3/8/2022,20220308,5,4.72,"AMAZING!! They have such great food and the people who run it are very easy to talk too, it made ordering very a dreamThe brisket sandwich and hot links are great, and they have prefectly executed sides, i recomend the coleslaw and the potato salad, and dont even think about not picking up one of their sweet potato woopie pies !"
3/12/2022,20220312,5,4.72,"How to describe the food? Tender and juicy brisket. Moist cornbread. Tastebud tantalizing BBQ sauce. Excellent, authentic, high-quality BBQ at a reasonable price point. I've had pretty good BBQ outside LA proper, but this is by far the best BBQ I've had in LA County.Some item-by-item notes:Brisket: Falls apart, tender, deliciousPulled Pork sandwich: Love the ""Memphis"" style with the slaw. Make sure to add plenty of sauce.BBQ sauce: We opted for ""spicy"" and loved it. It's not the ""picante"" kind of spicy, don't worry.Potato salad: a pretty generic side right? Wrong. Big tender chunks of potato, plus pieces of hard-boiled egg. I absolutely loved it.Mac n Cheese: This might have suffered a bit from the 15 minute drive home, but it was still good. I could tell it would have been excellent if eaten on the spot.Baked Beans: Really good, tons of flavor.Cornbread muffin: If you're like me, 9/10 of the time you get cornbread and it's dry AF. Not here. Pleasantly surprised!Sweet Potato Whoopie: I'll quote my wife, 2 seconds after her first bite. ""Whoa, why didn't you get two of these?!?"" -Imagine something like a Little Debbie oatmeal cream pie, with a sweet potato-based cookie/cake thing instead of the oatmeal thing. AMAZING.We will definitely return. FYI it's takeout only.. I hope they can get some outdoor seating soon, because as good as the food is, it'd be even better if you could eat it right away. I'd settle for a cheap card table and an upside-down plastic crate!"
3/19/2022,20220319,5,4.72,"Wonderful customer service!!!I had no idea what we were going to eat for dinner today until I was rolling down Lankershiem and smelled a bbq pit and a few people standing outside The Memphis Grill...BINGO!!! Once I #yelped this spot and liked the prices, I knew this was for dinner. Their 2 meat 2 sides was the choice. Also, I'm from the South so I'm pretty picky about my bbq. I chose chicken and a hot link as my meat. Candied yams and Mac n Cheese were my choices. O...M...G!! I haven't had real pit fired que in years. I'm so glad they turned out to be great because it's so close to my house...I'll definitely be back!!!"
3/20/2022,20220320,5,4.72,Wow! I got the Memphis style pulled pork and I was blown away. I grew up in St. Louis and have been to Memphis. I'm a bbq snob. I never thought I would find good bbq in LA. Memphis Grill lives up to its name and can hold its own. I will be a repeat customer because I'm so full but all I can think about is this sandwich and their Mac and cheese!!
3/25/2022,20220325,4,4.72,BBQ in the valley is hard to come by - so I gave it a try. Was expecting to dine in and found out they are only doing to -go orders.I order the barbecue chicken - added the spicy bbq sauce which taste better than the regular.I ordered a few different sides:*Greens- they are cooked with meat and carrots - carrots in greens was new to me but good.*Mac and cheese- not made with an elbow noodle and needed more seasoning. *Yams- on the sweeter side and heavy on the orange juice or sauce I could definitely taste it - but good with the Mac.*Beans - horrible!! *Potato salad- good I had to add some seasoning *sweet tea - good
4/2/2022,20220402,5,4.72,I had the brisket sandwich with a side of coleslaw and everything amazing. The brisket was very tender with great flavor. Make sure to get their bbq sauce too!
4/14/2022,20220414,5,4.72,Really Solid food! Get yourself some!Not to mention very friendly customer service. The owner takes great pride in preparing your meal.Brisket - 4/5Chicken - 4/5 Yams - 5/5 unbelievable Potato Salad - 3.5/5Greens -5/5
5/9/2022,20220509,5,4.72,Such flavorful ribs and tender. The sign of a good rib is when you can take a bite of it and enjoy it just as much as dipping it in the sauce. This was exactly that. A nice flavorful crust as well as the sides collard greens and cole slaw was good. Can't wait to go back when I'm in LA. Just hope they get a dine in area soon.
5/22/2022,20220522,5,4.73,"Hands down THE best barbecue in LA! It was listed as one of the top 5 in LA Eater though it should be #1. The ribs are tender, meaty, juicy, fall of the bone deliciousness. The brisket is also scrumptious. The collard greens and potato salad are the best I've ever had. Everything is fresh and tasty. I can't wait to try their pumpkin whoopie pies and lemonade.Head to The Memphis Grill in North Hollywood! Btw the service was incredibly sweet."
6/2/2022,20220602,5,4.73,"I was born and raised in Memphis. I cut my teeth on dry rub and ribs. Pulled pork is a way of life. I am always skeptical when I see ""Memphis"" anything. However, being a transplant to California 20+ years ago, I'm always on the lookout for a taste of home. The Memphis grill exceeded my expectations of a bbq joint this far from the epicenter. In fact, if this place was located in Memphis, it's where I would go when I do get to visit home. The pulled pork Memphis style is dead on perfect. The Mac and cheese is amazing. Even the bbq sauce had a hint of Memphis with the sweet base to fit the locale. I need a sixth star for how nice they were."
6/3/2022,20220603,5,4.73,Do not hesitate to come to this place!! The best bbq in LA. I got the chicken plate with 2 sides and the amount of food is amazing. You will definitely enjoy yourself eating this! 10/10 recommend - I will definitely be back!!
6/12/2022,20220612,5,4.73,Yes yes YES go here and give these kindhearted talented people your money! You won't regret it!
