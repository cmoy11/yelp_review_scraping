3/19/2010,20100319,4,4.0,"Already famous with a strong Farmer's Market following... COBBLERMANIA now has a stand that is open daily from 2-7 on the corner of Le Brea and Venice!!! My darling beloved stopped on his way home from work today to buy me a peach cobbler and so inspired me to put my love to words and write this review. The cobbler is delicious and sweetened with agava. That's as healthy as it gets while still being sweet, right?? The crusts are flaky and buttery and the fruit is plump and tender. Eat some cobbler... like they say ""its so good you'll want to slap somebody"""
4/6/2010,20100406,2,3.0,"As a peach cobbler lover, I was thoroughly disappointed in the entire cobbler. I really wanted to love and support this company, but it wasn't good at all. It did not have a homemade flaky crust that I love. I was excited about the strawberry peach cobbler but it didn't live up to the hype from the young lady that sold it to me. It tasted generic and bland."
5/1/2010,20100501,4,3.33,"They also have a stand at the Farmer's Market in Torrance (Wilson Park) ! I went with my dad and my boyfriend. My bf loves pies so I bought him one. The story of the young woman also inspired me, I love to support small businesses and she seemed genuine. We could not wait to take the pie home, heat it in the oven and eat it! It was delicious! The only part my bf was disappointed was there was alot of fruit juice a the bottom and he likes his pies a bit crispier. But it was very fresh and great for vegans! Will we buy another pie?! Absolutely."
5/4/2010,20100504,5,3.75,Loved the peach cobbler I purchased at the Culver City farmers' market. I am a sweet-a-holic and a baked goods appreciator and I found the crust delicious and the fruit fresh. Can't wait to stop by at their permanent stand at Venice & La Brea on the way home someday and get dessert! NOTE: The map on this page at posting date is incorrect. As far as I know they don't have a stand at Sunset. Check out the northeast corner of Venice and La Brea for Cobblermania.
5/10/2010,20100510,5,4.0,"I'd encountered Cobblermania at a few art fairs over the years and it was always a special treat. It is just outrageously good cobbler. Their sign says it's so good you'll want to slap somebody and that's about right.In the last few months, they've been at the downtown farmer's market at BOFA Plaza on Fridays. So now I have regular access to the cobbler and I'm afraid to bring it back to the office because I don't want to incite workplace violence."
6/4/2010,20100604,5,4.17,"I've been driving by Cobblermania for the last few months, but always after they were closed, until yesterday! I had the pleasure of chatting with the owner (one of the sweetest women I've ever met) and the even greater pleasure of two of the best cobblers I've ever had in my entire life. Seriously. These were no joke, agave sweetened, delicious, delectable treats. I bought two to take home to my girlfriends family and they were gone within the hour."
6/26/2010,20100626,5,4.29,"You must try these VEGAN cobblers. I've had the peach so far and absolutely enjoyed it. Not too sweet - no butter or dairy - AND agave is used instead of refined sugar.Can you believe it??They have strange business hours, but you can catch them at various farmer's markets and other events. You can also call them to place a special order.Super nice people running the operation so check them out!"
7/5/2010,20100705,5,4.38,The cobblers are delicious and there are a large variety of them. We tried the apple-blackberry. Thumbs up! The woman who runs the place is really sweet too.
8/6/2010,20100806,4,4.33,"My brother told me about Cobblermania so I went looking for it yesterday. When I got to the corner of Venice and La Brea I saw a small little building with some signs. So I guess it's more like a cobbler stand. I was on foot so it was easier for me to find but if you're driving by it and you see a gas station, a taco bell, and a mechanic place, you're there. It's on the NE corner.I talked to the lady operating the stand and she said they opened in November of 2009 and have been selling at farmer's markets and she's really hoping that word of mouth gets people out to the stand. It's hard to start a business in this economy so I'm really rooting for them. Go out and support these folks! Maybe it's not the usual neighborhood you'd go to and maybe buying cobblers from a stand seems odd to you but put your preconceptions to the side and give them a chance. Let's support the little guy who is just trying to put their love of cobblers out there!Now to the cobblers! They were having a special of 2 for $10 so I got the white peach and the apple-strawberry cobbler. They said they're still trying to figure out how to price them so prices are subject to change. Of the two, the apple-strawberry was the hit! So, so good. The peach was good too but it just didn't stand up to the awesomeness of strawberries with apples. That's just my personal preference.I'm excited to go back and try other flavors. I've never had rhubarb so I'm eager to try that one. Oh and the sweet potato sounds like magic so that's next on my list. Oh yes, and they are vegan. Really, VEGAN? Yes! And no, vegan doesn't mean tasteless cardboard. Baking is all chemistry so there are things you can do to still get great taste without animal products.So if you see them at a farmer's market or you see their stand, give them a chance."
8/14/2010,20100814,5,4.4,"We went right before they closed, and got a strawberry rhubarb cobbler and a sweet potato cobbler. Both were amazing! The woman at the stand was super-friendly and enthusiastic, and she was incredibly patient when we took at least seven minutes to decide what cobblers we wanted. We had a TON of cobbler left over, and it was just as delicious the next day. To be honest, I didn't even know it was vegan until I came on here to review it. It certainly doesn't taste like anything was left out or substituted. And it's true, it was so good we (wanted to) slap somebody. Definitely coming back, with more people. Must try all the cobblers."
8/23/2010,20100823,4,4.36,"Ok, listen up, Cobblermania rules! Only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it seems SOMEWHAT pricey for the size of the cobbler but I'm seriously so broke right now everything that's not from the 99 Cent Store or a taco truck is too expensive for me. So if you're gainfully employed this should be affordable. Anyway:I just moved into the neighborhood and got a kick out of the name and the format --it's a shack on Venice and La Brea that sells cobbler, like, are you kidding me, that's hilarious. Like the other reviewers have said, the people running it are enough to keep going back. My friend and I tried the sweet potato and the strawberry-rhubarb --$8 for the sweet potato and $5 for the s-r because it was day old but it still tasted really good and tart. The lady working said they usually don't have day-old options since they sell out everyday but if you're there and they happen to have day-old, just go for it.Normally I resent vegan places but this place is an exception. Go there!"
9/8/2010,20100908,5,4.42,"I regularly go out of my way to get these cobblers. They taste GREAT and they are way healthier than anything else I've come across. As a bonus, the owner is a beautiful person who has worked hard to make this business successful - it's nice to be able to support cool people."
9/13/2010,20100913,4,4.38,"I got a strawberry rhubarb cobbler at a farmer's market. I always wanted to try it when I pass by this place. But I did not try it till today because I thought it would be very sweet (I can't eat too sweet stuff.)But, NO! It was not too sweet. It was actually perfect for me! I was going to eat just a quarter of it, but ended up with eating a half of it at once. :) they use agave instead of refined sugar. I studied a bit about sugar alternatives and got to know agave is not so good as what people think it is, but I am pretty sure that it is much better than refined sugar :)Definitely I will go back again!"
1/8/2011,20110108,5,4.43,Oh my goodness. These cobblers are so fantastic their slogan is you will want to slap someone BUT! not them. They are all so sweet and i want to make sure they remain in prime cobbler making state.This is one of those places that you will drive by all the time and never ever notice. I tasted one at a Farmer's Market when my friend a vegetarian recommended it. YUM! Now I go out of my way to drive there. My landlord is a vegan and I take him a cobbler whenever I want to sweeten him up.
2/5/2011,20110205,5,4.47,INCREDIBLE COBBLER! THE PEACH and the BLUEBERRY PEACH are my personal favorites but honestly you cannot go wrong.
3/24/2011,20110324,5,4.5,"VEGAN COBBLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yes, vegan cobbler. I found Cobblermania at the Culver City Farmers Market and had to ask, ""Are these vegan?"" It's funny because her signs read dairy and egg free, but no mention of being vegan so I had to check it. Turns out she *used* to advertise as vegan, but all those idiots out there who think vegan food automatically must taste like dirt ruined it, she had to change the marketing. So now if you talk to her she'll tell you all about the vegan-ness of her products and just how popular they are, but she keeps the tasty bastards as vegan in disguise until asked about it.And they are VERY good. Peach, strawberry-rhubarb, cherry... I just drooled on my keyboard, gross. Smaller in size so you don't feel like you have to eat a huge dessert over a few days before it goes bad, it's perfect to share with another person or just destroy yourself in one sitting if the mood (or munchies) takes you.Such a nice lady running the gig too, she drives these little baked delights up to different markets from her bakery.So good, with that natural vibe you just can't get from processed garbage you'll find at the typical grocery store. Kudos to you, Cobblermania."
4/18/2011,20110418,4,4.47,"Tried the peach cobbler at the Torrance farmer's market. The lady was so nice; earlier she had had to go home, bake more cobbler and bring it back it was so in demand! I liked it a lot (ate the W-H-O-L-E thing), but I'm not sure it's the best I have had. Flossie's on Redondo Beach Blvd. is just too darned good....however, I just may have to do a side-by-side taste test real soon. I see she also has sweet potato cobbler (oh heaven!) so next time I'll try that one."
4/30/2011,20110430,5,4.5,"So I just clobbered two VEGAN apple cobblers today at the Wilson Park Farmer's Market in Torrance, CA - and they hit the spot! I'm not sure if they're gluten-free or organic, but if your only dietary baseline is ethics - they are definitely ""cruelty-free,"" sweet & delicious goodness!"
5/10/2011,20110510,5,4.53,"My family just finished eating a blackberry cobbler from Cobblermania and it was awesome. My son said it was amazing and I must agree. I love the fact that there was no refined sugar in it. I met Shae, the owner of Cobblermania, at Farmer's Market in Torrance. She is a delightful person, so friendly. She started her business with a family recipe that has been passed down for generations and she has perfected it. She proudly presents her family photo next to her cobblers. If you go to farmers market in Torrance you must try these cobblers!"
8/23/2011,20110823,5,4.55,"Cobbler mania cobblers are off the chain. I went to see her on 67th and Central Ave. I read all the reviews b4 I went to try her cobblers. Everybody said something great about her cobblers so I had to try them... They are delicious. I got the strawberry & mango, apple, peach, & sweet potato, I would got back and get them all again. I would get 2 of the strawberry mango the best:0) The crust is very flaky the fruit is sweet & fresh. Her cobblers are not overly sweet like most vegan desserts. She will see me again..."
9/1/2011,20110901,5,4.57,I live in Riverside and is willing to drive to L.A for ur pies... all I can say is WOW!!  VERY GOOD!
9/28/2011,20110928,5,4.59,"I am not vegan, but I am lactose intolerant, making good sweets all the more harder to find. However, with my crazy sweet tooth, I ventured out and got the sweet potato pie. It was all done in one day and I really need more. I need a storefront....cobbler withdrawal.....please help me."
12/25/2011,20111225,5,4.61,"It's Christmas day and we're sitting here enjoying the Lakers battle the Bulls, drinking seasonal brews and indulging ourselves with the most delicious vegan cobbler anyone of us has ever tried. The blueberry-peach is just outstanding. Owner Shae also deserves a shout-out for her caring customer service: she showed genuine concern that we wouldn't be able to pick up our order in time for Christmas Eve, calling repeatedly to make sure we were on our way. When you combine the excellence of the product and the service, this is exactly the kind of independently-owned business I enjoy supporting. Cobbler and football on New Year's day, now that's a plan!"
2/8/2012,20120208,5,4.62,"Wow this lady makes some amazing PIE! I ate a small amount that a special someone bought and I wanted to eat the whole thing.I'm not a pie person at all, but I definitely loved eating Shay..Shae..Shea's...(however she spells it) Pie's!I've been won over by this amazing treat.It's not heavy, it's not super sweet and it just taste pure and yummy.Give me some more pie, PIE lady!If you get a chance, I highly recommend this as a treat."
3/9/2012,20120309,5,4.64,"I ordered two cobblers from Shae, and they were both delicious...the blackberry and peach was superb as was the small apple cobbler. Track them down by phone or at one of the weekly farmer's markets they attend. Yummy. Waiting for Thanksgiving to order some for my meal!!!"
8/7/2012,20120807,5,4.65,Wow!!!! What to say about Shae and her amazing business. This woman can make COBBLER! I love how her cobblers are super sensitive to those with intolerances such as myself. If you email or call her the night before she can totally make you a gluten free cobbler as well! And they are already dairy free so that knocks out my only other restriction. Shae is not only a wonderful cook but a wonderful human being. When you try her cobbler....its safe to say you will become a COBBLERMANIAC! :-Dp.s. try the blueberry and sweet potato flavors. good GOD its delicious!
9/22/2012,20120922,5,4.67,"Yum cobbler -- cute small size portions. I had the white nectarine cherry, which was delicious. I love that they don't add gobs of sugar. It's simple, but delicious. And they were offering free scoops of ice cream with the cobbler, which was a great pair. $7 seemed like a fair deal, too. Nice ladies!"
11/6/2012,20121106,5,4.68,I love her service great customer service. Every pie is always baked fresh and I will continue going here before anywhere else. I refer everyone to this lady we lover her at 1800 dentist
11/16/2012,20121116,5,4.69,"This lady has a stand at the farmer's market at the Warner Bros. lot once a week. I tried a peach cobbler and it was excellent. Not too sugary sweet and the crust was delish. The pie size is good for 4 servings. Not sure if she makes regular 8/9"" pies. I had no idea the pies were vegan! BONUS for me as I am allergic to eggs. I wish she had a website so I could order online or at least find out where else she is in the city during the week.7$ per pie."
12/19/2012,20121219,5,4.7,"Shea, I love your cobblers! The pear apple raspberry was great but I especially love the pumpkin. Customer service is friendly and responsive. I'm going to order my Christmas cobbler as soon as I finish this review."
7/31/2013,20130731,5,4.71,Mmmmm...Mmmmm... LOVE @ 1st B!TE...My boyfriend and I had been on the hunt for Blueberry Cobbler and could not find a Place that had it...And one day I happened to LQQK on YELP while I was on La Brea and the 10 FWY and low and behold we found the wonderful Ms.Shae and her AMAZING Cobblers!!! She is no longer located in that area but on 83rd and Western @ GB where you can buy her awesome cobblers on a daily. She is also a vendor at Farmer's Market's Hollywood Sun 8-1 Culver City Tues 3-7 Torreance Sat 8-1 Pomona Fairplex Thurs 5:30-8:30pm So be prepared to become a COBBLERMANIC!!! :-P
10/6/2013,20131006,5,4.72,"I'm not sure how she does it, but this sweet potato cobbler that I just devoured was pretty much one of the best baked things I've masticated on. Flaky crust (butter free...whaaaat?), sweet-but-not-too-sweet filling of sweet potato, and to top it all off, STILL WARM FROM THE OVEN OF LOVE from that morning. Dang. Why bother baking yourself when you can get it from here, fresh baked, as good as home made because it is home made. Dang it, I guess I'm a cobbler-maniac!"
12/4/2013,20131204,4,4.7,"I ordered an Organic Strawberry Rhubarb cobbler, just a few days before thanksgiving and Shaye gladly accommodated. Perfect combo of sweetness from organic strawberries and tang from the rhubarb's natural sourness. Great home-made bubbly crust, cut out in cute little heart shapes. This was the hit of the dessert table! My family absolutely loved it - this is gonna be a holiday staple for us. My youngest sis took a small cobbler and horded it, so I couldn't tell you anything about it, except that it's worth starting a family feud with some cousins.  I love, love, love Shaye! She is just a character and a treat. She called me the day of delivery to let me know she would be running an hour behind delivery due to last minute orders. This was great for me (she knew I'd hit traffic coming from San Diego). I love that she gets to know the who, what, where so she can juggle her ""Cobblermaniacs"" needs accordingly. I learned that this is a pure community-supported, woman-owned and operated small-business. How awesome! Cobblermania is run out of the extra kitchen at the best Golden Bird ever! This place is a feast for the eyes. and belly. (Review to come!) Cobblers run $7 for a 1-2 serving cobbler up to $30/35 for about a 20 serving cobbler. Parking in the private lot is a breeze.So yeah, love the service and price... but the real deal is the taste.Next time I'll order our pumpkin pie here and try the blueberry-maple cobbler."
12/22/2013,20131222,5,4.71,"My man had been craving his Grandma's Peach Cobbler for the longest time and unfortunately his Grandma passed away a few years ago. The other night at 6:30pm we were determined to find a place that would make Peach Cobbler as good as his Grandma's.We searched Yelp and came across Cobblermania. We called to see if they had peach cobbler and the woman that answered the phone was the nicest woman ever! (She's the owner and baker of Cobblermania). As soon as she heard about the craving of his Grandma's Peach Cobbler, she offered to make a pie fresh specially for him. When we go there we were so happy to see that Cobblermania was inside of Golden Bird. We seriously thought we were dreaming. Was this all too good to be true? We first munched on the best fried chicken and for dessert we had a most delicious freshly baked warm peach cobbler with ice cream. He said it was just like how his Grandma made it and was so happy to have finally found someone who makes a great Peach Cobbler!! We left as Cobblermaniacs because we demolished the whole pie lol. It was good!We definitely recommend Cobblermania to anyone looking for homemade delicious pies!"
3/19/2014,20140319,5,4.71,"After my run I get a different flavor every week at the Culver City farmers market. Too many favorites!!! If I had to choose one I would get mango blueberry peach, strawberry mango, or raspberry peach. In that order of availability. Any other would be just fine."
5/28/2014,20140528,5,4.72,"Someone from my job brought in the sweet potato cobbler, boy did I want to steal the whole thing for myself. It was absolutely amazing. I am still drooling. Absolutely the best I have ever eaten."
7/8/2014,20140708,5,4.73,"I wish Cobblermania were right next door. Shea's cobblers are the best I've ever had. She got a great variety to choose from, the cobblers are always fresh, and reasonably priced. I've bought cobblers for parties, for myself, for friends, and they've always been a big hit!"
8/27/2014,20140827,5,4.74,"Cobblermania at the Hollywood Farmers Market sells the best cobbler I've ever had. The first time I stopped by the booth I could not decide which cobbler to buy so I had the awesome people behind the table pick for me. The half mile ride home was torture because I wanted to pull over and eat the cobbler right then and there! This past Sunday (8/24/14), I stopped again and this time I picked a sweet potato and strawberry cobbler. OMG! Cobblers are all-vegan and made with agave which does not cause my sugar levels to go sky high. BTW, I'm not a vegan. Shae is the top notch creator and artist behind these cobblers. I can't wait for Sunday to go back."
11/27/2014,20141127,5,4.74,Shae was great! Super accommodating and friendly. Buy these cobblers they are the best I have tried in LA!
1/14/2015,20150114,5,4.75,"She makes several different kinds of cobbler. She makes Sweet Potato pie, Apple, Peach, Strawberry Rhubarb, Blackberry, and a few others also. I have had all of these and rarely leave buying just 1 pie. I don't believe I have ever just bought 1 pie. You may not find a better pie in the L.A. area. They really are that good."
2/10/2015,20150210,5,4.76,"I love the peach cobbler by CobblerMania. I tried it in December 2014 and will be a regular whenever I get a craving for peach cobbler. The crust is fresh and has the right consistency. The peach filler is fresh, tasty and juicy the way I like it. Shae is friendly and very accomodating. She is very passionate about her pies. They are clearly made with LOVE."
3/12/2015,20150312,5,4.76,"My professor invited Miss Shae to our African American Experience class today as a treat to celebrate our final class together and to also celebrate the ending of her teaching career at Cal Poly Pomona University. Miss Shae prepared enough peach cobbler for the entire class and even had enough for seconds. This was such a treat! I often skip eating peach cobbler but today I most certainly indulged, twice. Her cobbler was fantastic!!!!I will defiantely be stopping by her establishment next time I'm in LA.Thank you for the sweet joy your brought today to class!"
4/10/2015,20150410,5,4.77,"Well, I don't want to be accused of speaking with a forked tongue, but there can be more than one winner in a cobbler contest. Last week I bought a cobbler from Cobblermania for my Aunt and a cobbler for myself somewhere else. Shae, the owner made a blueberry cobbler specially for my Aunt for Easter and I didn't want to ask her to bake another one for me, too. Since I didn't get to try Cobblermania's cobbler until today, I couldn't review the cobblers. My Aunt loved the blueberry cobbler and proclaimed it tasted like the ones she use to make! I knew that meant the cobbler tasted better than the ones she use to make!, but, I couldn't make that leap unless I tasted the cobbler myself. Now, I can make that leap! The cobblers are made with love. I'm not sure where you buy love or if it comes in liquid form, but it's definitely in those cobblers. That's how these cobblers make you feel! Truly, the crust was light and buttery. The peaches had to be picked fresh off of somebody's mother's tree. Every ingredient worked together in harmony to form a more perfect union... Anyway, whenever I start throwing quotes around, that's a sign that whatever I've eaten has inspired me! Cobblermania cobblers have that effect. You have got to try one of these!"
4/17/2015,20150417,5,4.77,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet:Shae is a cobbler goddess. Her cobblers are so beyond-words good I cannot fairly describe them except to say ""thank you"" for making my tastebuds have the most happy experience of their existence on this earth. Pure heaven. I love them. Love is indeed a powerful word, but yes, these cobblers are light, flaky, tasty, fruity, and worthy of the word love. They certainly are *made* with love...and it shows."
5/31/2015,20150531,5,4.78,"Completely stumbled on this cobbler by chance.I was at my local Office Depot making some copies and prints, and Ms. Shae was next to me in her chef's hat printing labels for her cobbler business, Cobblermania.I love me a good cobbler, so I introduced myself and we talked for a few minutes about cobblers and how delicious they are. She told me all Farmers Markets and various fairs that she brings her cobblers to, and told me to drop by and visit.I looked at the Yelp page and saw that it has glowing reviews, so I made a mental note to stop by one of these days and try her famous cobblers.As I'm pulling out of the parking lot of Office Depot, Ms. Shae comes running over! I roll down my window and she hands me a whole raspberry mango cobbler.I love when people can bring hospitality wherever they go!I went straight to the grocery store and bought a carton of vanilla bean ice cream and enjoyed the cobbler when I got home (and yeah, it was good).Mmmmmm....."
6/4/2015,20150604,5,4.78,My concern was it being too sweet and it was not! It was slightly sweet but not too sweet. It was so good! I had the peach cobbler and she used nice quality peaches and I believe it was vegan. I read the ingredients and didnt find any animal products.
7/11/2015,20150711,5,4.79,Just tried the blueberry peach cobbler and it was perfect not to sweet. And wow I can't believe it was made with agave which is better than sugar especially for diabetics. Got it at the Torrance Farmers Market. You must try it.
7/12/2015,20150712,5,4.79,"Purchased cobblers at Torrance Farmers Market on my way out, the best purchase of the day. The blueberry peach is awesome and I love that her desserts are made with agave and not sugar. I plan to continue eating these delicious cobblers it is worth the drive"
1/19/2016,20160119,5,4.8,OMG. I bought two tonight at the farmers market in Culver city. The peach and apple were amazing. My favorite is the apple all heated up. OMG!!
2/4/2016,20160204,5,4.8,Love this cobbler! I tried the sweet potato first and now I've tried the peach. I will have to buy at least one of these a week and I can't wait to try all the flavors/fruits. They are SO good! The most amazing part is that she uses agave instead of sugar which is always a plus in my book.
6/16/2016,20160616,5,4.8,The pie is delicious and shea is very nice. She was sold out of pies and made another one for me when she didn't have to. I thought that was really nice and i will definitely be coming back (:
6/18/2016,20160618,5,4.81,"Bought a peach cobbler at vegan fest today. Amazing!!! So good!!!! Warmed it up when I got home, best late night snack ever."
7/2/2016,20160702,3,4.77,"I've been craving a good cobbler lately and found out about Cobblermania through Yelp. So, looking through the reviews I concluded that this is the key to my yearning for cobbler. I got a peach and cherry/apricot cobbler at the Monrovia farmers market and was ready for some cobbler heaven. Upon eating them, I was satisfied but not to the extent of all the build up. Don't get me wrong they were good, solid cobblers (more like pies) but nothing to go out of your way for. After eating them, I got a little peace knowing they are vegan because it has to be a little healthier, right? Definitely worth a try, especially if you are a vegan but nothing to go crazy for."
7/2/2016,20160702,5,4.78,"I drive to wherever Shae's at! Culver City FM, Torrance FM, Monrovia Street Fair, etc. Best cobblers you will ever have!!! I'm a cobblermanic, though I wasn't until I found cobblermania at the Hollywood farmers market. I was never a pie or cobbler fan until I tried hers. It is the right amount of sweetness and the top + bottom crust is amazing! Who doesn't want more crust! She'll even top the cobbler with vanilla ice cream if you want. Yum!"
8/22/2016,20160822,5,4.78,I can tell you this is the best peach cobbler ever. I'm the most picky person and this tops my cobbler hands down . Will be stopping for some more . Also he has different favor . He does take debit card also .
11/8/2016,20161108,5,4.79,"So, so good. I was fortunate enough to get a peach cobbler hot out the oven. It's by far the BEST cobbler I've ever had. The crust to fruit ratio is perfect. I will definitely be returning. Cash ONLY. The location is inside a restaurant."
11/22/2016,20161122,5,4.79,"Ordered a half sheet and went the day before to check out a personal size. Tried the blueberry peach cobbler and excellent. After that I added a full sheet Also she is really a beautiful person, so great desert and a great person what more can you ask for. Can't wait to eat the peach cobbler on Thanksgiving!!!"
12/7/2016,20161207,5,4.79,"I'm officially a Cobblermaniac. I tried the apple, four berry, blueberry, and my new favorite blueberry-peach. The cobblers are not artificially overly sweet since the chef uses agave. For a person who cares about what they put into their body this is a great dessert. They taste very fresh and natural. Be sure to order the large ones ahead of time or else you'll be buying several of the smaller ones like I did."
1/2/2017,20170102,5,4.8,"I have been a faithful customer of Cobblermania for many years. We LOVE Shae's cobblers and her excellent customer service! We especially love it warmed and a la mode style with coconut ice cream yum! Our favorite is blackberry apple but you really can't go wrong with any flavor. She uses no refined sweetener( agave sweetened) and even has a gluten-free option. I used to make homemade peach cobbler but since discovering Shae's delicious cobblers, I have gladly turned the honor over to her. For as long as she's whipping up her cobblers, I'll be calling and placing our orders. Thanks Shae!! Long live Cobblermania!"
4/4/2017,20170404,5,4.8,"Not only are these pies delicious - whether gluten free or not - but for a long time, when my daughter was only eating gluten free, on a doctor's recommendation, I had a standing order for a sweet potato pie. Everyone was always ready with my kid's pie, and a smile and kind words. Thank you Cobblermania!"
4/23/2017,20170423,5,4.8,"AN AMAZING HIDDEN GEM IN LOS ANGELES! Among the tastiest cobbler I have ever had! Despite being low on flavor options that day I tried it, I went for the blueberry mango peach cobbler, and it was sensational! I will definitely pick up another cobbler later, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Cobblermania!"

Slap ya mama, ya sista, ya grandma, ya baby, ya pet, ya auntie's cousin's baby daddy's mother's friend, some random old person walking down the street!

The crust was crumbelievable!!! I can't remember her name, but I think it was Barb, like rhubarb, or maybe it was Mary, like marion berry??????? Whatever this sweet pie angel's name was, her pies were divine!! We got the 5 berry and boy it was just the right amount of berries!! Double crust? More like angel dust! This shit is addictive as fuck! Give me 5 more. Check please! **no animals were harmed in the making of these pies or this review**Signed, piiiiiiiiiete (pronounced like tiiiight ya dum dum)P.S.

Finally reunited with Shae tonight after I did a massive cobbler hunt for her.. lol so glad to know she's been here all along, right where I found her in the 1st place. Shae is still the sweetest since the 1st day I met her, also was so surprised that after all the people and families she meets she still remembered us. That tells a lot about her. I also picked up a cobbler for my friend to try and she txt me within minutes on how GOOD THE COBBLER WAS!!! Needless to say another ""COBBLER MANIAC"" was created:)"

I only bought it because I smelled it..I didn't sample it...I didn't need to. The smell was pure homemade apple pie smell. I had a gap of time where I bought it at 1230pm..and just am having it at 7pm...and it is PERFECTION. Gotta be brown sugar in there...Delicious! I know she said she did the Torrance Farmers Market on Saturdays but another on a different day...I should have listened but will find her. Want to try the Peach. Outstanding..10 of 10.

Upon looking at my options, I decided to try the mango peach pie with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream. My girlfriends and I eagerly dug our spoons into the tin & quickly knew why she had such a strong rating. We were not disappointed by her five-star worthy pie & are happy to announce ourselves as devoted cobblermaniacs!"

She told me she was coming from Hollywood and would be at that location in an hour. She kept in contact and met me there. Real sweet, professional woman. Now to the cobbler. Lord knows I shouldn't be eating it but I need it..i just do. Theres more crust than peaches for those who like crust. She told me she makes them fresh daily. Theres a nice lemon taste, peaches aren't too crunchy. Would I be back? Probably.... possibly"

10/2/2017,20171002,5,4.82,We discovered Shea's cobblers a few months ago and are TOTALLY ADDICTED!! We go every week and buy at least 7 !! We have given them to friends too... who LOVE them like we do!! She uses agave for sweetener . They are DELICIOUS and FRESH and Shea really is as SWEET as her pies!!! FANTASTIC!!
10/17/2017,20171017,5,4.83,"Shae, You made my day! Delicious cobblers and excellent service. Cobblermania you have a customer for life. See you again next week."
10/17/2017,20171017,5,4.83,Delicious. I love peach cobbler and this was great. This is a one woman show and she is good. Great customer service. Shae is friendly and efficient. I ordered a cobbler for 20 guests. It arrived warm and ready to eat.
10/18/2017,20171018,3,4.8,"I was craving peach cobbler & found cobbler mania. I was so excited because of the reviews but honestly I'm not sure if people say it's to die for because the fact that it's Vegan & a healthier sweet option or what. Although it was good, I wouldn't go brag to anyone about it. It didn't taste like I expected or how my grandma makes it for thanksgiving. I get that's it's Vegan & healthy but I really wished it had more sugar, cinnamon, & ...... Peaches! It had more crust than anything & it's $8-10 so I'm not sure if I'll be back."
11/24/2017,20171124,5,4.81,"My mother brought some pear cobbler for the holidays. It was AMAZING, cant wait to get back to LA to get some more. Check it out guys"
1/26/2018,20180126,5,4.81,"The first time I tasted this cobbler was at the Annual Taste of Soul that is held near the Baldwin hills mall. I New from the very first bite that I would be a lifelong cobbler maniac. This cobbler is world class. It is literally in a league of its own. I contacted the owner of the company and immediately New that she has the real deal. She is professional, considerate and she appreciates all of her customers. Unfortunately the highest score I can give her is a 5 on here, in my book she is a perfect 10 like her product. I definitely recommend."
2/26/2018,20180226,5,4.81,Vegan crust . What . It's so good.And she doesn't add sugar to her cobblers... she uses agave. She's all over the city in different places so totally accessible. And what more than to support a local artist like her ! She makes the cobblers sooo good and adds ice cream when you ask to eat it right there !
7/26/2018,20180726,5,4.81,"I can't believe I've been eating Cobbler here for years and never left a Yelp review. All I can say is WOW! Shame on me. Well anyway, I buy something EVERY time Cobblermania shows up to Food Truck Thursday at Pomona Fairplex. I have bought damn near everything over the years and it's ALL GOOD so you can't go wrong. Candace is the owner who is also provides A+ customer service. These are THE BEST cobblers on the planet. She uses organic raw agave instead of processed sugar. If you haven't had a cobbler from here then you truly haven't lived yet"
7/26/2018,20180726,5,4.82,"I had my first cobbler by this vendor this week. I purchased it from her at the Culver City farmers market.

Upon reading all the natural ingredients she uses I was pleasantly surprised that I wouldn't feel guilt eating this dessert. It was so delicious. She was right, I will be back for more!"

As they say...""try it you'll like it"".I say...""try it you'll love it""."
10/4/2018,20181004,5,4.82,"I've been vegan for some time now so finding something sweet is not that easy. I picked up a couple of peach cobblers from Shae and OMG it's delicious, I get to satisfy my sweet tooth without eggs, milk, and butter, she also uses agave which is a Dr. Sebi sweetener so that was a big plus as well. Shae herself is wonderful, a breath of fresh air, her great tasting cobblers and amazing personality lead to a great overall customer experience. I will definitely be going back, to Cobblermania."
12/17/2018,20181217,5,4.82,Great cobblers! Fresh filling with great crust. Parking was a breeze. Kind baker. We tried the Mango/Blueberry/Peach and the traditional peach. Very good. Would definitely recommend.
1/2/2019,20190102,5,4.83,"Ordered cobblers to feed 30 people 2 years in a row. Peach and a mixed berry. Not a bite is ever left over. The cobblers are beautiful to look and with enough crust AND filling to please both those who prefer more crust or more filling. But the taste is what keeps us going back. You can tell these cobblers are made with love. And dealing with Shea, the owner, is a dream. We're Cobblermaniacs!"
1/3/2019,20190103,5,4.83,"Wow, this customer service is unparalleled. The owner, Shae, had something come up and wasn't able to get me my order by 8 am on Christmas as planned. I had other commitments that took me out of the city that day, so she drove the cobblers to me in time for my dinner. Shae even gave us an extra cobbler free of charge as an apology for the inconvenience. She is the sweetest lady ever, just like her vegan cobblers! I couldn't believe she would do all of that for a customer, especially on Christmas. Thanks, Shae!"
2/25/2019,20190225,5,4.83,This is the best cobbler- no. The best thing- I have ever put in my mouth I go to the Farmers market just so that I can get these cobblers! Warm or cold this is the best thing you will eat all day!

4/14/2019,20190414,5,4.76,You will not find a better cobbler. I've been buying these for at least 3 years now from the Culver farmers market. These are vegan and Shae makes gluten free options as well. MBP or mango blueberry peach is my personal fav but so many good ones. Sweet potato is a close second. Everyone I've recommended these too has raved after trying them. Shae is such a nice person too! If you're at the farmers market or somewhere where these are sold get a couple and support an awesome local business.
5/3/2019,20190503,5,4.76,"I absolutely LOVE Cobblermania! I have had some challenges with an autoimmune disease, so my options for desserts have been very limited. When I stopped by Cobblermania, Shae was so kind. She explained that all her cobblers are vegan. What was even better is that she can make her cobblers gluten free. I buy her gluten free cobblers religiously now! They are so good. I usually get the apple or peach...sometimes both. You can that Shae cares about her clients and she wants them to enjoy her cobblers. I highly recommend that you try a cobbler (or two) by Cobblermania. :)"
6/15/2019,20190615,5,4.76,"I've been getting her pies from the Torrance Farmer's Market for years. Fruit forward, not-too-sweet, and the crust is just right. I tend to hide mine in the back of the refrigerator so it's all mine, so if you're planning on sharing, get more than one!"
7/11/2019,20190711,5,4.77,"This is one of the best cobblers I have ever had.  Still warm when we bought it.  We tried the mango, peach, blueberry.  Crust is amazing!!!"
7/28/2019,20190728,5,4.77,"Let me preface this with: I'm from the South. I'm not talking San Diego, folks, I mean born & raised in Virginia, and transplanted to CA after 13 years in Atlanta, Georgia. Yup, THAT South. Point being, I've been around a cobbler or 5,213. The South's got nuthin' on Cobblermania' s cobblers. Okay, to be fair, this was my first time, and maybe somebody's Great Aunt Beulah in Covington, Georgia might make one better, but I highly doubt it. The fruit. Blueberry and peach. Who knew these two are as perfect together as Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire? (Okay, for you hipstery mid-20s something, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas?) Apparently, Shae the Cobbler Whisperer does. Succulent. Sweet, but not cloying. Not mushy, but definitely slides right down the gullet.The crust. Sweet Baby Jeebus, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THIS COBBLER IS VEGAN WITH CRUST LIKE THIS?!?!? Melts in the mouth like a Hershey bar on Georgia asphalt in August. Cannot believe no lard was harmed in the making of this cobbler.Oh, did I happen to mention it's VEGAN, yet still somehow utterly gobsmackingly deeeeeelicious? (Sorry vegans, but bacon is its own food group for me, go eat some kale chips and sulk about it, better yet, eat something with FLAVOR, like one of Shae's cobblers.) The chef. Chef Shae was a breath of down-to-earth fresh air in the midst of Hollywood, but don't read that to mean dowdy or old-fashioned. No, I mean, she's like a REAL person. She ENGAGES you- conversational, anecdotal, with an undercurrent of sage wisdom and observation. Oh, and she rescues stray dogs, too, and that takes a mighty big heart.You can taste a piece of that heart in her cobblers. Okay, that sounds kinda weird and icky, but I think y'all get the point- Cobblermania is legit. Go find her on Instagram and get thee to a location that sells her wares. Awww, dangit. My poor waistline is doomed."
10/20/2019,20191020,5,4.77,Man lord have mercy I will probably be here every Sunday... If you haven't tried one I don't know what you waiting on...
6/3/2020,20200603,5,4.77,"I was at the N. Hollywood farmers market a few weeks ago and purchased Shae's Appke cobbler and pear cobbler and thoroughly enjoyed BOTH ALL BY MYSELF! #noshame #iwasglutonousNeedless to say, I will order again soon."
6/20/2020,20200620,5,4.78,"Go get your freaking pie from this black-owned shop!! I recently started a dairy-free diet which has made finding desserts to eat incredibly difficult. I was so stoked to come across a pie shop on Instagram that has ALL VEGAN pies. Did my research and went out to Torrance Farmers Market the next day to get myself a pie, which was the most warm and friendly experience ever! The pie itself was just as great as the service. I do wish I reheated the pie to toast the crust a bit more but I still have half left so I'll remember next time :) Cannot wait to bring some to my next family gathering."
6/23/2020,20200623,5,4.78,"5 stars for the service! You'll feel like as if you were getting it from a relative who wants to make you happy. I missed the Farmers's Market so I trekked out to Golden Bird to grab the pies. The pies I got were just minutes out of the oven so they smelled.... amazing (that's the only word that I can think of that would describe it). As far as the taste, it met every expectation I had."
9/6/2020,20200906,5,4.78,"Amazing cobbler. I've recommended this place to all my friends. We were stunned by how good it was. Also, black-owned business alert! They've gained my lifelong support!"
9/13/2020,20200913,5,4.78,"I was purchasing vegan cheese from a different vendor at the Hollywood farmers market when a across the way I hear a chipper voice say ""we have vegan cobbler!"" I knew instantly that I would need to head over to check out the merchandise. I spoke to Shea the cobbler master herself, she told me about the various flavors they had and not only were they vegan but they were so fresh. She mentioned that when she finds out she's running out of inventory at the farmers market she ends up running off to make more. The peach cobbler I got was still warm at the bottom from the oven. When I got home to try it I was FLOORED! It was just the right amount of sweet and the crust was baked to perfection! After I ate a few of the peaches inside I noticed that the filling began oozing out, it was the most glorious sight. I was warned that I would love my cobbler and I'm hooked. I can't wait to go back to try the other flavors."
10/2/2020,20201002,5,4.78,Shae makes the most tasty cobblers with imaginative combinations of various fruits. She made my cobblers to my request of just a top crust. It was truly wonderful. Please try her cobblers. It really is worth the effort to go to the farmer's markets where she sells them in various locations.
1/6/2021,20210106,5,4.79,"Omgoodness!!! The peach cobbler is simply delicious!!! My whole family loved it! Topped with some vanilla ice cream, you are in sweet heaven. Not to mention her customer service is superb!"
2/24/2021,20210224,5,4.79,"So freaking good! If you love cobbler look no further. The pastry is buttery and flaky and the fruit is sweet while still letting the natural flavor and tartness shine through. And it's vegan??! At $10 each it's a little pricier than a mass produced dessert you might buy at Ralphs or whatever, but you're supporting local WOC small business using high quality ingredients. And it's seriously good stuff! The owner is so nice to. 10/10 worth it."
3/13/2021,20210313,5,4.79,"I walked past this stand at the farmers market, and there was a line. I bought a peach cobbler, and may have totally eaten the entire thing myself in a day. Very tasty!"
3/27/2021,20210327,5,4.79,"Found Cobblermania at Torrance Farmers Market. Met most amazing and joyful baker/owner, Shae. Delicious varieties of cobbler. Sweet potato, blueberry, blackberries, strawberry/rhubarb, and many others. Our Black berry cobbler is wow delicious! Cobbler pastry delicious and black berries soooooo good. Thank you Shae! We'll see you again soon."
4/5/2021,20210405,5,4.79,"Kudos to Shay. Thank you for the peach cobbler absolutely mouthwatering delicious, family was pleased as well and satisfied that taste of old school. Thank you for the reminder to call since I forgot. Good luck &. God Bless."
4/10/2021,20210410,5,4.79,"Recently caught up with Cobbler Mania during the weekly Culver City Farmer's Market. Shae makes these phenomenal made from scratch cobblers that'll make you want to slap somebody! Try classic flavors like peach, cherry, blueberry and rhubarb. Or if you're looking for something different you can check out fillings such as strawberry, guava or mango. I purchased a peach cobbler. When I got home I popped the cobbler in the oven and added some vanilla bean ice cream on top to finish it off . The buttery crust and warm filing is sure to feed your soul"
4/27/2021,20210427,5,4.8,The best cobblers and to think there is no sugar. Last time I saw her at Torrance farmers market she had ran out of the flavor I wanted.
6/3/2021,20210603,5,4.8,"Tried Cobblermania for the first time this past weekend. We are at the Torrance Farmers Market on Saturday at Wilson Park when we saw their stand. After some deliberation we chose two, the 4-Berry, and the Mango-Blueberry-Peach. Both were very very good and did not disappoint. The ingredients tasted fresh and the sweetness of them was just right and not over the top. Would definitely recommend and can't wait to try them again"
6/5/2021,20210605,1,4.77,"Don't normally take the time to write bad reviews as I believe everyone can have a bad day but buyer beware in this case. I am a frequent patron of the Torrance Farmers market and find the vendors to always be friendly, helpful and the product is fresh and delicious.  My sister has recently been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and although her tastebuds are shot she recently expressed that she just wanted a peach cobbler. As I was leaving today the market today, low and behold I passed Cobblermania and quickly doubled back, excited that I would be able to give my sister a scrumptious treat. I waited patiently in line to make my purchase. I was greeted in a lukewarm manner which seemed odd as the vendor was very gregarious and seemed to great everyone else warmly. When it was my turn I asked if could use a credit card as many vendors accept cards even if they don't post any signage.  Initially Shae or Shay (sp?) said she responded that she did accept credit cards but then suddenly seemed to change her mind and asked me if I had cash. Thought that was odd since she had just said she accepted credit cards.  I wondered why the sudden change.  I did however explain that I hadn't planned on making any more purchases that day but had seen her cobblers and made an exception because my sister really wanted a peach cobbler. I explained that I did have cash but had planned to use it to purchase flowers for my sister. Still confused that her whole demeanor towards me seemed to be different from how she was treating her other patrons My agenda and focus was to just get that cobbler for my sister because I knew she was looking forward to her treat. So... I swallowed down the way I felt like she was treating me as again I give everyone the benefit of the doubt and realize everyone can have a bad day. I was confused but just wanted the experience to be over so that I could go about my day. After letting her know my selection of pies, Shay then very rudely announced to me that ""you know these pies are $10.00"".  Now mind you, I'd been standing in line for some time and hadnt heard her make this same announcement to anyone else even though some of the patrons seemed to be newbies just like myself. She smiled and laughed with them while bagging their cobblers and gave them their totals so even though her prices weren't posted and I hadn't heard her mention the cost to anyone else, I assumed that was the process and was prepared to pay whatever the cost as well I had this sister waiting for her cobbler. It was at this time that I decided I didn't want to give my hard earned money to someone who was treating me in this manner. So I told her that I changed my mind about purchasing the cobblers . That I felt like her behavior towards me had some very negative undertones.  As I was walking away, she yelled out over the crowd, "" I said I would take your card"" Shay/Shae then became loud and belligerent, yelling that was always ""us"".  I asked her to explain her statement and she said ""the blacks"".  Needless to say I was floored as she too is a black woman. I will share that I am a director of customer service for a large multi national company and I sit on the board of our DEI council which is heavily focused on inclusivity. So to say my level of disappointment that a vendor that services consumers in an area that covers a large swath of people of every imaginable nationality would behave in this manner was just appalling. So today my sister got a frozen peach pie, she was disappointed but I could not in good conscience participate in excusing such abhorrent behavior. Shay/Shae. Please learn from this experience and grow. Although the customer isn't always right, they always deserve your decency and professionalism."
6/9/2021,20210609,5,4.77,Her cobbler is really the best cobbler I have ever had. I guess it's a little pricy for a student but definitely worth a try!
6/10/2021,20210610,5,4.77,"In the past I was a frequent customer of Shae & Cobblermania and ever since the very first we met over 10 years ago, I've considered her a friend, and we instantly hit it off & bonded because she is as sweet & kind as her cobbler pies. I'm lactose intolerant and it's very difficult to find a good clobber in general, let alone, a damn good one that's dairy-free! :) and that's what first caught my attention 10 years ago at a vegan convention, when I purchased my very first peach cobbler from Shae. I even went back the next day to buy & try others. And guess what? Back then I recall it was $10...and it's still the same price today. Through the years I've gone out of a way searching for Cobblermania at all my neighborhood farmers markets. In addition, I used to go to her shop/store often on Venice & La Cienega to satisfy my peach cobbler craving, when I wasn't able to find time for farmers markets. I also told my friends & family (and strangers too) all about my new hidden gem. I even gave pies for gifts. I don't eat a lot of sweets (doesn't mean I don't love them ;) but I've loved pies since childhood and I love me some Cobblermania! And because these are made with all natural ingredients, I don't feel so guilty indulging every now & then. Well, imagine my surprise when I decided to go to a farmers market for the first time in a while and saw Shae behind her Cobblermania booth; standing there with all her luscious & decedent pies, doing her thing, all sweet & smiles...and even though she was wearing a face mask, her smile still shined. I was with my friend/neighbor (who loves pie & cobbler too) and the second he saw my ecstatic reaction to seeing Shae & Cobblermania, he was sold. Thank you Shae for still being out there & here doing your thing, and thank you for keeping your prices reasonable because I've seen people trying to charge a whole lot more for their cobbler pies, that don't even come close to the quality & healthier ingredients you provide. Because you make the best & tastiest cobblers on earth."
6/10/2021,20210610,5,4.77,"This place is always UH-MAZIng. Been a customer for years. I have to limit my purchases these days because they are so delicious, I will keep eating."
7/17/2021,20210717,5,4.77,Wonderfully fresh fruit. Delicious and perfectly sweetened blueberry cobbler and apple cobbler.
7/25/2021,20210725,5,4.78,"These are the best pies you'll find in LA! And they're vegan, whaaaaat?! My husband and I went to the Hollywood Farmer's Market every weekend during my 2020 pregnancy because this was the one thing I consistently craved. My baby boy is now seven months old and very happy and healthy. It might not have anything to do with these pies but I've kept on eating them, just in case!! Bonus: by buying these pies you're supporting a Black woman-owned business. Boom."
8/12/2021,20210812,5,4.78,"I randomly saw this stand at the Tuesday downtown Culver City Farmer's Market - I'm SO glad I did! I got the strawberry-rhubarb cobbler, and it was incredible! My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this delicious dessert. Excited to come back for more!"
9/9/2021,20210909,5,4.78,"I've seen the Cobblermania stand at the Hollywood Farmer's Market for years and was curious to try, but never did because I enjoy baking and prefer to make my own pies and cobblers. Well, I finally decided to try one of Shae's cobblers and now I regret all those times I walked past without buying. Her cobbler absolutely blew me away! I'm not going to try to describe how good her cobblers are and just say that they are so good I wish I could buy one every day. The crust is fantastic, and her filling flavors are balanced and complex. I especially love her strawberry rhubarb cobbler. I usually don't like strawberry rhubarb together, but she somehow found the perfect balance between them and it is to die for. Don't be like me and walk past without buying a cobbler and giving your taste buds a wonderful gift. You won't regret it."
9/30/2021,20210930,3,4.77,"Years ago I came across Cobblermania on Yelp and saw all the 5 star reviews, notice it was a small local business, pictures of the cobblers looked delicious, I had to try it. I called the phone number on Yelp and got Shae, she took my order to have ready the following day with pick up at Golden Bird restaurant. I sent my husband to pick up some Golden Bird and peach/ strawberry cobbler and loved it. Since then, I've hit up Shae many times for cobblers. Her cobblers were so good that I wanted to share it with my family and friends, so I put in a Thanksgiving order for probably five cobblers. When my husband picked up the cobblers, one of them was caved in at the top, with the crust sank into the filling. My husband pointed it out to Shae, but Shae seemed to be bothered that he pointed it out to her and told him that it's still good. My husband felt bad because Shae threatened to call me to let me know and he didn't want to disappoint me, but I really wished she would've just replaced that cobbler because my thanksgiving guests mentioned that the crust of the cobbler that was caved in - was soggy. My guest also mentioned that the blueberry cobbler did not have enough blue berry in it and it was mostly liquid in it. That last time kind of turned us off.. for a while."
10/7/2021,20211007,5,4.77,Shae. Your cobblers are awesome. Bought sweet potato this past weekend. Heaven. Thank you for sharing your gift of cobblers magic. My wife and I appreciate you so much.
2/15/2022,20220215,5,4.77,"Yummy, yummy, yummy! Get some cobbler in your tummy!What on Earth could be better than regular ole' cobbler, you ask? Make it vegan and not jammed packed with sugar for a guilt-free delight!I ordered a half sheet for a small dinner party I was having. It was the hit of the night! Even my non-vegan, sugar eating friends loved it. (Shhhh! I didn't tell them.) 1st...2nd...3rd helping, please! Now everyone requests it when I go over.Treat Yourself!"
5/3/2022,20220503,5,4.77,"I just finished the BEST peach cobbler of my life...we happened upon the Hollywood Farmer's market on Sunday, on our way to a friend's birthday gathering. The first booth we stopped at was Cobblermania and a worshipped at the altar of baking. Coming home I sampled a bit and it is truly the tastiest cobbler ever! All that remains today is the empty pan. Thank you, will find you again soon."
