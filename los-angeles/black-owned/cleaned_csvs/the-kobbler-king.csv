12/26/2007,20071226,5,5.0,In my search for a Red Velvet cake I was told to go here. It was cheaper then the one place I went to. It tasted really good. The one bad thing is its street parking. Not in the best of areas. I would go back.
3/26/2009,20090326,5,5.0,This place has some of the best peach cobbler i have ever had and i love me some peach cobbler!It has been too long since I visited this place and I can't wait to go back.
7/4/2009,20090704,5,5.0,"EXCELLENT cobbler - very homemade and very tasty. You gotta get there early though, because everytime we go its late in the day and they're out of cherry! I hate that! But its a cute little place and worth the stop to pick up some wonderful cobbler to take home and pig out. I dont remember how much the cobbler was, but I think I remember it being NOT on the cheap side. Still - its good stuff and well worth it."
4/26/2010,20100426,5,5.0,The best sweet potato pie outside of Georgia.
12/16/2010,20101216,5,5.0,"I saw a bunch of cute little Sweet Potato Pies at Albertson's and couldn't resist. I'm happy I did, because they were delicious!! It was nice seeing on the ingredients label that everything was REAL (no artificial stuff or preservatives), and I'm big into supporting local businesses.I hope to see more flavors at Albertsons, and if not, I'll enjoy that sweet potato pie!"
7/15/2011,20110715,5,5.0,"I went to this place after reading some reviews and it was a great idea. Small store with one glass counter inside. The counter had a variety of sizes and types of desserts. The man behind the counter (I think he was the Kobbler King) was super nice and friendly. Bought myself a medium size peach cobbler, brought it home, warmed it in the oven, and added a scoop of vanilla ice cream. DELICIOUS~ Delicious peach cobbler! Wish I had bought more other varieties, but didn't bring enough cash. They have ATM/C.C. but it was down for the day. I want to go back to get some more soon."
9/3/2011,20110903,5,5.0,"I have to search for places that accommodate my hubby who is diabetic. This place has a wide range of cookies, cobblers, and cake that are sugar free. He is hooked on the sugar free Red Velvet cake. The girls who work there are nice and it's always clean when I visit."
9/10/2011,20110910,1,4.5,"I drove 30 min to get here hopeing to test taste some of the sugar free treats someone mentioned.I found no sugar free treats nor cookies,pie,monkey bread or sweet potato pie.All that was in the display case where 4 lonley cobblers. Is this place a front for something else ?I support southern cusine but was so let down and taken aback.What a shame."
10/13/2011,20111013,3,4.33,I wanted to love this place.I'm eager about any hole in the wall that I stumble across without being told.Sadly they let me down. The berry cobbler was great. The girl was adorable and the service was good but I wasn't diggin' the sweet potato pie and the apple cobbler tasted exactly like the pie.Could be this is the best sweet potato pie on the planet. Just not my thing.
1/27/2012,20120127,5,4.4,"The best pie & kobbler west of the Mississippi. In a small unassuming place, super friendly, and authentic. And try the savory pies that are delicious!"
3/17/2012,20120317,5,4.45,"Very great peach cobbler, this place was found because i was driving by n caught my attention to find out how good this place is to be called kobbler king. Well this place does mot look like a bakery at all. When you walk in all you see is a demonstration counter n a few different types of kobblers already to be taken home. The guy who attended me was the actual baker n owner of the place. He said that by the middle of the day their kobblers are almost all gone that is why they didnt have many to choose from. Thry did however have the peach kobbler n omg was it delicious. It comes in a 5x8 container that is safe to put in the oven for heating but you can eat it right away just like i did (fat ass lol). The koobler is not deceiving but the look of this place is. Get your kobblers here!!!"
8/30/2012,20120830,4,4.42,"The absolute best peach cobbler I have ever had. Period. I took away one star becasue the gentleman who attended us was quite unpleasant. No hello how can I help you and when asking the price he points to a sign instead of just answering. Normally I would not return to bad customer service, but I will put up with all kinds of rude for some more of that peach cobbler! Yum!"
10/24/2012,20121024,5,4.46,"Forget Roscoes, this place is church and not churches chicken or even close but CHURCH, as in holy, as in da bomb shit!!This is the best fried chicken in Los Angeles, just don't wear all red when going to eat, you may get blasted, murked, kilt, you know. This place is GANGSTER and the best!! Bring your napkin and your Glock!"
11/21/2012,20121121,3,4.36,"can rude service really be excused for a good piece of kobbler???? not in my book. the taste is good, but understand ""kobbler king"", good tastes, combined with pleasing service will keep people coming back...Customer service may be minor to a lot of people, but to me, it really does play a factor in if you'll get my money or not."
2/11/2013,20130211,5,4.4,"I thought I'd delve in to some of my culinary taste.I stumbled across this rustic storefront ,years ago,when it first opened.An outstanding review in the Los Angeles Time ,piqued my curiousity.Yeah,you're a KING.Wih this kind of hubris, I thought, we'll see about THAT.I was met by this laconic,wanna be Clint Eastwood chef.So show me the goods,and i'll be the judge , your lordship.I got home and had my palate assalutedwith this slap you sideways DELICACY.OK,so you won KING.Then,I started to hear about all these celebrites sending their  lackeys to pick up order's from this storefront joint.So,you win, KING.You got the jump on me because you're passing on secret recipe's you swiped from your grandmother,generations back! You can't keep up with demand,so take that.For those of you concerned about your arteries being clogged,you needn't worry.There are no partially hydrogenated oils in his product,since he doesn't have to preserve things for an extended shelf life.You just get the clean calories,with an otherwordly taste As far as the neighborhood, elderly colored & asian folk, don't really strike fear in the heart of this mortal man.It's a middle class area,with street parking.Ah,nothing like simple,organic ingrdedient's,sans the chemical cocktails of those commercial bakeries.Personally,i prefer his banana puddings,this should give you a clue to who I am,Brian.You share my middle name, but I spread the word.You can thank me later."
5/28/2013,20130528,4,4.38,"I had heard a rumbling on the vine about this King that made the best peach cobblers on Jefferson. I'll admit peach cobbler is my absolute weakness. So, one late afternoon my daughter and I gave it a try. The interior is simple. There's the dessert case in the center and a TV. There is street parking. You can sit briefly and wait for a large order perhaps, but don't expect table dining for your dessert.The peach cobblers were offered in two varieties (pecan) and (plain). We opted for the plain which was very good. I mean he did not sneak in bunch of margarine and skimp on the butter if you know what I mean. I only wish it had a bottom crust, because that's how my grandmother made it and other grandmothers made it....so that's why I pulled a star away.Overall, go get your cobbler fix and especially if you've never tried it! Have fun!"
9/20/2013,20130920,5,4.41,"This place has by far the best sweet potato pie. The best in the city. Sure the location is ghetto, but dang that sweet potato pie is good!"
9/30/2013,20130930,3,4.33,"I'd heard about these cobblers, and I really wanted to like them. But...The BAD: The crust/topping on the berry cobbler was cardboard-like. It was like stale bread mixed with stale granola over a perfectly delicious fruit pie. After 3 bites, I threw the rest away.The GOOD: The apple cobbler with pecan topping/crust is phenomenal... PHENOMENAL!! Moist,buttery, and sweet.THAT'S the crust they should be using for *all* the cobblers! Forget that cardboard mess and just use the ""pecan""! Bravo!!!"
10/1/2013,20131001,5,4.37,"I had the pleasure of trying the Kobbler King yesterday at the Abbott Kinney Festival yesterday, September 29, 2013, and OMG! My honey and I were floored at how yummy and reasonably priced it was. Awesome!!! My son said it's the best he's ever had."
12/3/2013,20131203,5,4.4,"I ordered several desserts here last minute for the holiday. Kobbler King was able to accommodate the order no problem! Pick up was fast and friendly! VERY reasonable prices, delicious desserts, and all with warm and friendly smiles! Thanks Kobbler King!"
12/17/2013,20131217,3,4.33,"The shop opens at 11, which was right when I was going by. The man behind the counter seemed almost confused that I was there and pointed to the display, stating that they only had a couple flavors at the moment. This was true: one small apple cobbler, a couple medium blackberry, and 2-3 large peach cobblers. Considering the selection was so limited, both in sizes and flavors (plus no pies or monkey bread), were they from the day before? I don't understand why a bakery wouldn't have anything to sell upon opening, why bother being open if there's nothing to buy? I've never been into a bakery in the morning that had empty shelves.I chose the apple cobbler and split it with a coworker; it was delicious, even though we had no way to warm it. Perfectly spiced, the apples weren't canned, good crust and not too much of it. I would happily eat it again, and hopefully would be able to put it in the oven for a bit first. Toss some vanilla ice cream on top and you've got something no one would turn down. The missing star in this review is solely for the confusing business practices. Hopefully next time I find myself in the area it'll be later in the day and Kobbler King will have a better selection."
1/5/2014,20140105,4,4.32,"A small location that packs a powerful punch!! I've initially had Kobbler King when they had a booth at the Lobster Fest in Long Beach and I was wowed. I bought an individual peach cobbler and individual berry cobbler. They were both sweet and the crust was amazing.Later on in the year I went to their actual brick and mortar location to pick up a large peach cobbler and a couple of their sweet potato pies. The cobbler seemed too sweet for me but my family devoured it. I've heard this sweet potato rivals what you can find down south. It's sweet, with a little spice, and soft yet firm at the same time. I was surprised at how delicious it was considering I thought It'd be a plain version of pumpkin pie. I recommend placing an order ahead of time to ensure that your order is waiting for you when you arrive (in the event they run out).I tried to place my order right before Christmas and it was too late. I was told that I needed to just stop by and see what they had in stock. I was nervous but they had what I wanted. This will be my regular sweet spot for holidays and special occasions :-)It was a little tough to find parking so I left my co-pilot waiting double parked in a driveway out front. Keep that in mind of you're going solo or in a rush."
1/26/2014,20140126,5,4.35,"4.5 stars rounded upI've had this place bookmarked for a while. Southern desserts are definitely my thing. I've seen Kobbler King in Albertsons and I often wondered if the cobblers at the actual bakery were better. And...yes they were! Not sure why, but it was.There's various desserts but I tried the following:Peach Cobbler ($6 small): Really good. Peaches were perfect...sweet and buttery. Lots of crust too. Choose between regular crust or pecan crust. I haven't tried the pecan yet.Sweet Potato Pie ($5 small): My favorite thus far...aside from my own. It was so good! I'll definitely be back for more.Tips:Parking could be a problem. There's no lot. Street parking only.Prices are okay but you get better savings on buying larger portions."
2/23/2014,20140223,5,4.38,"Pecan crust or bust!The girl at the counter was super nice. Always welcoming when I come by. I went today to buy 6 small varieties for a bbq I was headed to, a BBQ thrown by southerners. all of the cobblers were a hit. If Bama approves, you're gold. Seriously that peach though."
6/4/2014,20140604,5,4.4,"Awesome, awesome, awesome peach cobbler with pecan crumble crust!!! I found the shop's interior a little off-putting - there's one lonely, dilapidated display case with cobblers strewn haphazardly inside it - but the *tastiness* more than made up for it. The guy behind the counter was really nice and friendly, maybe the Kobbler King himself? Be sure to buy twice as much cobbler as you think you'll need - it's that good!"
6/22/2014,20140622,4,4.38,I've heard of this place but never made the trip to experience their food. Well I had a chance to taste their desserts at the Long Beach Bayou Festival...OMG Yessss!!!! This sweet potato pie is EVERYTHING!
6/25/2014,20140625,3,4.33,I tired the pecan crust cobble it was really good I would try it again. On the other hand the service I received was at a event they were working at and the guy at they're booth was rude and lacked professional customer service. It was my turn in line and they were really busy and as I'm telling him what I wanted he starts talking to someone that walked up on the side then got an attitude with me when I asked him for his companies location. He looked at me like I interrupted his side conversation and threw a card on the table. Just because of his service I won't be going back
8/7/2014,20140807,1,4.21,"We purchased two things from Kobbler King, against my better judgement. I usually just walk out when customer service is sub-par. Believe me when I say, it was the worst I've experienced in years, like sketch comedy bad! The guy was on personal call the entire time. We ordered a pecan crusted cobbler and a sweet potato pie. Once we got to the care we noticed the sweet potato pie was molded. I mean like big white fuzzy spots on the pie! When we went back in I said, "" one of the things you sold us is spoiled."" He promptly followed up with, "" yeah...the sweet potato pie."" I'm standing there like...if you knew why would you sell it. I wanted my money back for both because I couldn't be sure that the cobbler was not molded under the pecan crust. He absolutely refused, became super defensive and reveled the no refunds sign behind his head. Maybe I would have saw that before my purchase if I wasn't so distracted by his personal conversation and horrible customer service. #neveragain #beware"
8/12/2014,20140812,4,4.21,"I had the pecan crusted peach cobbler that I bought from Orleans and York. It was good, but I could of been happier with the regular crust...too much going on on top (but I'm not a big sweet eater). The filling was great, though."
11/1/2014,20141101,2,4.13,"Today I was finally able to go to the Kobbler King expecting a great experience and cobbler based on previous reviews. I placed my order then I looked on the wall, to use my credit or debit you are charging the customer 3% and minimum $11.00 purchase. This is ridiculous, you a business and you've too cheap to pay the extra charge on your ""Square Account"". This is the first turn off, and the second experience, the actual cobbler on the outside of the aluminum container was sticky. They didn't take the time to clean if off and furthermore the cobbler crust on the bottom was clearly over baked. This was my first and last time going to this business."
11/3/2014,20141103,1,4.03,"I first found out about this place several years ago during the ""Taste of Soul"" Festival.. I had the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious!! At the time they did not have a store front it was phone orders only. Fast forward to now, I've been craving for some lately.. I wasn't sure if they had a store front by now, so I looked them up to see if they had a website.. Found the website and judging from the website, It wasn't really absolutely clear if they did or not. Now keep in mind, my first experience with them was that they only took phone orders. If I'm on the web page and If the options are HOME, ABOUT KOBBLER KING, ONLINE ORDERING, BLOG, MEDIA, CATERING, EVENTS, FAQ, and CONTACT.. What would you think?!?!? I did find the contact part which shows the hours of operations, but that was still ambiguous to me.. Sooo I called and a man answered the phone, I asked him if they had a store front, he replied in a cocky tone of voice, ""Taaaa (huffing and puffing) only for such and such amount of years, yes we do""!!! I'm like okay, I laughed it off, but boy, I felt some sort of way, maybe a little ignorant that I didn't know this (smirk)! But honestly, I live ions away from LA and I don't get down there very much anymore, so I'm not in the know about the popular food places down there.. But any who, I take my cobbler craving self down there with jet fuel on my fired up feet, because I'm like this guy was cocky like ""Girl we have the best cobbler in the world and you betta recognize who we are"" type of attitude!! I get there and go to the counter which is the display case.. There was only peach cobblers with a nut type of topping and some other type of cobblers that were not peach.. So I ask the guy, ""Do you guys have peach cobblers with out nuts on top""? He answers with a cocky azz response (and instantly I knew, this was the guy I talked to on the phone), ""Taaaa huhhh yeah, we sell cobblers, we have more in the back...""!!! I kinda cut him off like ""Well, I wasn't sure, because this is all you have in your display case and this is my first time here""!! He cuts ME off and says while shaking his head and huffing and puffing with an attitude, ""Now come on now, you know we have regular cobblers""!! I saw where that was going, so rather than argue the point that he could have just said, ""Yes Ma'am we have some in the back, how many do you want?"", I just smiled and thought to myself WOWWW, really??!? Whatever, just shake it off and yelp later!! I tell him I'll take one peach, I get it and it looks dry, but I remember it being so dang ol' lawd have mercy good, so I didn't think much of it.. I get to my car, and crack this dry looking peach cobbler open and it was just as dry as it looked!! The taste was extremely below mediocre!! Hardly any peach juice, and a bunch of dry crust. Kind of reminded me of the those knock off turn over Hostess store brand pies they use to sell in the grocery stores.. They were 2 for a dollar!! All of this attitude and cockiness for this cobbler to be this bad was beyond me! Now I grew up knowing that some minority business' are known to have good food but with a side of attitude but, you still keep coming back because the taste out ways the attitude, but this was ridiculous!! All of that cockiness and it was one of the worst I've ever tried, get a grip!!"
4/5/2015,20150405,5,4.06,"Well cobbler is not my favorite dessert, but I may have to reassess that. The peach cobbler, apple cobbler, lemon icebox pie and lemon bars were just what the doctor ordered. I had everyone of those inside of 24 hours! I know, it seems excessive, but I had to try them all in order to determine the best. .from the rest! The best ---meaning the best in the business of cobblers and lemon icebox pies is the Kobbler King! Long live the King!"
3/14/2016,20160314,5,4.09,"""Wow"" is all I can write to begin with. I really wanted to avoid eating the cobbler because after many let downs I did not want to be hurt again...Pros: The Peach Cobbler is beyond good. It reminded me of when my Mother was still here raiding the neighbors tree for peaches that were too done to eat but just right to bake or can. I would suggest warming the cobbler up but it is still great cold for Summer days. Parking is fairly easy and the portion sizes are good.Cons: None.Will go back..."
6/4/2016,20160604,5,4.12,"Omg the pecan crusted peach cobbler is something out of a sweet dream. Not being big on sweets and having a major craving for smthg sweet I looked up the best dessert places in mid-city and the king appeared..... I was pleasantly surprised by the infectious aroma of nutmeg, cinnamon and all the other stuff that goes into cobbler, lol..... Anyhoo the guy who helped me was friendly and kind and joked about how the cobbler was so good that I wouldn't want to share with my Dad, and he was right that's why I got my Dad the Blackberry cobbler and I kept my peachwhich was awesome saucesome"
7/10/2016,20160710,2,4.06,"I went to Kobbler King one afternoon for a treat. Upon entering I wasn't greeted with kindness, but more of a suspicion and distrust. I ignored the vibe because the cobbler is quite good. The owner, a young black man, asked what I wanted and I told him one small cobbler. He then told me I could get two for a discounted price, to which I replied ""No thanks, I just want one."" He then frowned and said in disgust to where I could plainly hear ""niggas"". He disrespected me, my people, his people, and his business. Never went back and caution anyone thinking they have the right to get exactly what they want. You're being judged."
7/24/2016,20160724,5,4.08,"I stay in the high desert (Victorville) California and I just intended a lobster festival in San Pedro and purchased a sweet potato pie and a peach cobbler with ""free"" ice cream. I must say this is not one of the best damn pies I've ever had in my life! when I'm down there I will for surely go pick me up a sweet potato pie they were very amazing thank you. Hope to see u at the taste of soul."
7/25/2016,20160725,1,4.0,"Purchased a 14.00$ peach cobbler at the R&B festival it was extremely dry not a drop of juice in it and the sides were burnt. We try to support our people, but quality control needs to be better."
9/15/2016,20160915,5,4.03,"Growing up in he Midwest, I've had some amazing cobbler. But I've struggled to find really great cobbler in Los Angeles. Well, my searching has come to an end. Walking around the neighborhood, I saw a sign for ""The Kobbler King"" and became immediately filled with fear that it was a shoe repair shop. It was not.I got a small blackberry cobbler and it was fantastic. The fruit tasted fresh, the crust was perfect and the entire thing was very juicy. As a ""thank you"", I purchased a peach cobbler for my neighbor, who has lived in the area for thirty-years. When I gave it to him, his eyes lit up and he said, ""I LOVE this place!""They serve a variety of other deserts and I am sure that I will be back to try other things but for right now, I will continue to order their amazing cobbler."
10/7/2016,20161007,4,4.03,We saw this place when driving by and decided to stop. I am so happy that we did because their peach cobbler and banana pudding were perfectly on point!! I am in love with this place.
10/22/2016,20161022,1,3.95,"It was the worst cobbler we've tasted--just because they say 'made fresh', doesn't mean it's made 'GOOD'."
11/2/2016,20161102,4,3.95,"Most amazing Sweet Potato Pie ever made!!! I had the privilege of meeting the woman who's recipe makes so many people happy, at Lobster Festival. She's as sweet as her pie. Thank you for sharing your talent with the world."
1/1/2017,20170101,1,3.88,"We Purchased a Large Peach Cobbler for our New Year feast ( ""Mommie Helen's"" was not at the Baldwin hills mall, perhaps rain delay) It was the one of the driest cobblers I'd ever had! The Crust was thick & mishapen, as if it was the leftover bits of pie dough. But, we tried it anyway ( sometimes Ugly in the Outside is Good on the inside..NOPE!Hardly any juice & peaches! I love a good Crust, but this was crust was crumbly! I had Cobbler from here years ago & had good Cobbler. This Pie was hastily put together with bits & pieces to make a sale! Back to Mommie Helen's!"
1/24/2017,20170124,1,3.81,"I've bought a small peach cobbler from Albertsons market, when ask why cheaper at the market I was told because it was smaller in size which was not true. Also I bought a Monkey bread for $12. It was horrible. Was not fresh tasting and dough was hard and dense, not lite, moist and butter as Monkey bread should be. My family called it Gorilla bread. I did find good Monkey bread at Heavenly bakery on Vernon Ave."
1/25/2017,20170125,1,3.75,Went in to try this place out first off the guy won't get off the phone to take my order. I ask him for the $6 peach cobbler while still on phone points me out to the sign outside that says $9.99 I'm thinking ok so it's 9.99 instead of 6. So he gets behind counter and is signaling me what did I want I let him know when he's finished on phone. I decided to try a different black owned business because this is ridiculous. Service was horrible. Won't be back.
1/26/2017,20170126,5,3.78,I love this place. I've been coming here for a few years and the desserts never disappoint -sweet potato pie is excellent as are the blackberry and peach cobblers. I've taken the large trays to big family functions and got great feedback on how good and fresh the cobblers tasted.
2/15/2017,20170215,5,3.8,"We really liked the cobbler from here! We stopped in one day as we were passing through the area and bought a cobbler to take home -- sadly my family ate most of it before I could get much more than one bite, Lol. We'd mistakenly thought this might be a dessert restaurant where you could sit down and order a bowl of warm cobbler with some ice cream on top... That is not the case, you've got to bring everything home and do the heating up & ice cream scooping yourself.The prices are decent, not cheap, but not too hard on the wallet either. Some of the other reviews mention the food not being fresh or being too dry, but I didn't notice that at all. Could just be personal preference, or maybe they bought another type? (So far we've only tried the peach cobbler with pecan crust.) I wish there'd been a little more variety -- when we stopped in I think they only had peach and apple cobblers available. I was hoping for something along the lines of blueberry/blackberry. And honestly the place itself could use a little sprucing up on the inside, but again it's not a sit-down restaurant, you just walk in, pick your cobbler, and go.I also wanted to include that a couple months later we placed an order online on their website to have a cobbler shipped to someone as a gift -- everything worked out great and the recipient was very happy. I like that they offer flat rate shipping to anywhere in the U.S."
2/19/2017,20170219,5,3.83,"Kobbler so delicious!!! Reminds me of my mother's home recipe, and don't forget the ice cream."
2/20/2017,20170220,5,3.85,Best pies in town! DONT SKIP ON THE PECAN CRUST!! Can't wait to try the bread pudding!! After this cherry cobbler though!!!
5/14/2017,20170514,5,3.88,Black berry cobbler had some a while after dinner and all I can say is Yum! It hot the spot I had it a a festival to and the desert was great
6/24/2017,20170624,5,3.9,"Thee BEST COBBLERS and SWEET POTATO PIES ever!!!! My family and I have been getting our cobblers here for the longest, especially for the holidays. My girl and co workers always ask me to stop by and grab a couple mini pies for them if im heading to the LA area. Best thing is, if i cant make it to the store before closing i can get them at Albertsons, food 4 less, and Louisiana Chicken spots as i get my fix before i head back home to the O.C. At certain events you can catch the truck and they hook u up with ice cream too. EXTREMELY GOOD PIES!! Thanks Kobbler King!"
6/25/2017,20170625,5,3.92,"My family and I have been getting not only delicious peach and berry cobblers from Kobber King for over ten years but also what has become my favorite the incredible banana pudding that will be sure to knock your socks off. We also don't let a holiday pass us by without getting their REAL DEAL monkey bread, not dinner rolls positioned in a bundt pan to resemble monkey bread. Do yourself a favor and wow your family and friends with the delectable treats Kobber King has to offer!"
6/25/2017,20170625,5,3.94,I love this place.. I drive from Pasadena just to get the peach cobbler and lemon cooler pie. Kobbler King has catered an event for me with seasoned chicken and fish. His special dipping sauce was a hit. I'm still trying to get his receipe!! :)
6/27/2017,20170627,5,3.96,"All I know is that The Kobbler King is the best place to get cobbler out there!!! Their Peach Cobbler is the best, my husband will not eat anyone else's. Thanks for always having such great tasting pies!!! Love it!!! Won't go anywhere else!!!"
6/27/2017,20170627,5,3.98,"I have been enjoying cobblers from the Kobbler King for years. I recently learned that they cater events big and small. Well, we had a graduation party for my nephew and had the Kobbler King cater the food. Honey, when I tell you the food was a hit, it was a hit! We had brown stew chicken, rice and peas, plantains, a garden salad, and of course that ultimate peach cobbler. I picked the food up from the restaurant at the time we agreed. It was hot and ready to go. Do yourself a favor, try them for your next gig you want catered. My family and guests were very pleased with the quality of the food and service we received."
6/30/2017,20170630,1,3.93,"So we called the Kobbler King in advanced to see if they take American Express. The gentleman said, ""Yes we take everything."" We drive from Irvine to Los Angeles over an hour, to barely make it there before closing time to be told, we only are taking cash!!! Come on black businesses!! Really? If you want to be taken seriously as a business you have to be consistent. If you take credit cards take them from opening to closing. They were loaded with pies and cobblers, but if you don't give them cash they weren't willing to sell it to you...shady. Won't return simply for the trouble they put us through. Even if you say no credit cards accepted 1 hour before closing at least customers know...FOUL FOUL FOUL!"
7/2/2017,20170702,5,3.95,I just picked up the Pecan-crusted Peach Kobbler and a Sweet Potato Pie...I've never been disappointed. The quality and freshness are evident. I love supporting a bakery that makes down home deserts just like me and my family make. Definitely my go to spot!
7/2/2017,20170702,5,3.96,My new favorite for holidays and special occasions. Fast friendly service and found they sell them at Vons and Albertsons near me in the valley. So happy I found The Kobbler King!
7/21/2017,20170721,5,3.98,"After having a disappointed dinner in Los Angeles. Went outside of the hotel. I notice The Kobbler king truck parking. Decided to try something sweet. I purchased Sweet Potato pie, Banana Pudding and Blackberry Kobbler. I'm not disappointed at all! All 3 that I've purchased was so yummy!! Couldn't stop eating it. It also comes with free ice cream!!! Pie and ice cream... what more can you ask for?! Thank you The Kobbler King for ending my night with a full stomach and a Smile."
8/6/2017,20170806,5,4.0,"My coworkers and I were planning a Juneteenth event for our office. We decided to have the food catered for up to 200 staff. We called The Kobbler King who helped us put together a menu of side dishes and dessert according to our budget. He worked with us on such short notice. We called him less than a week in advance and he had our food prepared, hot, and ready for pickup at the specified time the following week. He worked with us on our budget and delivered his promise on the quality and taste of the food.We settled on the garlic green beans and the cheddar cheese garlic mashed potatoes. They were delicious! Everyone is STILL talking about it a month later. We were repeatedly asked where we got the food. The peach cobbler really topped off the event. NOTHING was left over. I was hoping to take some home. LOLI just want to thank everyone at The Kobbler King for their professionalism. The food is excellent, the cobblers are THE BOMB, and it made our event that much more memorable. We will be using The Kobbler King again for catering our events in the future."
8/13/2017,20170813,1,3.95,HUH!!! I wish I could give this company a good score but the customer service blows. No matter how good your desert is TRUST me you live on referrals. The desert taste good but your customer service leaves a bad taste in our mouths here at #LongBeachJazzFestival.
8/26/2017,20170826,5,3.97,"The rumors are true - this is the best banana putting that I've ever had...reminds me of the one my grandma used to make! We also brought the savory fish cobbler to a friends house as a present, and it blew their minds!!! The peach cobbler with a pecan crust is a must every time we go out now as well! In addition to all of the fabulous treats we picked up, the woman that helped us pick a few new items out was very knowledgable about the products, and had such a pleasant energy about her - her smile is contagious!!! Thank you!!"
8/30/2017,20170830,4,3.97,"My husband knows I love the pecan crust cobbler so, tonight when I got home after a long day I had a great surprise! The cobbler and a seafood pop pie! That thang was soooo good! The chicken one was hella good too! Thnx Kobbler King . My inner greedy girl really appreciates u!"
9/27/2017,20170927,1,3.92,"The pie was ok but the places was gross. Dirty, smelly. I can only imagine what the restroom looked like."
10/29/2017,20171029,5,3.94,I tried this awesome place at the taste of souls and have been craving the peach cobbler ever since. So darn good !!!
11/5/2017,20171105,4,3.94,Let me start by saying yes the peach cobbler is good didn't really like the sweet potatoe pie It was my first time eating the cobbler @ taste of soul it was good definitely would recommend this place
11/28/2017,20171128,1,3.89,The owner talked to me so bad one day for no reason. Never will my money support abuse like that.
4/2/2018,20180402,1,3.85,The desserts were terrible they taste old they were not fresh the restaurant stinks so bad they need to shut it down
5/30/2018,20180530,1,3.81,"Call first...don't waste your time making a special trip to the location. A closed sign was displayed in the window, but the door was open and Yelp said ""Open"". The guy...assuming ""Kobbler King"" was not only rude, but of about 30 pies displayed in the bakery case, he pointed to the ones available for purchase. Yuck yuck yuck...my stomach hurts thinking about it. Best of luck if you decide to try."
6/29/2018,20180629,5,3.83,"I really enjoyed the ""Ultimate Peach Kobbler with Pecan Crust"" I grab it from my local grocery store and thought I'd give it a try; completely exceeded my expectations. Definitely bakery NOT gocery store quality, and most importantly It taste homemade. Yummm !"
8/14/2018,20180814,1,3.79,"Customer service is extremely important. As consumers we have choices. Although the cobbler was good, the service was not. In the future I will choose to spend my dollars elsewhere. No one wants to go into a business to be disrespected. Perhaps the owner should stay in the back and just bake and hire someone with a pleasant attitude to stay in the front to GREET THE CUSTOMERS. That's my constructive criticism."
8/18/2018,20180818,1,3.75,"Just tried the Kobb King at the LB BBQ festival. The guy at booth was very ""unconcerned"" and the cobbler was just okay. Perhaps you could hire someone friendly to be the face of the business. Just a thought ‍..."
11/14/2018,20181114,5,3.76,"My mom and I went to Leimert Park's Food Truck Friday event just to get this cobbler. My mom had tried it before (and wouldn't shut up about it). So, naturally I had to indulge as well (cheat day!!). At first sight...I immediately understood why my mom was SO anxious to get her fix. My mom got the blackberry cobbler, I wanted a taste, but she told me to get my own (the nerve!). There were too many delicious looking options, but I eventually settled on The Ultimate. Boy oh boy...the fresh crisp peaches and a perfectly rich buttery pecan crust made me want to slap my mama! It. Was. Devine. So much so, I drove over to his store on Jefferson to pickup another one yesterday (cheat day AGAIN!). You can taste the love that goes into baking these cobblers. Kobbler King, you've got a new fan!"
11/16/2018,20181116,5,3.78,"The Cobblers, Sweet Potato Pies and Banana Pudding are AMAZING, you must try!!!I normally don't write reviews, but this is a treasure that I MUST share. I love the fresh, rich, buttery flavor in each bite that they are able to accomplish in their desserts. Not only is the flavor on point, the consistency is not too soupy and not too thick, it's made just right. If I had to recommend my favorite it would be tough, but it would be the delicious mouthwatering peach cobbler with a scoop of ice cream.These are definitely the best desserts I have tasted and I will be back. Not to me mention the EXCELLENT friendly customer service."
11/25/2018,20181125,5,3.8,The peach cobbler is a must have. I bought two to take to thanksgiving dinner & everyone enjoyed them. And now they accept Venmo.
2/27/2019,20190227,5,3.81,The Kobbler King came to my office and the apple cobbler was insanely delicious. I can't wait to visit their store for another yummy treat!

2/27/2019,20190227,5,3.86,"I've tried a few of their kobblers and have to say, while the peach is wonderful, their strawberry kobbler is out of this world! It is my new obsession. A few colleagues love the bread pudding as well. Highly recommend this place."
2/27/2019,20190227,5,3.87,I really enjoyed the apple cobbler. I was convinced I was only going to have a little bit but ended up indulging in the whole thing :)

2/28/2019,20190228,5,3.95,The Kobbler King came to my office for a special occasion. OMG so delicious. This reminded me of my home made cobbler that grandma made. So amazing. I would recommend over and over. Thank you Kobbler King!

3/7/2019,20190307,4,3.97,"I found the kobbler king mini pies at Vons in Long Beach and had to get two of them, pecan and pumpkin. Both were delicious!! The crust was crunchy and sweet. The pecan was my favorite although i found a little hard piece in it. Will be buying more pies at Vons. I hope they will have more flavors to try out."

3/13/2019,20190313,2,3.94,They aren't same as the early 2000s. The crust was undercooked & tasted like firm flour baking soda mash. But I gave 2 stars cuz the peaches & juice was on point.
4/6/2019,20190406,2,3.92,Banana pudding was old. The man took forever coming from the back of the store not busy and the place could use some TLC
6/1/2019,20190601,3,3.91,My first experience with pecan crusted peach cobbler a few years ago when they were sold at Orleans and York was divine! The batch I got at the Obama Blvd event recently didn't have any flavor at all except for burnt. I bought the regular one as well but refused to eat it in fear of be disappointed again

8/6/2019,20190806,1,3.87,"Never even got to try the cobbler.Bought one apple cobbler and one banana pudding from their food truck, after the Lionel Richie concert at the Hollywood Bowl on 8/5. Took it to go since we were walking to the car. Got home 20 min later, opened it up and the cobbler was covered in mold.Threw everything out since trust was totally broken. Not cool. Considering we paid like $12 for 2. Will never give them a second shot and will tell all our friends at the Bowl shows to pass on this business."

9/10/2019,20190910,3,3.84,"Stopped by their booth at this past weekends Long Beach Lobster Fest. I love sweet potatoe pie and pecan pie so I had to made a stop here. Friendly customer service. But their prices were not so much. Double checking their website i saw that they upped their price per pie due to the festival. I guess I understand being a festival and all but damn. I ordered their sweet potatoe pie and their apple cobbler. Both were good. Nothing crazy as far as mind blowing flavors. I'd probably not try them again, especially at the price I paid for."
10/20/2019,20191020,1,3.81,"went to a taste of soul 2019 and bought 4 peach cobbler orders at $12 each from them, the nastiest cobbler ever.i don't think it should even be called cobbler. it was nasty peaches covered with a lot of, i think, cinnamon or something, not sure what it was, but i know forsure it was nasty. cobbler had no crust at top or bottom. i will never buy anything from them again. i wish i could give a no star. horrible product and their sign had the nerve to say sold at vons and albertsons. very nasty food from them."
11/15/2019,20191115,5,3.83,I was fortunate enough to have The Kobbler King take my last minute call requesting a peach cobbler for the Adult Medicine Department's Thanksgiving lunch. Everyone enjoy the freshness and flavors of the cobbler. I've shared The Kobbler Kings information with many staff members. The Kobbler King should be very busy this holiday season. Thank you!
12/1/2019,20191201,5,3.84,"Sweet potato pie and apple cobbler were ALMOST as good as my momma made em! Lol! Money well spent, I'll be back for Christmas."
12/30/2019,20191230,5,3.85,"In preparation for the holiday... I received a last minute request from my family to bring Monkey Bread. I told them it was going to be hard to find a place in LA AND most importantly one that I thought would be good enough to bring. My family is very picky about Monkey Bread because we grew up with my Grandmother from Texas making us a loaf every year.I called the Kobbler King and he indicated he was just taking some bread out of the oven. He was nice enough to endure all my questions. I showed up in AM and took a chance on buying 5 loaves. Couldn't wait to get home and try it and when I did OMG! It was soooo good! It reminded me of my grandmothers, I also had my sister try it and she said ""this is the Business"" lol! Same response from all my family as well. Thank you Kobbler King for saving Thanksgiving !"
2/18/2020,20200218,5,3.86,I brought some friends back to my favorite dessert place the kobbler king on monday feb 17th and again we purchased a lot of stuff and had some laughs with the head man in charge.... the stuff is all amazing!! Thanks again we will be back.
6/23/2020,20200623,3,3.85,"I purchased the peach cobbler with the pecan crust over the weekend. I prefer a juicy cobbler with a lot of crust in the juice. Though this sample had a decent amount of crust, it was dry and a pinch salty."
8/18/2020,20200818,4,3.85,I got a couple sweet potato pies and a blackberry pie...I give the blackberry 2 stars only because it smells sooooo good but it tasted bland. The sweet potato pies on the other hand .... WOW!!!! So good. I'll definitely be back for those lil babies.
10/20/2020,20201020,1,3.83,So not the Kobbler King! I was very disappointed in both the peach cobbler and the berry cobbler.
12/2/2020,20201202,1,3.8,"the best way to remedy this situation is to give me a full refund! i followed kobbler king on facebook for quite a while based on the pics of their products, i've contemplated on buying a dessert or two. i was impressed with how nice and delicious their pies and cobblers looked. finally decided to buy a dessert for this thanksgiving holiday. i placed my order over the phone monday before thanksgiving. i ordered three pies and one medium size cobbler. so busy with cooking dinner, my husband agreed to pick up the desserts. extremely disappointed when my husband came home with the desserts!!!! the pies were undercooked and the presentation was horrible!!! i was too embarrassed to bring the pies out for my family to enjoy, so i ended up buying store bought pies from ralphs on thanksgiving morning. the lemon icebox pie looked and tasted like garbage!!! compared to the pictures on facebook, the pies and cobblers were falsely advertised. will never order from this store again. kobbler king is an overstatement!!! the nice looking lemon pie is whats shown on the website. the homemade disaster is what i got. never again!"
1/26/2021,20210126,5,3.81,"I have a new favorite place called The Kobbler King.You know when you try someone's #bananapudding and it's the best you've ever had, and you think, hmmm... maybe their #peachcobbler won't be best in class?Or, maybe their #sweetpotatopie won't knock you off your feet?Not gonna happen. Close your eyes when you take your first bite of the King's #breadpudding and you'll swear you are on #bourbonstreet.Everything there is the best ever. I got a whole bag of goodies, waited till the kid was asleep, and broke it out for me and my husband. I had a teensy bite of the #pecanpie and then he commandeered it.I RAN OFF to my room with the lemon icebox cake. I made a nice decaf with steamed milk and locked the door behind me. I highly recommend you go there to celebrate your victories, commiserate about your fails, gossip with your friends and be thankful that you have your sense of taste and smell."

12/27/2021,20211227,5,3.82,"The apple&peach cobbler is off the hook, talking about spices and crust just like mama use to make it with love. No holding back on nothing and pricing total worth every damn dime"
2/10/2022,20220210,1,3.79,"I drove to Kobbler King because I had heard some advertisement of the Bakery. I drove from Western Ave and Florence Ave to the bakery in Los Angeles. I went inside and asked for a large size sweet potatoe pie. The man told me he didn't have any right then. I asked when will he have some, he replied he didn't know He kept referring to me as if I had been there before, by saying, you know you've been here before. He then said if said if you don't see what you want you can leave. I then told him I had driven far and I would get a peach cobbler. I asked him when the one's on display had been baked. He told me, ""I can't tell you that"". I told him I was getting it for a friends birthday tomorrow, he told me, ""I'm not going to say when they had been baked"". I asked him was he the owner, he told me, ""no"" I went to the website before writing this review and found out he is the owner (the man I had been speaking with). I am so puzzled why the owner of the bakery would be so rude to a customer. I hope the cobbler tastes good, if not I will be doing another negative review."
6/9/2022,20220609,1,3.77,had there desert before nothing like this weekend at Newport Jazz Festival full of crust
